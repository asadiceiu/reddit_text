First, a fix was released for a flaw that, used in conjunction with a [**Google Chrome**](URL exploit, could allow hackers to take control of a Windows system prior to version 10. Second, a vulnerability that has apparently been exploited by at least two malicious hacker groups has been patched. The vulnerability is exploitable in Windows operating system versions between 8 and 10 and, according to network security experts, abuses the Windows graphical subsystem to perform a local privilege escalation. If the attack is successful, hackers could take full control of the victims machine. Last month we detected an attempt to exploit a new vulnerability in Microsoft Windows; subsequent analyses led to the discovery of a zero-day exploit in win32k.sys, network security experts who reported the vulnerability mentioned. The vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2019-0797**, is a condition present in the win32k driver that exists due to inadequate synchronization between NtDCompositionDiscardFrame and NtDCompositionDestroyConnection, the experts added. As for their exploitation, the specialists believe that the vulnerability has been exploited mainly by two groups of malicious hackers, FruityArmor and SandCat. FruityArmor has been active for about three years, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities against some government organizations. On the other hand, SandCat is a group recently identified by some cybersecurity firms and agencies. [**Microsoft**](URL announced the release of an update patch after receiving the vulnerability report. The company took advantage of the patchs announcement to recommend to its users to install the updates as soon as possible; they also recommend users to follow up on the scheduled updates.

According to the ethical hacking training expert, a group of corrected vulnerabilities affects the Converging Management and Security Engine (CSME), server platform services, reliable execution engine, and active management technology (AMT). These implementations run at such a low level on the hardware stack that suspicious activity sometimes goes unnoticed for the anti-malware software. Vulnerabilities would allow escalating privileges, sensitive information leaking, or even generating [**denial-of-service**](URL conditions, mentions Intel. Within this group are 12 vulnerabilities, 5 identified as critical. Of these high severity errors, only the identified as CVE-2018-12187 is remotely executable; this is a denial-of-service vulnerability based on insufficient validation in Intel AMT, mention the specialists. Two of the vulnerabilities considered critical require that attackers have local access, in other words, they must log into the compromised machine so that the victim interacts with the malicious file. These vulnerabilities (tracked as CVE-2018-12190 and CVE-2018-12200) could allow for escalation of privileges and loss of control over the compromised device. A second set of patches solved some bugs in the Windows 10 graphics drivers that could generate denial of service conditions, information leaking and execution problems, mentions the ethical hacking training expert. This second group of patches corrected 19 vulnerabilities, two of which were considered critical. The most serious security errors are derived from memory corruption and insufficient input validation on the Intel kernel mode controller. Other warnings issued by Intel referred to critical firmware vulnerability (CVE-2018-12204) that enables arbitrary code execution. On the other hand, Lenovo issued updates to implement many of these Intel corrections in its own products a few days after Intel launched its updates."

However, other entry doors used by other Internet service providers began to present the same fault; many of the compromised developments remain vulnerable to date. According to case reports, this is easily exploitable remote code execution vulnerability. Ethical hacking training experts have analyzed the firmware of Huaweis domestic access point, discovering code blocks reused in multiple devices. The situation is that the company has decided to patch each compromised router, one by one, instead of implementing a general fix for all affected devices. This situation becomes even more complicated because there are already reports of threat actors exploiting this vulnerability. The hijacking of domestic routers to integrate them into the botnet Mirai is a clear example of this exploitation campaign. Even four years before Huawei received the report of this vulnerability, a cybersecurity firm discovered the same flaw present in another router model, thanks to an independent investigation. The company publicly acknowledged the vulnerability until November 2017, suggesting that users might take temporary mitigation measures or replace previous model routers with updated versions. A few months ago, a researcher discovered that Huaweis vulnerable routers were being used to house a botnet composed of more than 18000 devices committed to a malware variant of the Mirai botnet. According to the expert, this botnet would not have existed if Huawei had launched a firmware correction for all its devices."

Segn Mollema, los atacantes pueden configurar los parmetros EWS para autenticarse en un servidor Exchange para posteriormente autenticar la cuenta usando NTML (un conjunto de protocolos de seguridad para Microsoft). Otro error de configuracin predeterminada es que Exchange no establece firmas en el trfico de autenticacin NTLM, por lo que un usuario malicioso podra realizar un ataque de reenvo de NTLM hacia otros equipos en la red del administrador.

According to network security and ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this flaw could allow a hacker with a simple mailbox account to gain administrator privileges. Both Microsoft and US-CERT had alerted in recent days about this error, known as PrivExchange, mentioning that it has a score of 8.3/10 in the **Common Vulnerability Scoring System** (CVSS) scale. According to experts, the vulnerability exists due to multiple errors in the default configurations, the email server, and the Exchange server calendar. The vulnerability affects versions 2013 and later ones. Microsoft has not yet released update patches to fix that vulnerability; however, [**network security**](URL specialists mention that there are other risk mitigation methods. A week ago a proof of concept was published that describes how an Exchange user can use two Python-written tools to obtain domain admin privileges. In response, Microsoft stated: To exploit this failure, the attacker would have to run a Man-in-the-Middle attack to forward an authentication request to Exchange Server, which would allow for identity spoofing. The PrivExchange vulnerability was first described by the network security expert Dirk-Jan Mollema, who developed a proof of concept to exploit some default Exchange configurations. According to Mollema, attackers can configure the EWS parameters to authenticate to an Exchange server and then authenticate the account using NTML (a set of security protocols for Microsoft). Another default configuration error is that Exchange does not establish signatures in NTLM authentication traffic, so a malicious user could perform an NTLM forwarding attack to other computers on the administrators network. Finally, servers have access to high privilege processes by default, including the domain controller. With administrator privileges, the attacker could gain access to the domain controller, which can be useful for multiple hacking activities. Due to privileges granted by exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could control anything in the Active Directory, such as system access, data reading and modification, and backdoor implementation to ensure persistence of vulnerability, Mollema mentioned. The specialist added: Performing this attack is relatively easy, and some other implementations of the tools used in the concept test that allow the attack to be carried out through an infected workstation have already been launched. Microsoft has not published updates for this vulnerability, although there are ways to mitigate attack risks. Potential affected users would have OnPrem implementations because Exchange Online is not affected; how NTLM systems would be, because the systems that have disabled NTLM are not affected. To address this vulnerability, users could define and apply the constraint policy so that EWSMax subscriptions have a value of zero. The EwsMaxSubscriptions parameter specifies the maximum number of active subscriptions for insertion and extraction that a user of Exchange Web services can have at the same time on a specific Exchange server, thus limiting the number to zero and It would prevent the Exchange server from sending notifications."

According to network security specialists, NAE is a key tool for managing data center networks, as it helps administrators determine the impact of network changes and avoid application outages. The company explained that the vulnerability exists because changes in the passwords of users of the web administration interface do not spread to the command line interface (CLI), so the default password takes its place in the CLI. The vulnerability only seems to affect versions 3.0 and 3.1 of NAE. A local attacker could exploit the vulnerability by authenticating with the default administrator password in the CLI of a compromised server. From that point, the attacker could access confidential information, or even collapse the server. The vulnerability was corrected in versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Cisco NAE, although the company points out that to eliminate any possibility of exploitation users must change the administrator password after having installed the security update. Cisco has also described a risk mitigation method that involves changing the default password for the CLI. However, the company recommends its customers to contact their technical support center before implementing any of the available solutions. Cisco emphasizes that the password change must be completed on all nodes of the cluster. The Cisco network security teams claim that, so far, no cases of exploitation of this vulnerability have been reported in real scenarios; highlighted that this was discovered during a process of routine security tests; the company believes that it is unlikely that any hacker discovered this error before their security teams."

The vulnerability has been tracked as **CVE-2019-7304** and was discovered by a [**network security**](URL expert, who was responsible for notifying Canonical, the Ubuntu developers. The vulnerability has been nicknamed **Dirty\_Sock** and resides in the REST API for the SNAPD service, a universal packaging system on Linux, which renders compatible an application for various distributions without having to make more modifications. The SNAPD service was developed by Canonical and is installed by default in Ubuntu; it is also used by other Linux distributions, such as Debian, OpenSUSE, Arch Liunx and Fedora. According to network security specialists, these packages are compressed applications along with their dependencies that also include instructions on how to run and interact with other programs on various Linux desktop systems, IoT and cloud-hosted devices. Snap locally hosts a web server to provide a RESTful API list that helps the service perform multiple actions on the operating system. These REST APIs have access control to define user-level permissions for certain tasks, while some other APIs are only available to root users. An error in the access control process allows attackers to overwrite the user ID to access any API functions, including those that are restricted to root users. A local attacker could use this to access the privileged APIs and obtain administrator privileges, mentions an Ubuntu security alert. It is worth noting that the Dirty\_Socks vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. Vulnerability-discovery experts released two exploit proof of concept on GitHub. One of the exploits requires an SSH connection, while the second is able to download a malicious plugin. Canonical has just launched SNAPD 2.37.1 to correct this security flaw.

The notification arrived to Coinbase teams through its vulnerability bounty program at HackerOne, website though which many ethical hackers can work. Although no further technical details have been disclosed about the vulnerability, the amount of money received by the hacker suggests to network security experts that it was a critical flaw, whose exploitation could have generated catastrophic consequences for Coinbase. The bounties granted by Coinbase start at $200 USD, while the maximum amount offered by the platform is $50k USD. The Coinbase team determines the severity of a vulnerability based on the impact it could generate and its exploitation feasibility. For Coinbase to consider a vulnerability to be critical, it must allow an attacker to read or modify confidential data on a system, execute arbitrary code on the system, or extract assets in some form, whether digital or fiat money. Coinbase paid the hacker after encouraging Coinbase Wallet users to back up their private keys in some cloud storage options, such as iCloud or Gogle Drive. This is the biggest reward that Coinbase has delivered recently, according to specialists in network security, although during the last week the platform delivered other minor rewards. This is not the only case of its kind; last year, Coinbase granted a $10k USD reward to a hacker thanks to a bug report that allowed users to transfer Ethereum cryptocurrency unlimitedly to their online wallet addresses.

Subsequently, they developed a machine learning algorithm trained with Tor traffic patterns from ten different apps: Android Tor Browser, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Spotify, Skype, Twitch, Replaio Radio and DailyMotion. Once the algorithm training was completed, the specialists used it in Tor traffic to detect whether an individual were using any of these apps. The results were overwhelming, the algorithm showed 97.3% accuracy. However, the algorithm is not as efficient as it seems. According to network security specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, it can only be used when there is no background traffic, in other words, when the user is using one and only one application on a smart device. This means that when there are two or more apps communicating at the same time in the background, the algorithm starts confusing TCP traffic patterns, so its effectiveness level decreases. In addition, the algorithm also has precision flaws. Some streaming apps (like YouTube or Spotify) produce very similar traffic patterns, so the algorithm tends to confuse them. Finally, as future experiments consider the analysis of more applications, similar problems will continue to appear, thus the effectiveness of the algorithm will be considerably reduced."

Thanks to this it was possible to spend the same cryptocurrency more than once (a fact known as double spending in the cryptocurrency community). According to specialists from the ***MIT Technology review***, since 2017 hackers have stolen nearly 2 billion dollars in virtual assets, mainly attacking platforms such as Coinbase; in addition, these are only known incidents, undisclosed breaches have not been considered ). [MIT Technology review: Once hailed as unhackable, Blockchains are now getting hacked](URL The blockchain are especially attractive for groups of malicious hackers, mainly because, unlike traditional financial systems, transactions carried out in this way cannot be reversed. In addition, although blockchain technology has unique security features, it also suffers from unique security vulnerabilities; although developers argue that blockchain technology is impossible to hack, they should reconsider their claim. **Hacking a blockchain** A blockchain is a cryptographic database maintained by a computer network, each of which stores a copy of the most recently updated version; that is what makes it so attractive for many organizations, mainly financial ones. Even the New York Stock Exchange will be launching its own blockchain implementation. Recently, those in charge of Zcash cryptocurrency, which allows users to perform private transactions through complex mathematical processes, revealed the correction of a small cryptographic flaw incorporated into the Zcash protocol. But protocol is not the only thing that has to be secured; to swap cryptocurrency on your own or run a node you must run a software client, which can also contain vulnerabilities. Still, most recent hacking incidents did not present themselves in the blockchain, but in exchange platforms, websites where users can buy, exchange, or store their virtual assets. **51% attack** During the cryptomining process, nodes spend enormous processing power resources to demonstrate that they are sufficiently reliable to add information about new transactions to the database. If a miner somehow manages to take control of most of the networks mining capacity, it can defraud other users by sending them payments and then creating an alternative version of the blockchain in which the transaction was never performed (this version is known as ***fork***). The attacker, who controls most of the mining power, can make the fork the authorized version of the blockchain, so they can use the same cryptocurrency again. Carrying out this type of attack against a popular blockchain is very expensive; as mention by specialists in network security. According to experts, renting enough processing resources to attack the Bitcoin blockchain would cost about $250k USD an hour. However, the situation changes when it comes to less popular cryptocurrencies. Considering that there are currently more than 1 500 virtual assets, this becomes highly probable; moreover, the fall in the prices of these assets represents less protection for the blockchain. **Smart contracts attacks** A smart contract is a computer program that runs on a blockchain network used to automate the circulation of cryptocurrency, according to its own rules. The decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) were created in 2016 using the Ethereum blockchain system. Shortly thereafter, an attacker stole over $60M USD in cryptocurrency, exploiting an error in a smart contract that ruled the DAO. This vulnerability allowed the hacker to continue soliciting money from the accounts without the system registering that the transaction had already been performed. In traditional computer systems, vulnerabilities can be corrected with update patches, although this does not apply to blockchain technology, as transactions in a string cannot be reversed. There are some alternative solutions. Although smart contracts cannot be patched, adding an additional smart contract might work as a sort of update. Developers can also implement central switches on a network, so they can stop any process if they detect anomalous activity, although, again, network security specialists emphasize that this does not reverse the cryptocurrency theft once the process is completed. The only way to recover the money is to rewrite the transaction history, return to the point in the blockchain before the attack, create a new link for a new blockchain and have everyone on the network agree to use that specific point. This was the case of Ethereum; many users accepted the transition to another blockchain, while the remaining developed Ethereum Classic. Thousands of smart contracts could contain vulnerabilities, according to recent research. Given the nature of the blockchain, if there is an error in a smart contract, the hackers will surely find it."

WinRAR is used by over 500 million people around the world, and yes, all users could be affected, said [**network security**](URL specialists. Although not everything is bad news, as WinRAR released an update patch to correct this vulnerability at the end of January. A leaked technical report mentions that the vulnerability resides in the UNACEV2.DLL library, which unpacks the ACE format files and is included in all versions of this tool. According to network security specialists, there is a way to create special ACE files that, after being unzipped, use encoding errors in the UNACEV2.DLL library to inject malicious files out of the user-selected decompression path. The researchers managed to leave a malware in the Startup folder of a Windows computer, which would start after the next system restart, to finally take control of the infected computer. The WinRAR team launched WinRAR 5.70 Beta in January 2019 to correct this vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-20250**. The developers of WinRAR would have lost access to the source code of the library about 15 years ago, so they decided to stop supporting files in ACE format definitively. A large number of malicious hackers are expected to try to exploit some variant of this vulnerability in the near future. As a precaution, users must remain alert and not open any file in ACE format, unless they have the updated version of WinRAR. Organizations that reward hackers reporting exploits have shown a special interest in vulnerabilities that affect tools like WinRAR. Zerodium, for example, offers up to $100k USD for remote execution vulnerabilities in WinRAR, 7-Zip, WinZip and tar, for Linux systems. The interest shown in this kind of exploits is mainly because these kinds of applications are used within both domestic and business networks, so they are a considerable attack vector."

A couple of weeks ago, [**WhatsApp**](URL enabled biometric recognition to access the application with the purpose of protecting the sensitive content of users when the phone is unlocked, a very useful function but apparently presents some drawbacks on its implementation. For now, this feature is only available for some Apple devices. According to experts in [**network security**](URL a user of the social network Reddit found a drawback of security in this new feature: A user can access WhatsApp from the iOS Share Sheet without having to go through biometric identification. If the user configured an immediate biometric login is not affected by this incident; however, if the user selected a time interval, access to the Share Sheet resets the timer, and anyone could access the app without verifying its identity. According to the user, the process to exploit this fault is: * Access iOS Share Sheet through the photo app, for example * Click on the WhatsApp icon in iOS Share Sheet * During the transition to the next screen, note that the FaceID or TouchID check is not performed if a different option was set to immediately in advance. Now just go to the IOS home screen * Try to open WhatsApp and ready, you can access WhatsApp without taking biometric identification (either by facial recognition or fingerprints) Facebook Network security teams, the proprietary company of WhatsApp, claim that they have already identified the vulnerability; the social network ensures that a correction will be implemented as soon as possible.

Hackers are attacking users in versions 1.4.2 and earlier, the network security experts mentioned, after posting a report of the activity detected by a honeypot. Given the techniques of attack used, experts believe that this group of hackers could be originating in China. In the attack were exploited two vulnerabilities discovered in the years 2014 and 2015, used to pass scripts to the search queries, which allowed OS hackers to access the older computers and deploy the payload. Elasticsearch 1.4.2 was released at the end of 2014.

This vulnerability (**CVE-2019-1674**) is a command injection in the operating system designed to dodge new CISCO security measures, implemented after correcting a DLL-hijacking problem found in the same application earlier. According to network security experts, CVE-2019-1674 exists due to the inability of the update service for Webex Windows to properly validate the version numbers of the new files. Non-privileged local attackers could exploit the vulnerability by invoking the update service command with a specially crafted command. Malicious hackers could exploit this vulnerability by replacing the update binary of this application with a previous version using the fake software update technique. Then escalation of privileges is generated and hackers execute arbitrary commands with administrator privileges.

SHAREit has more than one billion users worldwide and is used to share files from Android, iOS, Windows and Mac systems. Through this platform, users can share videos, music and other files on different devices. The SHAREit version for Android operating system, which has about 500 million of users, suffers two vulnerabilities: one is an authentication omission flaw and the other one is an arbitrary file downloading vulnerability. The vulnerabilities had been discovered in December 2017 and corrected in March 2018, although technical details about the errors were revealed just a few days ago. Network security specialists mention that the details were kept hidden due to the vulnerabilitys impact, ease of execution, and wide range of attack. Network security experts found that if a user without a valid session searches for a non-existent page, instead of displaying the [**error 404**](URL page, SHAREit replies with an empty page and adds the user to the recognized devices, authenticating the unauthorized user. Vulnerabilities can be exploited in a shared WiFi network to intercept the traffic of a device, among other malicious tasks; the attacker can even gain unrestricted access to the storage of the compromised device. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker should simply send a ***curl*** command that references the path of the target file; the specialists emphasize that you should know the exact location of the file you are pointing to. The experts developed a proof of concept (nicknamed DUMPit!) with which they managed to download about 3000 different files (about 2 GB of information) in less than 8 minutes. SHAREit received the vulnerability report in January 2018, although it did not respond to the experts until a month later, when the time limit was about to finish so that the details of the vulnerability would be revealed to the public. The company corrected both failures in March 2018 without making any additional comments. The two vulnerabilities impact the SHAREit app for Android in the 4.0.28 and previous versions. Cybersecurity experts recommend updating as soon as possible if the user has not already done so. "

Some software developers choose to hire what is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS); this option allows them to easily stagger cloud-based applications without having to share their hardware with other users. The problem is that, according to specialists in network security, once a company decides to stop using this hardware, these servers can be restored to their factory settings and reassigned to other users, which exposes them to firmware vulnerabilities that can persist even after the restoring process. Although these servers are used by only one client at a time, this hardware could be used multiple times subsequently, even by dozens of users, who have direct access and total control over the servers, commented the experts. Network security experts discovered that a malicious hacker can deploy backdoors in the firmware of the shared infrastructure of these services in the cloud. The backdoor can survive the server reassignment process performed by the service providers. To be precise, attackers could compromise the servers by adding backdoors and malicious code to the firmware of a physical server, or on their Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), which requires minimal hacking skills. The BMC is a component developed by third parties to allow remote management of a server that allows the reinstallation of the operating system, problem solving, among other management tasks. If this kind of backdoor is successfully deployed on a physical server, it may persist despite customer reassignments made by the vendor, so to remove the backdoor vendors must physically connect to the chips to reflash the firmware, a non-practical task for service providers. If the vulnerability (nicknamed Cloudborne) is exploited, several scenarios of attacks could be presented, such as: * Permanent [**denial of service**](URL (PDoS) * Stealing or interception of application data executed on the compromised server * Running malware or disabling the running application Although the research was conducted by testing IBMs SoftLayer servers, the specialists ensure that other companies that provide this kind of services are also vulnerable to this attack vector. One way to mitigate the risks is for providers of these services to perform the firmware upgrade properly before reassigning their physical infrastructure to other customers."

Kate Tremlett, manager of harmful content at the British Safer Internet Centre, also believes that the media overexposure of the issue only generates more misinformation: It is a myth that has now become almost real. After conducting a thorough investigation, the British governments network security experts conclude that there is no evidence to support the Momo Challenge as a real threat to the most vulnerable users, technology-savvy children. In addition, the authorities say they have received more media calls than parents concerned about this issue. Rumors about this suicidal challenge began to circulate after the story of a 12-year-old girl and a 16 year-old boy who committed suicide after allegedly receiving messages from an unknown [**WhatsApp**](URL user went viral. Local media claimed that the 16-year-old sent the challenge to the girl, who was found, hanged, two days later. The Secretary of Government of Colombia stated: Apparently the children participated in a game via WhatsApp that prompted them to get hurt; it was a series of challenges that culminated in suicide. The first reports on this game in British territory arose after a family mother published in a Facebook group that her son had been influenced by this game. Apparently, the boy would have told his classmates that a doll-like creature would kill them in their sleep. **How does this challenge work?** According to experts in network security, those who decide to participate in this challenge receive photographs of highly explicit content via WhatsApp and, in critical cases, are blackmailed to hurt themselves, under threat of posting private information in online forums. Some reports say that Momo may be linked to [**data theft**](URL extortion, harassment, not to mention that it can generate anxiety, depression, among other disorders. This challenge would have begun in the state of Tabasco, Mexico. Participants were challenged to send WhatsApp messages to an unidentified user, known as Momo, reported Mexican authorities. However, multiple specialists in the field consider that this challenge is nothing more than a way to extract personal information from users, mainly for the purpose of blackmailing victims. Momo is likely to be operated by hackers seeking to collect personal information, although this does not mean that parents should not pay attention to what their children do online, the British authorities mentioned. The real danger is that parents are distracted from the real problems; children also need to know the risks of sharing their personal information over the Internet."

Es por eso que los usuarios de estos equipos se encuentran poco familiarizados con las polticas de actualizacin de estos dispositivos, por lo que es normal que los hackers encontraran equipos vulnerables an despus de que Cisco corrigiera el error. Acorde a expertos en seguridad en redes, hay alrededor de 12 mil de estos dispositivos, adems es posible encontrarlos con herramientas como Shodan muy fcilmente. Algunos miembros de la comunidad de la ciberseguridad afirman que esta vulnerabilidad fue originada por un descuido de los codificadores de Cisco, que usaron una funcin considerada insegura (conocida como string copy). Los expertos explicaron que el uso de esta funcin provoc que el mecanismo de autenticacin de los enrutadores quedara expuesto a un desbordamiento de bfer, gracias a esto los atacantes inyectaron comandos que ejecutaron con privilegios de administrador durante el proceso de autenticacin. Los fabricantes recomiendan a los usuarios de estos dispositivos aplicar las actualizaciones tan pronto como sea posible. Si un usuario cree que su enrutador podra haber sido comprometido, lo ms recomendable es actualizar el firmware, mencionan los expertos."

The vulnerability CVE-2019-1663 gained notoriety after being publicly disclosed during the last week of February, receiving a score of 9.8/10 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scale. According to network security experts, the vulnerability was scored so high because of its ease of exploitation and that no advanced coding skills are required. In addition the flaw bypasses the entire authentication process and a router can be attacked remotely. Among the affected router models are Cisco RV110, RV130 and RV215, mainly used in households and small businesses. Thats why users of these devices are unfamiliar with any updating policies so its normal for hackers to find vulnerable computers even after Cisco corrected the bug. According to experts in network security, theres about 12k of these devices functioning, and it is possible to find them with tools like Shodan very easily. Some members of the cybersecurity community claim that this vulnerability was caused by a neglect of Cisco encoders, which used a function considered insecure (known as string copy). The experts explained that the use of this function caused the authentication mechanism of the routers to be exposed to a buffer overflow, because of this the attackers injected commands that they executed with administrator privileges during the authentication process. Manufacturers recommend that the users of these devices apply the updates as soon as possible. If a user believes that his router could have been compromised, it is advisable to update the firmware, the experts mention."

The SCP (also known as Session Control Protocol) is a network protocol that allows users to safely transfer files between a local and a remote host using the Remote Copy Protocol (RCP) and the SSH protocol. In other words, the SCP protocol, created in 1983, is a secure version of RCP that requires authentication and encryption of the SSH protocol to transfer files between the server and the client, as mentioned by experts in [**network security**](URL The vulnerabilities, discovered by the cybersecurity expert Harry Toney, exist due to the deficient validations made by SCP clients, which could be exploited by malicious servers or by using some variant of the attack Man-In-the-Middle (MiTM) to arbitrarily delete or overwrite files on the client system. Many SCP clients do not verify whether the objects returned by the SCP server match the requests. This problem goes back to the year 1983 and the RCP protocol, on which SCP is based, the expert mentioned. An attacker-controlled server could place a .bash\_aliases file in the victims home directory, tricking the system into executing malicious commands as soon as the Linux user starts a new shell. **Multiple vulnerabilities** According to the report, the vulnerabilities were discovered and reported to potentially compromised clients last August. The list of vulnerabilities features: * Incorrect validation of the SCP client directory name (CVE-2018-20685) * The SCP client did not receive the validation of the name of the received object (CVE-2019-6111) * Counterfeit client SCP through object name (CVE-2019-6109) * SCP Client spoofing using stderr (CVE-2019-6110) Because vulnerabilities affect the implementation of the SCP protocol, all SCP client applications, including OpenSSH, Putty, and WinSCP, uses SCP as the standard for transferring files. WinSCP solved the problems with the release of version 5.14 last October, and the patch is also included in the current version 5.14.4. The vulnerability CVE-2018-20685 was corrected in the implementation of the SCP protocol last November, although the correction has not been officially published by the providers. The other three vulnerabilities remain unpatched. However, if you are concerned about a malicious SCP server had compromised your system, you can configure it to use SFTP (secure FTP) if possible. Alternatively, the network security expert also provided a solution to reinforce SCP against most server-side manipulation attempts, which you can apply directly, although it may cause some problems. Possibly affected users are encouraged to stay on the lookout for the release of security patches as well as apply them to their systems as soon as they are available. "

According to reports, malicious users could have stolen login tokens; the attackers only needed the victims to click on a specially crafted link. A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, in conjunction with an invalidated subdomain, enabled cybersecurity experts to evade the protection measures implemented by the login control system used to access Fortnite. Single Sign-On (SSO) systems may be useful, but only while the platform accessed is not vulnerable, as considered by [**network security**](URL When properly implemented, user authentication passes into the hands of a third party developer, which authorizes access to the platform via a one-use token. Researchers from a network security firm managed to exploit the vulnerability to request the single token on a second occasion and then redirect it to a compromised site, from where it could be stolen. The researchers concluded that Epic Games used an invalidated domain for their login page (accounts.epicgames.com), which could be redirected to another site. After redirecting the token to the vulnerable site, experts were able to steal it with a JavaScript code injection. For the attack to succeed, the victim is required to click on a specially crafted phishing link. When the victim accesses Fortnite, the login page is redirected to the attackers website, where the token will be stolen. This attack may not be the most elaborated one, but attackers require certain technical expertise beyond those required to deploy phishing campaigns or brute force attacks. As an attack of average complexity, the investigators do not rule out that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, although this is hardly verifiable. On the other hand, Epic Games issued a statement mentioning that the vulnerability was corrected in early December 2018, but omitted to mention whether there are any evidence that the bug has been exploited at some point.

Network security and ethical hacking analysts from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that this application runs a hidden server that could leave a device exposed to cyberattacks or data theft. Nearly 300 million of Android users have downloaded ES File Explorer, which makes it one of the most popular apps in Play Store. Because of this, the vulnerability could affect an incredibly high number of people. According to an investigation by experts in [**network security**](URL the ES File Explorer is running a hidden server, which could grant access to any other user connected to the same network at the moment the application starts and connects. Thus, another user connected to the same network would have access to the files stored in our devices without us noticing the intrusion. Baptiste Robert, who is in charge of the investigation, claims that this vulnerability exposes any kind of files. The attacker could access images, videos, applications and even access the memory card, mentions the network security expert. Experts highlight that the chances of successfully executing this attack are minimal, as its execution depends on the attacker and the victim being connected to the same network (to the same WiFi connection, basically), in addition to medium skill hacking knowledge. However, researchers do not dismiss any malicious user from developing an application capable of exploiting this vulnerability. However, it must be taken seriously the fact that ES File Explorer, the most popular file manager of Android, contains a vulnerability that allows the access and theft of the data and files stored in a smartphone. Although, as mentioned, it is a very complex attack that requires the conjunction of multiple variables and ability on the attackers side. Prior to publishing their research, the experts notified the application developers of the vulnerability, but they have not received any response. Android is the most used operating system in smart devices, which makes it one of the most attacked targets by malicious users.

According to experts in network security and ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, an attacker could exploit this flaw to take full control of the compromised device and therefore the entire network of an organization. According to [**network security**](URL experts, the Small Business Switch was developed by Cisco to operate in small organizations and home office environments for the control and management of small local networks. It is one of the most popular solutions offered by the company for organizations with limited resources, as its price range starts at $300 USD. The vulnerability (tracked as **CVE-2018-15439**), has been considered critical, with a score of 9.8/10 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System scale, and it exists due to the default device configuration, which includes a user account with admin privileges by default that cannot be removed from the system. In recent days, Cisco issued a security statement that warns users: An attacker can use this default account to log into a vulnerable device and execute commands with all administrator privileges. This vulnerability could allow remote attackers to bypass the Small Business Switch user authentication system. Because these devices are used to manage local area networks (LANs), exploiting this vulnerability would involve attackers getting access to network security features such as firewall configuration or network management panel. Cisco has not developed a patch to fix this vulnerability, although it is expected to be launched over the next few days, according to network security experts from the company. Although its not all bad news, there is a simple solution to this flaw: An administrator can add at least one user account with level 15 access privileges in the Small Business Switch configuration to mitigate the risks. A user can set up an account using admin as the user ID, setting the access privilege to level 15 and setting a complex password for this new administrator account. By adding this new account, the default privilege account will be disabled, mentions the Cisco security alert. Just a few days ago, Cisco launched 18 new patches as part of its monthly updates, including fixes for several of its small business-specialized products. The bugs in question were two critical vulnerabilities that could lead to a denial of service on the affected devices. The flaws could be exploited by unauthenticated attackers via email.

According to reports, some of these flaws could be exploited for remote execution of arbitrary code, all without the need for users interaction. Security failures were discovered in ThreadX, a real-time operating system (RTOS); according to the website of the developers, ThreadX has more than 6 billion of implementations, being one of the most popular programs running with WiFi chips. The firmware also operates on Marvells SoC Avastar 88W8897 (Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + NFC), present on Sony PlayStation 4, on the Microsoft Surface tablet, Xbox One, Samsung Chromebook and some smartphones, report [**network security**](URL experts. **Process initialization of WiFi chips** Regularly, a WiFi chip is initialized by a manufacturers controller charged with loading the firmware image during the startup process. With Marvells wireless chip system (SoC), there are certain drivers that work with the Linux kernel you use: mwifiex, mLAN, and mlinux. &amp;#x200B; URL Both functions have debugging capabilities, allowing you to read and write to and from the WiFi module memory. **Controlling memory block allocation** One of the vulnerabilities discovered in the firmware is a block overflow that could be activated when the chip is looking for available networks, a process that starts every five minutes, even if the device is already connected to a WiFi network. An attacker could perform a remote code execution on a Samsung Chromebook, for example, even without the user having any interaction, says Denis Selianin, a network security and WiFi device specialist. In a report, Selianin describes two methods of exploitation, one that works with any ThreadX-based firmware if certain conditions are met, and another for the implementation of Marvells firmware in its modules; The combination of these two methods leads to a successful exploitation of vulnerabilities, says the expert. In the generic case, an attacker can overwrite the pointer to the next free memory block and control the location to assign the following block: When you control the location of the next block assignment, an attacker can place this block in place where some critical execution-time structures or pointers are found, thus achieving the execution of an attackers code. The exploitation of Marvells Avastar SoC vulnerability requires reverse-engineering activities for memory management routines. This works if the next block is busy. The functions use a metadata header with special pointers that are called before releasing a block at the beginning of each ThreadX block. This information is enough to allow code execution in a wireless SoC. Selianin said in his presentation that as soon as a solution is available, he will publish a review with the exploit and the tools used in the process."

This flaw exists in the file-transfer interaction between a client host and a [**MySQL**](URL server, as reported by [**network security**](URL specialists. Exploiting this attack would allow a malicious actor to steal sensitive information from a poorly configured web server by allowing connections to unreliable servers or from applications to manage databases. According to the security alert, there are two main drawbacks. Transferring the file from the client host to the server host is started by the MySQL server. In theory, a patched server could be built that would instruct the client program to transfer a file from the server choice instead of the client-named file in the LOAD DATA declaration. This server could access any file on the client host to which the client user has read access. In a post published on his blog on January 20, the network security expert Willem de Groot responded to the affirmation of the security notice that this failure could be exploited in theory, pointing out that a malicious MySQL server that is capable of doing that can be found on GitHub, and its probably been used to leak passwords from the hacked sites. This could be leveraged to steal SSH keys, online cryptocurrency wallets, among other malicious activities. Although this may not seem serious, as few users are really deceived to connect to malicious MySQL servers, there are many web servers with vulnerable database management interfaces, allowing for initiated connections from the side of the attacker to arbitrary servers, says Craig Young, an analyst at a network security firm.

Recently, a detailed investigation was published on this campaign, where it was concluded that it was possible thanks to a critical vulnerability in [**GoDaddy**](URL that allowed the attackers to hijack dozens of domains belonging to Mozilla, Yelp, among others organizations. According to the investigators, using the same exploit the attackers managed to hijack thousands of domains belonging to multiple organizations to deploy other campaigns of spam or blackmailing against some unsuspecting users. The distribution of malicious emails through legitimate domains was the cornerstone of this attack campaign. This technique, known as **snowshoe spam**, gives these messages a normal and legitimate appearance, which increases the possibility that malicious email is delivered, as reported by experts in [**network security**](URL Domains that sent these messages include wotdonate.com, wothome.com, wotlifestyle.com, wotnetwork.com, and wotscooking.com, which are registered as Expedia property. Other domains, such as yelpmarketingservices.com, virtualfirefox.com and blueestatescoffee.com, belong to organizations such as YELP and Mozilla. In total, 78 domains used to distribute spam were registered, although there are no more sites involved. On the other hand, the number of domains hijacked by the same user or group for other campaigns is much larger. An analysis of the network security expert Ronald Guilmette shows that, in the most recent years, this individual or group has hijacked over 4 thousand domains belonging to more than 500 companies or individuals, including sites like MasterCard International, Hilton International, ING Bank, MIT, McDonalds Corp. And even the DigiCert certifying authority. The evidence collected by Ronald Guilmette is sufficient to link the December 2018 bomb threat campaign with other email fraud campaigns, although researchers must still find the identity of the person or group of people behind of these attacks. Preliminarily, the investigators have nicknamed the responsible entity Spammy Bear, as the attacks usually involve IPs located in Russia. On the other hand, GoDaddy responded through an official statement: After conducting an internal investigation, our teams have confirmed that a malicious actor exploited our DNS configuration process. We have already devised a solution, which we are in the process of implementing. In spite of the malicious actions of the attackers, at no time changed the ownership of the accounts of the clients, nor exposed their personal information, claims the organization. Although GoDaddy teams did not disclose technical details about exploited vulnerability, several evidences show that it was a weakness present throughout its structure, which has affected other DNS service providers on previous occasions.

According to the network security specialist, the remote exploitation of the jailbreak consists of a combination of two vulnerabilities: * Memory Corruption Vulnerability in Safari Webkit (**CVE-2019-6227**) * Memory Corruption Vulnerability in iOS Kernel (**CVE-2019-6225**) The researcher demonstrated that the vulnerability in Safari allows maliciously created web content to execute arbitrary code on the victims device; along with the second flaw, this allows attackers to elevate their privileges and install a malicious application in the background. Qixun Zhao decided not to publish the jailbreak code so as not to provoke a surge of cyber attacks against Apple users; he also mentioned that he expects the cybersecurity community to use this research in a way that does not harm users in the future. I will not release the operating code, if you want to perform a jailbreak, you must complete the code on your own or expect more details from the jailbreak community. I have also decided to omit post exploit details, the researcher mentioned. Due to the potentially malicious users wide attack range, in addition to the remote nature of this exploit, experts in cybersecurity recommend that Apple users install the latest iOS operating system update as soon as possible."

The Singapore Ministries of Health and Communications defined this incident as a deliberate, well-defined and planned cyberattack campaign, although subsequent investigations by network security experts confirmed that a human error was fundamental for this incident to materialize: while SingHealth implements the necessary technical controls, two high-level employees turned out to be negligent in their work. The researchers criticized the poor server configuration of Lum Yuan Woh, the leader of the Citrix team, as they considered that unnecessary risks were introduced to the system. On the other hand, Ernest Tan, SingHealth Incident Response Team Manager, was criticized for ignoring the due process of security incident notification. Another five senior employees were also reported as responsible for data theft, but their mistakes were not considered serious enough to warrant dismissal. Four of these employees were fined, while the remaining employee was transferred to a position with lower responsibilities. According to the experts, SingHealth employees committed three fundamental errors: * They were unable to install software patches on their systems, allowing attackers to exploit an Office vulnerability and gain access to one of the employees PC * The SingHealth team took at least a year to identify the data breach. Hackers accessed the system for the first time in August 2017 and, over a year, managed to distribute malware and infect other computers on the network without being detected * Employees used weak passwords (***p@ssw0rd***, for example).

According to reports, this campaign would have already infected more than 70k servers worldwide and could have laid the foundation for a massive botnet. SpeakUp targets local servers as well as cloud-hosted machines (such as Amazon Web Services, for example); it is also believed that it is not only limited to acting on Linux, but it is also capable of infecting MacOS devices. The network security specialist Oded Vanunu has mentioned that this attack extends to servers running ThinkPHP, Hadoop, Oracle WebLogic, Apache ActiveMQ and Red Hat JBoss. In addition, the specialist stresses that because this software can be deployed on virtual servers, any infrastructure in the cloud could also be compromised. Infection begins when remote code execution vulnerability is detected (CVE-2018-20062); the code uses command-injection techniques to load a PHP shell that serves and runs a Perl backdoor. SpeakUp has a Python script for its spread whose main functions are to use brute force against administrative panels and to scan the environment of the infected machine. For this, SpeakUp verifies the availability of specific ports on servers that share the same internal and external subnet mask. The idea is to scan and infect the most vulnerable Linux servers within their internal and external subnets, using a wide range of exploits. For its propagation, SpeakUp exploits known vulnerabilities in six different Linux distros: * JBoss enterprise application platform security bypass (CVE-2012-0874) * JBoss Seam Framework Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2010-1871) * Oracle Fusion Middleware Oracle WebLogic Server Component Vulnerability (CVE-2018-2894) * Hadoop YARN ResourceManager command execution exploit * Oracle WebLogic remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-10271) * Apache ActiveMQ fileserver file upload vulnerability (CVE-2016-3088) Successful exploitation of one of these vulnerabilities will result in the implementation of the original script on the exploited server, the network security experts mention. The file downloads that the backdoor is showing are simple cryptocurrency mining scripts; however, SpeakUp authors can download any kind of code to the servers. Some specialists consider that the injection of mining code could be a kind of beta test for future hacking activities. The threat actor behind this campaign can at any time deploy additional, potentially more intrusive and offensive payloads.

According to recent reports, just by looking at a seemingly harmless image a smartphone with Android OS could be hacked, this due to three recently discovered critical vulnerabilities. These flaws are present in millions of devices that work with that operating system, from the Android versions Nougat 7.0 to the latest Android 9.0 Pie. Vulnerabilities, tracked as **CVE-2019-1986**, **CVE-2019-1987**, and **CVE-2019-1988**, were patched by Android Open Source Project as part of their security updates for February 2019, report [**network security**](URL specialists. The problem is that not all smartphone manufacturers launch their security updates on a monthly basis, so mitigation for these vulnerabilities will not be available to all Android devices at the same time. Googles network security team has not revealed further technical details about the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, although the updates available to the operating system mention repairing some bugs like buffering overflow, SkpPngCodec errors, and some more flaws in various components that render PNG format images. Reports indicate that one of the three reported vulnerabilities could allow a specially crafted PNG image to execute arbitrary code on a compromised device. Of the three vulnerabilities found, this is the most severe, according to Googles security teams. A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability if they manage to deceive users to open or download the malicious PNG file on their devices (it is impossible for the user to detect the payload in this image at the naked eye). The image can reach the user through an instant messaging service, as an attachment in an email, or it can be downloaded from any webpage. In February updates, Google also included fixes for 42 vulnerabilities in the Android OS in total; 11 considered critical, 30 high impact and one medium-gravity. The company stresses that there is no evidence that any of these vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild. Finally, the company claims that it had already notified its partners working with Android on the vulnerabilities weeks before the publication of these reports, and added that the source code of these fixes will be published shortly in Android Open Source Project repository."

The vulnerability resides in **PolicyKit** (also known as Polkit), a set of tools for Unix-like operating systems that defines policies, manages system-wide privileges, and provides a way for processes that do not require privileges to communicate with those who do require them. This security issue, tracked as **CVE-2018-19788**, affects PolicyKit version 0115, which is pre-installed on the most popular Linux distributions, including Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS, according to [**digital forensics**](URL experts report. The vulnerability exists due to the incorrect validation that PolicyKit performs for permissions requests for any user with low privileges with UID greater than INT\_MAX, which is a constant widely used in programming that defines the maximum value that can store an entire variable, which is equivalent to 2147483647 (in hexadecimal 0x7FFFFFFF). This means that if you create a user account on affected Linux systems with a UID greater than the INT\_MAX value, the PolicyKit component will allow the user to execute any **SYSTEMCTL** command successfully. The digital forensics expert Rich Mirch, known on Twitter as 0xm1rch, has also launched the proof of concept of an exploit to demonstrate this vulnerability. Several Linux distros have recommended system administrators do not allow UID or UID over 2147483646 to mitigate attack risks until the corresponding update patch is available."

Apparently all the experts needed to perform the attack were a laptop and various devices worth about $1.5k USD. The AKA (**Authentication and Key Agreement**) protocol is intended to provide security between mobile phones and base stations, and had been exploited in the past using surveillance devices such as the [**Stingray**](URL used by some police agencies. In the research carried out by experts in digital forensics from countries such as Germany and Norway, the existence of a new attack vector against any of the variants of the AKA protocol, including the version for 5G networks, is confirmed. Moreover, experts say this is a much more invasive attack than its predecessors. This is a serious problem because we faced with a logical vulnerability in AKA, which means that the security problem is not limited to a single implementation of the protocol, so it is inconvenient for users of last generation networks and for mobile phones that use 3G deployment. AKA is a challenge-response protocol based on symmetric cryptography and a sequence number (SQN) to verify the freshness of the challenges, preventing repetition attacks, mentions the experts report. Thanks to the discovery of previous vulnerabilities in cellular networks, especially the susceptibility of the smartphones to the IMCI receptors (similar to the Stingray), **3rd Generation Partnership Project** (3GPP), organism in charge of the standards in mobile telephony, modified the AKA protocol in 5G generation with asymmetric encryption to protect users during the communication process. However, this new version of AKA still uses sequence numbers (SQN), so the digital forensics investigators decided to check if the protocol was still vulnerable. During the investigation, they discovered that the lack of randomness would allow them to infringe the SQN protection mechanism. It has been shown that partially learning SQN produces a new class of attacks against mobile phone users; although the attacker must start with a fake base station, the attack can be extended even if the victim moves away from the attack area, the experts mentioned. Even when the victim uses his cell phone outside the attack area, some of their activity can be leaked to another attacker once the user enters the attack area again. The vulnerability occurs because an attacker can send authentication challenges to the users system at different times, retrieve the SQN, and exploit its values to violate the confidentiality of the SQN. To carry out their proof of concept, the experts only required a laptop, a radio peripheral, a smart card reader, and the **OpenLTE** software. In total, the researchers claimed to have spent about $1.5k USD, not counting the laptop (which, according to experts, can be replaced by a Raspberry Pi, obtaining the same results). Experts say they have already notified 3GPP, as well as giving notice to manufacturers like Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia. An update is expected to be released as soon as possible, but only for mobile phones operating with 5G technology."

According to Elias Heftrig, a digital forensics expert at the **Fraunhofer Institute for Information Technology Security**, five of seventeen certification authorities are vulnerable to IP fragmentation attacks. Certification authorities that use **Domain Validation** (DV) to authenticate domain property were selected and scanned to detect this class of vulnerabilities. This attack exploits DNS cache poisoning and deceives the certification authority into issuing fraudulent certificates for domains that do not rightfully belong to the attacker, the investigators explained. Another group of specialists discovered some shortcomings in the implementations of elliptical curve cryptography in real scenarios. However, this research revealed nothing serious enough to force users to resort to weaker cryptography. The finding of these [**digital forensics**](URL experts came from passive Internet scans for TLS on a large number of ports, as well as Secure Shell (SSH) and IPsec, in a series of tests designed to measure the support of the elliptical curve and the behavior of the implementation. Researchers Luke Valenta and Nick Sullivan also performed active measurements to estimate server vulnerability to known attacks against elliptical curve deployments, including support for weak curves, invalid bend attacks, and curve spin attacks, they mention in their reports. Around 0.77% of HTTPS hosts, 0.04% of SSH hosts and 4.04% of IKEV2 hosts that support elliptical curves do not perform curve validation checks as specified in elliptical curve standards, experts said. These vulnerabilities have the potential to be used in elliptical curve parameter degradation attacks, known as CurveSwap attacks. Even so, when this variant of attack was put into practice, the investigators were unable to execute malicious actions as they were theoretically posed. Valenta mentioned that there are other easier methods in which a nation state could attack a system that attempts to degrade the connections of elliptical curves. In addition, the expert added that there could still be poorly configured servers available, so the possibility of this attack should not be completely ruled out. After scanning, the investigators proceeded to examine the source code for elliptical curve implementations, finding instances where libraries cannot perform point validation for JSON web encryption, as well as some coding deficiencies in multiplication algorithms."

A secure password mitigates the risks of dictionary or brute force attacks. **Sensitive information encryption** Users should consider encrypting information considered as sensitive when sending it by email or storing it in the cloud, there are multiple options for users with any level of knowledge. **Remember to always log out** Log out from every platform you use, especially when using a device that does not belong to you. Public-use computers may contain a keylogger or some type of software that registers a users login keys. **Store your passwords in a safe space** Never store your passwords in text files or notepads on your computer, in case of loss, all your access codes would be compromised. Consider using password management software. **Keep alert of system upgrades** Software bugs appear frequently in all systems. Keeping your software updated will help you stay safe from exploiting any vulnerability present in your system. **Avoid public WiFi networks** You must be careful with the use of public networks; digital forensics experts mention that malicious users often try to compromising them to extract information. Using VPN services is an interesting alternative for private browsing. **Enable security alerts** You can choose to receive a security alert when using an online banking service or similar. In the event that a malicious user tries to access one of your accounts, one of these alerts might help your bank determine an illegitimate access attempt. **Think before you click** Resort to common sense; dont click on misleading links or ads, never open an email if youre not sure its from a legit user.

According to Facebook estimates, about 6.8 million users would have been affected; the company is in the process of notifying potentially affected users. Over the next few days we will begin with the implementation of a series of tools for the external developers, allowing them to determine which users might have been affected by this flaw, Facebook said. We will work together with developers to eliminate these compromised files. This year has been plagued by errors and accusations against Facebook. Last May, experts in digital forensics revealed a bug in Facebooks software that changed the privacy settings of millions of users posts, leaving any post available to the general public. Subsequently, the social network stated that it was the victim of a group of hackers who exploited a flaw in the View as function, thus about 50 million of access tokens were exposed. As if it were not enough, it was verified the responsibility of Facebook in the scandal of the consultant **Cambridge Analytica**, where the information of millions of users of Facebook was leaked for electoral purposes."

The worst part is that things didnt get any better; new **malware** families, government-sponsored attacks, and many more incidents have kept the cybersecurity community busy. Some of the most dangerous cyberthreats that were presented this year are: **Spectre and Meltdown** Just started the year and several [**cybersecurity**](URL specialists began to report the CPU vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. Present on the Intel, IBM, ARM and AMD chips, it was discovered that these vulnerabilities could be exploited through a side channel attack for the purpose of stealing confidential information stored on the device by deceiving the compromised computers programs. Prior to its public disclosure, multiple industry organizations worked together to develop security patches for these failures, which generated some mistimes, such as slowing down the affected devices, if not enough, in the following months some variants of the vulnerabilities continued to appear, as well as other speculative execution vulnerabilities, such as Foreshadow. Companies like Intel mentioned that their next generation of chips will be designed to avoid the presence of this kind of flaws. **GandCrab** GandCrab encryption software became the most widely used tool in[ **ransomware**](URL attacks this 2018. Unlike conventional attacks, GandCrab is based on exploitation kits such as RIG, GrandSoft and Fallout to deploy its attacks; in addition, GandCrab demands ransom in the cryptocurrency Dash. According to an analysis of a cybersecurity firm, hackers behind GandCrab could have generated about $700k USD in earnings. **VPNFilter** VPNFilter is a modular malware program allegedly developed by the Russian hacker group known as Fancy Bear. Present in a wide range of routers, this malware is capable of performing DDoS attacks, data leaking and cyber spying tasks. At a later stage, VPNFilter is able to even propagate much more quickly through multiple endpoints, leak information and encrypt its own malicious traffic. **Coinhive** The use of cryptocurrency mining software increased considerably this year. Among the many programs available, Coinhive was consecrated as the most widely used mining software, especially for focusing on the digital currency Monero, an anonymous asset whose transactions are very difficult to trace. Coinhive is explicitly used in some sites, although most of its users are malicious hackers who inject the miner inadvertently into unsuspecting websites or administrator machines. **Magecart** This is a malware used for the theft of payment card data used at least by six malicious hacker organizations around the world. In general, malicious actors incorporate Magecart into committed websites using a JavaScript tool that copies the data entering the forms present on a website, this information is subsequently sent to a malicious server. Although the first logs of Magecart attacks date back to the year 2014, it ultimately reached its peak of activity along 2018."

On the other hand, Huawei has reported that it is developing a solution for this vulnerability, also claims to be working with companies that use the compromised router model for the solution to be implemented in their networks. The cybersecurity experts who discovered the vulnerability reported that no technical details will be published on this flaw, nor has the scope of the error been detailed, although Anubhav mentioned that, during this investigation, they found an alarming amount of affected routers. This is the most recent incident of operator-level equipment flaws, a trend that has become problematic due to the potential scope of such vulnerabilities.Exploiting vulnerabilities with such features could be much more favorable to hackers than attacking a vendor with only a few hundred infected devices, the expert mentioned. Vulnerabilities such as **CVE-2018-14847** (MikroTik) and **CVE-2014-8361** have been widely exploited during this year and, one point they have in common, is the large number of devices that can be affected, the expert concluded."

The companys honeypots detected for the first time the attack traffic directed to the Orange Livebox ADSL modems. After conducting a search on Shodan, the [**cybersecurity**](URL expert Troy Mursch found that 19 490 devices of this type leaked their WiFi credentials in plain text. According to the expert report, many of the devices that showed this WiFi password leaking use the same access keys for the device administration, or even lack a password set by the admin, so the attackers find the default passwords in a very easy way. The vulnerability would allow a remote attacker to access the compromised router and modify the device or firmware settings. In addition, attackers could get the phone number linked to the router and perform other hacking or social engineering activities, said the cybersecurity expert. According to Murschs report, most of the compromised routers are in Spain; in addition, the traffic of the attack has also been linked to an IP address associated to a client of the company Telefnica Espaa. At the moment we do not know the reasons for the attack, although we find it interesting to discover that the source is in a nearby location, even though we thought it was a malicious actor in another country, the expert mentioned. This could allow attackers to connect to the WiFi network if they were closer to one of the indexed modems in the search on Shodan. The vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-20377**, is already being investigated by Orange. Further company reports are expected over the next few days. For many cybersecurity experts, most home-use routers remain an important vector for deploying cyberattacks due to their limited security measures, so hackers can use these devices to build huge botnets.

In one of the infection cases we analyzed, sysadmins did not change the default passwords for the IPMI interface. Another victim claimed that the admin user function was disabled, but somehow the attackers got access by exploiting vulnerability. Experts noted that once the user gained access to the server, attackers would restart the computer in single-user mode to gain root access, then downloaded and compiled the ccrypt encryption program. After encrypting the files, the attackers send the ransom note that contains the instructions for performing the transfer and restoring the files. Attackers use the email address junglesec@anonymousspeech\[.\]com to communicate with victims and demand 0.3 Bitcoin.

According to the reports of the specialists, the error in question is a problem with the firmware of the Guardzilla systems. Experts say they found that all of these security devices use the same encrypted keys, so passwords are easy to crack. Getting these keys must be easy for any hacker with minimal skills, researchers said. Guardzilla works with the [**Amazon S3**](URL service to store the customers data sent from each device. According to the investigators, because of this seemingly weak security protocol, all users of the **Guardzilla All-In-One** security system could access the recordings and images of other users.

The hacker identified as **TheHackerGiraffe** is behind this campaign of attacks, dubbed on Twitter as #CastHack. Through a thread of tweets, the hacker announced that this campaign takes advantage of users of smart devices that use incorrectly configured routers that use the UPnP (Universal PlugnPlay) service that forwards specific ports from an internal network. The ports are 8008, 8009 and 8443, which normally use devices such as smart TVs, Chromecast or Google Home to manage some of their functions. The devices expose these ports to internal networks, where anyone can send commands from their smartphones or computers for remote management. But a router with UPnP erroneous configurations makes these ports available on the Internet, as mentioned specialists in [**cybersecurity**](URL This allowed the hacker FriendlyH4xx0r to configure a script that analyzes the Internet to find devices with these exposed ports. When these devices are found, the hacker changes their name (HACKED\_SUB2PEWDS \_ #) and finally tries to automatically play the video in question. The video is part of a marketing campaign that began a few weeks ago when fans of PewDiePie tried to help the content creator to consolidate as the YouTuber with the most subscribers in the world.

Recently, while I was using the application, I felt the need to check an option that apparently granted more permits than it should, said the young [**cybersecurity**](URL expert. Kunushevci discovered that when a Skype call is answered, the application continues with its normal operation, allowing actions such as access to the phones files or search for contacts, regardless of whether the phone was blocked or not when the call was received. Just like multiple flaws found in the iOS system over the years, this vulnerability is due to a slight oversight in systems security. In this case, Skype allows users to access other functions by omitting any additional step of identity verification. I think this vulnerability is rather a design flaw, the expert mentions. Before posting any vulnerability report, Kunushevci reported the flaw to Microsoft, waiting for the company to launch an update to correct this bug. According to reports of experts on cybersecurity, this would have been corrected in the Skype update last December 23. The bug affects all versions of Skype for Android, according to Kunushevci. However, the vulnerabilitys scope seems to vary depending on the version of the operating system.

According to reports of information security and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, versions of Struts library prior to 1.3.3 have a security issue with a Java Object, which could be exploited to write or copy files in arbitrary locations on the disk. While the Java Object can be used alone, this new attack vector can be integrated with ysoserial to load and run binaries on a single deserialization call, mentions the original security warning for the vulnerability in question. Unless there is a different mechanism to add file loading capability to web applications created with Struts, the default framework is the Commons FileUpload component. Apache Software Foundation launched the first security alert on this issue last March. Since then, two new versions of Struts 2.3.x are available. The most recent is Struts 2.3.36, released as an edition of General Availability in October 15th. Like other versions, 2.3.36 includes a vulnerable version of the library.

The security problem in the Content Management System (CMS) was discovered by Simon Scannell, a cybersecurity and digital forensics researcher, who said in a blog post that this design error specifically affects WooCommerce, a popular WordPress plugin that has been downloaded over four million times. The vulnerability allows store managers to delete certain files on the server and then take control over any administrator account, the investigator says in his security report. According to reports from information security and [digital forensics](URL specialists, this plugin has been developed by Automattic and is a free e-commerce system for websites based on WordPress. Scannell found the file deletion bug in the software which, by itself, is not considered a critical flaw, since the greatest damage an attacker could cause would be to remove the index.php pages and cause a denial of service (DDoS) condition. However, when combined with the flaw in the WordPress design, this becomes a critical security error. This problem in WordPress, which continues without being patched, derives from the way in which the CMS assigns capacities to different roles. When its defined the store manager role that uses this plugin, the **edit\_users**capability is configured to allow users with these privileges to edit client accounts. Even if the plugin is disabled, this account privilege is stored in the central WordPress database. By default, the edit\_users function allows the account holder to edit any user, including administrator accounts. To prevent this from being abused, WooCommerce specifies that you can only edit accounts with the client role, but these metadata additions, possible thanks to the current\_user\_can() functionality, are only active when the plugin is enabled. Thats where the problem lies. Because the flaw in the WordPress design maintains the store manager function stored separately from the plugin, if WooCommerce is disabled, attackers who can access one of these accounts are not limited by changes in metadata. This means that if WooCommerce was disabled for some reason, the privilege check that restricts administrators from editing other admins store would not run, producing this default behavior in the plugin allowing the editing of any users information, says Scannell. This would allow store managers to update the password for the administrator account and then control the entire site. If a threat actor is able to successfully perform a phishing campaign and get the credentials of a store admin account or use XSS vulnerability for the same purpose, then the attack string becomes possible."

Tatooine will be a central point for technical talent throughout the army, a place to write code and solve high-impact problems, said DDS director, Chris Lynch, at the presentation of the new facilities last Thursday. Together, men and women, professionals and technicians of cybersecurity and digital forensics are finding new ways to quickly resolve the challenges we face. At this center, the soldiers and technology experts at the DDS will work together on several pilot programs, known internally as Jyn Erso (another Star Wars reference), to help the Department in its war efforts and train soldiers to adapt and respond to future needs and problems. The first of these pilot programs will focus on the detection of drones, the active hunting of cyber threats in the Department of Defense (DoD) networks and the design of better training systems for the military working in computer science areas. To help the military solve the technical and talent management challenges, the US Army DDS and Cyber Command have partnered to bring together technically endowed soldiers with civilian private sector talents to rapidly develop the cyber capabilities needed at present, mentioned ARCYBER commander, Lt. Stephen Fogarty. This innovative partnership will solve complex problems and serve as a powerful staff retention and recruitment tool. Military personnel interested in joining these or other pilot programs can register through a special Google Hire portal created for the program. In addition to the collaboration between ARCYBER and DDS, this space will also host academic and industrial tasks through programs such as the reward for bug report Hack the Army or the Civilian Hiring-as-a-Service pilot, which seeks to count with more civilians specializing in [digital forensics](URL and information technology. Technology has become the new battlefield, Lynch said. Recruiting, supporting and retaining technical talent in the military can present unique challenges, from training to compensation, and ensuring opportunities for growth and participation in a rapidly evolving field."
93,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Botnet infects over 400krouters for spam campaign,1,9x2lgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9x2lgo/botnet_infects_over_400krouters_for_spam_campaign/,2018-11-15 05:17:56," Security investigators discovered a new botnet of spam; they calculate that the number of infected devices is close to half a million Researchers from a cybersecurity and digital forensics firm have recently discovered a new botnet of spam, called ***BCMPUPnP\_Hunter***, which primarily attacks the routers that have the BroadCom UPnP function enabled. BCMPUPnP\_Hunter was first seen last September; in mid-October, the researchers managed to collect the first samples of this [botnet](URL Digital forensics experts noted that the interaction between the botnet and the potential victim requires several steps to complete, starting with the destination scan of TCP 5431 port. After scanning, verification is made of the UDP 1900 port of destination and the target is expected to send the appropriate vulnerable URL, mentions the security report published by the specialists. After getting the correct URL, it takes another 4 packet exchanges for the attacker to find out where the Shellcode execution start address is in memory so that the exploit payload can be created and sent to the target. Experts noted that the extent of infection is really large; the amount of IP found is approximately 100k in each analysis. Once the attacked device is compromised, the attacker implements a proxy network (TCP-proxy) that communicates with widely used mail servers such as Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, etc. This suggests that botnet may have been involved in spam campaigns. The geographic distribution of scanned IP in the last 7 days revealed that most of the infected devices are found in India, the United States and China. [Digital forensics](URL experts tested the scanners and discovered at least 116 different types of infected devices. According to reports from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the malware sample analyzed by the experts is composed of the main body and a shell code that is apparently designed specifically to download the main sample and run. The main function of the shellcode is to download the main sample of C2 (109.248.9.17:8738) and execute it, the analysis continues. Shell code has a total length of 432 bytes, very well organized and written. It seems that the authors have advanced hacking skills, they are not amateur hackers. The main sample includes an exploit for the BroadCom UPnP vulnerability and the proxy access network module. The main sample can scan four C2 instruction codes, enable port scanning, and find a potentially vulnerable target, empty concurrent task, access the proxy network. The botnet was probably designed to send traffic to servers of known mail service providers. Researchers believe that the proxy network established by the botnet is used for spam due to connections made only through TCP port 25."
94,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Steam error allowed people to download any game for free,1,9xdfnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9xdfnp/steam_error_allowed_people_to_download_any_game/,2018-11-16 04:48:21," **The person who reported the bug was rewarded with $20k USD** A cybersecurity researcher discovered and reported a bug on [Steam](URL that allowed people to download any game available on the digital platform without paying for it, as reported by digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Cybersecurity researcher Artem Moskowsky was responsible for finding this flaw, which allowed anyone to generate license keys to access material available only by purchasing a license. Digital forensics specialists estimate that there are millions of people who use Steam to buy and download games. Mr. Moskowsky informed Valve, owners of Steam, receiving $20k USD in return, thanks to the companys vulnerability bounty program. This type of program allows companies to reward cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL experts who make the security issues known directly to companies so they can be repaid, rather than disclosing the information online. Moskowsky claims that he discovered the issue in a circumstantial way while browsing the Steam Partners portal. This portal allows game developers to generate license keys for their software, allowing them to deliver a copy to their fans or experts on the subject for testing before being available to the public. The expert discovered that by modifying the request, anyone was allowed to generate thousands of codes for any game they want. In theory, this could be sold on any black market forum online. I managed to overlook the ownership verification of the game by changing only one parameter, reports the expert. Valve granted him $15k USD for discovering the error, plus a bonus of $5k USD for informing the company privately about the error. The flaw was corrected shortly after the company received the report. The company also mentioned that, after an investigation into its records, it has found no evidence that the bug has been exploited in a real-world scenario."
95,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Zero Day vulnerability in VirtualBox is disclosed,1,9xdfst,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9xdfst/zero_day_vulnerability_in_virtualbox_is_disclosed/,2018-11-16 04:48:49," **A Russian exploit developer publicly revealed the security flaw** An expert in cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL and exploits developer from Russia has publicly disclosed a zero-day vulnerability in all versions of VirtualBox 5.2.20 and earlier. VirtualBox is an open source virtualization software developed by Oracle and has been widely used, as reported by experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security. According to the analysis of Sergey Zelenyuk, the problems of memory corruption are responsible for this zero day [vulnerability](URL also mentions that the exploit is 100% reliable. The vulnerability affects the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) network card (E1000) if the network mode is set to Network Address translation (NAT). The problem prevails in a virtualization software-shared code base, which is available literally on all operating systems. According to experts in digital forensics, this vulnerability is not specific to this platform or some operating system mainly because it is present in a shared code base. Zelenyuk has also shown the steps to follow to exploit vulnerability. Through the exploitation of this flaw, an attacker can evade the virtual environment of a guest computer and gain direct and easy access to the Ring 3 privilege layer, which is used to execute the encoding of most user programs with minimum privileges. Zelenyuk discovered that the error can be exploited on those virtual machines that have been configured with the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) network adapter only when NAT mode is enabled, while the default setting allows the system guest can access external networks. Zelenyuk explains clearly the error in his blog: The Intel PRO/1000 MT has a zero-day vulnerability that allows an attacker with administrator privileges to operate as a guest to escape a host3 ring. The attacker can then use existing techniques to escalate privileges to ring 0 through /dev/vboxdrv. In addition, he stated that it is important to understand the way this failure is exploited, because it is the key to understanding how context descriptors are processed before data descriptors. Zelenyuk demonstrated how the conditions needed to obtain a buffer overflow are activated, which can be exploited to evade the virtual operating systems confinements. The digital forensics expert used package descriptors to produce a suboverflow condition in data segments that cause the network adapter to locate package data from the network by searching the system memory. Next, Zelenyuk read the guest operating system data in a stack buffer to create an overflow condition. This led to overwriting of function pointers, which can be understood as a stack overflow condition. Zelenyuk further explained in its technical report that the exploit depends on two overflow conditions and the vendor access to the Ring 3 level permissions, therefore, to control the host operating system, it is necessary to obtain a privilege escalation. An attacker can do that by linking another vulnerability to achieve greater privileges, which is a difficult process but certainly not impossible, according to Zelenyuk."
96,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,63 new vulnerabilities found in Windows,1,9yua0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9yua0m/63_new_vulnerabilities_found_in_windows/,2018-11-21 04:31:57," **The company recommends users to update their systems as soon as possible, because among the errors found there are zero-day vulnerabilities** Last Tuesday Microsoft has launched a new round of security updates for the Windows operating system and other [Microsoft](URL products, reported experts in digital forensics and cybersecurity from the International Institute of Cyber Security. This month, Windows users and sysadmins must immediately take care of updating to correct a total of 63 security vulnerabilities, of which 12 are considered critical, 49 relevant, one moderated and one low-severity. Two of the errors solved by the technology giant this month had not been publicly disclosed until now; in addition, specialists in digital forensics report that one of the vulnerabilities is being actively exploited in real environments by multiple groups of cybercriminals. **Zero-day vulnerability exploited** The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-8589**, was detected and reported for the first time by researchers from a Russian cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL and its being exploited in real scenarios by multiple advanced persistent threat groups. The error resides in the Win32k component (win32k.sys), and if successfully exploited, it could allow a malicious program to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode and raise the privileges of the attacker on an affected Windows 7, Server 2008, or Server 2008 R2 system, allowing them to take control. The exploit was executed by the first stage of a malware installer to obtain the necessary privileges for its persistence in the victims system. So far, we have detected a very limited number of successful exploits of this vulnerability, researchers mentioned. **Two zero-day vulnerabilities disclosed** The other two recently disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities (and of which no evidence of exploitation has been found) reside in the Windows Advanced Local Procedure Call service (ALPC) and the Microsoft BitLocker security feature. The ALPC-related vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-8584**, is a privilege escalation vulnerability that could be exploited when running an application specially designed to execute arbitrary code in the local context system security and take control of an affected system. APLC facilitates safe and high-speed data transfer between one or more processes in user mode. The second publicly disclosed vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-8566**, occurs when Windows unduly suspends BitLocker device encryption, which could allow an attacker with physical access to an off system to omit security and get access to encrypted data. BitLocker caught the attention of the cybersecurity community in early November for a security issue that could expose some Windows users encrypted data due to default configuration and poor encryption in self-encryption solid state units. Of the 12 critical bugs, 8 are memory corruption vulnerabilities in the Chakra script engine present due to the way the script engine handles objects in the Microsoft Edge browser. All of these 8 errors could be exploited to corrupt the memory, allowing an attacker to execute code in the context of the current user. Three of the remaining vulnerabilities are remote code execution errors on the TFTP server of Windows Deployment Services, all residing because of the way the affected software handles objects in memory. The latest critical vulnerability is also a remote code execution flaw found in Microsoft Dynamics 365 version 8. The error exists when the server cannot properly disinfect web requests to an affected Dynamics server."
97,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,New variants of Meltdown and Spectre cause information leaks,1,9z5c9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9z5c9r/new_variants_of_meltdown_and_spectre_cause/,2018-11-22 04:35:30," **Developers insist that existing defenses will be enough to contain attacks, but experts disagree** Information security and digital forensic investigators have discovered a new set of transient execution attacks on modern CPUs that allow a local attacker to gain access to the systems privileged data, confirming predictions made when the cybersecurity community revealed the [Spectre](URL and Meltdown vulnerabilities at the beginning of the year. In short, these security failures can be exploited by malicious users and potentially remove passwords, encryption keys, and other sensitive information. To date, there is no knowledge of any software that exploits these vulnerabilities in the wild, however, this have been a wake-up call for the semiconductor industry, a situation that forced manufacturers to make new designs of silicon and tool chain changes. Digital forensics investigators described seven new transient execution attacks, consisting of two new variants of Meltdown (Meltdown-PK on Intel and Meltdown-BR on Intel and AMD) and five new Spectre branches for previously described flaws known as Specter-PHT and Specter-BTB. The researchers say they have already informed the companies involved. When Spectre gains access to transient data, Meltdown prevents isolation between applications and the operating system when evaluating out-of-order transients after a CPU exception to read kernel memory. Previously, five variants of Meltdown were publicly disclosed: Meltdown-US (Meltdown), Meltdown-P (Foreshadow), Meltdown-GP (Variant 3a), Meltdown-NM (Lazy FP) and Meltdown-RW (variant 1.2). The digital forensics investigators propose two more: Meltdown-PK and Meltdown-BR. The Meltdown-PK attack can override a defense on the Intel Skylake-SP server chips called memory protection keys for user space (PKU), allowing processes to modify the access permissions of a memory page from the user space, without a syscall/hypercall. For its part, Meltdown-BR provides a way to bypass linked checks, which generate exceptions when an out-of-bound value is encountered. It exploits the transient execution after such an exception to capture information outside of the limits that would otherwise not be accessible, the experts in [digital forensics](URL report. Researchers demonstrated the attack on an Intel Skylake i5-6200U CPU with MPX support, an AMD 2013 E2-2000 and an AMD 2017 Ryzen Threadripper 1920X. They point out that this is the first time that a Meltdown-style transient execution attack can take advantage of exception handling delays in AMD hardware. As for the new approaches to confuse the predictor of the branch in the attacks Specter-PHT and Specter-BTB, the researchers carried out the vulnerability proof of concept on Intel Skylake i5-6200U and Haswell i7-4790, in AMD Ryzen 1950X and Ryzen Threadripper 1920X, and on an Arm-based NVIDIA Jetson TX1. Researchers say that all vendors have processors that are vulnerable to these attack variants. CVEs for these security flaws have not yet been assigned. In a statement, an Intel spokesperson dismissed the possible risks. The vulnerabilities documented in this research can be fully addressed by applying the existing mitigation techniques for Spectre and Meltdown, including those documented earlier in this document and elsewhere by other manufacturers of Chips, the spokesperson mentions. An ARM spokesman said: The recent vulnerabilities of Spectre and Meltdown identified by a group of researchers can be addressed by applying existing mitigations. For its part, AMD has not issued any statement regarding the investigation."

During the event, participating cybersecurity specialists earned more than $300k USD for disclosing flaws that affected various smartphone models from several manufacturers. During the first day of the event Pwn2Own Tokyo 2018, the participants, experts on cybersecurity and digital forensics, hacked Apples [iPhone X](URL devices, Samsungs Galaxy S9 and Xiaomis Mi 6, generating revenues of more than $225k USD. The novelty of this edition of Pwn2Own was the implementation of a specific hacking session for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The second day, the organizers delivered rewards of $100k USD for one iPhone and two Xiaomi hacks. The day began with the triumph of the team Fluoroacetato composed by experts in information security and [digital forensics](URL Amat Cama and Richard Zhu, who hacked an iPhone X exploiting a Just-In-Time (JIT) vulnerability and an out of bonds flaw. Specialists received $50k USD for leaking device information, successfully extracting a previously deleted photo from the hacked device. In another test, the Fluoroacetate team failed in their attempt to demonstrate a base-band exploit directed against iPhone X devices in time, but the experts successfully exploited an overflow of integers in the web browsers JavaScript engine Xiaomi to leak an image stored in the phone, earning $25k USD. Researchers Georgi Geshev, Fabi Beterke and Rob Miller of the LaterMWR Labs team also failed in their attempt to hack an iPhone X in the browser category, as they were unable to use their exploit chain within the time the test allowed them. Later, this team hacked the Xiaomi Mi6 in the browser category using a download error along with a stealth app installation to load their custom application and leak the images of the device, thanks to this the team won $25k USD. The organizers reported the vulnerabilities found to the respective vendors, who paid a total of $325k USD for 18 zero-day vulnerabilities, of which $110k USD were paid for vulnerability reports on iPhone X. These security bugs could have been exploited by a persistent attacker or a surveillance company to compromise a device through the browser or Wi-Fi feature. This type of vulnerability can reach much higher prices in the cybercrime community. Overall, we grant a total of $325k USD during the two days of the event, buying 18 zero-day exploits. Manufacturers and developers received reports of these errors and now have 90 days to launch security patches to address these vulnerabilities. Once the updates are published, the user must remain attentive to their implementation, is mentioned on the official website of Pwn2Own Tokyo 2018."

The US Postal service is an independent agency of the US federal government. This office is responsible for managing and providing the postal service throughout the United States, and is one of the few government agencies explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution. According to reports from experts in digital forensics, the flaw is linked to a weakness of authentication in an application programming interface (API) for the Postal Services **Informed Visibility** program, designed to help enterprise customers to track their mail in real time. According to the investigators who revealed the security incident, the API in question was scheduled to accept any number of wildcard search parameters, which allowed any usps.com account holder to perform queries in the system to get details of accounts belonging to other users. In other words, an attacker may have obtained email addresses, usernames, user IDs, account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and postal information for up to 60 million users with account at usps.com. APIs are becoming a double-edged weapon when it comes to Internet-scale connectivity and B2B security. The APIs, when unsafe, break the premise of the connectivity they have helped to establish, says Setu Kulkarni, a [digital forensics](URL specialist at WhiteHat Security. **The Postal Service fixes the vulnerability almost a year later** The API authentication vulnerability also allowed any Postal Service user to request account changes for other users, for example, they could modify their email addresses, phone numbers, or other sensitive details. The worst part of the whole incident was the handling that the Postal Service gave to the disclosure of the vulnerability. Although it has not been confirmed, researchers are believed to have discovered the vulnerability and reported it responsibly to the Postal Service officials; however, the office ignored the warnings, leaving users data unprotected for almost 12 months, until a journalist contacted the Postal Service on behalf of the investigators. Subsequently, the Portal service corrected the problem (a task that only took them 48 hours), said journalist Brian Krebs. Although there is no evidence so far that someone has exploited the vulnerability, it is known that it remained present for almost a year, so the panorama doesnt seem so good, said Paul Bischoff, a digital rights activist. On the other hand, the Postal Service stated: So far we do not have information to confirm that the vulnerability has been exploited. The Postal Service continues to investigate the incident to ensure that any malicious user will be processed by the authorities."

According to reports of experts in digital forensics, [Uber](URL has been fined for an amount of $1.2M USD, amount established by the data regulatory authorities of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, accusing the company of inadequate data security policies, as well as for not properly reporting the data breach that the company suffered two years ago. The authorities argue that this incident, which the company took a year to report, exposed Uber drivers and users to an increased risk of cyber fraud. The incident compromised the personal information of over 50 million users and 3 million Uber drivers worldwide, including names, email addresses and phone numbers. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL in some cases attackers even leaked location data, access tokens and user passwords. The incident occurred in October 2016, but Uber kept it undisclosed until November 2017. The United Kingdom **Information Commissioner Office** (ICO), in charge of compliance with data protection laws in British territory, has fined Uber with 385k. The ICO mentioned that the incident occurred because of a series of flaws in Uber IT infrastructure, adding that about 3 million of Uber users in the UK were affected by the incident. The ICO research found that data breach was possible thanks to the credential stuffing technique, a process by which usernames and passwords are injected massively into a website until they match with an existing account. Uber uses Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (S3), a cloud-based storage service, where its information is protected. An attacker was able to access multiple Uber S3 buckets because the company IT team left the S3 access credentials in the code that was uploaded to GitHub, the popular code development and sharing platform. Uber S3 account accesses were in a plain text file stored on GitHub, the ICO mentioned. On the other hand, **Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens**, the regulatory authority on data protection in Netherlands, imposed Uber a fine of 600k for violating the Dutch information security law. The company was fined for not reporting the data breach within 72 hours after the discovery of the incident, the Dutch authorities reported. It is estimated that about 174k Dutch users were affected by data theft. Data breach occurred while Travis Kalanick served as Ubers CEO, but remained undisclosed until November 2017, after Dara Khosrowshahi emerged as CEO, who ordered a digital forensics investigation. In the end, it was learned that Uber had paid $100k USD to a young hacker from Florida for a bug report as part of its vulnerability bounty program. However, the authorities believe that the hacker had discovered the data breach, and the payment made by the company was a bribe to keep the incident a secret. The data breach occurred before the entry into force of the European Unions **General Data Protection Regulation** (GDPR), so Uber was sanctioned in accordance with the provisions of the United Kingdom Data Privacy Act, promulgated in 1998. Fines imposed in accordance with this law may not exceed $500k USD."

In addition, the company claims that since 2015 had stopped selling Superfish software with its equipment. While Lenovo has never been in agreement with the allegations contained in the collective lawsuit, the company is glad to finally close this case which has taken more than two years of legal proceedings. To date Lenovo is not aware of a single case in which a third party has been able to exploit a vulnerability to gain access to user communications, the company statement mentions. Back in 2015, Robert Graham, a specialist in [digital forensics](URL analyzed Superfish software, later recounting his findings: Superfish software can be considered malicious in many ways. It is designed to intercept any type of encrypted connection. However, it does so in a very poor way, leaving the system exposed to the NSA-style intelligence agencies or malicious hackers, who could spy on users private banking operations, Graham said. In 2017, Lenovo agreed with the Federal Trade Commission, Connecticut and 31 other states to pay $3.5M USD due to a similar controversy. The company was also committed to changing the way it sells its equipment. In addition, in a besides agreement, the company paid $3.5M USD to the State authorities."

Researchers from a cybersecurity firm published a proof of concept for this unauthorized command execution vulnerability, mentioning that the error persists in the Zoom messaging function; the vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-15715**, has been considered of critical gravity, and has a **CVSS** score of 3.0/9.9. This vulnerability could be exploited if certain scenarios are presented such as: * A malicious Zoom meeting participant * An attacker on the local access network (LAN) * A remote attacker on a wide area network (WAN) could theoretically use this vulnerability to hijack a Zoom meeting in progress Attackers could use this vulnerability to perform otherwise restricted operations at Zoom conferences, said David Wells, a digital forensics specialist. The vulnerability comes from an internal Zoom messaging pump flaw, a mechanism that this application uses to send and wait for messages. This means that a potential attacker, remotely and without authentication, could create and send a **User Datagram Protocol** (UDP) message, and would be interpreted as a reliable transmission Control protocol message used by the authorized Zoom servers. This attack is especially dangerous because it can be done by both the participants of a Zoom conference and a remote attacker capable of creating a counterfeit UDP package, because they can infiltrate without problems in an existing UDP session, find a Zoom conference underway and trigger the attack, the [digital forensics](URL expert mentioned. From that point, the malicious actor could perform various harmful operations, such as hijacking screen controllers, identity spoofing to send or receive messages addressed to other conference participants, or even expelling other participants from the conference. For example, in the proof of concept published by Wells, it was shown how a malicious participant could send UDP packets to take control of a display of the presenter to start his calculator. Exploiting such vulnerability can be extremely damaging and poses a serious risk to a companys reputation, says Wells. Even if a single of the more than 700,000 companies working with Zoom Software were presented, the impact would be significant. This kind of vulnerability is particularly detrimental to a company, as said by specialists in digital forensics. Companies like Cisco and Adobe have also experienced problems with this kind of computer errors in their videoconferencing systems. Just a few days ago, Cisco was correcting a series of flaws in its [WebEx](URL conferencing system that allowed remote code execution. For its part, Adobe recently launched an update patch that would correct a series of failures on its Adobe Connect platform."

This is not a minor recognition, even PewDiePie fans have designed a campaign known as Bro Army, designed to recruit friends and family members of the Swedish vlogger subscribers, in order to keep him at the top of the video platform. But this dispute has reached new and unthinkable levels. [Digital forensics](URL specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that some person or group hacked printers from around the world to print propaganda in favor of PewDiePie. Twitter users everywhere shared their experiences with the incident in the past few days. The message appeared unexpectedly in our printer. I think PewDiePie hacked our systems, mentioned the **Twitter** user DrMoxmo, attaching a photo of the message that appeared when using a printer. &amp;#x200B; URL According to specialists in digital forensics, the printers were, indeed, hacked, although it is not PewDiePie who is behind this incident. Through a Twitter account, identified as **TheHackerGiraffe**, the attacker or attackers mentioned some details about this incident: This is how the PewDiePie printer hack happened: * I was bored after playing Destiny for 4 hours in a row and decided I wanted to hack something. So I thought of any vulnerable protocol I could find in Shodan * While playing with [Shodan](URL it occurred to me that I could hack printers from around the world to printed anything * I was horrified to find over 800k vulnerable ports. I chose the first 50k printers I found running on port 9100 and downloaded the list of Shodan * After thinking what message I could print, it occurred to me that it would be best to print a message in support of PewDiePie After I left the script running, I did this Twitter account, other one on Reddit, and I waited for people to find me. According to reports of experts in digital forensics, the hacker used a tool called PRET, a printer exploit rootkit, which, according to GitHub, allows hackers to capture, manipulate, or print jobs to access file systems and device memory, with the possibility of damaging the hardware as well. The hacker claims that he did not act with any malicious purpose, but did so to raise awareness of printer users about how vulnerable these devices can be. People underestimate the ease with which a hacker could exploit these vulnerabilities; I could have stolen files, installed malware or even caused physical damage to any device. The worst thing is that downloading, creating and executing these scripts took me less than half an hour. Experts in digital forensics recommend applying some security measures to prevent this type of attack; properly configuring a firewall, changing the default password or even turning off your device when you do not use it can help you to stay safe from some attack vectors."
108,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Nearly 90% of routers contain vulnerable code,1,9nm2nx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9nm2nx/nearly_90_of_routers_contain_vulnerable_code/,2018-10-13 04:06:13," **Five out of six brand routers such as Linksys, NETGEAR, and D-Link, contain known open-source vulnerabilities** Experts in digital forensics report an exorbitant figure regarding to the use of domestic and organizational tasks [routers](URL since 83% of these devices contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited to deploy numerous cyberattacks. Of vulnerable routers, more than a quarter contain critical and high-risk vulnerabilities, according to a report published this week by the American Consumer Institute (ACI). The study examined 186 WiFi routers from 13 different manufacturers, including Linksys, Belkin, NETGEAR and D-Link, Market Leaders. If known security failures are not resolved, consumer devices are vulnerable to their data being compromised, resulting in malicious activity, identity theft, fraud, and espionage, say [digital forensics](URL specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Researchers believe open source libraries are one of the leading causes of security failures in router firmware. Hackers point to hardware parts as routers, because companies usually stop launching updates for their firmware. The limited release of update patches for routers is a systemic problem that affects most consumers and vendors. Vulnerability correction is partly in the hands of consumers who need to do know their situation and install firmware updates, says a section of the report. In addition, manufacturers often do not provide accessible ways for consumers to upgrade their devices firmware or, in the worst cases, companies come to consider creating security protocols on their devices as an unnecessary expense, at least until this generates undesirable consequences. This report by experts in digital forensics for the ACI suggests that router vendors create a lot of problems that consumers have to deliver to maintain the security of their devices. Sometimes, access to firmware upgrades requires consumers to pre-register their products with manufacturers, while other updates are not available online, and other times the older routers are not compatible at all with these protection measures. According to the report, of the 186 routers surveyed, only 17% were vulnerability-free. On average, each router contained 172 vulnerabilities, according to the experts in charge of the investigation. The report mentions that 7% of the vulnerabilities were classified as critical, according to the classification of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The report found that 21% of the routers vulnerabilities were rated as high-risk, 60% average risk, and 12% low-risk. Researchers believe that providers are failing to protect consumers and need to do a better job not just by patching their firmware, but by taking better security measures more stringent. We want these electronic devices to be free of security flaws, and we want user data to remain secure, cannot be corrupted, and of course cannot be distributed without the owners permission, the specialists mentioned."

A team of digital forensics experts recently discovered three vulnerabilities (a buffer overflow, a directory transversal, and a command-injection issue) on eight [Sony](URL Bravia smart TVs, one of which was rated as critical. The Sony Bravia Smart TV models affected include R5C, WD75, WD65, XE70, XF70, WE75, WE6 and WF6. The most serious vulnerability, identified as CVE-2018-16593, is a command-injection flaw residing in the Sony Photo Sharing Plus application that allows users to share multimedia content from their mobile devices through a Sony Smart TV. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL an attacker must share on the same wireless network as the Sony TV to trigger the vulnerability. This application handles file names incorrectly when the user loads a media file. An attacker can abuse this file name mishandling to execute arbitrary commands on the system, which can result in the complete remote execution of the code with root privileges, the investigators mention in their security report. The remaining vulnerabilities also affect Sonys Photo Sharing Plus application running on Sony Bravia. The buffer overflow (CVE-2018-16595) is a memory corruption vulnerability linked to the lack of disinfection of the users input, the experts mentioned. This is a memory corruption vulnerability resulting from insufficient user input size verification. With a sufficiently long HTTP POST request sent to the corresponding URL, the application will be blocked, the reminder continues. The third flaw is a directory transversal vulnerability tracked as CVE-2018-16594 that relates to how the Photo Sharing Plus application handles file names. The application handles file names incorrectly by receiving a users input file by loading a URL. An attacker can load an arbitrary file with a false filename that can then traverse the entire filesystem. According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, Sony has provided an update patch to solve vulnerabilities, corrections must be approved by the user on their Sony Bravia Smart TV devices. If your TV is set up to receive updates automatically when connected to the Internet, it should have been updated. This is the default setting for affected models, mentions the security notice published by Sony. To verify that your TV has been updated, visit the downloads section of your models product page. Click the firmware update link for details on how to verify the software version. If your TV has not yet been updated, follow the instructions to download and install the update, the company notice concludes."

When the company staff discovered the flaw last march, they decided not to disclose the problem publicly, as there were no signs of affected users, the company said in a statement at the beginning of the week. This decision could violate the new laws of California and Europe, specifically the paragraphs concerning the deadlines for revealing security incidents. In its statement, Google said that its office of privacy and data protection decided that the company was not obliged to report the security problem. Google looked at the type of data involved and it would not in any way directly compromise Google+ users, said Ben Smith, vice president of Google Engineering. Up to 438 applications may have been compromised, but Google reported that it had not found evidence that external developers were aware of the security flaw and there was no indication that user profiles were used incorrectly. According to specialists in digital forensics, the incident could attract more external research, and even mentioned the possibility that the United States Congress call to appear to Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google. Earlier this year, Facebook admitted that Cambridge Analytica, a British research organization that had worked for Trumps campaign, had unduly accessed personal information from up to 87 million Facebook users. Mark Zuckerberg, executive director of Facebook, spent two days testifying at US Congress hearings about that incident and other issues related to the privacy of its users. The decision to close Google+ is part of a comprehensive review of how much user information shares Google with third-party developers. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL Google is limiting the applications that can work with Gmail, the companys email service, and restricting the amount of data that developers can access through Android, the software for Google smartphones."

SpankChain is an Ethereum-based smart contact that uses Ethereum and a smart token called BOOTY to tip adult models during their online live shows. According to the security report published by SpankChain developers, the attack occurred around 6 PM last Saturday; the attacker would have stolen 165.38 units of Ethereum and immobilized more than 1.2k BOOTY tokens due to an error in his smart payment contract. At 6 PM on Saturday afternoon, an unknown attacker exhausted 165.38 Ethereum (about $38k USD) from our smart payment channel contract, which caused $4k USD in BOOTY tokens to remain immobilized, reports the SpankChain digital forensics teams announcement. Out of the Ethereum units and BOOTY tokens stolen/immobilized, 34.99 Ethereum (about $8k USD) and 1271.88 BOOTY tokens (about $9.3 USD in total), belong to the users, the remainder belongs to SpankChain. This attack was not evident until Sunday at 7 PM, which caused them to disconnect their camera service Spank.live. SpankChain plans to replace the $9.3k USD in Ethereum that were stolen from its users. They also plan to keep their webcam service offline while correcting bugs and updating to a new payment channel contract. **The attack was possible thanks to a reentry flaw** According to the announcement of the SpankChain digital forensics team, in the attack a reentry vulnerability was used to steal the cryptocurrency of the compromised site. A re-entry attack occurs when an attacker is able to repeatedly call a function in the smart contract before the previous functions finish its execution. This allows the attackers to repeatedly withdraw the cryptocurrency before the contract realizes that there is no balance. In other words, the attack capitalized a reentry error, much like the one used in the attack on The DAO, mention the operators of SpankChain. The attacker created a malicious contract masked as an ERC20 token, where the transfer function was executed multiple times to extract the virtual assets from the site. Reports indicate that SpankChain would have opted not to do a security audit in past months, as this would have worth between $30k and $50k USD, considering that the price was too high. This is further proof that there is no price too high to ensure the security of a site compared to the price you have to pay after a cyberattack."

The vulnerability is a memory overflow issue that is triggered when a user receives an incorrectly-formatted RTP package that is specially designed through a videocall request, resulting in corruption failure and causing the crash of the mobile application. Since the vulnerability affects the implementation of [WhatsApp](URL of RTP (real-time transport protocol), the flaw affects iOS and Android applications, but not the version of WhatsApp Web, because it is based on WebRTC to make video calls. The digital forensics specialist also unveiled a vulnerability proof of concept, in addition to the instructions for carrying out the attack. Although the proof of concept published by Silvanovich only causes damage to the memory, another investigator, Tavis Ormandy, affirms that the problem resides there. Answering a call from an attacker could completely compromise WhatsApp, the expert considers.In other words, hackers only need the victims phone number to fully compromise their WhatsApp account and spy on their conversations. Silvanovich reported on the vulnerability to the WhatsApp team in August of this year. The developers recognized and solved the problem for Android in September, while the solution for iOS came in recent days.If you have not yet updated your WhatsApp for any operating system, digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend installing the update as soon as possible. Just a couple of months ago, researchers also discovered a flaw in the way the mobile app of WhatsApp connects to WhatsApp Web, which allowed malicious users to intercept and modify the content of messages sent both in private and group conversations.

Exploiting this flaw would allow malicious users to hijack any installed application and access its contents. This vulnerability is due to incorrect verification by the system. Computers that operate with macOS do not run applications (user-installed software) without code signing. The system blocks executable files that do not have a valid signature. This is done by Apple to control the application environment, so uncertified applications cannot be easily distributed and updates will fail if signature checks are not performed correctly. For [digital forensics](URL experts, it seems that Apple performs checks for all installed applications. During this process, any executable file is flagged, then the code is signed and, if passed, the flag is deleted from the executable file. Deleting this flag will send a warning to the operating system to be labeled as reliable software. Once this process is complete, macOS will no longer verify the applications or run any more security checks. Hackers can easily abuse this control mechanism; all they need to do is replace the legitimate executable in an application pack with a fake one, specially crafted, the original file can be renamed as another file. The proof of concept of this attack shows that this leads to abusive behavior: the original application will start normally, but at the same time the malicious copy will run in the background. Previous security incidents that exploit this vulnerability involve broader code modifications, while this approach is easier to use. The potential abuse and exploitation of macOS devices can be carried out even by beginner hackers. The most troubling thing is that the digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security say that there is very little chance that this particular vulnerability will be solved, because it resides in the way this operating system works. At the moment, the short-term solution is for software developers to implement their own signature validation processes. Just a few days ago, Apple was handling with another flaw that allowed the leaking of personal information from computers working with macOS through its mobile device management service (MDM)."

This is done by Apple to control the application environment, so uncertified applications cannot be easily distributed and updates will fail if signature checks are not performed correctly. For [digital forensics](URL experts, it seems that Apple performs checks for all installed applications. During this process, any executable file is flagged, then the code is signed and, if passed, the flag is deleted from the executable file. Deleting this flag will send a warning to the operating system to be labeled as reliable software. Once this process is complete, macOS will no longer verify the applications or run any more security checks. Hackers can easily abuse this control mechanism; all they need to do is replace the legitimate executable in an application pack with a fake one, specially crafted, the original file can be renamed as another file. The proof of concept of this attack shows that this leads to abusive behavior: the original application will start normally, but at the same time the malicious copy will run in the background. Previous security incidents that exploit this vulnerability involve broader code modifications, while this approach is easier to use. The potential abuse and exploitation of macOS devices can be carried out even by beginner hackers. The most troubling thing is that the digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security say that there is very little chance that this particular vulnerability will be solved, because it resides in the way this operating system works. At the moment, the short-term solution is for software developers to implement their own signature validation processes. Just a few days ago, Apple was handling with another flaw that allowed the leaking of personal information from computers working with macOS through its mobile device management service (MDM)."

Later, another research revealed how hackers exploited Googles search results to distribute the Zeus Panda banking Trojan. Now, experts in digital forensics have identified unusual behavior in Googlebot servers, where malicious requests originate. This brings serious consequences because many vendors rely on [Googlebot](URL to such an extent that they allow it to influence their organizational security decisions. The remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2018-11776) identified in Apache Struts 2 in August of this year delivered JavaPayload through the URL; [digital forensics](URL experts noted that the campaign known as CroniX exploited this flaw to deploy cryptocurrency mining malware. The same malicious agent was being used to exploit the Googlebot service. The researchers noted that some of the offensive requests generated in the CroniX campaign actually originated on Googles servers. It should be noted that you have no choice but to trust Googlebot if you want your website to appear in the Google search results. Therefore, most providers simply rely on the legitimacy of traffic that comes through Googlebot servers. This implies that malicious requests that originated on Googlebots servers ignored some of the key security mechanisms without any authentication and may end up delivering malicious loads. If these IP addresses are automatically blocked by an organizations mitigation mechanism, Googlebot will be blocked and this would decrease the organizations ranking in Google search results. In other words, Googlebot follows each link on its site and follows the link on these pages to allow Google to add previously unknown pages to expand its search database. This method also allows Google to analyze new websites before making them available to users. This method involves sending a GET request to each URL containing the links. Requests generated by Googlebot are based on the links on which they have no control and such links are never validated. This method can easily be exploited by a hacker, deceiving Googlebot to send malicious requests to random victims; the attacker can add such links to a website and each of them will contain the destination address and the payload. When Googlebot identifies the malicious link, it follows it and sends a malicious GET request to the destination address, and the request will maintain the operating payload. The researchers verified the method by manipulating Googlebot to send malicious requests to a managed IP address using two servers, one for the attacker and another for the target. Digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend that providers verify their level of confidence related to third-party services to ensure that there are multiple levels of security, and as well as validate the organizations data. Google has been informed about the problem, it is expected that in the next few days the vulnerability will be solved."

A cybersecurity and digital forensics firm has begun to investigate the reasons behind this significant increase in attacks with cryptocurrency mining software, reporting that, during September this year, the most common malware were the crypto miners, being CoinHive the most used in its kind, just like last year. While Coinhive currently affects 19% of organizations worldwide, researchers also reported that the Dorkbot Trojan remained in second place with a 7% global impact. The report also noted a significant increase in Coinhive attacks against PCs. Also, the attackers used the Coinhive mining malware to target iPhone devices, which coincided with an increase in attacks against users of the Safari browser, used on Apple gadgets. Behind CoinHive and Dorkbot, in the third place in the attack index is Cryptoloot. The operators of both tools request to the sites where they operate a portion of the profits generated by the [cryptojacking](URL Cryptoloot demands a smaller percentage than CoinHive. Cryptocurrency mining continues to be a major threat to global organizations, said Maya Horowitz, a [digital forensics](URL specialist in charge of the investigation, in a press release. The most interesting thing weve noticed is the increase in attacks against iPhone devices and other gadgets that use the Safari browser over the last month. These attacks on Apple devices do not use new features, so we continue to investigate the possible reasons behind this behavior. As the investigators publish their conclusions, these kinds of attacks are a reminder that mobile devices are an element that is often overlooked on the attack surface of an organization, so it is essential that these devices are protected with a comprehensive threat-prevention solution to prevent them from being a weak link in the organizational structure. According to reports of specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the vulnerability known as Microsoft IIS WebDAV ScStoragePathFromUrl Buffer Overflow (**CVE-2017-7269**) has been the most exploited flaw against organizations around the world, with 48% of the attacks on companies in total during the first eight months of 2018."

The most serious vulnerability is probably the one registered as CVE-2018-0049, which could be exploited by an attacker to block the Junos OS kernel by sending specially designed MPLS packages. Juniper Networks reported that a single, specially-designed MPLS package could trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition, while sending more packages could crash the device. A NULL pointer dereferencing vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS would allow an attacker to block the devices kernel. A single package received by the victim will cause a [denial of service](URL (DoS) condition. The continuous reception of this malicious MPLS package, specifically designed to exploit the vulnerability, would cause a sustained DoS condition, mentioned in the security notice published by the companys digital forensics team. Until the time the security patches were released, no news were known about the exploitation of the flaw in the wild, anyway, Juniper is aware of a possible malicious network probe that may have caused this problem, the company reports. Another serious vulnerability that Juniper has corrected affected the NFX series devices could be exploited by malicious users to gain access to the system through the use of blank password accounts. The patches provided by the company no longer allow accounts with blank passwords. Juniper also provided fixes for several vulnerabilities that affect the NTP daemon. The company addressed several flaws in the RDP protocol, most of which could be exploited to cause a DoS condition. Someone could take advantage of two of these flaws to block the RPD protocol daemon and potentially allow remote code execution. By carefully examining the list of safety warnings on the Juniper site, there is also a solution to a high-risk vulnerability in the Junos Space Network Management platform and a DoS vulnerability in the SIP Application Layer Gateway (ALG) in Junos. This last problem could be exploited to block multiple processes. Junipers digital forensics experts also corrected a high-risk vulnerability in the RSH service that could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain root access to the affected devices. The company also corrected a dozen DoS and XSS flaws ranked as moderate risk."
118,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Vulnerability in Apple VoiceOver allows hackers access to user photos,1,9qfr60,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9qfr60/vulnerability_in_apple_voiceover_allows_hackers/,2018-10-23 04:03:41," **The bug can be exploited to access the photos stored on a users device, and its been found in iOS12** A digital forensics specialist has discovered a vulnerability in Apple iOSs VoiceOver feature that can be exploited by a malicious actor to gain access to the victims photos. The bug, a bypass of the lock screen made through the VoiceOver screen reader, depends on the attacker getting physical access to the selected device. Revealed by the expert in [digital forensics](URL in iOS, Jos Rodrguez, and later shown in a Youtube video, the attack chain begins when the attacker calls the victims phone. This can be made possible by asking Siri voice attendant to read the digit-to-digit phone number if the attacker does not have this information. Once a call has been made, the attacker must select Reply by SMS and then select the Personalize/Custom option. Phrases are irrelevant, so any word can be placed in this step, but it is crucial for the attacker to ask Siri to activate VoiceOver at this point of the attack. The camera icon should also be selected, and after this, the attacker must touch the screen twice while calling Siri through the side buttons at the same time. More than a single attempt may be required to trigger the vulnerability, but when successful, the screen of the attacked device will become black, which could be the result of a confusion or conflict in the operating system. The attacker can use this bug to access user interface elements, such as the image library, which should otherwise be restricted if the attacker does not know the victims access code when any interaction with the device is performed. Once the photo album has been accessed, it is possible to touch the photos twice to return to the call SMS response box and add the contents of the library to the message. These images can be stolen and sent to any other device controlled by the attacker. While the actual graphics for each image are hidden by the message box at this point, you can still access them and view them after adding them to the message. Rodriguezs report confirmed that the vulnerability is present in the newer models of IPhone running the latest version of the mobile operating system, IOS 12. According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, last September, the well-known security expert of Apple, Patrick Warder, revealed a zero-day vulnerability in Apple [Mojave](URL the same day of the launch of the update of the operating system that, if exploited, could result in the theft of the users contact information. Disclosure of this vulnerability binds to Wardes previous findings, such as the well-known macOS error that could lead to a total system compromise."
119,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Vulnerability in voting machines has not been corrected after 11 years,1,9qfsdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9qfsdp/vulnerability_in_voting_machines_has_not_been/,2018-10-23 04:07:16," **No measure has been taken to solve this flaw** We all prefer to think that the voting systems in our countries are efficient and that the votes counting are always accurate. Whether the vote is issued through a paper ballot or even electronically, there must be some confidence measure involved in the process. But what would happen if we could no longer have confidence in the way in which peoples votes are counted? Would that change the way we see the whole process? It is normal to think that the government would do anything as long as these electoral processes are carried out without security drawbacks. The worrying thing is that apparently thats not the case. It turns out that experts in digital forensics have reported the existence of a serious vulnerability affecting [voting machines](URL even worse, its existence was reported 11 years ago and nothing has yet been done to correct it. The problem affects the M650 high-speed ballot scanner, which is made by Election Systems &amp; Software and is used in 23 out of the 50 American states. The disturbing findings were summarized by digital forensics specialists in the most recent DEF CON in Las Vegas. These machines can be hacked with an infected removable Zip drive that could transmit malware. The machines also have a built-in network port that can also be used to transmit an infection. According to researchers, the M650 scanner counts ballots for entire counties, which means that if the device is compromised, the attack could easily impact an election. This leads us to ask why no one has done anything to fix this flaw if it was reported since 2007. **M650 is not the only security concern** In many ways, this machine, which scans about 3000 ballots per minute, is a symbol of what is considered an obsolete electoral infrastructure. For many reasons, the technology used to count the votes has not kept pace with current cybersecurity demands. Election Systems &amp; Software, manufacturer of the M650, believes that its security protections are strong enough for hacking these devices to be very difficult, especially in a real world environment. Being questioned about why this vulnerability has not been corrected after so long, the company did not make any statement, although they recently stopped announcing this team on their website. Still, [digital forensics](URL experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that these types of problems will not disappear soon, because this vulnerability is not the only or the most serious security problem of the current electronic voting infrastructure. In the meantime, the voters will be compromised until someone does something. Touchscreen voting machines have been shown to be vulnerable previously, and now the ballot scanning machines seem to be vulnerable too."
120,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Three critical vulnerabilities can be chained to take full control of D-Link routers,1,9r16zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9r16zi/three_critical_vulnerabilities_can_be_chained_to/,2018-10-25 03:27:38," **Researchers from the Silesian University of Technology in Poland discovered several flaws that could be exploited to take control over some models of D-Link routers** A group of [digital forensics](URL investigators from the Silesian University of Technology in Poland reported the founding of three vulnerabilities in some [D-Link](URL router models that could be chained to take full control over the devices. The reported flaws, and their respective identification codes, are a directory traversal (CVE-2018-10822), a password stored in plaintext flaw (CVE-2018-10824), and a Shell command injection vulnerability (CVE-2018-10823). We found multiple vulnerabilities on the httpd server of the D-Link router. These vulnerabilities are present in multiple router models of the D-Link company. The three vulnerabilities taken together would allow someone to take full control over the router, including code execution, is read in the security notice of the experts in digital forensics. Vulnerabilities reside on the httpd server of some D-Link routers, including models DWR-116, DWR-111, DIR-140L, DIR-640L, DWR-512, DWR-712, DWR-912, and DWR-921. Researchers found a directory traversal vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-10822, which could be exploited by remote attackers to read arbitrary files using an HTTP request. The problem was initially reported to D-Link with the key CVE-2017-6190, but the company did not correctly fix the vulnerability. This error could be exploited to access the file that stores the device administrator password in text format, without encryption. The password storage in plaintext flaw was tracked as CVE-2018-10824. To avoid any kind of abuse, experts did not disclose the route of the files on the router. The investigators also reported on another bug, traced as CVE-2018-10823, which could be exploited by an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands and take control of the device. The team of researchers reported the vulnerabilities to D-Link last May, but the vendor has not yet released updates to correct them, so the experts proceeded to publicly disclose the security issues. D-Link is in process to publish the patches and fixes these bugs; in the meantime, users could ensure that their devices are not accessible via online tools such as Shodan as a basic security measure. Again, this company is facing serious security issues; recently a group of hackers stole code signature certificates from the manufacturer of router and D-Link cameras, employing them to spread a malware to steal passwords, as reported by specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security last July."
121,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Vulnerabilities in telepresence robots allow access to image and video,1,9rbuyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9rbuyx/vulnerabilities_in_telepresence_robots_allow/,2018-10-26 03:29:23," **The manufacturer has solved two of the five reported errors; three patches are in the process of being released** Telepresence robots manufactured by the company Vecna Technologies can be hacked using a set of five vulnerabilities, as reported by experts in [digital forensics](URL the International Institute of Cyber Security. Vulnerabilities can be combined to allow an attacker full control over one of these devices, which gives the hacker the ability to alter the firmware, steal chat records, images or even access video live feeds. Vecna has already launched security updates for two of the five [vulnerabilities](URL and is in the process of addressing the remaining three errors. Vulnerabilities have been reported as: * CVE-2018-8858: Credentials protection deficiencies  patch pending * CVE-2018-17931: Inadequate access control (USB)  patch pending * CVE-2018-17933: Incorrect authorization (XMPP client)  patch pending * CVE-2018-8860: Confidential information leaking  firmware updated * CVE-2018-8866: Remote Code Execution  solved The flaws were discovered earlier this year by Dan Regalado, a cybersecurity and digital forensics specialist. Vulnerabilities affect Vecna VGo Celia, a telepresence robot that can be deployed in some certain space but controlled from a remote location. Telepresence robots are equipped with a microphone and a video camera and are placed on mobile platforms. Its use is very common in hospitals to allow doctors to remotely monitor patients, in schools, to allow sick children to attend classes or for teachers to teach remotely, or in factories to allow technical inspections for authorized personnel. Because the robot performs firmware updates via HTTP, an attacker with access to the same network segment where the robot is connected can intercept the update, said the digital forensics expert in his report on the subject. An attacker could infect the firmware with malicious code or analyze it for vulnerabilities that could be exploited later. Regalado discovered that the developers of Vecna had left an active developer tool in the robot that renders it vulnerable to a lot of attacks. This tool, a CGI script, allowed the attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the device. The expert says the attacker can use this vulnerability to access the internal functions of the robot, but could also use the infected robot to attack other devices on an organizations internal network. Vecna has already solved the vulnerabilities CVE-2018-8860 and CVE-2018-8866, but Regalado says that there is another equally serious error. It says that the CVE-2018-17931 error allows an attacker to connect a USB drive in a robot and its firmware will run a file hosted on the USB drive (/config/startup.script) with root privileges, which gives the attacker the opportunity to hijack the device. Regalado also discovered CVE-2018-8858. This vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve the WiFi passwords used by the robot to connect to an organizations internal network. CVE-2018-17933, the last of the three unsolved vulnerabilities, resides in the XMPP client, which is the heart of the robot firmware, which functions as a tunnel between the remote user and the internal functions of the robot."

People worry about thinking that their smart speakers or security systems in their homes are compromised, because compromising any of these services could cause serious consequences for anyone. However, the consequences could be much worse if hackers focus their efforts on attacking medical infrastructure. Medical devices are widely used; in addition, this market shows expected growth of 3% annual, at least until 2022. Specialists in ethical hacking and digital forensics have contacted the manufacturers of these devices after exposing the vulnerabilities in their products. Historically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have remained neutral about the role these professionals should play in exposing the weak points of technology in the health sector. But this is changing as the agency reports that it is collaborating with ethical hackers and using the research that professionals develop to design their policies. A recent example is a pacemaker manufactured by Medtronic. Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts, two cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL investigators, found a vulnerability that would allow a hacker to change the device settings remotely, potentially causing serious consequences. The FDA and Medtronic issued safety alerts on pacemakers. In addition, Medtronic stopped issuing updates for these devices until an effective way to fix the problem was found. However, the company stated that it was not possible to manipulate the devices remotely. It also said that the vulnerability was under control and that it was not a threat to the patient. The two ethical hackers continued to work with Medtronic for months, and then presented their research to the FDA, which continued with their own analysis. The FDA said its research coincided with that of cybersecurity experts, forcing Medtronic to admit that vulnerability could affect patients if it was not resolved. Such progress emphasizes why the FDAs collaboration with ethical hackers could be as beneficial to both the technological community and consumers. In short, the researchers tried for months to get the manufacturer to take their research seriously, without success. It was the FDAs intervention which helped the company recognizes the severity of the incident. If such partnerships continue to occur, patients could access safer products, as ethical hackers gain greater recognition for their research. **Thinking ahead** Apparently this will not be the only case of collaboration between the FDA and ethical hackers. According to Jeff Shuren, an FDA official, there is awareness of the crucial role that cybersecurity researchers play in monitoring medical devices security. Shuren also noted that the FDA encourages manufacturers to rely on ethical hackers, especially if companies do not have an area of specialists in the field to correct possible failures in their products before they are released to market. According to reports from the International Institute of Cyber Security, some other ways to manipulate medical devices include altering their functioning or reporting incorrect readings that could influence a patients treatment or diagnosis. Hackers could also make diagnostic equipment, like magnetic resonance machines, collapse."
123,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,A jQuery plugin has been exploitable for 8 years,1,9rmi7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9rmi7c/a_jquery_plugin_has_been_exploitable_for_8_years/,2018-10-27 03:57:04," **Different ways of exploiting the flaw have been widely spread too** Out of the thousands of plugins for the [jQuery](URL framework, one of the most popular has hosted for at least three years an oversight in the code that remained hidden for the cybersecurity and digital forensics community, despite the availability of tutorials explaining how it could be exploited. The vulnerability affects the jQuery File Upload widget, widely used, and allows an attacker to load arbitrary files on web servers, including shell commands to send commands. Security Update enabled vulnerability 8 years ago Larry Cashdollar, a digital forensics expert, found the flaw by analyzing the widgets code and was able to load a web shell and execute commands on a test server that he set up. Along with Sebastian Tschan, the plugin developer, the investigator discovered that the flaw was caused by a change introduced in Apache 2.3.9, which deactivated by default the .htaccess files that stored the security settings related to the folder. Unless the administrator had enabled it manually, the .htaccess files were omitted. One reason for this was to protect the administrator system configuration by preventing users from customizing security settings in individual folders. Another reason is to improve performance, because the server no longer had to check the .htaccess file when accessing a directory. After Apache 2.3.9., plugins that use .htaccess files to impose access restrictions no longer benefit from the custom folder access security settings. This was also the case with jQuery File Upload, which adds files to a root directory. Tracked as CVE-2018-9206, the encoding vulnerability is no longer present in the latest version of jQuery File Upload. [Digital forensics](URL experts changed the code to allow only the types of GIF, JPG, JPEG, and PNG image files by default. Tschan provided instructions on how to enable more content without running security risks. **The flaw spread to other projects** The popularity of jQuery File Upload provoked thousands of derivative projects; many of them used the defective code. There are over 7.8k variations at this time, and Cashdollar says there are cases where vulnerabilities are present, even if the original code was modified to meet custom needs. The investigator came to this conclusion after reviewing some of the forks, where he noticed three common variations. Later he created a proof of concept of the exploit trying to find one of the differences and to load a PHP shell. Ive done some tests with the 1000 branches of the original code and it seems that only 36 were vulnerability-free. I found that they only needed a small modification in the exploit to work in most cases, says Cashdollar. jQuery File Upload has remained vulnerable since the launch of Apache 2.3.9., eight years ago. On the other hand, this flaw did not go unnoticed all this time; moreover, the method to exploit it has been widely disseminated for at least three years. A 2015 video, even available on Youtube, details the instructions on how to find vulnerable websites and how to modify them. More recent vulnerability videos are also available."
124,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Zero-day vulnerability in Windows allows privileges escalation,1,9sq2yv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9sq2yv/zeroday_vulnerability_in_windows_allows/,2018-10-31 04:29:45," **The flaw, still unpatched, allows an attacker to delete any type of file on a machine, including system data** A cybersecurity and digital forensics researcher has published a proof-of-concept for a zero-day vulnerability in Windows functional on fully patched [Windows 10](URL Exploiting the vulnerability would allow an attacker to delete any type of file on the victims computer, including system data. The bug (not yet assigned CVE code, as it has just been discovered) is a privilege escalation zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Data Sharing Services (dssvc. dll). This is a local service that runs as a LocalSystem account with broad privileges, and allows data to be distributed between applications. According to the expert who published the proof of concept, the error allows malicious users to delete application libraries (ddl files), which means that the affected applications will look for their libraries in other places. If an application finds its way to a user written location, it gives the attacker the opportunity to load their own malicious library, putting the information stored on the machine at risk. Mitja Kolsek, a specialist in digital forensics, detailed the potential of this vulnerability. Even a user with few privileges can make a request to this service for an undocumented function, and this function verifies whether the requesting user has permissions to create a file in a location, he explained. To do so, overrides the user who requests it, try to create an empty file, remember if the creation of the file was successful and then delete it. Therefore, vulnerability can open the door to a series of malicious activities. This could be exploited to facilitate lateral movement within an organization or even for potentially destructive purposes, such as removing key system files, making a system inoperable, said Tom Parsons, an expert on cybersecurity. In the proof of concept, a program called Deletebug.exe Removes a file from the system of the attacked computer, which means that a user can no longer restart it. Therefore, the machine becomes completely inoperable. What the proof of concept does, in simple terms, is that it calls the function in Data Sharing Service, which tells to perform an operation in the pci.sys file in a temporary folder and expect this file to be created. Then, it quickly traces that file to pci.sys in the system folder (where the user could not delete it), explained Kolsec. As a result, the system file is deleted. Will Dormann, analyst of vulnerabilities in CERT/CC, in conjunction with Mitja Kolsec, were able to confirm the presence of the vulnerability and then exploit it on Windows 10 machines that had all the patches and updates available. Through Twitter, Dormann added that Data Sharing Service does not appear to be present in Windows 8.1 and earlier systems. [Digital forensics](URL experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security were able to confirm that the vulnerability only works on Windows 10 and Server 2016 and 2019. In addition, they report that the bug allows non admin users to remove any files by abusing a new Windows service that does not verify any previously granted permission. Although Microsoft has not yet issued any statement regarding this vulnerability, a micropatch from the 0Patch organization has proven to be effective in successfully blocking the vulnerability, generating a ACCES DENIED message against any attempt to user suplantation. A zero-day vulnerability was also discovered last September in Microsoft Task Scehduler. The company patched up the vulnerability a few days later."

126,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,The Pentagon expands the scope of its vulnerability bounty program,1,9t1b81,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9t1b81/the_pentagon_expands_the_scope_of_its/,2018-11-01 05:11:53," **The program will now consider physical systems flaws reports** Cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that the [Department of Defense](URL is in the process of expanding its vulnerability bounty program, known as Hack the Pentagon, to include its hardware assets, leveraging the platforms Synack, HackerOne and Bugcrowd to attract more personalities to this program. The news has been released two weeks after the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report detailing cybersecurity issues in some of the Defense Departments weapons systems. A package that includes a three-year contract and an indefinite amount that spans the three bug reporting organizations will attract more hackers to verify the Department of Defense websites, hardware, and physical systems. Finding innovative ways to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen security has never been more important, said Chris Lynch, a [digital forensics](URL expert from the Department of Defense, in a statement. When our adversaries carry out malicious attacks, they do not stop and do not fail to explore all their possibilities. The expansion of our security and collaborative work allows us to build a deeper bank of technological talent and offer more diverse perspectives to protect and defend our assets. We are excited to see that the program continues to grow and generates benefits for the entire Department. Since the start of the Hack the Pentagon program in 2016, cybersecurity and digital forensics experts who have participated in it have reported more than 5k code vulnerabilities, and have executed six public demonstrations, including Hack the Marine Corps the most recent Department of Defense cybersecurity event, last August. Other hacking sessions have focused on the Air Force systems, the Army and the Defense Travel Service. In the current environment, joint security work is critical because all systems are vulnerable and there is a massive shortage of resources trained to address these incidents, said Ashish Gupta, CEO and president of Bugcrowd, on his personal blog. While we cannot control the actions of our adversaries, we can control our most vulnerable points. But we can only do so if we know our systems well enough, he mentioned. In accordance with the contract, the government expects companies to execute at least eight limited-time samples and five continuous samples during the first year of the contract. Each program will last between three months and a full year. The amounts offered by the program have not been disclosed. It may not be surprising that the Pentagon is expanding its approach to include physical systems. The news of this expansion occurs shortly after the GAO described the Department of Defense as a unit that is just beginning to deal with the scale of vulnerabilities in its offensive military team. The GAO reported that in the tests applied to the major weapon systems in development, the evaluators were able to take control of the systems with relative ease and to operate largely without being detected. The departments weapons are more computer-operated than ever, so its not surprising that there are more attack vectors, the GAO report mentions. However, until relatively recently, the Department of Defense had not prioritized the work of cybersecurity. For digital forensics experts, this news is a big step in the right direction. The Pentagon has made significant progress in this area in recent years, said Jim OGorman, an expert in cybersecurity. To continue this positive drive, they must continue to emphasize the importance of testing and invest in increased training to develop the skills of their security teams."
127,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Multiple Linux distributions affected by new vulnerability,1,9tbisq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9tbisq/multiple_linux_distributions_affected_by_new/,2018-11-02 04:29:25," **Vulnerability would allow privilege escalation and malicious code execution** A digital forensics investigator discovered a critical vulnerability in the X.Org server package that affects OpenBSD and most [Linux](URL distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat, and Fedora. X.Org X Server is a popular X11 system open source implementation that provides a graphical environment for a wider range of hardware platforms and operating systems. According to reports of specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this serves as an intermediary between the applications between clients and users to manage the graphical screens. According to a publication by engineer Narendra Shinde, Xorg Server does not correctly handle and validate arguments for at least two command-line parameters, allowing a user with limited privileges to execute malicious code and overwrite any file, including files that are managed by users with high privileges on the system. The vulnerability, tracked with the codename **CVE-2018-14665**, was introduced in the X.Org Server 1.19.0 package and remained undetected for nearly two years, and could have been exploited by a local attacker in the terminal or by SSH to elevate their privileges in the system selected for the attack. According to the report published by Shinde, the two vulnerable parameters in question are: * **modulepath**: To set a directory path to search for X Server modules * **logfile**: To set up a new log file for the Xorg server, instead of using the default log file found in/var/log/Xorg.n.log on most platforms In a security notice, Xorg mentioned: When the X server is run with elevated privileges, the modulepath argument can be used to specify an unsafe path to the modules to be loaded on the X server, allowing you to execute unprivileged code in the privileged process. On the other hand, a cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL firm mentioned: An incorrect permission check for the modulepath and logfile options when the Xorg X server is launched allows unprivileged users the ability to log on to the system at through the physical console to scale their privileges and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Security investigator Matthew Hickey shared by Twitter a proof of concept of exploitation code of this vulnerability, mentioning that an attacker can literally take care of the affected systems with 3 commands or less. The X.Org Foundation has now launched the 1.20.3 version of the X.Org server with security patches to fix the problem. Popular Linux distributions like OpenBSD, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat and Fedora have posted the corresponding alerts confirming the presence of the problem and mentioning that they are already working on the release of the update patches for each distribution."

According to the investigators, producing a document that delivers the malicious payload is pretty easy. According to digital forensics experts, to carry out this attack, an attacker must first create a Word document, fill it with the most appropriate content for their purposes, then use Insert  Online video option, add a YouTube video to the document and save the file. The saved file must be unpacked, either with a specific tool or by changing the .docx extension to a .zip extension and unzipping it. These actions allow the attacker to access an XML file named document.xml in the Word folder, open it and edit it. Instead of the YouTube iframe code for the video (included after the embeddedHtml parameter), the attacker can choose to put a malicious HTML or JavaScript code, and then save the changes, update the package.docx and find a way to deliver the file to the victim and get them to open the file and click on the built-in video to access its content. This interaction with the video will activate the download of the built-in executable file when the victim opens the Internet Explorer Download Manager. A window will appear asking the attack victim whether to run or save the file, but they will not be warned about the possible dangers of doing so. For their bad fortune, many users do not think twice before clicking, approving the execution of malicious load. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL Attackers could use this feature for malicious purposes such as phishing, as the document will show the attached video with a link to YouTube, while disguise a hidden HTML/JavaScript code that will run on background and could lead to a subsequent malicious code execution scenario. **So, what do users can do?** Experts claim this incident should be considered as a vulnerability with the potential to affect all users with Office 2016 and earlier versions of the productivity suite. Microsoft has already been notified of the vulnerability, but the enterprise has reported that for now they do not plan to do anything about it because the software is correctly interpreting the HTML as it is designed. But if the feature begins to become more widely abused, the company might end up launching some update patch. According to reports of specialists in digital forensics, a similar situation occurred last year when, after a considerable increase in the malware campaigns that abused the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) function in Word; Microsoft initially said it was a function, not a vulnerability, and simply offered risk mitigation tips to an attack scenario, but eventually ended up disabling DDE by default to stop the rise of function abuses."

The error in the Windows API broadFileSystemAccess could have given a malicious developer of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) access to all documents, photos, downloads and files of a user stored in OneDrive. The incident was detected by digital forensics expert Sbastien Lachance, who created a business application that collapsed suddenly in the October 2018 Windows 10 update, also known as Build 1809; this version of the update is currently waiting for Microsoft to complete data-loss bug correction tests. Regularly, UWP applications are restricted to certain folder locations, but developers can also request access to other locations, provided the user grants permission to the application. As Microsoft points out, the broadFileSystemAccess API provides access to all the files a user has access to. Microsoft promoted the role as a way for developers to make their UWP applications easier to use. This is a restricted capacity. In the first use, the system will ask the user to allow access. The access can be configured in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; File system, explains Microsoft. If you send an application to the store declaring this capability, you will need to provide additional descriptions of why your application requires this capability and how you intend to use it. The problem is that, until version 1809, users did not receive the permission request and the API could be used to access the entire file system. According to Lachance, the dialogue is intended to be shown to a user in the first use of the application. Microsoft recognized that this is a privacy issue and therefore disables the value of the wide-access file system. If users are concerned that an installed application has obtained access to a wider file margin than the default, users can limit that access in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; file. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL developers who previously used the API can also find that their UWP applications are now blocked when users change to version 1809."
130,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Tips to avoid computer fraud,1,9uqb0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9uqb0t/tips_to_avoid_computer_fraud/,2018-11-07 04:23:35," **Different ways to anticipate possible fraud scenarios** Several types of fraud are inevitable for most business; this is a reality that many organizations have refused to admit. The truth is those malicious actors, whether extern or members of the organization are always lurking around the critical systems of a company, and whenever they have the slightest chance to exploit any vulnerability or bypass security systems, they will do so. The various types of fraud persist, and frankly, it is not realistic to believe that companies can take measures that eradicate it definitively. But combating fraud does not have to be an unproductive task. Cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security bring you three useful tips to help companies fight fraud, specifically cyber fraud: **Think like a malicious actor** Antifraud systems may be effective, but they will not stop a criminal. The main challenge is to anticipate the opponents next move. To be able to get into an adversarys head, cybersecurity and digital forensics professionals should consider what motivates malicious hackers and what their goals might be in the organization. Threat actors are always looking for similar things: payment card data, personal identifying information, log in credentials, and other types of data and sensitive personal information. It is also necessary to consider the methods that scammers use to hinder existing controls to access an organizations systems. Two-factor authentication (2FA) can protect payment card data but what about other forms of electronic payment such as gift cards? Generally, this type of electronic assets does not have antifraud protection such as bank cards, which makes them an easy target for the cybercriminals. Research by specialists in [digital forensics](URL conclude that, in recent years, the number of illicit transactions related to electronic assets and gift cards has been increasing. Thinking like a fraud actor means considering all the options available to an attacker and admitting that certain systems or processes may have deficiencies. Identifying any weakness in existing antifraud programs can help companies to be better prepared for the worst of scenarios. **Monitor criminal forums in deep and dark web** Thinking like a criminal is just a part of the strategy. To anticipate a possible cyber fraud accurately, it is important to have an idea of the issues that are trendy among the [cybercrime](URL community. Not every organization considers this scenario, but it is important to have trusted people who are aware of todays deep and dark web. Some forums of deep and dark web focus on fraud, and in these forums, certain trends arise. For example, discussions related to the weak antifraud controls of online payment systems eventually manifested themselves empirically in more payment card frauds. The monitoring of deep and dark web can be one of the main sources of information on the new tactics and schemes of fraud used. But since access to these challenging and risky online communities, it is necessary for organizations to work with experts on the subject, avoiding security risks due to the nature of the information and the content that is handled in deep and dark web. **Determine possible links** Many experts in digital forensics have linked different types of fraud with certain geographic regions, forcing companies to make a great effort to better understand new schemes and tactics of fraud. This helps to establish causal relationships between the linguistic or cultural characteristics of a particular region with a certain type of specific fraud. But in recent years, new communities of cybercriminals have emerged rapidly in many more regions. Latin America is one of those examples. While scammers in Latin America were considered unsophisticated, disorganized, and unlikely to represent a real threat, these communities have evolved substantially. Many companies that previously had no reason to monitor the cybercriminals in this region of the world now strive to understand and combat the threats caused by scammers in Latin America. As threats and indicators can vary substantially in different regions and communities, monitoring these variations and new developments is a necessity for companies and anti-fraud teams."
131,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Two zero-day vulnerabilities expose millions of access points,1,9vc4fc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9vc4fc/two_zeroday_vulnerabilities_expose_millions_of/,2018-11-09 04:42:42," **The flaw, known as BleedingBit, affects wireless networks used in a large percentage of companies worldwide** Two zero-day vulnerabilities present in the low-energy Bluetooth chips manufactured by Texas Instruments (and used in millions of wireless access points) expose corporate networks where they are used to silent and dangerous attacks, as reported by [digital forensics](URL specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security. According to reports, attackers could exploit vulnerabilities simply by approaching a sufficient distance (between 100 and 300 feet away from vulnerable devices). A compromised access point could allow an attacker to take control of it, capture all traffic, and then use the compromised device as an access path for further internal attacks. The vulnerability affects Hewlett-Packards Aruba Enterprise and Ciscos Meraki [WiFi access points](URL which represent a large percentage of the hardware used in corporations, according to researchers from a cybersecurity and digital forensics firm. The two flaws were discovered at the beginning of the year and publicly disclosed in recent days. An unauthenticated user can deploy devastating attacks on enterprise networks without being detected from a location near vulnerable devices, such as the company lobby, for example, said Ben Seri, one of the digital forensics specialists in charge of the investigation. Texas Instruments released the update patches for the vulnerable hardware last Thursday. It is expected that Cisco launches patches for three wireless access points from the Aironet series (1542 AP, 1815 AP, 4800 ap), along with patches for their Cisco Meraki series access points (MR33, MR30H, MR74, MR53E), in upcoming days. On the other hand, updating patches for the access points Aruba 3xx and IAP-3xx t have already been launched. **About vulnerabilities** The first vulnerability (CVE-2018-16986) is linked to the Texas Instrument cc2640/50 chips used in Cisco and Cisco Meraki access points. This vulnerability is a remote code execution flaw on the BLE chip and can be exploited by an attacker from a nearby location. First, the attacker sends multiple benign streaming messages, known as advertising packages, which will be stored in the vulnerable chips memory on the selected device, the experts mentioned. Next, the attacker sends the overflow package, which is a slightly modified standard advertising package: a specific bit in its heading on instead of off. This bit causes the chip to allocate package information to a much larger space than it really needs, triggering a memory overflow. The filtered memory is exploited by the attackers to ease the execution of malicious code on the chip. A backdoor is opened and the attacker can use it to control the chip wirelessly. From there, hackers can manipulate the main processor of the wireless access point and control it locally and then remotely. The use of Texas Instrument chips is so common that an attacker could enter the lobby of any company, search for the available WiFi networks and start the attack, said Nadir Izrael, an expert in cybersecurity and digital forensics. The second vulnerability (CVE-2018-7080) was discovered in the Texas Instrument air firmware download feature used in the Aruba WiFi Access Point Series 300 that also uses the chip BLE. This vulnerability is technically a backdoor on the BLE chips that was designed as a development tool, but is active at these access points according to the experts. It allows an attacker to access and install a completely new and different version of the firmware, rewriting the operating system of the device."

Safety warnings for this security issue have already been published by Schneider Electric and the Industrial Control Systems Computer Emergency Response Team (ICS CERT). The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-7789 and described as a problem related to inadequate verification of unusual or exceptional conditions, can be exploited by a hacker to remotely restart the M221 controllers. According to Schneider Electric, all M221 controllers that run firmware versions prior to 1.6.2.0, which include a patch for the security issue, could be affected. The ethical hacking specialist mentioned that while Schneider responded to the vulnerability in a highly professional manner, he believes that the company has not considered the severity of the vulnerability in a fair measure, since Schneider and ICS CERT assigned the vulnerability a 4.8 score in the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), which places this problem in the medium severity category. In general, a security issue is assessed from an IT perspective, which considers the impact of the vulnerability according to its potential to compromise sensitive information. This, of course, is important, though less relevant to an operational technology area, so the vulnerability should have received a higher score, the expert mentioned. This vulnerability could have caused the PLC disruption, to recover from such a problem a specialist technician is required to perform an energy reboot. The CVSS score of this flaw was also reduced because the attack complexity was described as high. According to ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, to be exploited, the attacker should be familiar with Schneider Electric proprietary protocols, which hinders the deployment of the attack. Although it may be complex for a novice hacker to exploit this vulnerability, it would not be difficult for more experienced hackers to take advantage of this flaw, mentioned Kfir. Other vulnerabilities in the M221 drivers Different notices published in the last days by ICS-CERT and Schneider Electric disclosed three other vulnerabilities discovered in the M221 drivers. These security holes, all classified as high severity, can be exploited to load the original PLC program and decode the device password using a rainbow table. These vulnerabilities have also been managed by Schneider Electric with the release of the firmware version 1.6.2.0."

Software vulnerabilities are the core of penetration testing, so for the companies ethical hacking teams looking to optimize their vulnerability management efforts based on exploits, omissions and actual security holes, this report provides ideas and advices taken from practical experiences. According to this report, you can see a significant increase in the rate of software vulnerabilities that are being exploited to be able to control a critical network resource. Todays environments defy how we analyze and manage vulnerabilities. With expanding attack surfaces that include physical and virtual environments, complex web applications that change frequently, and the avalanche of alerts that all this produces, its no wonder that vulnerabilities continue to accumulate. Moreover, as code and systems become more complex and more interconnected, the probability of introducing vulnerabilities into a network environment becomes inevitable. Experts in ethical hacking mention that when new vulnerabilities are exploited, the attacker will bypass the security controls on a system. This can lead to the leaking of sensitive information, privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary code, among many other types of cyberattack. Of a total of 268 penetration tests performed, the most common vulnerabilities found were: SMBRelay (to deploy Man-in-the-Middle attacks) Cross-Site scripting (XSS) Clickjacking Escalation of local privileges SQL Injection Identify vulnerabilities in a modern environment Malicious hackers operate according to the activity of experts in ethical hacking; at the time when the vulnerability is revealed, the hunt begins, as malicious hackers know that many organizations cannot keep up with them. This means that, as ethical hackers, not only do we need the ability to detect vulnerabilities quickly, but we also need to patch them as soon as possible. Knowing this, the monthly vulnerability scan is no longer enough, taking into account that environments change steadily. The more complex an environment is, the more difficult it will be to detect vulnerabilities with conventional techniques, which is why lots of organizations look for ethical hacking specialists solutions to analyze expansive and constantly changing environments. Prioritize critical vulnerabilities Finding a new vulnerability is the first step, knowing which one to prioritize the next. Thats why ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security agree that pentesters should work with tools not only to detect the present vulnerabilities, but also to prioritize these vulnerabilities depending on which are the biggest threats to an organization at any given time. If you have wide visibility on an environment, you can prioritize what vulnerabilities to address based on actual threat data and even automate some of the recovery steps. In compensation, vulnerabilities can be patched much faster, reducing the timeframe of an attacker and fortifying the security of organizations."

According to reports of ethical hacking specialists, a well-known malicious actor has deployed a great cryptocurrency mining campaign using the remote code execution vulnerability present in Apache Struts 2 recently disclosed. In this campaign, the attacker uses a persistent and stealthy malware called CroniX, the malware name comes from the fact that it uses the Cron tool for persistence and Xhide to launch executables with fake process names. The vulnerability of Apache Struts 2 (CVE-2018-11776) was revealed a couple of weeks ago. Specialists in ethical hacking have warned that this has the potential to provoke even more havoc than last years Equifax data breach, also caused by Apache Struts 2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638). The new campaign uses one of the proof-of-concept exploits that were published on GitHub2 and Twitter a few days after the vulnerability was publicly disclosed. Attackers use it to obtain remote code execution capabilities that are not authenticated on specific Linux machines in order to install a Monero mining script. As with many other Apache struts 2 vulnerabilities, CVE-2018-11776 allows attackers to inject object graphic navigation language expressions (OGNL), which may contain malicious Java code. This time, the injection point is within the URL, the attacker sends a single HTTP request while injecting the OGNL expression that, once evaluated, executes shell commands to download and execute a malicious file. Analyzing the malware in detail, experts in ethical hacking noticed that the malware downloads a file called H, which turns out to be an old XHide tool to launch executables with a fake process name. In this case, it launches a branch of the miner XMRig Monero, with an embedded configuration (group, user name and password), while the process name is changed to java , so as not to generate suspicion. Experts also noticed that three Cron processes are used for persistence, and two of them refresh the backdoor every day with C2 server downloads. Another process downloads a daily file called Anacrond , which is saved in multiple Cron work files throughout the system. In all three cases, scripts are used to connect to the C2 server and download the implementation bash script to restart the mining process; earlier versions of scripts are removed from the system. CroniX is also a competitive malware, as it locates and removes binaries from any previously installed cryptominer to reclaim all CPU resources. While cryptomining may seem less damaging than other cyberattacks such as cleaner malware, ransomware or massive data theft (all of which can be carried out exploiting this vulnerability), specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security point out that the development of exploits tends to be faster for the more widely embedded vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of solving this particular problem immediately."

If the company receives multiple reports from different sources for the same problem, the reward will be given to the first report received The first external report received on an internally known problem will receive up to 10% of the maximum reward amount If a duplicate report provides Microsoft with previously unknown information for the company, a differential sum will be paid to the duplicate report If a report is potentially eligible for multiple rewards programs, the researcher will receive only one payment, out of the largest reward possible Microsoft reserves the right to reject any report that, to the companys consideration, does not meet all the requirements previously stipulated A high quality report provides necessary information for ethical hacking experts at the time of reproducing, understanding, and fixing problems as soon as possible. This regularly includes backup information, vulnerability description, and a proof of concept. Microsoft recognizes that some problems are extremely difficult to reproduce and understand, so this will be considered at the time of qualifying all the received reports. Many Microsoft sites share a common platform. For this reason, a vulnerability reported in a domain might exist in other domains that share the same platform. For example, a problem reported in account.microsoft.com could be present exactly the same way in account.microsoft.com.uk, so the vulnerability would be corrected in the same way in both cases. Microsoft asks ethical hacking experts participating in the program to take the time necessary to confirm this, so as to include in the report other possible locations of the same error instead of sending multiple flaws. In such cases, the first report received will be considered as a single vulnerability report, while the remainder will be considered as duplicates. Prohibited Safety Research Methods The following methods of investigation shall be deemed prohibited within this program: Phishing attempts or any other form of social engineering against Microsoft employees. The scope of this program is limited to the report of technical vulnerabilities in the specified Microsoft online services Any type of denial-of-service test Perform automated analysis of services that generate significant amounts of traffic Gain access to any information that does not belong to you completely Even with these restrictions, Microsoft reserves the right to respond to any action on its networks that seems malicious."

According to experts in ethical hacking, one of the most outstanding victims was the financial company JP Morgan Chase, the attack made them lost personal and financial information of nearly 100 million customers. The Russian citizen was extradited to the United States, where he will face charges of bank fraud and computer piracy. Ethical hacking specialists responsible for investigating the case calculated that, in total, the gang of hackers behind the attacks on various U.S. financial institutions stole information from almost 100 million of U.S. citizens, according to a statement published by the Department of Justice (DoJ) on its website. The DoJ states that Mr. Tyurin was a key member of the hacker gang and carried out massive attacks with the collaboration of other members. Numerous technical tricks were used to penetrate the bank accounts, affirms the accusation of the DoJ, including the well-known bug Heartbleed that can give attackers access to confidential data stored in the memory of a computer. In addition to obtaining illicit access to customer accounts, it is believed that the group used the victims contact list as a way to artificially inflate the value of the companies in which their members possessed assets. It is believed that Mr. Tyurin is one of the last members of the gang who carried out this attack campaign. Four other men have already been arrested and charged for their alleged involvement. According to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, Heartbleed, the vulnerability used in that campaign, was able to compromise the secret security keys that are used to encrypt network traffic, usernames, passwords, and the content that is transmitted over the Internet. Multiple online services such as emails, instant messaging and even some VPNs were affected by this bug. The Heartbleed vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2014, but it is believed that it already had about 2 years in active, and during all that time, malicious agents with the necessary knowledge and without possibility of being traced in any way, could have been exploiting the flaw."

The different forms of cyberattacks continue to increase and, to increase the complexity of the problem, the threat model has changed dramatically, as many of the applications of an organization were written quite a while ago. The use of vulnerable components in developments has become a major concern; for example, does your organization work with data of European citizens? Attacks on web applications are a primary focus for data theft and, with the current GDPR, a company could pay up to 4% of its annual revenues in penalties for breaches of data protection. Thats why specialists in ethical hacking have been busy enlisting best practices to keep their web developments safe in an ever-changing threat environment: Store your application in a container A primary way to protect your application is to take it into a container. The security features inherent in the container and its default configurations make it a more robust instance talking about security, so your application will instantly inherit those features when stored in a container. Think of the container as a protective cover, isolating your application from other containers and from the host; this isolation mitigates infections and malicious use of your software. Security starts with developer The container platforms offer seamless security in the background, so security is present, only not in the same way as the developer. Several container platforms include a container engine and built-in security capabilities; digital signatures confirm the source and authenticity of the container to validate that no one has altered or infected the application. The container platform has security features that intimately interlace the efforts of its developers without changing their workflow. This makes the development process and its application safer without sacrificing speed or efficiency. Check for vulnerabilities According to specialists in ethical hacking, the best way to know that your applications are safe is to have an automated process to verify the application at every step. Platforms scan their containers for vulnerabilities, compared to their programming resource versions with information in vulnerability databases. Vulnerability scans provide greater visibility and insight into the security status of your applications  from development to production. Keep aware about new standards Standardization bodies such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) help organizations address their security challenges and industry regulations with standard guidelines that maintain good safety practices. These standards help developers understand how to detect gaps between these required security standards and the security status of their applications. Add different protection layers Many container services offer third-party plug-ins and implementations to enable security layers and other additional features. These options can be integrated into your current security strategy to meet the required standards. For example, you can use an integration specifically to reinforce runtime security policies to avoid anomalous behavior in the container, and another to provide firewall and mitigate possible container-to-container attacks; anyways, specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend verifying that these implementations comply with the required safety standards too."

According to a security report issued on Monday, the vulnerability has been rated as critical and is linked to the firmware possibly used in one out of 100 different cameras running the affected software. NUUO, the Taiwan-based company that manufactures the compromised firmware, is expected to issue an update patch for the flaw in the next few hours. The company works with more than 100 different partners, including Sony, Cisco Systems, D-Link and Panasonic. It is unclear how many NUUO partners might have been working with the vulnerable firmware. Vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-1149  CVE-2018-1150), named Peekaboo by the ethical hacking experts in charge of the research, are linked to the web server software of NUUO NVRMini2 devices. According to the researchers, once it is exploited, Peekaboo would provide cybercriminals access to the control management system, exposing the credentials of all connected surveillance cameras. Using root access on the NVRMINI2 device, cybercriminals could interrupt live broadcasts and alter security recordings. Last year, Reaper, a variant of Mirai botnet, also attacked the NUUO NVR devices. These recently revealed vulnerabilities also leave the cameras open to similar botnets attacks. CVE-2018-1149 is the disclosed zero day vulnerability. Using tools like Shodan, attackers can find a compromised device, then, they start to trigger a buffer overflow attack that allows them to access the CGI of the cameras web server, which acts as a gateway to a link between a remote user and the web server. According to the researchers, the attack involves delivering a cookie file too large for the CGI identifier. The CGI does not validate the users input correctly, allowing them to access the web server portion of the camera. The second flaw revealed (CVE-2018-1150) leverages a backdoor functionality on the NUUO NVRMINI2 device web server, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to change a password for any registered user, except for the sys admin. The patch issued by NUUO covers the 3.9.1 and later software versions, specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security point out that the compromised devices must be manually updated to ensure the correct operation of the patch."

The flaw, identified as CVE-2018-17153, would allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to the appliance to authenticate himself as an administrator without providing a password. Hackers could take advantage of the vulnerability to execute commands, access the data stored on the device, modify and copy it, and delete the NAS. We found that the My Cloud device is affected by an authentication escalade vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user to create an administrator session linked to their IP address, mentions the report published by specialists in ethical hacking. By exploiting this vulnerability, the unauthenticated attacker can execute commands that would normally require administrator privileges and obtain complete control of the Western Digital device. The vulnerability lies in the process of creating admin sessions implemented by My Cloud devices that are linked to the users IP address. Once the session is created, the attacker can call the authenticated CGI modules by sending the cookie = admin username in the HTTP request. The CGI will verify if there is a valid session and is linked to the users IP address. An attacker can send a CGI call to the device, including a cookie that contains the cookie username = admin. The investigators even published the code to exploit the vulnerability: POST /cgi-bin/network_mgr.cgi HTTP/1.1 Host: wdmycloud.local Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: username=admin Content-Length: 23 cmd=cgi_get_ipv6&amp;flag=1 It was discovered that an unauthenticated attacker might create a valid session without having to authenticate himself, the report continues. The vulnerability was reported to the company since April, but there is still no official pronouncement by Western Digital. According to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, last February were revealed two vulnerabilities in the storage devices Western Digital My Cloud that could be exploited by an attacker to gain root access to NAS devices. Similarly, in April it was discovered that Western Digital My Cloud EX2 storage devices were leaking files on a local network by default."

This is the highest fine imposed by the United Kingdom Data Protection Act, which dates back to 1998, although it might seem a little significant figure for a company worth 16 billion. In July this year, the UK Data Protection Agency had already issued the maximum fine allowed by this law to Facebook, due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, saying that the social media giant could not prevent its citizens data to fall into the wrong hands. The Equifax data breach As experts in ethical hacking reported at the time, Equifax suffered a massive data violation last year between mid-May and late July, exposing highly sensitive data of up to 145 million people from around the world. The stolen information included the names of the victims, birth dates, phone numbers, drivers license details, addresses and social security numbers, as well as payment card information. Data theft occurred because the company did not respond adequately to a critical vulnerability of Apache Struts 2 (CVE-2017-5638), whose revisions had already been published by ethical hacking and cybersecurity companies. The UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO), which launched a joint investigation into the incident with the Financial Conduct Authority, issued the largest monetary penalty that the countrys Data Protection Act allows, 500k, equivalent to about $660k USD. ICO said that although cyberattack compromised Equifax systems in the United States, the company did not take appropriate measures to protect the personal information of its 15 million customers in the UK. Likewise, ICOs research revealed multiple failures in the company, which resulted in: Information exposure of 19 993 UK customers (including names, dates of birth, phone numbers and drivers license numbers) Deletion of 27 000 email accounts linked to Equifax Stealing passwords, personal information, and payment card information from 15 000 Equifax customers in United Kingdom ICO said Equifax was aware of a critical vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 by a security announcement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in March 2017, but the company did not take the appropriate steps to solve the problem. It was also known that the company kept the event hidden until a month after it was discovered, giving three senior executives of Equifax enough time to sell their shares for a value of almost $2M USD, although the company denied such claims. Equifax has already received the official notice of the fine, and is able to appeal the ICOs decision."

Patrick Wardle showed that macOS security can be omitted to access confidential user data, such as information in the address book. Defective implementation of the new security mechanism Patrick Wardle mentions that he was able to access the confidential user address through a non-privileged application, which means that it was not executed with administrator permissions. The ethical hacking expert says that the zero-day vulnerability derives from the way Apple implemented the protections for various privacy-related data. I found a trivial flaw, although 100% reliable in its implementation, said Wardle, adding that this vulnerability allows a malicious or unreliable application to bypass the new security mechanism and access confidential details without authorization. Wardle says the found vulnerability does not work with all of the new Mojave privacy protection features, and hardware-based components such as the webcam are not affected by this flaw. The expert in ethical hacking decided to reserve the technical details of his research until his participation in a cybersecurity related event. In a later test, Wardle attempted to copy the contents of the address book and deny the operation when the operating system requests permission. It then runs a non-privileged application that allowed him to copy the address book data to the desktop and provide access to the few entries he added for demonstration purposes. Finally, he ran a non-privileged application that allowed him to copy the Address book data to the desktop User Data protection on MacOS Mojave As part of new user data protection measures in macOS Mojave, users must explicitly provide apps their consent to access their location, contacts, calendars, reminders, photos and other files and private information. This means that applications can no longer do this automatically by simulating human interaction with the device (also known as synthetic clicks) using the prescribed APIs. Any such access is now blocked in Apples latest operating system, and an authorization notice is triggered for direct user interaction. To reduce the hassle generated by authorization notices, Apple included a pre-authorization feature for the applications the user wants to use. As experts in ethical hacking report from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this configuration can be done in the system preferences, security and privacy panel."

According to specialists in Ethical hacking, Zheng successfully hacked the hotel server and wrote an article on his blog about the incident, a publication in which he revealed the passwords of the hotel administrators server. This blog ended up attracting the attention of the Singapore Cybersecurity Agency (CSA). Zheng arrived in Singapore last month to participate in a Capture the flag competition, conducted along with a cybersecurity and ethical hacking conference at the Intercontinental Hotel. The competition was attended by hundreds of cybersecurity specialists facing different hacking tests. Zheng checked into the Fragrance Hotel on August 27th. One day later, he began to wonder about possible vulnerabilities in the hotels WiFi server. He successfully searched the default User ID and password of the hotels WiFi system through Google. After connecting to the hotels WiFi gateway, Zheng executed scripts, decrypted files and broken passwords within the next three days before accessing the hotels WiFi server database. The hotel server had a vulnerability that Zheng exploded to gain access, also tried to access the WiFi server from the Fragrance branch in the neighborhood known as Little India, but failed. The engineer documented his finding on his personal blog. By disclosing this information, Zheng knew that the vulnerability in the hotels WiFi server was likely to be exploited by others for illicit purposes, which could cause losses for the organization, said the city attorney. Zheng had been posting on his blog about server vulnerabilities since 2014, the prosecution said, although this incident is the first time he discovers a vulnerability by himself. The CSA found its blog and alerted the hotel managers. Zheng eliminated the blog post after he was asked to do so. The companys IT vice president presented a police report for hacking against Fragrance Hotel. According to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the defense alleged that Zheng appeared to have committed the offense because of curiosity and that no tangible damage had been caused. However, the authorities discovered that the publication was retaken by different forums. According to the prosecution, since other hotels use the same server model, Zhengs actions could have led other hotels to be victims of cyberattacks thanks to Zhengs posts. For the offense of revealing the hotel passwords without authorization, Zheng could have been imprisoned for up to three years and received a fine of up to $10k USD, although the defense expects him to pay only $5k USD, as he has already spent a few days in jail."

This flaw could give an unauthenticated remote attacker the ability to execute arbitrary commands as root on specific systems. Software running on certain systems includes default and static credentials for the root account that could allow attackers to get the access mentioned. The credentials for the account are not documented. The security notice published by Cisco mentions that the vulnerability is due to the presence of predetermined and undocumented static user credentials for the root account of the affected software on certain systems. A malicious actor could exploit this vulnerability by using the account to log on to an affected system. The vulnerability affects the launch of the Cisco Video Surveillance Manager (VSM) software in its versions 7.10, 7.11 and 7.11.1. The flaw only affects the systems in which the software was pre-installed by Cisco. According to our experts in ethical hacking, this vulnerability exists because the root account of the affected software was not disabled before Cisco installed the software on vulnerable platforms, and the default static user credentials exist for the account. The users credentials are not publicly documented, the companys notice continues. Up to now, there are no solutions available for this vulnerability, so VSM users are encouraged to upgrade to version 7.12 to mitigate possible risks. When being questioned by specialists in ethical hacking, Cisco confirmed that they have no knowledge of any attack that exploits the vulnerability. The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability, concludes the companys security notice. Recently, Cisco issued another security warning for critical static credential vulnerabilities in its IOS XE software."

The stolen information includes names and driver license numbers of about 600k Uber drivers. The investigation, lead by state attorneys-general across the United States, will focus on resolving whether Uber violated the report in case of data theft laws, as the company did not inform consumers that their information had been compromised. According to specialists in ethical hacking, instead of disclosing data breach when it happened, Uber paid a hacker $100k USD through its vulnerability bounty program. The company convinced the hacker to erase the data and remain silent with a nondisclosure agreement. The incident became public knowledge a year later, when Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, announced it, qualifying it as a failure for the company, in addition to firing the two employees who had signed the hackers payment. Ubers decision to cover up this data breach was a clear betrayal to consumer confidence, said a statement by Xavier Becerra, Attorney General of California. The company did not protect the data of its users and did not dare to notify the authorities about the exposed data. Tony West, Ubers legal director, said this research was part of an Uber effort to reinvent the companys image. He also mentioned that the company had recently hired a privacy chief and was in collaboration with specialists in ethical hacking. We know that winning the trust of our customers and the regulators we work with globally will not be easy. After all, trust is hard to win and easy to lose, said West. He added that data theft was revealed to the public during his first day at work. Instead of settling into my new workspace and walking on the floor to meet my new colleagues, I spent the day calling several state and federal regulators. According to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced last April its resolution on this incident. The FTC ordered Uber to regularly submit to privacy audits as part of an agreement reached last year. The total amount for the investigation will be divided among the 50 states in the US."
148,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Vulnerability discovered in WiFi routers,1,9ldpzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9ldpzf/vulnerability_discovered_in_wifi_routers/,2018-10-05 02:59:03,"An error has been discovered in all modern WiFi routers that cannot be solved Specialists in ethical hacking and cybersecurity at the University of California reported the discovery of a vulnerability that leverages the interaction of two universal Internet protocols: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and WiFi. This exploit does not appear to be traditional security vulnerability. Instead, the security flaw lies in a fundamental decision of Wi-Fi design made over 20 years ago, making it extremely difficult to correct. TCP has existed since the advent of the Internet and virtually all websites use it. TCP divides information into manageable fragments that can be transmitted between computers over the Internet. Each fragment, known as package, receives a number within a single sequence for that particular communication, ensuring that it is delivered correctly. The first number of the initial sequence is chosen randomly, but the following numbers are added in a predictable pattern, so the receiving device can organize them properly if they arrive in disorder. When you click to enlarge an image on a website, your computer asks the remote computer to send the image data. The remote computer divides the image data into numbered packets and sends them through the fastest routes. Your computer responds to recognize each package and assembles them in the correct order to display the selected image. According to the ethical hacking experts reports, for an attacker to be able to intercept this communication, he must pretend to be the sender and correctly guess the next number in the sequence. Because there are about 4 billion of possible sequences, it is almost impossible to guess successfully before the communication is complete. But if the attacker finds out which number triggers a response from the recipient, he can figure out the approximate range of the next number and send a malicious load that simulates arriving from the original sender. When the computer reassembles the packets, the user will find the content sent by the attacker. How can someone find out this number? Wireless routers can only transmit data in one direction at a time because they communicate with devices on their network on a single channel. Like walkie-talkies, if both parties send information at the same time, there will be interference. This is known as half duplex transmission, a feature of all routers. This means that there is always a time interval between a request and a response. If an attacker sends a falsified TCP packet with a random sequence number, followed by a normal package and an immediate response, the attacker will know that he is mistaken because in a half-duplex system, the recipient should take longer to respond to the spoofed package. If the response takes longer, the attacker will know that has being able to guess the sequence and can hijack the communication. To be contacted by a remote attacker, the victim must visit a website controlled by the attacker. The website runs a JavaScript that creates a TCP connection to a bank or other website chosen by the attacker. The victim is not aware that the connection has been established. In their experiments, the investigators found that the victim needs to stay on the malicious website only one or two minutes for the attack to succeed. Specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security commented that there is no solution to this security failure in the short term. The only solution would be to build routers that operate at different frequencies to transmit and receive data. According to experts who discovered the vulnerability, it is still about five years before it can be solved."

MDM is a common-use enterprise technology used by organizations to control the use of mobile devices of employees. This includes applying security policies, standardizing upgrades, controlling expense management, and more, all centralized on a platform. It is meant to avoid the inconvenience of having multiple types of phones and tablets, all with access to corporate resources, spread between hundreds or even thousands of geographically dispersed workers. Meanwhile, DEP is an Apple service designed to facilitate the registration of iOS, macOS and TvOS devices in MDM. Unlike traditional deployment methods, which require the end user or administrator to take steps to configure a device and manually enroll it in an MDM server, DEP allows administrators to automate the process. This investigation of specialists in ethical hacking found that DEP only requires a serial number to enroll a device in an organizations MDM server, which means an attacker could register an unauthorized device on the system. That device would be treated as a privileged endpoint, which would allow the attacker to collect important information about the organization. If the serial number is registered in DEP and the MDM server does not require additional authentication during enrollment, an attacker could enroll a device of its choice on the MDM server of an organization by falsifying a legitimate serial number registered in DEP, explained James Barclay, one of the research managers. Once a device is registered, it is treated as a trusted device for the organization, and can be used to access sensitive information such as device and user certificates, VPN configuration data, and many other data considered as sensitive information. The ability to enroll a device in an organizations MDM server can bring significant consequences, allowing access to an organizations private resources or even full VPN access to internal systems, said the research in a publication. There is only one impediment to potential attackers; they must start enrollment in DEP before the legitimate user does, as DEP only accepts the serial number once for each device. This reduces the time range for the attack, as a malicious agent would have to register a device before the organization enrolled it. For its part, Apple mentioned that they do not consider this as a vulnerability, and that in its documentation they already recommend that companies apply user authentication or limit access in the preliminary configuration. According to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the solution for this weakness is to implement additional requirements for authentication on the MDM server, so that device enrollment is not based only in the serial numbers."

A security report warns of the vulnerability in Linux kernels versions 4.9+ that can allow an attacker to overflow resources from a network with low-effort calls. With the right procedures, a Linux system can be forced to make a sequence of calls to the kernel for each packet, kernel calls that are very costly in terms of system resources. There are limitations and restrictions to exploit the vulnerability, but there is also evidence that this is real. Kernel of Linux versions 4.9+ may be forced to make very expensive calls for each incoming package, which can lead to a denial of service, the report reveals. An attacker can induce a denial of service condition by sending specially modified packages within the current TCP sessions. Enterprise network security experts note that because of this, denial of service attacks cannot be performed using spoofed IP addresses. Update patches have already been released for the vulnerability, so enterprise network security specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend users of the Linux operating system to update their systems as soon as possible and avoid any risk."

At an event held in Las Vegas last Monday, a team of enterprise network security experts demonstrated how old-school threats are putting the development of smart city environments at risk in the future. It is estimated that investment in smart cities technology will reach $80 billion USD this year and will reach $135 billion USD arriving to 2021, only in the United States. Water and drainage systems, intelligent lighting, traffic controllers, utilities and more will be intertwined in smart cities, seeking to make urban life more efficient in terms of energy, ecology and sustainability. However, connecting all these critical elements can have devastating effects if something goes wrong, for example, a hypothetical successfully deployed cyberattack. We all have witnessed the damage that can be caused when hackers threaten core systems in a nation, as in the case of Ukraines electricity grid, and unless smart city developers take cyber security as a serious matter for the future, every smart city environment will be under considerable threats. Enterprise network security experts responsible for this research found that the systems developed by Libelium, Echelon and Battelle are vulnerable to several attacks. Libelium is a hardware manufacturer for wireless networks, while Echelon specializes in industrial Internet of Things (IoT), and Battelle develops and commercializes related technologies. Out of the 17 vulnerabilities discovered in the systems used in four smart city environments, eight are considered critical; many of the flaws were due to poor security practices, such as the use of default passwords, lack of SQL injection and weak authentication processes. Researchers discovered four critical shell injection flaws prior to authentication in the Libelium Wireless sensor network, Meshlium. Echelon servers, which are used for energy conservation, contained two critical authentication flaws, unencrypted communications problems, and default credentials. In the case of Battelle, the hub with 2.5.1software version also has severe security problems. The most serious vulnerability discovered was a coded admin account, followed by access allowed to sensitive features on the system without prior authentication, default API keys, and authentication omission, security failures of SQL injection and reflected XSS problems. After submitting the vulnerability report, the enterprise network security specialists team found that dozens (and in some cases, hundreds) of these vendors devices were exposed to online remote access. Subsequently, the manufacturers recognized their mistakes and began launching the update patches to cover the vulnerabilities."

The Department of Defense mentions that it is already working together with its suppliers to solve the flaws. Enterprise network security experts who discovered the vulnerabilities commented that the terminals could be used to intercept the GPS signals that reveal the location of a satellite terminal and the location of the soldiers who use it. Satellite terminal antennas use GPS, and sometimes they also rely on instructions from their operators to target the right satellite. Location data is supposed to be visible just for the operator through the management software, but research managers have shown that it is possible to access that management software remotely. Part of the data exposure occurred due to incorrect configuration problems. It was not just a problem with the product, mentioned the enterprise network security experts. The configuration problem can be repaired. In fact, some of these problems have already been resolved, reported the Department of Defense spokesman. Experts in enterprise network security from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider exploiting vulnerability poses a high risk to the troops, but the chances of any hacker to exploit the vulnerability are lower. The research also suggests that slightly larger satellite terminals, such as those used in maritime operations, can be manipulated against nearby people using radio waves in order to cause pain. Using a specific amount of energy, it is possible to create a scenario in which the biological tissue is affected, as well as the electronic and electrical systems. This can be used to cause burns or cause failures in electrical systems, the experts added. Four years ago, experts in enterprise network security had already revealed widespread problems in satellite communications systems manufactured by the companies Harris, Hughes, Cobham, Thuraya, JRC and Iridium."

Unlike the old USB ports, this new kind, the USB-C, can carry energy enough to charge your machine. This is a big plus, because you wouldnt need to add a different port just to load, in addition, when the USB port is not used as a power source, it can be used to plug in storage devices or to charge your smartphone. Anyways, specialists in enterprise network security from the International Institute of Cyber Security, consider that this function is an opportunity for hackers to exploit a new vulnerability. An enterprise network security researcher, who has chosen to remain anonymous, has revealed some details about a project in which he developed a specially crafted MacBook charger that can be used for malicious purposes on a device, compromising it without the owner even noticing. This is the type of hack that causes panic among professionals in enterprise network security. The typical white and square MacBooks chargers are located in offices and cafes around the world. They are borrowed, lost and replaced regularly. As he has reported, the researcher dismantled the inside of a charger and filled it with small components that activate when the victim, unsuspectingly, plugs it to his computer. This is extremely difficult to detect, as the equipment regularly performs the battery charging process. The device was able to insert a fake log in screen into a website. If this technique was used in a real scenario, the attacker could use this method to collect any relevant data through the fake site. In the demo we are only collecting username and password, the researcher said. However, it could also be used to inject malware, root kits, or other types of malicious software. The project continues in testing phase, but the researcher thinks that the attack could work on any machine powered via USB-C, regardless of the manufacturer. The researcher is keeping private the precise details of his project. Among the information he has revealed so far, he mentions he does not work for any security company, so he could invite other investigators to work with him in the development of this project, adding that he will eventually make public the content of this research. The main premise of this attack is not a new discovery. In smartphones, where the charging point is often the same slot through which the device transfers data, hackers carry out the so-called juice jacking attacks. This attack takes advantage of peoples need to keep their devices powered so they dont lose communication. What makes this new attack different is the use of USB-C, which has made it possible to extract information via laptop charger. The easiest way to protect yourself against this type of attack is to take care of your charger, but once more details of the attack e revealed, better security measures will be also disclosed."

An important and convincing statistic is that of the 3,279 vulnerabilities registered, 44.2% have CVSS scores between 9.0 and 10 (high to critical severity), says Carsten Eiram, a cyber security organization specialist in charge of the report. While it is important to consider other criteria in addition to CVSS scores to manage and prioritize vulnerabilities, it may be very problematic for an organization not to be aware of the critical vulnerabilities that may jeopardize their assets, the expert added. Out of the vulnerabilities reported in 2018, 25.6% do not have a known solution yet. Because of this, the release of software patches, though still important, is only a part of the vulnerability management today. In the current environment, effective vulnerability management needs to use detailed intelligence to understand and prioritize mitigation actions to address the ever-changing threat landscape. The report also shows that while the relations between researchers and suppliers may be difficult to manage, progress is being done in cooperation tasks. The vulnerabilities reported in a coordinated manner with suppliers are still high, with numbers close to 48.5%, an improvement over 2017. According to cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the task of protecting digital assets has never been so fundamental to companies, as we keep appreciating an increase in compromised organizations and data breaches. Vulnerability intelligence solutions are a cornerstone of a companys defense strategy and they need to be kept up-to-date on cyber security issues."

The network security company launched the patches as part of a cyber security organization event, where researchers will present details about new variants of IPsec IKE attacks that could threaten VPN large scale use, for example, industrial information exchanges and backhaul of wireless operators executed in the Cisco kit. The attack is possible due to the reuse of a key pair in the first and second version of the internet key exchange protocol, IKE, IKEV1 and IKEv2, and it could allow an attacker to impersonate a network or conduct a Man-in-the-Middle attack against two parties. We demonstrate that reusing a key pair in different IKE versions and modes can cause attackers to avoid the inter-protocol authentication process, allowing them to impersonate a victim host or network, the cyber security organization team explained. In addition, we describe an offline dictionary attack against Pre Shared Key-based IKE modes, thus covering all of IKEs available authentication mechanisms. As the experts point out, although IKEv2 replaced IKEv1, both can be deployed on all major operating systems and network devices, such as firewalls. They also found the same IKE flaws on devices from competing manufacturers, such as Huawei, Clavister and ZyXEL. This included the Huawei Secospace USG2000 series firewall. According to cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, along with the Cisco patch for the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-0131, that affects IOS and its software IOS XE based on Linux, Huawei, Clavister and ZyXEL have launched a new firmware for avoid exploiting the vulnerability in their respective developments. Cisco has rated the bug as a medium-severity problem. The problem only affects IOS, the most widely deployed software for CISCO switches and routers, and IOS XE software when the authentication rsa-encr option is enabled. Vulnerabilities in the implementation of RSA-encoded nonces in Cisco IOS software and Cisco IOS XE software could allow a hacker without authentication to remotely get the encrypted nonces of IKEV1 session, Cisco explained. The vulnerability exists because the affected software responds incorrectly to the decryption failures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted ciphers to a device configured with IKEV1 that uses nonces encrypted in RSA. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited it could allow the attacker to obtain the encrypted nonces. The company comments that there is no record of the successful exploitation of this vulnerability for malicious purposes."

After all, it is considered completely harmless to share the fax number alongside other data, such as email addresses or phone numbers of a company. However, cyber security organization experts have found that the fax machines are also exploitable by hackers. According to a research by cyber security organization experts, named Faxploit, if an attacker gets the fax number of an organization, it is possible to send a specially crafted image file to the targeted machine and anything can be encoded in that file, like malware, mining software, ransomware or spyware. The machine will decode the file and load that software into your devices memory. This way, attackers can easily get sensitive data or can alter the entire network the fax machine is connected to. Researchers claim that certain vulnerabilities in communication protocols used by most fax machines around the world are responsible for the attacks, if vulnerabilities are exploited, an attacker can take control of any network, whether private or commercial use. Defective protocols are installed not only on widely used fax machines, but also on various multifunctional printer models. The research shows that the vulnerabilities present in the protocols used by all the fax machines and the multifunctional printers allow the hackers to inject malware into a companys network in a very simple way. Using only a telephone line, we were able to send a fax that could take full control of the printer, and then release our load within the network accessible to the device. The exploit was tested on HP Officejet Pro 6830 fax printers. However, researchers say that this flaw can be exploited in any fax machine because the vulnerabilities are in their communication protocols. Online fax services such as fax2email are also vulnerable to similar types of attacks. It is worth noting that HP quickly fixed the vulnerability in the above mentioned model by launching a software patch, which is now available for download on the companys website. Cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that the rest of the manufacturers must address this vulnerability as soon as possible, modifying how modern network protocols deal with fax machines and multifunctional printers. They also stated that as of today, companies should remain alert and consider fax machines as a possible attack vector for hackers."

If these unsafe smart plugs had been used in conference rooms or offices, they could have meant a major problem for the companies that used them. IoT devices are often overlooked from a cyber security organization perspective, this may be due to many being used for seemingly harmless purposes, such as home automation, said the vulnerability report. However, these devices work with operating systems and require as much protection as a desktop computer. Such vulnerability could become the point of support an attacker needs to enter and completely jeopardize a business network. For cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security this event also serves as a reminder to make due diligence when it comes to buying safe IoT devices and to adequately secure those devices, with secure passwords and other security measures after buying them to keep domestic and enterprise networks safe."
163,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Serious vulnerabilities in Philips medical devices,1,9b0ebh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9b0ebh/serious_vulnerabilities_in_philips_medical_devices/,2018-08-29 02:29:47,"Advanced hacking skills are not necessary to exploit the flaw Several remote code execution vulnerabilities have been found on Philips devices designed to generate cardiovascular imaging, report experts in cybersecurity. According to a security advisory from the US Department of Homeland Securitys Computer Emergency Readiness Team, the first vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-14787, affecting IntelliSpace Cardiovascular and Xcelera IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV), both Philips developments. The notice mentions that the vulnerability only requires basic hacking ability to be exploited, and is caused by improper management. In ISCV software version 2.x or earlier, and Xcelera version 4.1 or earlier, an attacker is able to access folders on the system that might have executables that provide the attacker with authentication to overwrite the system. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could grant an attacker with local access and user privileges to the ISCV server or Xcelera to execute arbitrary code. The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-14789, affects the ISCV system version 3.1 or earlier and Xcelera version 4.1 or earlier. Unquoted search paths allow attackers to increase their privilege levels and execute arbitrary codes. In a Philips security notice, it was mentioned that the servers for ISCV version 2.x and above and Xcelera from 3x to 4 x contain 20 Windows services whose executables are present in a folder where authenticated users are granted permissions to overwrite. Services run as a local administrator account or a local system account, and if a user replaces one of the executables with a different program, that program would also run with local administrator or local system permissions, the company mentioned. In ISCV version 3.x and above and Xcelera 3.x to 4.x, there are 16 vulnerable Windows services; these services are run with local administrator rights and can be started with a registry key, potentially offering an attacker a path to place an executable that grants local administrator rights. Vulnerabilities cannot be remotely exploited and no reports have been received indicating exploitation in the wild. The mitigations will be applied through a patch that will be released next October. Meanwhile, Philips suggests users should restrict the available permissions when possible. The United States takes very seriously even the slightest security flaw in medical devices. There is a background of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which once ordered the removal of 465 St. Jude pacemakers to correct several flaws, the vulnerabilities found in these systems can cause anxiety in patients and they even could stop working suddenly. Cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that FDA recommendations should not go unnoticed for those involved in these cases."
164,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Chrome vulnerability allows hackers to find Facebook users data,1,9b0ez7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9b0ez7/chrome_vulnerability_allows_hackers_to_find/,2018-08-29 02:31:48,"It is recommended to change to the latest version of the browser With the launching of Chrome 68, Google identifies any non-HTTPS web site as unsafe to make Internet browsing a safer experience. If this is not reason enough to switch to the latest version of the browser, here are more reasons: cyber security organization experts have discovered a vulnerability in web browsers that could allow a hacker to find all that other web platforms, such as Facebook and Google, know about you, and all they need is for you to visit a website. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2018-6177, exploits a weakness in the HTML audio and video tags and affects all web browsers powered by Blink Engine, including Google Chrome. To describe the scenario, cyber security organization experts showed a Facebook example, the popular social networking platform that collects comprehensive information about their users, including their age, sex, location data and interests. Facebook offers a targeting feature for guiding posts, allowing administrators to define a specific audience for posts based on age, location, sex and interests. To demonstrate the vulnerability, multiple posts were created on Facebook with different combinations of audience restrictions to categorize victims according to these criteria. Now, if a website incorporates all of these Facebook posts, the site will upload and display only a few visitor-specific publications, based on the profile data of Facebook users that match the restricted audience settings. For example, if a post  defined to be visible only to Facebook users with 26 years old, males, with interest in hacking or cyber security organization, was successfully loaded, an attacker would have the ability to deduct personal information from users, no matter the privacy settings of users profiles. Even though the idea sounds rather simple, there are no direct ways available for site administrators to determine whether an embedded publication was successfully loaded for a specific visitor or not. A member of the Google security team pointed out that the vulnerability could also work against websites that use APIs to get user specific session information. The core of this vulnerability has some similarities with another browser error, patched in June this year, which exploited a weakness in the way web browsers handle cross-source requests to video and audio files, allowing Attackers access Gmail or private Facebook content. Cyber security organization researchers reported the vulnerability to Google with a proof of concept of the exploit, and the team of Chrome patched the vulnerability in the Chrome 68 version. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that Chrome users update their browser to the latest version, if they have not yet done so, to stay safe from the possible Facebook information leaking."
165,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Open source components: time saving and security problem,1,9bkwm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9bkwm7/open_source_components_time_saving_and_security/,2018-08-31 02:02:44,"Development teams can benefit from the different libraries and open source frameworks, but they need to keep in mind the possible risks of this practice A growing trend among software development teams is the adoption of open source code, as cyber security organization specialists believe that open source components currently comprise between 60 and 80% of code in modern applications. Software development teams have realized that using open source code helps them build safer, more powerful web applications in a fastest process. Although there are obvious reasons for developers to use open source components, this practice carries some risks. Constantly securing an open source product can be a huge and time-consuming challenge, and it depends on the right tools for those who use it to stay safe from these threats. Speaking about open source components, the most common security risk is known vulnerabilities. These are vulnerabilities and solutions, published by the cyber security organization community or the open source community, which are available for anyone to see and can be used by hackers to exploit the victims. Open source components are used in different kinds of developments, and open source security vulnerabilities present in a single component can have a huge impact on a large number of web applications. The open source community provides maintenance to the different open source components and quickly alerts users when a new vulnerability is discovered. To help users maintain these secure components, cyber security organization researchers publish their findings on different portals, enumerating vulnerabilities, how to fix them, and how those flaws can be exploited. While this helps security teams and developers to correct their applications, hackers also use these resources to better understand their possible attack vectors. The main challenge is to always stay one step ahead of the hacker; unfortunately, most development teams are unaware of how many of their products depend on open source components and typically do not maintain an inventory of the code and possible vulnerabilities. This is a major problem, as they may be victims of cyberattacks through a vulnerable open source component to which they did not pay due attention. This is what happened in the Equifax data breach last September when the company was hacked through a vulnerable version of Apache Struts 2, which caused the theft of millions of personal records. Manually tracking an organizations open source can be a really slow process. To optimally implement a development, the best solution is to automate the selection and management process of open source components. By implementing a correct automated open source verification process, development teams will be able to avoid potential security failures in the future. By integrating such tools into the software development cycle, vulnerable components can be tracked before they are inserted into an organizations encoding environment. Also, cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend organizations to stay alert on any new vulnerability reports, which will give their security teams time to quickly repair vulnerable components before they can be tapped."

In a LinkedIn publication, researcher Bob Diachenko explains how he found the 2GB MongoDB database on August 13, which contained phone numbers, addresses, transaction details, account holder contacts, partial numbers of credit cards and encrypted account passwords. The leaked information included users chat in the app and the history of notifications, as well as details of what users needed a babysitter at what time and in what direction. Shodan indexed the database one day before the cyber security organization researcher found it, suggesting a short period of exposure, although it is possible that the database has been compromised for longer. The good news is that, upon learning about the information leak, the team behind Sitter reacted quickly and removed the leaked data, thus avoiding that the compromised information could be used for illicit purposes. The Sitter developers issued a statement in which they reported that the affected users had already been notified of the situation, as well as announcing improvements in the security of their users data. Sitter also stated that the vulnerability that enabled this data leak has already been corrected. This event occurs not long after the leaking of another MongoDB database compromised the health records of thousands of people in the state of Michoacn, Mexico. Before that, in 2017 a hacker implemented a data theft campaign in which he managed to compromise 28K MongoDB databases with poor security measures, getting many of the victims to pay the ransom in Bitcoin that the hacker demanded. There is no evidence that other people, besides researcher Bob Diachenko, have accessed the Sitter database, so it seems that this time the incident did not generate more serious consequences; however, cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that, once a hacker accesses online information, there is no such thing as a temporary data breach, and information will remain vulnerable."

The hacker, who calls himself L.M., revealed to a digital media that he gained access to the servers of TheTruthSpy, a company that sells an Android and iOS spy app (known as stalkerware). The hacker was able to steal logins and passwords, images, audio recordings intercepted from victims phones, text messages, location information and social network chats, among other data. I have control over victims all around the world, the hacker said a few months ago, when it was revealed that he had compromised the companys information. L.M. shared to the media a sample of usernames and logins of TheTruthSpy clients. This way, cyber security organization experts were able to verify that about half of them were active TheTruthSpy accounts when trying to use the respective email addresses to create a new account. In many cases this was not possible, because the website mentioned that the user already existed. They care about how to spy, but dont care about how to secure their users and victims privacy, mentioned the hacker. L.M. also mentioned that he recently lost access to the site when TheTruthSpy updated its servers. L.M. said he could hack into the companys media server after reverse-engineering the Android app and finding a serious vulnerability. The hacker warned that many of TheTruthSpy customers used the same passwords for their email, PayPal or Amazon accounts, mentioning that he entered those accounts but did not steal money. This is the seventh company that sells spyware to common users to be hacked over the last two years. Many hackers have focused their attacks on the fragile consumer spyware industry, exposing their mediocre cyber security organization and questionable ethics. TheTruthSpy has often been used as an example of questionable actor in the industry. The companys blog announces its products as a solution for spying on a cheater husband mentioning that the software is undetectable and silent. Although there are several companies that sell programs to spy on their lower-quality partners in the market, there are some genuine products worth considering. One of my favorite programs to spy on my partner is TheTruthSpy, known for its quality and novel features, mentions a companys blog post. The founder of StealthGenie, another company that commercialized software for domestic abusers, was arrested and charged in 2014. In the United States, selling spyware to parents or employers is not considered illegal, but if a company sells its product to adults for use with other adults, that is considered a crime. Cyber security organization specialists mention that undue access to this information could be very dangerous; a hacker can know everything about anybody and also know the identity of the domestic abuser, which makes them easy victims to online extortion and other cybercrimes."

The compromised service was Sentry, an open-source error tracking application that helps developers control and correct flaws in real time. Its written in Python with the Django framework. Cyber security organization researchers were examining the application and saw that the stack traces (lists of the stack of functions at the time of an error) appeared regularly on the page. Thus, the researchers concluded that the application seemed unstable respect to the users password-reset function, which was occasionally blocked. More important, these stack traces were triggering full printouts of the entire application, albeit with some critically information. According to cyber security organization experts, Djangos debugging mode was not disabled, which consequently prints the whole environment when a stack trace occurs. However, Django cuts critical information (passwords, secrets, keys) on those pile traces, thus avoiding a massive leak of information. Still, the stack traces revealed enough pieces of information to build an exploit to execute commands on the system. For example, the name of the session cookie, the session serializer that uses the Pickle binary protocol to deserialize the structure of Python objects, the session engine, and a list of Sentry configuration information that contains a secret key used for the session. The SENTRY_OPTIONS list contains a key called system.secret-key, which is not cut and is used for session logging. If this is compromised, it is important to regenerate it because otherwise it is much easier to hijack user sessions. Knowing this, the investigators discovered that they could create their own session containing arbitrary code to execute commands on the system. To test the mechanism, they wrote a simple script with an arbitrary load on a specially designed SENTRYSID cookie. The payload was a sleep 30 command, when using this cookie, the page actually takes an additional 30 seconds to load, confirming the flaws presence. It seems that Facebook could not completely eradicate the data returned by a public web application vulnerability, the experts mentioned. This is a common problem in the cyber security organization world. Facebook recognized the vulnerability and disabled the system on the same day as it prepared an update patch. The problem was solved about a week later. Cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security commented that although the vulnerability did not directly affect Facebook users, as it was a disclosure of information in a third-party application that Facebook was running on some of their servers that seemed to be disconnected from user information, is an important reminder of the challenge of applying security patches on a business scale."

The vulnerability was discovered and reported by cyber security organization researcher Max Justicz. According to the researcher, Summit Package input field for sending new PHP packages through the Packagist homepage allowed an attacker to execute a malicious command in the format $ (MALICIOUS_COMMANDS) . The main cause of this problem was that the Packagist service expected the input to be a URL that would be redirected to a source repository hosted on a Git, perforce, Subversion, or Mercurial server. The cyber security organization expert found that Packagist was incorrectly escaping the characters entered when performing checks to see if the URL leads to a perforce or Subversion repository, and was executing malicious commands: once for the Perforce check and twice for subversion verification. Depending on the skill level of a potential attacker, someone could easily hijack the underlying Packagist server and perform more malicious actions. The vulnerability has already been corrected, according to Max Justicz. The aforementioned cyber security organization researcher has found and reported several vulnerabilities in popular programming language servers. He previously informed and helped to correct: A remote code execution vulnerability in RubyGems.org, the main repository of Ruby packages (hosting service) A flaw that allowed a group of hackers to delete files from the Python Package Index (PyPI) Remote code execution in a mirror of the orgservice, the main package repository for the JavaScript ecosystem A vulnerability in com According to cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the number of vulnerabilities registered increases year by year.

Ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that Family Orbit, a monitoring and espionage app related to parental control, exposed online almost 281 GB of data. Data was stored on a poorly secured server until a hacker discovered the presence of a large amount of data from compromised Family Orbit customers. Later, the hacker reported the defective server to various specialized media. Around 3.8k containers were in Rackspace, a cloud storage service. The hacker proved to have accessed the files stored there, ranging from user names to video recordings: Ive got all the photos loaded from the childrens phones monitored with this app, and also some screenshots of the developers desktop, where are exposed passwords and other sensitive information, said the hacker, who preferred to remain anonymous. Ethical hacking experts were able to confirm the data theft, after verifying that the e-mail addresses provided by the hacker belonged to active users of the Family Orbit service. Family Orbit announces itself as the best parental control app currently available online. The worrying thing is that the exposed data include hundreds of images of children, which were monitored by their parents or relatives through this app. The data were protected only by a very easy to guess password. The hacker found the key to access this data on the servers in the spyware cloud. The hacker who discovered the unprotected server is known for having attacked Retina-X, another domestic use spyware, attack in which he erased the company servers twice. At a time after the hackers statement, Family Orbit also recognized the data theft. A company spokesperson stated that the spyware API key is stored in the application in encrypted form and that the company observed unusual bandwidth on its server. As soon as the company detected this anomalous behavior, the API key and login credentials were immediately changed.

The vulnerability report states that Opsview builds monitoring software that helps developers understand how the performance of their hybrid IT infrastructure and applications impact the delivery of commercial services. Opsview Monitor supports 3500 Nagios plugins and service checks that make it easy to control everything from Docker and VMware to Amazon Web Services, Hyper-V and more. Multiple vulnerabilities were found on Opsview Monitor, which would allow an attacker with access to the management console to execute commands on the operating system. In principle, a team of ethical hacking experts notified Opsview and requested GPG keys to submit a draft report on May 3, 2018. After receiving the notice, Opsview reported that they were able to reproduce all the vulnerabilities and planned to launch a solution by the end of July, according to the report timeline. Opsview and the specialists continued in communication while the company was working on the remaining corrections. Both parties agreed to publish the full vulnerability report at the beginning of September. According to ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, of the found vulnerabilities, an attacker could use two of them (reflected cross-site scripts in diagnostics and persistent cross-site scripts in the configuration endpoint) to run malicious JavaScript code in the context of a legitimate user. The proof of concept showed that the input will be stored without any sanitizing process and will be processed every time the Settings section is visited by the user. It is important to note that this XSS is automatically stored and runs only in the context of the victims session. However, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain persistence and execute malicious code every time the victim accesses the configuration section. The three remaining vulnerabilities include abuse of notifications leading to remote command execution, abuse of the test connection functionality that leads to command execution and script modification that could allow escalation of local privileges."

As if that wasnt enough security alerts, it was just known that a hacker was found selling confidential U.S. Air Force documents on the dark web for prices between $100 and $200. Information security and secure data destruction specialists reported that today they discovered a hacker trying to sell secret documents about the MQ-9 Reaper drone, used in U.S. federal agencies, for just a few hundred dollars in a dark web forum last month. Brought to the scene in 2001, the MQ-9 Reaper drone is currently used by the Air Force, the Navy, Customs and Border Protection, NASA, the CIA and the armies of several other countries, as reported by experts in secure data destruction from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Information security analysts found this during their regular work of monitoring on dark web for criminal activities. They impersonated potential buyers and contacted the hacker before confirming the validity of the documents involved. Use of FTP credentials predetermined Secure data destruction experts discovered that the hacker managed to get the confidential documents by accessing a Netgear router located at the Creech Air Force Base that used the default FTP login settings to share files. The authentication vulnerability on the Netgear routers that exploited the hacker to access the confidential military data was initially discovered two years ago, plus it is thought that more than 4K routers have not yet updated their firmware and are vulnerable to an attack on similar conditions. After gaining access to the network, the hacker infiltrated a captains computer established at the Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, and stole a cache of confidential documents, including the drones maintenance instructions and a list of planes possibly connected to it. Ironically, a certificate found in the data file reveals that the captain, whose system was compromised, recently completed the Cyber Awareness Challenge, but he omitted to set a new password for the FTP server that hosts confidential files. It is still undetermined how spread the attack is. The hacker interaction process allowed analysts to discover more leaked military information, including a large number of military documents from an unidentified officer, a M1 ABRAMS tank operation manual, and a training course for platoons, on sale by the same hacker. Experts in secure data destruction discovered locating data from an individual possibly related to the group behind the attack."
178,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Chrome uses more RAM because of new feature against Spectre,1,8zx6nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8zx6nf/chrome_uses_more_ram_because_of_new_feature/,2018-07-19 02:50:38,"RAM use increases up to 10% Google revealed this week that its solutions for the Spectre vulnerability have caused the Chrome browser to use more RAM memory. In a publication, Google details its new Site Isolation function for the latest version of Chrome 67. It is a default-enabled feature used to protect against Specter side channel attacks that use the speculative execution characteristics of most processors to access parts of the memory supposedly restricted. That could be great news, but secure data destruction specialists expect that as a result of this security measure it also increases the Chromes use of RAM memory. The Site Isolation feature makes Chrome create more rendering processes, implying performance offsets, as reported by experts in secure data destruction. There is a total memory overload of between 10 and 13% in actual workloads due to the largest number of processes. This will not be good news for many Chrome users, who often point out that the browser uses a lot of RAM memory. According to experts in secure data destruction from the International Institute of Cyber Security, an increase of 10% of the use of RAM is significant, especially in systems with 4 GB of RAM or less. The increase in the use of RAM will affect the versions of Chrome in Windows, MAC and Chrome OS as a result of this change, but Google is working to reduce the impact. In a statement, the company claims that its teams keep working hard to optimize this behavior and keep Chrome fast and secure. Google has also been optimizing Chrome after Microsoft publicly highlighted the Google browser for being bad for the battery life of laptops."

The manufacturer released an update patch last Wednesday. Cisco also fixed two medium-security flaws on its FireSIGHT management platform for network security, and a medium-security problem in Web Security Appliance. Finally, it issued a solution for a high-severity bug on its platform for mobile operator routers, StarOS. CVE-2018-0341, the most critical of vulnerabilities, would allow for commands injection and remote code execution on IP Phones, including bleeding edge models whit HD video call function. Specialists in secure data destruction mention that due to insufficient input validation, an authenticated user could send crafted commands to a specific user input field, compromising the user interface that is linked to the phones. This could result in the ability to inject and execute arbitrary commands, opening the door for hackers to listen to conversations, make phone calls, or even more. The vulnerability, found internally by the vendor, affects IP Phone devices series 6800, 7800 and 8800 that run a version of multiplatform firmware prior to version 11.2 (1). According to specialists in secure data destruction, no exploits have yet been seen in nature, and the requirement that an attacker log in to the user interface to launch an attack mitigates the severity of the problem. Cisco also sent solutions for two medium-gravity failures in the Cisco FireSIGHT System software, which provides centralized management for network security and operational functions for Cisco ASA with FirePOWER services and network security devices Cisco FirePOWER. The first flaw (CVE-2018-0383) is file policy omission vulnerability, found in the FireSIGHT detection engine. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send an FTP connection created for malicious purposes to transfer a file to an affected device; That file could contain malware created to disable detection mechanisms in the system or perform other despicable actions. According to experts in information security and secure data destruction, an exploit could allow the attacker to circumvent a file policy that is configured to apply the  block load  with the reboot action to FTP traffic. The second vulnerability (CVE-2018-0384) in the same detection engine could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to bypass a URL-based access control policy that is configured to block traffic on an affected system. Another medium-severity error (CVE-2018-0366) is cross-site script vulnerability in the Web-based management interface of the CISCO web security device. Through social engineering, a malicious agent could convince an interface user to click on a specially designed link that would then give attackers the ability to run arbitrary scripts on the interface or allow the attacker access to sensitive information set in users browser. Meanwhile, Cisco has also corrected two high-severity vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-0369) on StarOS. StarOS drives next-generation mobile networks, which support everything from tablets and smartphones to connected automobiles, smart-city and other Internet of Things implementation. The platform provides virtualization and intelligence for mobile network architectures, and enables the allocation of dynamic resources for mobile networks and services. Internal security tests discovered vulnerabilities in reassembly logic for fragmented IPV4 packages from Cisco StarOS running on virtual platforms. An exploit could allow an attacker to implement a DoS condition."

Accessing the billing data is really easy for anyone because it simply enters the system and the bill is accessed after modifying the URL. Exposed data include sensitive information such as addresses, names, mobile numbers, banks, billing records, call history, etc. The data is now available in CVS format for downloading. Specialists in enterprise data protection services report that the security breach was identified thanks to the report of a user to FACUA, a civil organization of consumer rights in Spain, which has referred to this breach as the biggest of all security breaches in the history of telecommunications in the country. FACUA has filed a complaint with the Spanish Data Protection Agency (AEPD), the department responsible for implementing the European Unions General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). According to the GDPR, Telefnica could receive a fine of up to 20M or request that it pay a fine equivalent to between 2 and 4% of its annual revenues. It is worth mention that in Spain, the data protection law includes only fines of a range between 300K and 600K, but FACUA considers these amounts as derisory and they plan to appeal. According to reports from experts in enterprise data protection services from the International Institute of Cyber Security, Telefnica spokespersons say that there has been no fraudulent access to customer information, yet the company informed the Competent authorities on the situation and has also solved the problem, so they expect to be dismissed the demands of FACUA."

Experts in enterprise data protection services agree that a clients digital identity is often the key to accessing services and interacting over the Internet. Microsoft has invested a lot in the security and privacy of its identity solutions for individuals (Microsoft account) and enterprises (Azure Active Directory). The company has made major investments in the creation, implementation, and enhancement of identity-related specifications that foster solid authentication, secure login, API security, and other critical infrastructure tasks, such as IETF, W3C or OpenID Foundation. In recognition of that strong commitment to users security, Microsoft launches its Identity Bounty Program. If you are an information security researcher who has discovered any security vulnerability in some identity authentication service, Microsoft would appreciate your help to share it with them directly and give them the opportunity to solve it before publishing the technical details. In addition to the companys commitment to industry identity standards, Microsoft is expanding its rewards for this type of research. Submissions prepared for this rewards program must meet a fully-ratified identity standard in the scope of this reward, in addition to meeting other specifications. What does your submission require to be eligible? This program, designed for information security and enterprise data protection services experts, is looking for high quality submissions that reflect a certain research level. The goal should be to share your knowledge and experience with Microsoft developers and engineers so that they can understand and apply your findings quickly and efficiently, so the vulnerability can be patched. Vulnerability reports provided to Microsoft must meet the following requirements to be eligible for bounty payment: Identify critical or important vulnerability that has never been reported and coul be reproduced in Microsoft identity services listed within the scope Identify an original, non-reported vulnerability that results in the takeover of a Microsoft account or an Azure Active Directory account Identify an original vulnerability and not previously reported in the OpenID standards listed or with the protocol implemented in Microsoft certified products, services or libraries The vulnerability must work against any version of the Microsoft Authenticator application, but the rewards will only be paid if the error is played in the most recent version publicly available You must include a description of the problem and concise steps for its execution in simple words Describe the impact of the vulnerability Describe an attack vector in case this is not obvious Scope windows.net microsoftonline.com live.com live.com windowsazure.com activedirectory.windowsazure.com activedirectory.windowsazure.com office.com microsoftonline.com Microsoft Authenticator (Android &amp; iOS apps) How are the rewards established? The rewards for each submission fall within a range of $500 to $100K. Higher payments are granted depending on the quality of the report and the vulnerabilitys security impact. Security investigators are encouraged to provide the most data at the time they make their submissions to make them more prone to the highest possible payment. Lower amounts are usually given for vulnerabilities that require too much user interaction for exploitation. If multiple bug reports are received for the same problem from different parts, the reward will be given to the report that is sent first. The first external report received on an internally known issue will receive a maximum of 10% of the maximum payment. If a duplicate report provides Microsoft with new information that was previously unknown, a differential payment will be granted to the duplicated report. If a report is potentially eligible for multiple rewards programs, you will receive the highest payment of a single rewards program. Microsoft reserves the right to refuse any payment to a project that does not meet the established standards. A high quality report provides the information needed for an engineer to reproduce, understand and quickly solve the problem. This includes a concise wording that contains any required background information, a description of the error, and a proof of concept. Many Microsoft sites share a common platform. Because of this, an informed vulnerability in a domain can exist in another domain if the problem exists on the shared platform. For example, a reported issue for account.microsoft.com can also occur exactly the same way in account.microsoft.co.uk and the problem will be resolved in both sites with the same solution. The company requests researchers in information security and enterprise data protection services to confirm this first, and to include the other vulnerable locations in a single report instead of submitting several reports. In these cases, Microsoft will treat the error as a single report, while the following reports will be treated as duplicates. How to create test accounts to make eligible reports for the rewards program? You must create test accounts and try tenants to perform security tests. For Azure services, you can start a free trial to use as your test account here: URL For the Microsoft account, you can set up your test account here: URL In all cases, when possible, include the string MSOBB  in your account name and/or tenants name to identify that you are in use for the error bonus program. For further inquiries about this program and its rules, you can contact bounty@microsoft.com. Note: Microsoft cannot predetermine possible payments prior to the official submission of a vulnerability report."

Policy Suite brings a framework for building rules that can be used to enforce business logic against policy enforcement points such as network routers and packet-data gateways. It is mainly used by organizations that operate with wireless and mobile systems. According to enterprise data protection services experts, the vulnerability is due to the lack of authentication, which means a hacker could access and make changes to existing repositories and create new ones. In addition, a particular vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to log into an affected system using the root account, which has default user credentials. An exploit could allow the hacker to login to the affected system and execute arbitrary commands as the root user. Cisco has also launched patches for its SD-WAN solution, with seven high-rate alerts, and its VPN subsystem. For the SD-WAN solution, there are Denial of Service and file overwriting vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities affect previous versions of the 18.2.0 software, and there are no mid-term solutions that can fix it. The tech company has released free software updates that aim the vulnerability, and its security incident response team believes there has been no malicious use. Last week, specialists in enterprise data protection services reported the rise of different vulnerabilities that would affect Ciscos Internet phone call service by VoIP."

Like its predecessors, these last two vulnerabilities arise during the speculative execution process, with the difference that none of them resolves with recently issued patches and updates. According to enterprise data protection services experts, the exploitation of variant 1.1 (CVE-2018-3693) may cause the theft of sensitive information, while variant 1.2 (no CVE number yet) can be exploited to overwrite read only data and code pointers in order to breach into the sandboxes. In addition, researchers warn that no effective analysis is available to generically detect or mitigate the vulnerability Spectre 1.1. On the other hand, the previously established mitigations against Specter-V1 using a speculative barrier could be an effective countermeasure. Like many of its predecessors, variants 1.1 and 1.2 affect Intel and ARM processors, and most likely AMD processors. Experts in enterprise data protection services refer to Spectre 1.1 as a lesser variant of Spectre 1 that leverages speculative reserves to create speculative buffer overflows, allowing attackers to access the protected CPU memory. Meanwhile, information security specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security describe Spectre 1.2 as a lesser variant of Specter-V1, similar to the Spectre-V3 variant. While this is concerning, notices from various groups of information security experts point out that malicious code must already be present in the system so that errors can be exploited, stating that the complexity and requirement of a previous infection make the exploitation of these vulnerabilities unlikely in the near future. In more related news, Greg Walden, president of the Congress Energy and Trade Committee, and John Thune, president of the Senates Committee on Trade, Science and Transportation, jointly published a letter expressing concern about how vulnerability disclosure process could be improved. In the document, legislators ask for consideration of these concerns and updating of recommended policies and procedures for attacking or facing vulnerabilities."

According to reports of enterprise data protection services experts, only in the first half of this year, ZDI has published 600 reports, and the number keeps increasing. An advantage of buying so many bug reports is that researchers can orient themselves to specific areas of interest to improve the protection protocols for computer users. For example, ZDI added a virtualization category to its Pwn2Own event to see what kind of exploits might escape from a guest Operating System, and the results were extraordinary. This is one of the main reasons for the latest addition to the existing ZDI bug reward program: Targeted Icentive Program, which contributes more than $1.5M in special rewards for specific targets. ZDI wants to increase the number of critical server vulnerabilities it receives from the information security research community. From August 1, Targeted Incentive Program (TIP) offers a special monetary reward for specific targets, but only for the first successful entry and only for a certain period of time. At the beginning of this program, ZDI started primarily with open source server-side products used by its customers and the computer community in general. These are the initial targets, their awards and the time limit for each category: iniciativadiacero This means that researchers and enterprise data protection services experts have until the end of September to be able to obtain $25K for a Drupal or Joomla exploit. They have until the end of October to earn $35K for a WordPress exploit, and so on for each of the other categories. The first investigator to provide a fully functional exploit and demonstrate remote code execution wins the full reward amount. Once the prize is claimed, the target will be removed from the list and a new target will be added to the list. To be electable for rewards, the report must demonstrate that the exploit actually works, not just as a proof of concept. Reported vulnerabilities must be true zero-day vulnerabilities and must affect the central code of the selected target. ZDI will not accept entries in complementary components. A successful entry must exploit a vulnerability (or vulnerabilities) to modify the standard execution path of a program or process in order to allow arbitrary commands to run. Successful entries must thwart objective mitigations designed to ensure safe execution of the code. The objectives must be executed in the latest and updated version of the operating system available for the selected target unless otherwise noted. Any doubts the researchers in enterprise data protection services could have, may be solved via e-mail. The first exploit to successfully compromise a target will receive the prize amount indicated for that specific target. Subsequent reports received by the program through its standard process could also be purchased by ZDI. Once the objectives are committed or the end date of a category is reached, additional objectives will be added to the program. So far, ZDI has more than $1M in rewards reserved for future targets. New targets can and will be added to the list based on the orientation of the ZDI team in conjunction with the Trend Micro teams. Reports submitted to the program will be handled through the standard Zero Day Iniciative Researcher Agreement and Disclosure. This also means that once notified, providers will have 120 days to launch a public security patch. If you, as a researcher or expert in enterprise data protection services expert, are interested in participating but still have questions related to the program, you can send an email to ZDI. Questions made through Twitter, blogs, or any other media will not be recognized and/or answered."

The vulnerability was identified and disclosed by information technology security investigators in an Israeli information security provider operating without servers. The vulnerability existed in Apache OpenWhisk, an open-source, serverless cloud platform used by thousands of reputable companies around the world, including IBM. A hacker who managed to override or modify the code of the serverless function could perform other actions, such as filtering confidential data during subsequent executions, which may belong to other ultimate users claims the enterprise data protection services team who disclosed the vulnerability. Identified as CVE-2018-11756 and CVE-2018-11757, the vulnerability is the first publicly disclosed on a serverless platform. Yet there is good news; not only did IBM manage to correct the vulnerability before it was exploited, but the investigators responsible for reporting it also provided the OpenWhisk team with suggestions for solutions to mitigate the risks. As a result, Apache has also released a patch, while researchers suggest that Apache Openwhisk users should upgrade to the latest available version as soon as possible. After receiving and validating the details of this flaw, the Apache OpenWhisk team reviewed and introduced a solution that mitigates the risk to users, as mentioned by the developers of the Apache OpenWhisk project. We would like to thank the enterprise data protection services experts, as their contribution has helped to make the OpenWhisk platform safer. The security of the functions is an important element of serverless computers, so it was mandatory, for both IBM and for Apache OpenWhisk, that these failures were resolved and that the risks were mitigated."

Thanks to this failure it was possible to hijack video and audio transmitted from the properties of other people making a small adjustment to the Swann Security app. Specialists in enterprise data protection services found the problem after the BBC reported a case in which a client had received recordings from another Swann camera user, causing the discomfort of the exposed user. Swann and OzVision, the Israeli provider of their cloud technology, said the problem had already been solved. Swann mentioned that the vulnerability had been limited to a model, the SWWHD-Intcam, also known as the Swann Smart Security Camera, which went on sale for the first time in October 2017, and can be found in stores like Walmart and Amazon. Anyway, there is concern that cameras from other companies compatible with OzVision support may have problems too. Open access A team of enterprise data protection services from different information security consultants teamed up to investigate the problem: Ken Munro, Andrew Tierney, Vangelis Stykas, Alan Woodward and Scott Helme. The group of experts discovered a new vulnerability; the free software tools commonly used in the cyber security industry could be used to intercept messages sent from OzVisions computer servers to the Safe by Swann app. Safe by Swann is used to view motion detection recordings through a smartphone. Intercepted messages included references to a unique serial number given to each camera in the factory. By altering the serial number, the investigators were able to get video from other cameras, something they tried writing numbers from other cameras they had bought. At no time were they asked to enter the user names and passwords of the other accounts. They also found a way to identify the serial numbers used by the Swann cameras, which theoretically gave researchers the ability to see any active account and move quickly from one to the other, although they did not access any account, because this would threaten the Computer Misuse Act. Instead, the group of experts in enterprise data protection services reported the vulnerability to Swann, which recognized the flaw. Swann managed to detect the flaw in question for early attention to the vulnerability, the companys spokespersons mentioned. After reporting the problem with the Swann chamber, the researchers found that an EU-based security consultant had identified a previous problem with Flir FX, another brand backed by OzVision, with two models of compromised cameras, the FXV101H and the FXV101W."

Identified as CVE-2018-5383, the vulnerability affects the firmware or operating system software drivers of several relevant vendors, including Apple, Broadcom, Intel and Qualcomm, it is still unknown if the flaw is also present in Google , Android and Linux. The security vulnerability is related to two Bluetooth features: low-energy Bluetooth implementations of Secure Connection Pairing in the operating system software, and Secure Simple Pairing implementations in the device firmware. How does it work? Researchers specialized in enterprise data protection services found that the Bluetooth specification recommends, but does not forces compatible devices with the two features to validate the public encryption key received during secure pairing. Since this specification is optional, some Bluetooth products vendors that support the two features do not sufficiently validate the parameters used to generate public keys during the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. In this case, a non-authenticated remote attacker within the range of encountered devices during the pairing process may launch a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack to obtain the cryptographic key used by the device, allowing them to break into supposedly encrypted devices to steal data that is air-streamed and inject malware. Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), in charge of maintaining the technology, mentions in a statement: For an attack to be successful, an attacking device should be within the wireless range of two vulnerable Bluetooth devices that were in pairing process. The attacking device would have to intercept the exchange of public keys by blocking each transmission, sending an acknowledgement to the transmitting device and then injecting the malware into the receiving device within a short period of time. If only one device had the vulnerability, the attack would not succeed. Reports of specialists in enterprise data protection services comment that Bluetooth technology uses a device matching mechanism based on the Diffie-Hellman Elliptical Curve Key Exchange (ECDH) to allow encrypted communication between devices. The ECDH key exchange implies a private and public key, and public keys are exchanged to produce a shared pairing key. Devices must also agree on the elliptical curve parameters that are used, but in some cases, these parameters are not sufficiently validated, allowing remote attackers within range to inject an invalid public key to determine the session key with high probability. Installing patches from the developers Bluetooth SIG has updated the Bluetooth specification to require that the products validate the public keys received as part of the public key-based security procedures. In addition, the organization has also added evidence for this vulnerability within its Bluetooth qualification process. Information security experts commented that patches are needed in both the firmware and operating system software drivers, which must be obtained from the vendors and developers of the affected products. Apple, Broadcom, Intel, and Qualcomm affected so far Apple, Broadcom, Intel, and Qualcomm are the main vendors affected by the Bluetooth flaw, while Google, Android, and Linux have not yet confirmed the existence of the vulnerability in their respective products. Microsoft products are not vulnerable. As for the state of vulnerability in each manufacturer, specialists in enterprise data protection services comment on the progress of companies: Apple and Intel have already released update patches. Broadcom comments that some of its most recent products may be affected by the flaw, but claims it has already been resolved. Qualcomm has not spoken about the vulnerability. Bluetooth SIG adds that there is no evidence that the failure has been exploited for malicious purposes; while experts in enterprise data protection services from the International Institute of Cyber Security affirm that there are no projects for developing devices able to exploit vulnerability in an efficient way."

According to reports, the vulnerability was discovered through the companys newsletter that was received by a user of the service. By clicking on the unsubscribe option of the newsletter, a page showing the subscribers key appeared. That allowed the user to create a script that was able to extract keys and email addresses for other users.

The spokesperson from the Idaho Department of Corrections, Jeff Ray, says the departments Special Investigations Unit discovered the problem earlier this month, and that the crime did not involve taxpayer funds. According to reports from experts in enterprise data protection services, JPay is a service provided for different correction institutions that provides support technology in activities such as money transfer, email and video call visits. The service can transfer money through an electronic payment system that includes credit and debit payments on an inmates account. These tablets are popular in prisons along the country and are available to Idaho inmates through a contract with CenturyLink and JPay. None of the companies have made further statements about the incident. The spokesman said in his statement that the prisoners were intentionally exploiting some vulnerability within the JPay system to unduly increase their JPay account balances. He added that 50 inmates credited amounts exceeding $1K in their accounts; the largest amount found in a single-prisoner account was a little less than $10K. The total amount of the robbery was almost $225K. Individuals involved in the robbery are held at the Idaho State Correctional Facility, Idaho State Correctional Center, Idaho Correctional Facility, southern Idaho Correctional Facility, and in the facilities of the Alternative Correctional Placement, operated by the private prison company MTC Inc. For specialists in enterprise data protection services from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this is a very serious security flaw, as the inmates were able to build a network capable of compromising software contracted by correctional institutions that may be not secure enough to work with."

This is the first printing hardware security flaw bounty program for industry, according to the companys statement. HP will work with Bugcrowd to manage vulnerability reports addressed to the organization. Any discovered vulnerability that aspires to receive rewards from this program must be reported to Bugcrowd, which will verify the found flaws and offer a reward of up to $10K depending on the bugs severity. If there was a bug report that the company has already registered, enterprise network security specialists could still receive compensation. HP launched the program last May with the participation of 34 researchers. Since then, the company has already made a $10K payment to a hacker who found a serious vulnerability in one of HPs printing devices. The company decided to focus on the security of printers due to vulnerabilities found in Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In many cases, printers are the IoT device that is most commonly found in any house, although conversations about security flaws tend to focus on things like smart TVs or some other home supplies instead of printers. Enterprise network security researchers from the International Institute of Cyber Security claim that printers are not immune to hacker attacks. For example, its well-known the case of the Mirai botnet, which a couple of years ago managed to compromise a large number of devices, including printers. Printers suffer a considerable number of vulnerabilities, according to reports from experts in information security. Many attackers use PostScript malware to manipulate documents that are printed or to capture their content, compromising users personal information."
192,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Multiple flaws found in Samsung SmartThings Hub,1,94b8nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/94b8nh/multiple_flaws_found_in_samsung_smartthings_hub/,2018-08-04 02:49:58,"Enterprise network security researchers found dozens of flaws that could expose smart home devices to attacks Enterprise network security experts discovered 20 vulnerabilities present in the firmware of Samsungs SmartThings Hub controller that would potentially expose any compatible smart home device to cyber attacks. These vulnerabilities could allow a hacker to execute Operating System commands or other arbitrary code on the affected devices. Samsung SmartThings Hub is a central controller that can be used to manage a wide range of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in a smart home environment, including smart plugs, LED light bulbs, thermostats and cameras. Access to these IoT devices could allow hackers to collect sensitive information managed by devices within the smart home and perform unauthorized activities. Samsung SmartThings Hub runs a Linux-based firmware and allows communication with several IoT devices that use wireless standards such as Zigbee, Z-Wave and Bluetooth. Enterprise network security experts explained that hackers need to chain several existing vulnerabilities to exploit the SmartThings Hub flaws. Experts identified three strings, one of which is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability that can be exploited without previous authentication. Remote Code Execution chain  CVE-2018-3911 This RCE affects the hubs HTTP server; it could be exploited by hackers to inject HTTP requests into this process from another network. This is an exploitable HTTP header injection vulnerability that exists within communications between the hub and remote servers. The flaw could be exploited by sending specially-designed HTTP requests to vulnerable devices. Other chains Other chains identified by the investigators could be exploited only by an attacker with previous authentication. The first chain exploits the vulnerability CVE-2018-3879, allowing authenticated attackers to execute SQL queries against a database running on the IoT device. Enterprise network security experts remark that chaining this vulnerability to a string of other memory corruption vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2018-3880, CVE-2018-3906, CVE-2018-3912 to CVE-2018-3917 and CVE-2018-3919) affecting the Samsung SmartThings Hub makes it possible to execute arbitrary code on the network. Experts noted that CVE-2018-3879 can also be exploited in the last chain attack for remote information leaking. This vulnerability can be used to create an empty file inside the device. By stringing the 3 vulnerabilities in an established order, an attacker can get a memory emptying of the HubCore process, which contains most of the central logic, and hence sensitive device information. Experts in enterprise network security tested and confirmed that the 0.20.17 firmware version of the Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 is compromised by these vulnerabilities. Enterprise network security experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that Samsung is already working on vulnerabilities and update patches will be installed automatically."

The good news is that the possible exploitation of the vulnerability depends on social engineering, which means that the attack cannot be automatically deployed; therefore its danger level is considered low for regular computer users. The flaw is related to the Same Origin Policy (SOP) Specialists in enterprise network security comment that the vulnerability involves the Same Origin Policy (SOP), which supports any browser. In Edge, and in any other search engine, SOP works by preventing an attacker from loading malicious code through a link that does not match the same domain, Port, and protocol. SOP implementation in Edge works as planned, with just one exception  when users download a malicious HTML file on their PC and then run it. When the user executes this HTML file, its malicious code is loaded through the file:// protocol, and as it is a local file, it has no domain and port value. This means that this malicious HTML file may contain code to collect and steal data from local files that can be accessed via file:// URL. As you can access any operating system file through a file:// URL within a browser, this gives the hacker access to collect and extract any local file. Useful vulnerability in targeted attacks Experts in enterprise network security say that during the testing process they were able to steal data from local computers and send them to a remote server when running this file in Edge and in the Mail and Calendar app. Completely exploiting the vulnerability requires the hacker to know where the files are stored, but in most cases some operating system configuration and storage files and apps are stored in the same location for almost all devices. In addition, the location of some files can be simply deduced or guessed. The flaw could be useful in more targeted attacks against victims working with valuable assets. Although Microsoft has dealt with this issue in the latest versions of the Edge and Mail and Calendar apps, enterprise network security specialists warn users about the dangers of executing HTML files they receive from strangers or by email, valid warning as HTML files are generally not associated with common malware distribution campaigns."

Enterprise network security specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that hundreds of HP Inkjet printers have two remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities and need to be patched immediately. According to a security statement, two security vulnerabilities have been identified within certain HP inkjet printers. A maliciously-created file sent to an affected device can cause a static or stack buffer overflow, which could allow RCE, the company says. By mentioning certain printers, HP refers to 166 models of multifunction printers for companies that are likely to be connected to computer networks, although it has not explained how vulnerable printers could be used by hackers to exploit these networks. The affected models include several versions of their popular OfficeJet, DeskJet, and Envy printers, as well as the DesignJet and PageWide Pro printers. The two bugs were identified as CVE-2018-5924 and CVE-2018-5925. HP has released firmware updates for affected printers through its pages, where customers can search for their specific model. This event coincides with HPs announcement last week of its vulnerability bounty program, which offers between $500 and $10K for enterprise network security specialists to find flaws on their devices. The program provides experts with remote access to various printers and multifunctionals to analyze the potential of possible malicious actions at the firmware level, including spoofing inter-site requests, remote code execution, and scripting flaws. One of the challenges for companies is that directors of enterprise network security often do not participate in the purchase of printers. The company is partnering with Bugcrowd to manage vulnerability reports and rewards. In 2009, enterprise network security experts pointed out flaws in a series of HP LaserJet printers that threatened corporate networks because machines were unable to verify digital signatures before installing a firmware update."

The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-14773, resides in a component of a third-party library, called Symfony HttpFoundation component, which is being used in Drupal Core and affects Drupal 8.x versions prior to 8.5.6. Given that Symfony, a web application framework with a set of PHP components, is being used by many projects, the vulnerability could potentially put several web applications at risk of being hacked. Symfony Component Vulnerability According to a statement published by Symfony, the security bypass vulnerability its caused due to Symfony support for risky HTTP headers. A remote attack can exploit the vulnerability with a specially designed HTTP x-Original-url or x-rewrite-URL header value, which overrides the path in the request URL to potentially prevent access restrictions and make the target system display a different URL. The vulnerability has already been corrected in the Symfony versions 2.7.49, 2.8.44, 3.3.18, 3.4.14, 4.0.14 and 4.1.3, and Drupal has corrected the problem in its latest version 8.5.6. The same flaw exists in Zend In addition to Symfony, Drupals enterprise network security specialist teams discovered that there is also a similar vulnerability in the Zend Feed and Diactors libraries included in Drupal Core, which they called URL rewrite vulnerability. However, the popular content management system mentioned that Drupal Core does not use the vulnerable functionality, but recommended that users patch their website, if their site or module uses Zend Feed Diactors directly. Drupal powers millions of websites and, unfortunately, the content management system has recently been under attack since the highly critical code remote execution vulnerability, known as Drupalgeddon2, was discovered. So that being said, before hackers began to exploit the new bug to take control of your websites, enterprise network security specialists recommend updating your sites as soon as possible."

The nature of the attacks on computer security continues to evolve. Unless the systems could be also developed to counteract these threats, they will remain an easy target. While conventional security measures are necessary, it is important to keep in perspective the people or organizations that could potentially attack our systems. Different organizations have allowed a category of hackers, known as [ethical hackers](URL or white-hat hackers, to identify possible system vulnerabilities and provide suggestions for fixing them. With the express consent of the leaders of the organizations, the ethical hackers penetrate in a holistic way in the systems to implement various security measures that allow systems to continue operating normally against the threats of attacks from other hackers. **Is white hat hacking really necessary?** According to experts from the [International Institute of Cyber Security](URL it is not really obligatory for an organization to hire the services of a hacker, but basic computer security systems have shown repeated failures in providing accurate protection against a rival who shows increasing growth and variety of resources. With the proliferation of intelligent devices connected to the network, the systems are under constant threat. In fact, currently hacking has been shown as a possibility of lucrative business, practiced at the expense of attacked organizations. As Bruce Schneier, author of the book Protect Your Macintosh, mentions, its easy to protect your hardware, just put it under lock, chain it to your desk, or buy another one. Taking care of information is more complicated. It can be in more than one place; it can be carried from one side of the world to the other just in seconds and be stolen without your knowledge. Unless you have great resources, your information technology department will be inferior to the onslaught of hackers, and valuable information can be stolen before you know it. That is why it is pertinent to add an area to the Information Technology Department of your organization, hiring white hat hackers who know how to act as malicious hackers. Otherwise, your organization will run the risk of leaving tickets to your systems. **Knowing Hackers Methods** To prevent hacking it is important to understand how hackers think. The conventional security programs stop working as soon as the hacker makes his entry, it is obvious that hackers have all different ways of acting, so that systems are exceeded, which makes necessary the emergence of an ethical hacker who can enter the system the way a black hat hacker would do it, but trying to find security deficiencies. **Penetrating test** It is used to find the vulnerabilities of the system that could be attacked by a hacker. There are various methods to apply a penetration test that organizations use according to their needs. *Targeted tests involve people in the organization and the hacker. The staff of the Organization knows all about the attack that will take place. *External testing penetrates all externally exposed systems, such as Web servers and DNS. Internal tests discover open vulnerabilities for internal users with access privileges. *Blind tests simulate real hacker attacks. The testing organization receives limited information about the target, requiring them to perform a reconnaissance prior to the attack. Penetrating tests is the most common case for hiring ethical hackers. **Identify vulnerabilities** No system is completely immune to attacks. Organizations need to provide protection at different levels. Ethical hacking represents an opportunity to cover these levels. A good example is the case study of a large organization in the manufacturing sector. The organization knew its limitations in terms of information security, but could not do much for itself. Then, they hired ethical hackers to evaluate their security system and provide his findings and recommendations. The report included the following components: Recommendations for improving computer security of the system, such as the implementation of an incident response system, complete implementation of a vulnerability management program and more comprehensive strengthening guidelines. **Preparing for an attack** Attacks are inevitable no matter how strong a system is. In the end, an attacker will find vulnerability or two. This article has already established that cyber attacks are inevitable. That does not mean that organizations should stop reinforcing their security system, but quite the opposite. Cyber attacks have evolved and the only way to prevent or minimize damage is a good preparation. One way to prepare anti-attack systems is to allow ethical hackers to identify vulnerabilities in advance. There are many examples of this and it is pertinent to look at the example of the Department of Homeland Security of the United States. DHS uses an extremely large and complex system that stores and processes large volumes of sensitive data. Data violation is a serious threat, and like threatening national security. DHS realized that making ethical hackers enter their system before hackers did it was an intelligent way to raise the level of preparation for an attack. Therefore, the DHS Hack Act was passed, which would allow select ethical hackers to enter the DHS system. This Act establishes in detail how the initiative would work. A group of ethical hackers would be hired to enter the DHS system and identify vulnerabilities, if any. For any new vulnerabilities identified, ethical hackers would be financially rewarded. Ethical hackers would not be subject to any legal action because of their actions, although they would have to work under certain restrictions and guidelines. The Act also made it obligatory for all the ethical hackers involved in the program to go through a background check. Like DHS, reputable organizations have hired ethical hackers to raise the level of system security preparation for a long time. **In conclusion** Both ethical hacking and conventional information security must work together to protect organizations. However, companies must develop their strategy towards ethical hacking. They can probably take the example of DHS into this practice. The role and scope of ethical hackers must be clearly defined; it is important for the company to maintain checks and balances so that the hacker does not exceed the scope of the work or cause any damage to the system. The company also needs to give ethical hackers the assurance that no legal action will be taken in the case of a violation as defined in their contract."

The list of affected programs includes Enigmail and GPGTools. About Vulnerability (CVE-2018-12020) The vulnerability CVE-2018-12020, nicknamed SigSpoof by Marcus Brinkmann, the investigator who found it, emerged from weak design choices. According to the specialist, the signature verification routine in Enigmail 2.0.6.1, GPGTools 2018.2 and Python-gnupg 0.4.2 allows remote attackers to falsify signatures through the filename parameter. The attacker can control key identifiers, algorithm specifiers, creation times, and user IDs, and does not need any of the private or public keys involved, adds Brinkmann. The investigator shared several samples of the various possible attacks, such as impersonation of signature, impersonation of signature and encryption, and impersonation of signature on the command line. Security Updates In collaboration with another hacker, he also found the vulnerability CVE-2018-12019 that allows for a similar attack (spoofing of signatures) but specifically aimed at Enigmail. Error CVE-2018-12020 is found in the versions of GnuPG 0.2.2 to 2.2.7, in Enigmail 2.0.6.1 and earlier, in GPGTools 2018.2 and earlier, and in Python-GnuPG 0.4.2 and earlier. All of these packages have already been updated, so if you are using any of them, be sure to upgrade to the latest available version. Any software could be potentially affected. If you use GnuPG in your application, you must verify that it is not affected, and consider some additional security measures, say specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Brinkman is concerned that the vulnerability has potential to affect a large part of the central infrastructure, since in addition to being used for email security, GnuPG is also used to protect backups, software updates and source code in control systems."

According to reports of experts in information security training from the International Institute of Cyber Security, a Google developer has discovered a serious vulnerability that affects Microsoft Edge and other browsers, and that could provide an attack access to the victims private information. Its a huge bug, it means you could visit my site on Edge, and I could read your emails, or have access to your Facebook account, all without you knowing it, wrote Jake Archibald, who found the security hole in a circumstantial way. If exploited, the vulnerability, labeled as CVE-2018-8235, could allow a remote attacker to retrieve content from other tabs within the victims browser. This includes sites that ask users to authenticate themselves. Of the four main search engines, the bug mostly affected Microsoft Edge. Having been alerted about the error, Microsoft released a patch in its June 2018 update. For Firefox, only the beta versions were affected, and Mozilla was quick to correct the error before it could affect the users of their current version; Safari and Chrome were not affected. The bug has to do with the way browsers treat cross-source requests to media content. According to experts in information security training, the vulnerability can be exploited when a malicious website uses service workers to load content into an audio label from another domain while simultaneously using the range parameter to find only one section of that file. Browsers dont always respond in the same way when they upload files inside audio tags from other locations with the help of service workers, and a malicious website can search for that content from another site. Microsoft referred to the bug as a security feature bypass vulnerability that exists when Microsoft Edge treats inappropriately requests from different sources. Information security training experts argue that an attacker who successfully exploits the vulnerability could force the browser to send data that would otherwise be restricted."

203,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Zerodium pays up to $500 000 for zero-day exploits,1,8w5cr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8w5cr8/zerodium_pays_up_to_500_000_for_zeroday_exploits/,2018-07-05 07:53:42,"The sale of zero-day exploits is a very profitable business that most people completely ignore. The International Institute of Cyber Security talks about this practice using the example of Zerodium, a zero-day broker. According to the company itself, Zerodium offers rewards to information security and pentest investigators to acquire its original zero-day vulnerability investigations that affect major operating systems, software and devices. Most of the current exploit bonus programs accept almost any kind of vulnerability, but pay very low rewards, at Zerodium we focus on high-risk vulnerabilities with fully functional exploits, and we pay the highest rewards on the market, claims a statement on their website. Zerodium, like other zero-day brokers, buys investigations and sells them to government and intelligence agencies, but many privacy advocates fear that these failures can be used by surveillance agencies that sell their products to authoritarian regimes. The company offers rewards of up to 500 000 dollars for zero-day exploits on UNIX-based operating systems, including OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD. The same offer is for exploits developed from popular Linux distros such as Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian and tails. The prices of these findings vary by several factors, including market shares of the affected platforms or systems (Windows zero-day exploits are usually more valuable than those for Linux, for example) and the level of users interaction required for exploiting the vulnerabilities. Other influencing factors are reliability to run the exploit, the number of vulnerabilities that attackers need to chain to exploit the error, success rate, and operating system configuration that is necessary for the exploit. According to pentest specialists, in past opportunities Zerodium came to offer up to 1.5 million for a zero-day exploit for iOS. If we look at the price list for zero-day exploits, we can see that operating codes for Linux server environments have great rewards, but mobile exploits remain the most expensive in the research market on vulnerabilities. Recently a new competitor broke into the scene of the zero-day market. Is Crowdfense, which launched an acquisition program with prizes of up to 10 million dollars for research and pentest on this information security researches."

The Tasmanian Electoral Commission states that an attacker still unknown gained access and downloaded a backup file containing voters information such as names, addresses, emails and birth dates. Pentest revealed that the breach occurred through a server of the Barcelona-based company Typeform, whose online forms have been used on the Tasmania Electoral Commission website since 2015 for electoral processes, said Commission in a statement last Saturday. On the other hand, Typeform stated that the vulnerability was identified on June 27, and it was shutted down within half an hour after detection. The Commission said it believes that voters stolen personal information from the online forms were provided by themselves by requesting an express vote in the last state and Legislative Council elections. The statement also claims that the Electoral Commission apologizes for the violation, and will re-evaluate its information collection procedures and internal security elements around electoral storage for future events. Meanwhile, in its statement Typeform said after pentest performing we can say that the leaked data came from a partial backup dated May 3, 2018 and that the risk of recurrence of the attack is now considered sufficiently low to issue this statement. Right after receiving the information, we have implemented pentest and a thorough review of the security of our system. We have identified the origin of the violation and have handled that security vulnerability, the company said. According to reports from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this case has lots of similarities with recent vulnerability samples from companies that work with large volumes of information about their users, such as the attack that Ticketmaster suffered in past days, in which millions of records of its clients were compromised."

In case of failure or loss of reception from the primary time source, the central clock of the plant ensures the steady continuation of the clock time and the monitoring of the time of the system without jumps of time as soon as the reception is restored, says a statement on the Siemens website. Vulnerabilities are identified with codes from CVE-2018-4851 to CVE-2018-4856, three of these failures are considered as critical by pentest experts. SICLOCK TC devices are affected by multiple vulnerabilities that could allow a hacker to cause DoS, bypass authentication, and modify the device or administrative client firmware, can be read in the issued notice by the company. One of the critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-4851) could be exploited attackers with network access to cause denial-of-service (DoS) condition and potentially restart by sending packages especially designed. According to pentest specialists, for this vulnerability to be exploited no user interaction is required. An attacker with network access could cause DoS when sending certain packets to the device, causing possible clock restarts, the security alert continues. The main functionality of the device may be affected. The time service functionality is retrieved when time synchronization is complete with GPS devices. The vulnerability could affect the availability of the device and could affect the integrity of the devices time-service functionality. The second critical vulnerability (CVE-2018-4853) can be exploited by an attacker with access to UDP Port 69 to modify the firmware on a vulnerable device. The flaw could be exploited by an attacker to run his own code on the SICLOCK device. The third critical problem (CVE-2018-4854) can be exploited by an attacker with access to UDP Port 69 to modify the administrative client stored on the device. Siemens has also reported a serious vulnerability that could be exploited by an attacker to bypass authentication process. The other problems discovered by Siemens are medium-gravity flaws that could be exploited to launch a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack and intercept unencrypted passwords stored in the client configuration files, as well as low-gravity flaws that can be exploited by attackers with access to the management interface to block legitimate users. The company is still unaware of the extent to which vulnerabilities could be exploited. The defects affected the devices SICLOCK TC100 and SICLOCK TC400. Siemens has not released updates for the products because they are in phase of elimination, the industrial giant only provided midterm solutions and mitigations to reduce the risk of attacks."
206,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Thermal trace of the keyboard can be used in computer attacks,1,8y16ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8y16ez/thermal_trace_of_the_keyboard_can_be_used_in/,2018-07-12 02:42:30,"A new type of attack would allow a malicious actor to capture the keys pressed on a keyboard using a thermal camera. The discovery was made by pentest experts at the University of California. In simple words, the thermal trace of our fingers over the keyboard can be recorded by a hacker to reveal the users passwords or any other text that you typed. How does it works According to the pentest specialists in charge of the investigation, if the user types his/her password and then moves away from the keyboard, anyone could learn about this routine. The attack, known as Thermonator, can be used to retrieve users sensitive information, such as passwords or short text lines. This attack requires several conditions to function properly. First of all, the attacker must place a special camera with thermal recording capabilities near the victim. The camera should also be able to capture the keys on the victims keyboard, otherwise it will not work. According to the researchers explanation of the Thermonator attack, this is an internal attack variant in which an attack scenario proceeds as follows: The victim uses a keyboard to enter a valid password as part of the computers logon or unlocking procedure. Soon after, the victim moves away from his/her workplace. Using thermal imaging, the attacker collects heat residues on the keyboard. The attacker then uses the heat map left by the user to determine the recently pressed keys. This can be done manually (via visual inspection) or automatically (via software). Once these conditions are fulfilled, the attacker can discover the keys pressed by the victim even without hacking skills. Captured keys can be assembled into possible combinations and can be deployed to perform a dictionary attack, a popular technique for decrypting keys and authentication mechanisms. This is done using hundreds or even millions of possible words. Pentest specialists conducted several experiments where 31 users entered passwords in four different keyboard models. Then, eight people with a user-level computer domain were asked to get the pressed keys using the recorded data from the thermal camera. The results of these tests revealed that the thermal data recorded up to 30 seconds after text entry is sufficient for a non-professional attacker to retrieve the entire set of keys that the selected user has pressed. If you are the type of user who presses the keyboard very slowly, you are more susceptible to experiencing the Thermonator attack. This research exposes the vulnerability of standard password-based systems in front of the possibility of an attack of this nature. Based on the results of the study, information security experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security believe that these attacks represent a considerable threat to this kind of systems, suggesting that it may be time to evaluate passwords as we know them so far."

A data breach has recently been confirmed at the German web hosting company Domainfactory. The company, in possession of GoDaddy since 2016, has eliminated its forums after they began to appear messages of alleged hackers claiming to have intervened Domainfactorys infrastructure. The company notified the data violation to its customers and asked them to change their passwords. Last July 3rd, an unknown person at the Domainfactory forum claimed to have accessed to the companys customer data. We performed pentest and discovered that a non-authorized third party managed to access clients data. The information is now secured, mentioned company spokespersons. We have communicated customers and recommended them to update their Domainfactory passwords. The company also claims to have notified the data protection authorities and pentest experts in charge of the investigation; adding that the protection of the data of its clients is paramount and regretting the inconvenience that the incident may have caused. Domainfactory staff learned of the incident on the afternoon of July 3, 2018, the security team estimates that the vulnerability has been exploited since January 28, 2018. A first investigation and pentest confirms that unauthorized third parties may have had access to several categories of data, including the customers name, company name, customer number, address, email, phone numbers, and Domainfactorys passwords. To face the attackers, the company secured its compromised information security systems. The hack was revealed by German media, which noticed the strange messages of hackers posted on the forums. Particularly, German journalist Fabian Scherschel published that he found a thread on Twitter, before the breachs public disclosure, which stated that Domainfactory customers asked hackers about their data because the company did not respond to their requests. According to reports from the International Institute of Cyber Security, hackers behind the attack may have used a variant of the Dirty Cow vulnerability to accomplish the data breach."

According to [information security](URL experts, these malicious actors had a deep knowledge of the functioning of the system. This attack affected approximately 1,860 bicycles, interrupted the service and did not allow its use between Friday and Saturday. The Copenhagen Post newspaper of Denish said that only 200 bicycles were not affected so it is almost impossible for users to find one during peak hours. Information security researchers are not yet clear what vulnerability exploited the hackers or what were the reasons, as Bycyklen wrote on his page that no data was stolen from any user. However, all data was erased and the entire system fell as a result of the attack that forced Bycyklen to manually update all its bicycles in the city. All the databases were eliminated and, therefore, the system has been out of service. The way in which the attack was carried out is quite primitive, but shows that it has been carried out by a person with knowledge of the structure of our system, said the company. The servers were analyzed after the attack and there are no signs of data loss, the attack has only been directed at our business, not our users. The company does not store payment card information, but it stores email addresses, phone numbers and PIN codes on the server. The publication also indicated that users PINs and passwords are stored in an encrypted format. However, [information security](URL professionals recommend that users change their PINs as soon as possible. In databases, salty password hashing is used, which means that the PINs are encrypted and cannot be read or reproduced, the company explained."

The Safe Links feature designed by Microsoft to protect users from malicious code and phishing attacks is part of Microsofts Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). At the end of October last year, the ATP Safe Links protection was extended to work with web addresses (URL) in emails and URLs in Office 365 ProPlus documents, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint in Windows, iOS and Android devices, and Visio files in Windows. Information security experts explain that this security feature works by replacing URLs in an incoming email with secure URLs owned by Microsoft. At the moment when the user clicks on a link in an incoming email, it redirects the user to a domain operated by Microsoft to verify the original URL. If the scan detects a malicious activity, then it warns the users; otherwise, the user will be redirected to the original link. BaseStriker takes advantage of the URL &lt;base&gt; tag in the header of an HTML email to divide and disguise a malicious link, information security experts say. BaseStriker refers to the method used to exploit this vulnerability: divide and disguise a malicious link using a tag called &lt;base&gt; URL tag says the analysis published by Avanan. This attack sends a malicious link, which would usually be blocked by Microsoft. In the tests of the baseStriker technique they showed that Office 365 users are vulnerable. The vulnerability has been tested in various configurations, the proof is that anyone who uses Office 365 in any configuration is vulnerable, Gmail does not have this problem, if you are protecting Office 365 with Mimecast, you are sure, but Proofpoint is also vulnerable. says the publication. [Information security](URL professionals commented that malicious actors are already using baseStriker to carry out phishing campaigns, they also warn that the technique can be exploited to distribute malware. Avanan reported on baseStriker to Microsoft and Proofpoint last weekend, but there is still no patch available. Because the vulnerability is already known, an immediate step would be to notify users and reinforce the risk of phishing attacks."

The [information security](URL experts found that two applications, which appeared to be normal, hosted by Canonical, contained a cryptocurrency miner disguised as the systemd daemon. These affected applications sent a start script to automatically load the malicious code during startup and thus allow it to run in the background. Canonical commented that it has eliminated all the requests of this author pending further investigations. Canonical learned of this error through a Github problem over the weekend, information security experts commented. Snap Store does not provide public installation numbers for the applications it contains, because of this it is not clear how many Linux users have been affected by this problem, it is important to note that both applications were only loaded at the end of April. Now many users will wonder how this was allowed to happen in the first place. The code was first found by a Github user tarwirdur in an application that purported to be a version of the 2048 game. Upon realizing that the application added a system startup script, they reviewed it and found that it was for a cryptocurrency mining tool. The [information security](URL expert duly verified another application loaded in the Snap store by the same developer. They found that it contained the same mining script ByteCoin, linked to the same email address. This is the first major security problem in Snappys packaging system. This error is not necessarily as frightening as it seems at first, nor is it necessarily an error with the Snappy format. The applications loaded in the Snap store go through automatic tests to ensure that they work and install correctly for users in Linux distributions, commented professionals. Applications are not reviewed line by line to detect something suspicious or out of the ordinary. Therefore, there was simply no way to detect or prevent this malware. The pre-detection would have been difficult given that both affected applications were loaded as proprietary software. Your code was not available to verify. According to [information security](URL experts, cryptocurrency miners can be considered malware since they are not mentioned in the description and used system resources without permission or knowledge of the user for an unauthorized task. It is likely that the author of the application was not intentionally malicious; given the lack of effort to disguise the malware, they may have been trying to draw attention to vulnerability in Snapcrafts research model. Even though this bundleware package was distributed as a Snap, it did not take advantage of a specific Snap defect. The Bytecoin miner could have been included with an application and distributed through a PPA, an AppImage, a shared installer script on Github, and so on, said information security researchers. We must be cautious about the type of software that it installs and the places where it is installed. Install applications only from sources, developers and repositories that you trust. Only use applications packaged by an official maintainer or a reliable source."

[Information security](URL researchers commented that standard operator settings disable signature verification, as a result, Server x BIOS / UEFI versions do not authenticate the signed code correctly before starting it. In Lenovos internal tests they found that some versions of System x server BIOS / UEFI that, when safe boot mode is enabled, do not authenticate correctly the signed code before starting it, this means that an attacker with access physical to the system could start the unsigned code, says the security advisory. Lenovo ships systems with Secure Boot disabled by default, because the signed code is new in the data center environment, and standard operator settings disable signature checking.

A member of the [information security](URL team of Google, Felix Wilhelm, found a critical vulnerability of remote injection of commands in the implementation of Red Hat Linux DHCP client; the problem also affects other distributions, such as Fedora. Malicious hackers could exploit the vulnerability, CVE-2018-1111, to execute arbitrary commands with administrator privileges on specific systems. Red Hat is aware of a command injection vulnerability found in a script included in the DHCP client packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. says the Red Hat security advisory. A malicious DHCP server, or a malicious actor in the local network capable of impersonating DHCP responses, can use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands with administrator privileges on systems using NetworkManager that is configured to obtain network configuration using the protocol DHCP.  [Information security](URL professionals comment that the DHCP client application receives the network configuration parameters, including the IP address and DNS servers, from the DHCP server (Dynamic Host Control Protocol). The injection failure of the CVE-2018-1111 command falls on the NetworkManager integration script of the DHCP client packages on Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The information security researcher Barkn Kl published a PoC for the CVE-2018-1111, where you can see how the attacker accesses the shell as root. Felix Wilhelm did not show a PoC exploit code, but said that it is so short that it can even fit in a tweet. The security expert said that a hacker using a malicious DHCP server or connected to the same network as the victim can use this vulnerability by falsifying DHCP responses, allowing him to execute arbitrary commands with administrator privileges in the system of the victim running the vulnerable DHCP client. As mentioned in the security advisor, the vulnerability affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. It is recommended that administrators update their packages to the newer versions as soon as possible. Red Hat also said that, Users also have the option to remove or disable the vulnerable script, but this will prevent some configuration parameters provided by the DHCP server from being configured on a local system, such as the addresses of local servers in NTP or NIS. The [information security](URL expert said that, some Linux distros like OpenSUSE and Ubuntu are not strained by the vulnerability because their DHCP client implementation doesnt include NetworkManager integration script by default. The experts leave us the full list of affected RHEL versions: Advanced Update Support 6.4; Extended Update Support 7.3; Advanced Update Support 6.6; Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6; Extended Update Support 6.7; Advanced Update Support 7.2; Server TUS (v.6.6); RHEL 7; Extended Update Support 7.4; Virtualization 4 Management Agent for RHEL 7 Hosts; Advanced Update Support 6.5; and Linux Server TUS (v. 7.2).

216,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,New Spectre variation allow attackers recover data from System Management Mode,1,8mu5ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8mu5ts/new_spectre_variation_allow_attackers_recover/,2018-05-29 08:57:01,"A team of experts from Eclypsium presented a new variation of the Spectre attack, which allows attackers to recover the data hosted within the CPU system management mode. [Information security](URL researchers devised this new variation that can allow attackers to recover the data stored within the System Administration Mode of the CPU (SMM) (also known as ring -2). Experts excuse that SMM is an operating mode of x86 CPU in which normal execution is suspended, also the operating system. If a code is sent to the SMM, the operating system is suspended and part of the UEFI / BIOS firmware executes commands with elevated privileges and with access to all data and hardware. Professionals say, One benefit of SMM is that it offers a distinct and isolated processor environment that operates transparently for the operating system or the executive and software applications. SMM mode was launched with Intel 386SL in the 90s. Intel CPUs run a memory protection mechanism, better known as range logging to protect sensitive contents of memory regions, SMM memory. Information security experts commented that the SMM memory in Intel CPUs is protected by a type of range registers, better known as the System Administration Range Register (SMRR). This study was based on a public concept test code for the vulnerability of the Specter 1 variant, CVE-2017-5753, to evade the SMRR mechanism and access the system management RAM (SMRAM) stored by the SMM and in where the SMM job data is executed. Since SMM normally has privileged access to physical memory, research shows that Specter-based attacks can expose other secrets in memory, says the Eclypsium research report. These attacks allow an unprivileged malicious actor to read the contents of memory, such as SMM memory, exposing the SMM code and data that should be confidential, revealing vulnerabilities and data stored in SMM. The [information security](URL professionals brought the PoC code to a kernel driver and showed how it works from the kernels privilege level. Then they exploit the code from the privilege level of the kernel against the protected memory. Experts explained that, The kernel-level PoC exploit grants access to hardware interfaces, which gives malicious actors better control over the system hardware and access to different hardware interfaces such as physical memory, IO, PCI and interfaces. MMIO, in turn, also grants access to interfaces with a higher privilege level, such as SMI software.  Afterwards, the PoC exploit is integrated into CHIPSEC to expand the tests. In our experiment, we tried to read the protected SMRAM memory, we mapped the physical addresses of SMRAM in the virtual address space and the SMRAM addresses were used as the target of exploit. , added the information security researchers. It is believed that it is possible to obtain the same result using the Specter 2 variant (CVE-2017-5715). The new technique was reported to Intel in March. Intel commented that the security updates released for the Specter variant 1 and 2 should be sufficient to mitigate this new attack."
217,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,How to exploit two zero-days vulnerabilities simultaneously in a single attack: unicorn attack,1,8mu73r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8mu73r/how_to_exploit_two_zerodays_vulnerabilities/,2018-05-29 09:02:16,"In an unusual case someone managed to develop a malware attack that, with one click, exploits separate zero-day vulnerabilities in two different pieces of software. Even more exceptional is that an error burns a unicorn before it can be used. According to [information security](URL experts, this is precisely what happened with a malicious PDF document designed to attack unpatched vulnerabilities in both Adobe Reader and earlier versions of Microsoft Windows. Today, applications often contain sandboxes, in addition to other defenses to make it harder for exploits to run malicious code on devices. When the protections work as intended, the buffer overflow attacks and other common software vulnerabilities result in a crash of the application and not a catastrophic security event. Defenses require attackers to link two or more exploits: one executes malicious code and another exploit allows the code to exit the sandbox. An Eset analyst found a PDF document that ignored the protections when Reader ran on earlier versions of Windows. It exploited a vulnerability of memory corruption, called double free, in Reader that allows obtaining a limited capacity to read and write in memory. But when installing programs, the PDF needed a way to bypass the sandbox so that the code would run in sensitive parts of the operating system. According to [information security](URL experts, the solution was to combine a separate attack that exploited unknown privilege escalation vulnerability in Microsoft operating systems prior to Windows 8. These privilege escalation vulnerabilities could allow users with limited system rights to obtain unrestricted access to the sensitive resources of an operating system. With a click on the PDF, the malware was installed on Windows 7 and Server 2008 computers. Its pretty weird to have an exploit on a piece of software that combines with a zero day for the operating system in order to escape sandboxing protection, said Jrme Segura, information security researcher at Malwarebytes. Early last year, the professionals unpacked an exploit in nature that exploited two different components when a malicious Microsoft Word file targeted Emmanuel Macrons staff. Eset commented that the DOCX file exploited remote code execution vulnerability in Word and a local privilege escalation failure in Windows. The document was used to install surveillance malware used by Fancy Bear. This time the PDF was found in VirusTotal. The body of the document only said PDF sample. Malwarebytes and Eset loaded the file to test if several antivirus vendors could detect it. Information security experts commented that instead of installing malware, the file downloaded and installed a calculation program. Before the attackers could use the PDF, Eset reported the vulnerabilities to Microsoft and Adobe."

One of the flaws found allows attackers to execute remote unauthenticated code with administrator privileges. A team of [information security](URL experts explain in one publication that if an attacker without knowledge of any credentials has RecoverPoint visibility on the network or local access to it, he can gain control over RecoverPoint and its underlying Linux operating system. The vulnerabilities found affect all versions of Dell EMC RecoverPoint prior to 5.1.2 and RecoverPoint for virtual machines prior to 5.1.1.3. The most critical vulnerability is CVE-2018-1235, CVSS 9.8, which allows an attacker with visibility to a RecoverPoint device in the network to gain control over the underlying Linux operating system. The Foregenix researchers commented that during a contract with an unnamed customer, once the researchers had control of the RecoverPoint devices, it was possible to exploit the discovered other zero-day vulnerabilities to pivot and gain control of the Microsoft Active Directory network with which the RecoverPoints were integrated. On the other hand, vulnerability CVE-2018-1242, gave an attacker with access to the boxmgmt administrative menu the ability to read file system files to which only the boxmgmt user can access. A third vulnerability, showed that RecoverPoint loses the credentials of clear text in a file of registry, the information security professionals commented. Dell EMC issued CVE for three of the vulnerabilities and included them in its DSA-2018-095 notice of May 21. But also the other three errors remain unpatched until now. These vulnerabilities do not have CVEs issued. It was found in one of these errors, that RecoverPoint was sent with a system password hash stored in a file readable by anyone. In a second error, it was discovered that RecoverPoint uses a coded root password that can only be changed by contacting the provider. Regarding the third vulnerability, it is an insecure configuration option that allows the LDAP credentials sent by RecoverPoint to be intercepted by the attackers. Regarding this latest vulnerability, [information security](URL professionals recommend that RecoverPoint customers make sure that if LDAP integration is required, it is configured to link securely. Performanta security specialist Nicholas Griffin commented that attackers could use these vulnerabilities to steal data backups using vulnerable RecoverPoint devices. The visibility of LDAP credentials could allow a malicious actor to gain access to other key resources on the network, or even compromise the Active Directory domain, the information security expert said. For the defense of attacks on internal systems; Organizations must first understand the access footprint to the system. Bitdefender analyst Liviu Arsene said that preventing these attacks is a security defense issue throughout the organization, which is able to defend not only endpoints, but also activate a security warning indicative of possible security breaches."

This backdoor, was found by Kaspersky Labs [information security](URL experts, the backdoor grants access to the devices web panel, and there is no way that device owners can disable this account. The way to protect the devices against hacking is to prevent the router from exposing its administration panel in the WAN interface and, therefore, it can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet. For now, professionals have not revealed the username and password of the backdoor account, this to avoid abuse. The backdoor account, CVE-2018-6213, is one of the four vulnerabilities found by the information security team in the firmware of these devices. The other three defects include: CVE-2018-6210: A vulnerability that allows attackers to recover Telnet credentials CVE-2018-6211: an error that allows attackers to execute operating system commands through one of the URL parameters of the administration panel CVE-2018-6212: A cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS) reflected in the Quick Search admin panel field of the router CVE-2018-6210 and CVE-2018-6213 were considered critical vulnerabilities, as they allow attackers easy access to the device. The D-Link DIR-620 devices are somewhat older router models and there are not many available to exploit, which may be good news. In general, these devices were implemented by Internet service providers in Russia, the CIS and Eastern Europe, as equipment in the installations for broadband clients. Most of these devices have been found, and [information security](URL professionals have already contacted the ISPs to report the problem. According to Kaspersky, most ISPs have taken action on warnings and restricted access to these devices on their networks. Information security experts also contacted D-Link about the problems, but the company commented that it did not intend to issue firmware updates for a previous model. In the investigation, the following firmware versions of DIR-620 were tested and all were vulnerable to varying degrees: 1.0.3, 1.0.37, 1.3.1, 1.3.3, 1.3.7, 1.4.0 y 2.0.22."

A while ago, it revealed that ATGs in approximately 5,000 service stations were exposed on the Internet, without a password. Now, a scan found 5,635 service stations with the same vulnerability. The initial research led by HD Moore, was based on Internet scans for devices with an open port TCP 10001. Trend Micro conducted research on gas tanks and found examples of hijinks hackers in Guardian AST gas tank monitoring systems. The information security experts reported on the detection of an Internet-oriented tank monitoring system at a service station, with the name Diesel, mysteriously changed to We_Are_Legion. So it is believed that it was the work of Anonymous. The researchers had the following findings: The hackers could exploit the pump data by modifying them to the extent that they could cause an explosion. The overflow limit of a tank could be increased above its capacity, which could cause the tank to overflow, which could trigger an explosion. Manipulation to allow free fuel. Gas readings can be changed, which affects the bottom line of the gas station. Several service stations could be closed by adjusting the fuel levels so that they appear empty at each station. On the other hand, the use of skimmers at ATMs had been on the news for a while when malicious actors used them at the gas pump to steal credit card information. Now, these skimmers have appeared at service stations. So far, more than 300 skimmers were found at the pumps at the gas station in Florida alone. Many of them had Bluetooth enabled, while others were conventional skimmers. Information security experts in New York found skimmer bombs that used cannibalized components to send stolen card data by text message. They commented that Bluetooth-based skimmers can be detected by anyone else with a mobile device, which is a drawback for malicious actors. GSM-based skimmers can transmit stolen card data wirelessly via text messages, allowing thieves to receive real-time transmissions of card data anywhere in the world. The information security experts commented that the places most affected by skimming activity are in the United States, although this activity also affects India, Mexico and the UK.

Finally, it generates reports of scan results. GyoiThon executes the previous processing automatically. GyoiThon executes steps 1 and 4 automatically. The only operation of the user is to enter the top URL of the target web server in GyoiThon. You can identify vulnerabilities in web servers without so much time and effort. Step 1. Collect HTTP responses. GyoiThon gathers several HTTP responses from the target website while reviewing the site. Step 2. Identify the name of the product. The expert comments that GyoiThon identifies the name of the product installed on the web server using the following two methods. Based on Machine Learning: when using (Naive Bayes) Machine Learning, GyoiThon identifies the software based on a combination of different characteristics; Etag value, Cookie value, specific HTML tag and others. Unlike the signature database, Naive Bayes is identified stochastically based on several features included in the HTTP response when the software can not be identified in a feature. Ejemplo: Etag: 409ed-183-53c5f732641c0 GyoiThon can identify the Apache web server software. This is because GyoiThon learns Apache features, such as Etag header value (409ed-183-53c5f732641c0). Apache uses a combination of lowercase letters and numbers as the Etag value and the Etag value is separated by 4-5. 5 digits and 3-4 digits and 12 digits, the final digit is 0 in many cases. Example 2: Set-Cookie: f00e68432b68050dee9abe33c389831e=0eba9cd0f75ca0912b4849777677f587; GyoiThon can identify the CMS Joomla !. This is because GyoiThon learns the features of Joomla! as Cookie name (f00e6  9831e) and Cookie value (0eba9  7f587). Based on string matching: GyoiThon can identify the software by matching strings also used in traditional penetration testing tools. Example: /core/misc/drupal.js?v=8.3.1 Step 3. Exploit using Metasploit. According to the information security expert, in this step, GyoiThon runs the exploit corresponding to the software identified using Metasploit and checks if the software is affected by the vulnerability. Step 4. Generate scan report. GyoiThon generates a report that summarizes the vulnerabilities. The style of the report is html. Operation check environment: Kali Linux 2017.3 (for Metasploit) Memory: 8.0GB Metasploit Framework 4.16.15-dev ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Host OS) CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5200U 2.20GHz Memory: 8.0GB Python 3.6.1Anaconda3 docopt 0.6.2 jinja2 2.10 msgpack-python 0.4.8 pandas 0.20.3"

Drupal seems to be a top pick for governments and financial sector. However, [information security](URL experts report suggest that Drupal contained a highly critical vulnerability that allowed remote hackers full control of a website. Users were kept unaware of this flaw until the company released a patch to address the issue. Now, researchers at Checkpoint have openly disclosed the vulnerability to the public, leaving site admins scratching their heads. Labeled as Drupalgeddon2, the vulnerability was so serious that it can be used for installation of cryptocurrency miners to mine for Monero cryptocurrency. Drupals information security experts team addressed the issue last month and released the patch, which admins who use Drupal to run websites are advised to install as quickly as possible. Researchers also released a proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw, which demonstrates that attackers can easily gain complete control of a website using the vulnerability. Researchers havent observed hackers wasting time in exploiting any kind of vulnerability until now and in this case too they have been rather quick on exploiting Drupalgeddon2. Attacks have already been initiated and attackers are installing cryptominers. An excerpt from a thread on SANS ISC Infosec forums confirms this as well. The exploits are being launched at a rapid pace currently. The information security experts and website owners are quite concerned. A tweet from GoDaddys VP of Engineering clearly shows this unrest among web owners. The only possible solution at the moment is to install the patch immediately. A PSA was also published by Drupals team stating that the company was already aware of the attacks that are being launched to compromise Drupal 7 and 8 websites. The vulnerability has been classified as CVE-2018-7600 whereas the security risk score of the issue is increased to 24/25. If your website remains unpatched, it is at the risk of compromising, [information security](URL researchers said. Quite possibly, targeted attacks were already launched before the release of the patch. It is also to be noted that just by updating Drupal, you cannot remove backdoors and also cannot fix already compromised websites. In fact, if you think that your website is patched while you didnt patch it yourself then this indicates the site has been compromised. Thats possible because in some previous attacks it was noted that attackers themselves applied the patch to ensure that the site remained in their control."

According to [information security](URL researchers, the California based website security provider Sucuri has suffered a series of massive DDoS attacks causing service outage in West Europe, South America and parts of Eastern United States. The attacks began on April 12th 2018, when Sucuri network came under non-stop DDoS attacks. The company then worked with Tier 1 providers to mitigate the attacks. In an email, Sucuri spokesperson said that The attack was big enough that caused some of our ports to be pretty close to capacity, causing very high latency and packet loss. In some other regions, it caused temporary latency and packet loss. The companys Status page also kept the customers updated revealing that Sucuri worked with its upstream providers, our NOC and partners to help mitigate the attack and re-route the affected regions. Unfortunately, due to the size of the attack, it took a lot longer than expected to get it fully handled. The exact size of DDoS attacks is still unknown, the same goes for its culprits and their motives, however, lately, and there has been a surge in large-scale DDoS attacks. Last month, hackers used Memcached vulnerability to carry out worlds largest ever DDoS attacks of 1.7 Tbps on an American firm and 1.35 Tbps attack on Github. The vulnerability was also used to hit Amazon, Google, NRA, Play Station, and several other high-profile targets. As for Sucuri, [information security](URL analysts have good news, the attacks have been successfully mitigated and at the time of publishing this article Sucuri services and customer websites were back online."
226,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Now Hyperledger have a bug bounty public program,1,8dj2t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8dj2t6/now_hyperledger_have_a_bug_bounty_public_program/,2018-04-20 09:16:51,"The Hyperledger project has opened the doors of its bug bounty program to the public. Hyperledger is an open-source project and hub for developers to work on blockchain technologies. According to [information security](URL experts, Hyperledger infrastructure is being developed in order to support cross-industry uses of distributed ledger technologies, most commonly associated with the exchange of cryptocurrency. Hosted by the Linux Foundation, Hyperledger focuses on cross-industry support for distributed ledger frameworks, smart contracts, and libraries, and already supports a range of business-based blockchain frameworks and transactional applications. While Hyperledger is an important initiative for businesses to utilize the blockchain safely and with a potential ROI, security is a crucial ingredient of the projects success. Over the past six months, the Hyperledger information security team has operated a private bug bounty program with HackerOne. This allowed developers and security researchers to test the waters, ironing out any communicative or disclosure issues before going public. Now, Hyperledger has a public bug tracker, a full vulnerability disclosure policy, and compliance systems in place. The next stage, revealed on Tuesday by Hyperledger team member Dave Huseby, is the launch of a public bug bounty program. The public program only includes Hyperledger Fabric at present as a target for bug hunters to ferret out vulnerabilities, but Hyperledger Sawtooth and other frameworks are on the radar and are expected to be added to the program soon. HackerOne is hosting and administering the program. Rewards range from a minimum of $200 for a low-severity bug to at least $2000 for the discovery of a critical vulnerability. At Hyperledger we have a broad base of committed developers and it is their professionalism that makes our security process solid and straightforward, Huseby says. Last year, Hyperledger has formalized how blockchain projects can move from development to their first 1. 0 release. This process now includes a number of security requirements, including meeting the demands of the Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII), which sets best practice requirements for open-source project security, [information security](URL researchers said. In addition, up to three members of a project must be nominated to the Hyperledger security team to help triage and resolve vulnerabilities. Hyperledger projects must also undergo a security audit from an external auditor, and now by adding the public bug bounty program, all of these requirements may be made easier with the help of a community of information security researchers."
227,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Biggest tech companies together to fight attacks,1,8dj4kg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8dj4kg/biggest_tech_companies_together_to_fight_attacks/,2018-04-20 09:24:29,"Thirty eight companies, including Microsoft, Facebook, Dell, and Oracle, have signed an accord to develop long-term, wide-reaching cyber-security akin to a Digital Geneva Convention. Among the signatories of the new the Cybersecurity Tech Accord are Arm, Dell, Facebook, Cisco, HPE, Microsoft, and Trend Micro. The pact was signed at the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. The [information security](URL researchers said that the accord comprises four key principles. First, the companies promise to first protect all users, whether they be individuals, organizations or governments and irrespective of their technical acumen, culture, location or the motives of the attacker, whether criminal or geopolitical. The organizations will also oppose cyber-security attacks on innocent citizens and enterprises from anywhere, which includes a pledge to not help governments launch cyber-attacks. Third, the firms promise to empower users, customers and developers to strengthen cyber-security protection by providing more information and tools. The companies will also establish formal and informal partnerships with industry, civil society and information security researchers in order to improve technical collaboration, coordinated vulnerability disclosure and threat sharing, as well as to minimize the levels of malicious code being introduced into cyber-space. The signatories will also encourage global information sharing and civilian efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to and recover from cyber-attacks and ensure flexible responses to security of the wider global technology ecosystem. Kevin Simzer, chief operating officer at Trend Micro, said that the The real-world consequences of cyber-threats have been repeatedly proven. As an industry, we must band together to fight cyber-criminals and stop future attacks from causing even more damage. Carolyn Herzog, general counsel of Arm, said that the accord will help to protect the integrity of the one trillion connected devices we expect to see deployed within the next 20 years. In a post, Microsoft president Brad Smith said that the success of this alliance is not just about signing a pledge, its about execution. Thats why today is just an initial step and tomorrow we start the important work of growing our alliance and take effective action together, [information security expert](URL said. Protecting our online environment is in everyones interest. The companies that are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord promise to defend and advance technologys benefits for society. And we commit to act responsibly, to protect and empower our users and customers, and help create a safer and more secure online world. We believe our membership in the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association is a huge win for our mutual customers and prospects, said Chuck Leaver, CEO of Ziften. As security vendors, we all recognize the need to cooperate and collaborate to protect our customers and their employees. Kudos to Microsoft for leading this industry effort. The days of siloed endpoint security tools that provide only incomplete, point-in-time data exposing organizations to unacceptable risks and unnecessary costs is ending. Together, we help security teams to address todays visibility, security and control challenges at the endpoint and in the cloud. Guy Bunker, SVP of products at Clearswift, told that the cynical view would be that this is a marketing stunt. The reality is that while there is legislation appearing across the globe to protect citizens (for example, EU GDPR), these are all aimed at organizations who use technology, rather than something for those who create it, he said. The IT world has always created standards and consortiums for the greater good  and this is just that. By coming together, a new set of standards will be created which should result in better joined up security for those who use technology from the different vendors. For the wider industry, this is about making everybody safer when sharing information and increasing cooperation where applicable. The information security expert Amit Yoran, CEO, Tenable, told that the growing threat of cyber-attacks and offensive cyber- weapons endangers all of us, from consumers and private businesses to government agencies. As information security professionals, we have a social responsibility to protect everyone online and support foundational cyber-hygiene practices among private citizens and organizations of all sizes. Were focused on empowering organizations everywhere to understand and reduce their cyber-security risk. Thats always been our mission as an organization, and this Accord solidifies that commitment, he said."
228,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Several Pentesting Tools and Techniques Used by Information Security Experts,1,8drmm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8drmm9/several_pentesting_tools_and_techniques_used_by/,2018-04-21 08:35:32,"Technology is pulsing all around you, and in the short amount of time that you are hosted in this network that you must try to understand its inner workings. Fortunately or unfortunately, most network and system administrators are persons of habit. All you have to do is listen for long enough, and more often than not it will yield some of those juicy findings, [information security](URL experts say. Regardless of any discussion beforehand, a penetration test has a competitive feel from both sides. Consulting pentesters want their flag, and administrators want their clean bill of health to show that they are resilient to cyber-attack; something akin to a game of flag football. The difference here is that in flag football, both teams are familiar with the tools used to play the game. It goes without saying that a pentesters job is to simulate a legitimate threat to effectively determine your organizations risk, but how can remediation happen without at least some familiarity? Sun Tzu once said, If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. In order to truly secure our networks, any administrator with cybersecurity duties will need to not only understand what they themselves have, but also step into the shoes of the opposite side. This articles intention is to focus on the why and not completely the how. There are countless videos and tutorials out there to explain how to use the tools, and much more information than can be laid out in one blog post. Additionally, I acknowledge that other testers out there may have an alternate opinion on these tools, and which are the most useful. This list is not conclusive. With that being said, lets get into the list. Responder This tool, in the information security expert opinion, makes the absolute top of the list. When an auditor comes in and talks about least functionality, this is what comes immediately to mind. If you are a pentester, Responder is likely the first tool you will start running as soon as you get your Linux distro-of-choice connected to the network and kick off the internal penetration test. The tool functions by listening for and poisoning responses from the following protocols: Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) There is more to Responder, but I will only focus on these three protocols for this article. NBT-NS is a remnant of the past; a protocol which has been left enabled by Microsoft for legacy/compatibility reasons to allow applications which relied on NetBIOS to operate over TCP/IP networks. LLMNR is a protocol designed similarly to DNS, and relies on multicast and peer-to-peer communications for name resolution. It came from the Vista era, and we all know nothing good came from that time-frame. You probably dont even use either of these. Attackers know this, and use it to their advantage. WPAD on the other hand serves a very real and noticeable purpose on the network. Most enterprise networks use a proxy auto-config (PAC) file to control how hosts get out to the Internet, and WPAD makes that relatively easy. The machines broadcast out into the network looking for a WPAD file, and receive the PAC which is given. This is where the poisoning happens. The information security professionals are aware that most protocols which rely on any form of broadcasting and multicasting are ripe for exploitation. PowerShell Empire Before, pentesters typically relied on Command and Control (C2) infrastructure where the agent first had to reside on-disk, which naturally would get uploaded to Virus Total upon public release and be included in the next mornings antivirus definitions. The time spent evading detection was a seemingly never-ending cat-and-mouse game. It was as if the collective unconscious of pentesters everywhere came to the realization that the most powerful tool at their disposal was already present on most modern workstations around the world. A framework had to be built, and the Empire team made it so. The focus on pentesting frameworks and attack tools has undoubtedly shifted towards PowerShell for exploitation and post-exploitation. It means that some of the security controls you have put in place may be easily bypassed. File-less agents (including malware) can be deployed by PowerShell and exist in memory without ever touching your hard disk or by connecting a USB. A write-up mentioned at the end of this post elaborates much further into this topic. Existing in memory makes antivirus whose core function is scanning disk significantly less effective. Fortunately, information security researchers say, that the best mitigation here is something you may already have access to , Microsofts Applocker. Granted, white listing can take some time to stand up properly and likely requires executive sign-off, but it is the direction endpoint security is heading. This is a good opportunity to get ahead of the curve. When it comes to mitigation; the execution policy restrictions in PowerShell are trivial to bypass. Hashcat with Wordlists This combo right here is an absolute staple. Cracking hashes and recovering passwords is pretty straightforward of a topic at a high level. Hashcat is a GPU-focused powerhouse of a hash cracker which supports a huge variety of formats, typically used in conjunction with hashes captured by Responder. In addition to Hashcat, a USB hard drive with several gigs of wordlists is a must. On every pentest that the information security analysts have been on, time had to be allocated appropriately to maximize results, and provide the most value to the client. Sysadmins, think about your baseline policies and configurations. Typically it is best practice to align with an industry standard, such as the infamous DISA STIG, as closely as possible. Baselines such as DISA STIG support numerous operating systems and software, and contain some key configurations to help you prevent against offline password cracking and replay attacks. This includes enforcing NIST recommended password policies, non-default authentication enhancements, and much more. DISA even does the courtesy of providing you with pre-built Group Policy templates that can be imported and custom-tailored to your organizations needs, which cuts out much of the work of importing the settings. Web Penetration Testing Tools It is important to note that a web penetration testing tool is not the same as a vulnerability scanner. Web-focused tools absolutely have scanning capabilities to them, and focus on the application layer of a website versus the service or protocol level. Granted, vulnerability scanners (Nessus, Nexpose, Retina, etc) do have web application scanning capabilities, though I have observed that it is best to keep the two separate. Many organizations nowadays build in-house web apps, intranet sites, and reporting systems in the form of web applications. Typically that since the site is internal it does not need to be run through the security code review process, and gets published out for all personnel to see and use. The surface area of most websites leaves a lot of room for play to find something especially compromising. Some of the major issues are: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). SQL Injection. Authentication bypass. Directory traversal abuse. Unrestricted file upload. If you administer an organization that builds or maintains any internal web applications, think about whether or not that code is being reviewed frequently. Code reuse becomes an issue where source code is imported from unknown origins, and any security flaws or potentially malicious functions come with it. Furthermore, the Always Be Shipping methodology which has overtaken software development as of late puts all of the emphasis on getting functional code despite the fact that flaws may exist. Acquaint yourself with OWASP, whose entire focus is on secure application development. Get familiar with the development teams Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and see if security testing is a part of it. OWASP has some tips to help you make recommendations. Understand the two methodologies for testing applications, including: Static Application Security Testing (SAST). The applications source code is available for analysis. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). Analyzes the application while in an operational state. Additionally you will want to take the time to consider your web applications as separate from typical vulnerability scans. Tools (open and closed source) exist out there, including Burp Suite Pro, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), Acunetix, or Trustwave, with scanning functionality that will crawl and simulate attacks against your web applications. Scan your web apps at least quarterly. Arpspoof and Wireshark Arpspoof is a tool that allows you to insert yourself between a target and its gateway, and Wireshark allows you to capture packets from an interface for analysis. You redirect the traffic from an arbitrary target, such as an employees workstation during a pentest, and snoop on it. Likely the first theoretical attack presented to those in cybersecurity, the infamous Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is still effective on modern networks, information security researchers said. Considering most of the world still leans on IPv4 for internal networking, and the way that the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) has been designed, a traditional MitM attack is still quite relevant. According to [information security](URL researcher, many falsely assume that because communications occur inside their own networks, they are safe from being snooped on by an adversary and therefore do not have to take the performance hit of encrypting all communications in their own subnets. Granted, your network is an enclave of sorts from the wild west of the Internet, and an attacker would first have to get into your network to stand between communications. Now, lets assume that a workstation is compromised by an attacker in another country using a RAT equipped with tools that allow a MitM to take place. Alternately, consider the insider threat. The information security experts said that the best tactics of defense are: encrypt your communications. Never assume communications inside your network are safe just because there is a gateway device separating you from the Internet. Keep your VLAN segments carefully tailored, and protect your network from unauthenticated devices. Implementing a Network Access Control (NAC) system is something you may want to add to your security roadmap in the near future or implementing 802.1X on your network may be a good idea. Shut down those unused ports, and think about sticky MACs if you are on a budget."

The vulnerability affects both client and server versions of WebEx Business Suite or WebEx Meetings. Cisco urges its users to update their software to fix the problem. A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Business Suite clients, Cisco WebEx Meetings, and Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a targeted system. reads the security advisory published by Cisco. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation by the Cisco WebEx clients. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing meeting attendees with a malicious Flash (.swf) file via the file-sharing capabilities of the client. Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow arbitrary code execution on the system of a targeted user. According to [information security](URL experts, the flaw has received a CVSS score of 9.0 and was rated as a critical severity issue by Cisco. The vulnerability was reported by the ENISA information security expert Alexandros Zacharis of ENISA, it is due to insufficient input validation by the Cisco WebEx clients. Zacharis find out that an attacker could submit a malicious Flash file (.swf ) to a room full of attendees using the file sharing feature, then trigger the flaw to execute arbitrary code. Cisco has already released software updates that fix the flaw; it confirmed that is not aware of any attacks exploiting the vulnerability in the wild. Cisco added that currently there is no workaround to address the problem. WebEx Business Suite software should be updated to the versions T32.10 and T31.23.2, while WebEx Meetings client software should be updated to T32.10 and Meetings Server should be updated to 2.8 MR2."
230,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Vulnerabilities exploited by third-party trackers to abuse Facebook Login,1,8ey3mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8ey3mi/vulnerabilities_exploited_by_thirdparty_trackers/,2018-04-26 09:23:35,"So far, [information security](URL researchers have uncovered how web trackers exfiltrate identifying information from web pages, browser password managers, and form inputs. Now, the information security experts report yet another type of surreptitious data collection by third-party scripts that we discovered: the exfiltration of personal identifiers from websites through login with Facebook and other such social login APIs. Specifically, we found two types of vulnerabilities. seven third parties abuse websites access to Facebook user data one third party uses its own Facebook application to track users around the web. Third parties piggyback on Facebook access granted to websites When a user clicks Login with Facebook, they will be prompted to allow the website theyre visiting to access some of their Facebook profile information. Even after Facebooks recent moves to lock down the feature, websites can request the users email address and public profile (name, age range, gender, locale, and profile photo) without triggering a manual review by Facebook. Once the user allows access, any third-party Javascript embedded in the page, such as tracker.com in the figure above, can also retrieve the users Facebook information as if they were the first party. Facebook Login and other social login systems simplify the account creation process for users by decreasing the number of passwords to remember. But social login brings risks: Cambridge Analytica was found misusing user data collected by a Facebook quiz app which used the Login with Facebook feature. Researchers have found an additional risk: when a user grants a website access to their social media profile, they do not only trust that website, but also third parties embedded on that site. The [information security](URL professionals also found seven scripts collecting Facebook user data using the first partys Facebook access. These scripts are embedded on a total of 434 of the top 1 million sites. The professionals detail how they found these scripts in Appendix 1 below. Most of them grab the user ID, and two grab additional profile information such as email and username. The user ID collected through the Facebook API is specific to the website (or the application in Facebooks terminology), which would limit the potential for cross-site tracking. But these app-scoped user IDs can be used to retrieve the global Facebook ID, users profile photo, and other public profile information, which can be used to identify and track users across websites and devices. It is straightforward for a third party script to grab data from the Facebook API. The code is from the OpenTag script that exfiltrate the users Facebook ID to Lytics, a personalized Marketing and Customer Data Platform. The script continually checks for the existence of the Facebook API. Once the user logs in to Facebook, the tracking script can silently query the users login status. The response to the login status query contains the users Facebook ID, information security analysts say. The script then parses the ID out of the response and sends it back to a remote server. While we cant say how these trackers use the information they collect, we can examine their marketing material to understand how it may be used. OnAudience, Tealium AudienceStream, Lytics, and ProPS all offer some form of customer data platform, which collect data to help publishers to better monetize their users. Forter offers identity-based fraud prevention for e-commerce sites. Augur offers cross-device tracking and consumer recognition services. Tracking users around the web with the Facebook Login service Some third parties use the Facebook Login feature to authenticate users across many websites: Disqus, a commenting widget, is a popular example. However, hidden third-party trackers can also use Facebook Login to deanonymize users for targeted advertising. This is a privacy violation, as it is unexpected and users are unaware of it. But the information security professionals ask, how can a hidden tracker get the user to Login with Facebook? When the same tracker is also a first party that users visit directly. This is exactly what we found Bandsintown doing. Worse, they did so in a way that allowed any malicious site to embed Bandsintowns iframe to identify its users. The information security experts also found that the iframe injected by Bandsintown would pass the users information to the embedding script indiscriminately. Thus, any malicious site could have used their iframe to identify visitors. We informed Bandsintown of this vulnerability and they confirmed that it is now fixed. To conclude, the [information security](URL researchers say, that this unintended exposure of Facebook data to third parties is not due to a bug in Facebooks Login feature. Rather, it is due to the lack of security boundaries between the first-party and third-party scripts in todays web. Still, there are steps Facebook and other social login providers can take to prevent abuse: API use can be audited to review how, where, and which parties are accessing social login data. Facebook could also disallow the lookup of profile picture and global Facebook IDs by app-scoped user IDs. It might also be the right time to make Anonymous Login with Facebook available following its announcement four years ago. Several companies stated that they do not use Facebook data for third-party tracking purposes."
231,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Trustjacking Attack Allows Hackers to Hack iOS Devices,1,8f6uoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8f6uoz/trustjacking_attack_allows_hackers_to_hack_ios/,2018-04-27 08:41:32,"Symantec professionals have found a vulnerability that could allow hackers to compromise iOS devices without the owners knowledge. This iOS attack named as Trustjacking by [information security](URL researchers exploits a vulnerability in iTunes Wi-Fi Sync, a special feature that allows iOS devices to synchronize with iTunes without having to physically connect the device. This feature can be enabled by physically connecting an iOS device to a computer, specifying that the iOS device can trust the computer, and then enable iTunes Wi-Fi Sync from the PC. Once a reliable Wi-Fi Sync connection is established, the hacker could have access to the users computer; the hacker could secretly spy on the iOS device or record and control any type of activities remotely. With this the computer could access the photos on the device, make a backup, and install applications and much more, without requiring another confirmation by the user and without any noticeable indication. It also allows activating the function iTunes Wi-Fi synchronization, which allows continuing this type of communication with the device even after it has been disconnected from the computer, provided that the computer and the iOS device are connected to the same network. It is important to mention that enabling iTunes Wi-Fi synchronization does not require the approval of the victim and can be carried out purely from the side of the computer, wrote Roy Iarchy, head of research at Modern OS Security. Adi Sahabani, senior vice president of modern security for the operating system at Symantec, said it is extremely shocking. Adi was the one who revealed the findings at RSAC 2018 last Wednesday along with his colleague Iarchy. The report states that once the malicious computer is authorized, there is no means to prevent continued access to the device. The information security expert said that users do not receive any message or notification when authorizing the computer; they allow access to their device even after disconnecting the USB cable. Even if the device is only connected for a very short time, it may be enough for an attacker to maintain visibility of all actions performed on the device after disconnecting it, Iarchy wrote. The professionals revealed the vulnerability to Apple, which addressed the problem by adding an additional layer of protection in iOS 11. The new layer requires the iOS user to enter their password when they trust a computer. However, [information security](URL researchers believe that such measures are inadequate. The user is told that this authorization is only relevant while the device is connected to the computer, this makes the user believe that unplugging his device guarantees that nobody can access his private data, Iarchy writes in a publication. While we appreciate the mitigation that Apple has taken, we would like to emphasize that it does not address Trustjacking in a holistic way. Once the user has chosen to trust the compromised computer, the rest of the exploit continues to work.  Information security analysts suggest that users enable encrypted backups in iTunes and select a secure password to protect their devices. The users should also go to Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Reset location and privacy, and reauthorize previously connected computers."
232,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Nintendo Switch could be hacked with exploit that cant be fixed,1,8f6wdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8f6wdt/nintendo_switch_could_be_hacked_with_exploit_that/,2018-04-27 08:48:32,"Nintendo suffers from a string of exploits based on Nvidia Tegra X1 system that describe an unsupported method for executing arbitrary code on all Nintendo Switch consoles, the computer security expert said. Hardware hacker Katherine Temkin and the ReSwitched hacker team today released a summary of what they call the Fuse Gele cold-start vulnerability, along with a proof-of-concept load. This Fuse Gele is not a perfect feat, although in some cases it can be very close, [information security](URL researcher Temkin told. This exploit uses a vulnerability inherent in the USB recovery mode of the Tegra X1, bypassing blocking operations that would protect the ROM boot of the chip. By sending an incorrect long argument to an incorrectly coded USB control procedure at the correct point, the user can force the system to request up to 65,535 bytes per request. That information overflows a crucial memory direct access buffer (DMA) in the bootROM, allowing data to be copied into the stack of protected applications and giving the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code. It seems that the hardest part of the exploit is that it may be forcing the system to a USB recovery mode, information security professionals said. To do this without opening the system, it is necessary to short-circuit a certain pin in the correct Joy-Con connector. The Fail0verflow hacking team tweeted an image of a small plug-in device that can apparently provide this short circuit easily. What makes this exploit worrying for Nintendo is that it seems that it cannot be solved by a simple downloadable patch; the defective bootROM in question cannot be modified once the Tegra chip leaves the factory. Thats a security measure if the bootROM itself is secure, but it becomes a big problem if the bootROM is exploited, as is the case here, information security researchers said. As Temkin writes, Unfortunately, access to the fuses to configure the devices ipatches was blocked when the ODM_PRODUCTION fuse was blown, so the bootROM update is not possible. It is suggested that consumers are aware of the situation so they can switch to other devices.  That suggestion is not very useful for Nintendo, which has already sent more than 14.8 million vulnerable Switch systems to the public. Previous software-level vulnerabilities in Nintendo systems could be mitigated through upgrades of downloadable systems, Nintendo attempts to force users by making them a requirement for new software and access to online servers. Now, the use of this exploit by the public is limited to a program and load of Python proof of concept that can be used to show protected information of the ROM boot instructions of the switch, said [information security](URL analysts. The most complete details of how to use the exploit will be published on June 15, writes Temkin, adding on Twitter that the guides and information so you can use it are also nearby. And the work continues on a custom Switch boot manager called Atmosphre that apparently will exploit the exploit to run. The professional also says that she previously notified Nvidia and Nintendo about the existence of this exploit, providing what she calls an adequate window to communicate with her clients and to achieve the highest possible correction for an unsupported bootROM error. The information security expert, Temkin, also writes that he is publicizing the exploit due to the possibility that the parties that independently discover these vulnerabilities will do very badly. It is believed that other groups were threatening to publish a similar exploit before the planned release of the Team ReSwitched summer, forcing early disclosure. The launch is also partly a response to Team Xecuter, a team that plans to sell a modchip exploit that can allow similar code execution on the switch. Temkin opposes Xecuters explicit endorsement of piracy and efforts to take advantage of keeping information to some people."
233,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,My Cloud EX2 device from Western Digital leaks files by default,1,8ffn4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8ffn4x/my_cloud_ex2_device_from_western_digital_leaks/,2018-04-28 08:39:10,"According to research conducted by [information security](URL professionals at Trustwave, Western Digitals My Cloud EX2 storage devices filter files to anyone in a local network by default, this is regardless of the permissions set by users. If configured for remote access through the public Internet, My Cloud EX2 will also be able to filter files through an HTTP request on port 9000. This week, Trustwave released its findings and warned: Unfortunately, the default configuration of a new My Cloud EX2 unit allows any unauthenticated local network user to take any file through HTTP requests. This file leak is due to the UPnP media server on the device that automatically starts when the device is turned on, the researchers said. By default, unauthenticated users can take any file from the device while avoiding the permissions or restrictions set by the administrator, wrote Martin Rakhmanov, manager of security research at Trustwave in an analysis of My Cloud EX2. The information security professionals also said that when they revealed their research to Western Digital, the company said that the insecure default configuration did not guarantee a solution. For its part, WD only recommends users to turn off DLNA if they do not want to use the feature of the product. You do not have to be authenticated, you do not have to get the credentials early, if My Cloud is on a closed network or is on the open Internet, an attacker can access all the files on the device, said Karl Sigler, manager Trustwave threat intelligence. Western Digital said the DLNA function is used in conjunction with the media players of the users on smartphones and televisions. My Cloud systems come with Twonky Server, which allows access to My Cloud users within the local network without password protection, which is common with DLNA server software. Western Digital recommends that users save content that they want to protect with a password in shared resources for which the DLNA capabilities are disabled, or disable the Twonky server for the entire system, which would disable only the capabilities of the DLNA media server, said a spokesperson. The spokesperson also said that DLNA is enabled by default in all My Cloud and My Cloud Mirror products. He also said that DLNA is disabled in other My Cloud Pro Series and Expert Series products by default. WD commented that you can only access the files that reside in a shared resource for which DLNA is enabled without password protection and only to the users of the local network. If you are going to provide a NAS that really provides authentication and access controls for users, from a security perspective it makes no sense to implement this type of wonky DLNA component, says Sigler. Concept test attack In addition, Sigler said the Trustwave proof-of-concept attack involves an adversary that issues an HTTP request to port 9000 requesting the TMSContentDirectory / Control resource. The request must contain XML with the Explore action in it, said Sigler. The UPnP server will respond with a list of files on the device. Then, the attacker uses subsequent HTTP requests to retrieve the files on the device using the URLs of the collected response. It does not matter if you can set permissions and credentials in My Cloud EX2 to make sure that the photos are blocked and only available to someone who is authenticated with the device. Knowing how traffic works with the My Cloud (EX2) device, you can get it to supply any file on the device, also the permissions, thats something specific for this device.  Western Digital is no stranger to vulnerabilities in its NAS products. [Information security](URL analysts said the company has patched several critical security bugs in its My Cloud network storage devices, the most serious of which allows remote attackers to gain root access without restrictions to the device. In this year, GulfTech researchers found a backdoor vulnerability that allowed remote attackers to send a subsequent request to a vulnerable WD NAS, which allowed an arbitrary file to load on the server running on vulnerable storage devices. The experts also found a backdoor that included the coded administrator credentials of the device. Trustwave also found other flaws; Trendmicro and others have included the falsification of requests between sites, the injection of commands, the denial of service and the disclosure of information. Information security professionals recommend disabling DLNA to protect user data."
234,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,How to do offensive Penetration Testing with Kali?,2,8g3ig5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8g3ig5/how_to_do_offensive_penetration_testing_with_kali/,2018-05-01 08:26:40,"We will start with the preparation. We will need some basic skills. Even more important than being able to do research, time management and learn new technical skills, there are less obvious basic skills that will still be very useful to take PWK and pass the OSCP Exam, says a information [information security](URL One tip is to take note. Maybe this seems completely foreign, but: to take advantage of their experience in PWK, they should be able to do an effective job of taking notes. You must know how to structure your notes, how to keep the data associated with different machines, and keep screenshots with your notes, etc. There is not just one way to do it, but you could separate the notes into two categories: Thematic notes that describe information about particular vulnerabilities, tools or techniques. As it could be, to associate particular exploits of the kernel with the versions to which they apply, or notes on techniques to pivot through machines. Notes per machine. Detailing the information about the operating system and the applications, vulnerabilities and vulnerabilities applicable, and the technique that I used. For most machines, a python or metasploit rc script can also be produced to quickly re-explode the machine, since the equipment in the lab room can be restarted at any time by other students. In the case of having Linux on the workstation. It is surprising to see people enrolling in a class called Penetration Testing with Kali Linux, but never before had I used Linux, however, there are many reports of this. Information security experts recommend that you learn to use some form of Linux before paying hundreds of dollars a month for access to the lab. At least you should be familiar with: The design of the file system Network settings Shell familiarity How to use SSH You do not have to use Kali, but since its based on Debian Testing, you can use some kind of Debian derivative. Debian, Ubuntu and Mint are good options. A good way to start is to download a distribution, place it in a virtual machine and start using it for a while. Then try to do some daily controller tasks and familiarize yourself with the interface. Configure and run the SSH server, and test with SSH on. Experts also recommend OverTheWire Bandit which is a free war game that teaches basic Linux concepts. Its free and its a good place to start. If you can overcome that, you will be on your way to the basic knowledge of Linux to continue with PWK. Experts say you must learn what you do not know. It is important to find the gaps in your knowledge so that you know what to investigate and how to fill those gaps can be quite a challenge. Check the Syllabus for the PWK course. If you find yourself confused, you can research more and spend more time becoming familiar with the concepts and terminology. The class will teach you a lot about the material, but if you are lost even with what the titles mean, it will be almost impossible to follow and you will definitely not spend so much time working in the laboratories. IP and Ethernet networks Almost all modern networks use IP in the network layer (L3). As a result, you must be familiar with the IP network. Mainly relevant is the division into IP subnets and the difference between routing and switched networks. Know what RFC1918 is and why these IP addresses are special. It may be useful to learn how to translate between representations of CIDR subnets, such as / 24 and / 255.255.255.0. [Information security](URL professionals say that you should have an understanding of No route to the host and how to correct or circumvent it. You should also understand how a host with two hosts works and how that differs from a host that acts as a router between two networks. Note the differences between broadcast and single broadcast traffic. IP Protocol Ethernet IP subnet calculator For TCP and UDP. It is important to know the differences between TCP and UDP. This includes differences in terms of establishment and maintenance of the connection, as well as differences in the reliability of the protocols. Common well-known service port numbers will also be useful to know, say information security researchers. TCP UDP List of TCP and UDP port numbers Regarding network protocols Learn about some of the common protocols used in networks. Even if you do not learn details or read the RFCs, at least read the Wikipedia article about some of the most common protocols. DNS Telnet SSH HTTP SMB / CIFS TLS Now we will talk about operating systems and applications. The professionals comment that knowing how operating systems work at a basic level will be of great help. This includes differences between operating systems, how processes work, how file systems work, and information about authentication and authorization in each operating system. We will begin with Linux. It is very important to understand the different types of authentication and authorization mechanisms in Linux systems, as well as the interfaces of operating systems and common services. The root user Setuid Binaries POSIX users and groups Posix file system permissions SELinux and AppArmor File locations (/ etc / passwd, / etc / shadow, etc.) How services are started (SysV init, Upstart, systemd) Now Windows. Windows has a very different behavior from Linux and POSIX systems. Most PWK students are probably familiar with Windows on the desktop, but not in a multi-user or Windows domain. Users and groups File system permissions Windows Services Domain authentication SMB / CIFS resources We will continue with some applications. Part of this is independent of the operating system or may differ from the operating system, but it is important that it is known. Database servers (MySQL / MSSQL / PostgreSQL) and application servers are a large part of the attack surface. For example, know different web servers (Apache, nginx, IIS) and mechanisms to load web applications (mod_php, cgi scripts, php-fpm, Python WSGI and ASP.net). Not all of these are critical, but being familiar will be useful. In a business environment, there will be dozens of web applications, most of which are supported by database servers or other application servers. Regarding security issues. PWK is mainly about learning safety skills, but there must be some knowledge that a student brings to the table, say information security experts. Understanding the basics of security will serve the student during the course. The triad of the CIA (Confidentiality, integrity and availability) Authentication vs Authorization Memory corruption vulnerabilities Web vulnerabilities (maybe OWASP Top 10) Scripting. Researchers say it will be useful to become familiar with reading scripts written in Python or Ruby. Many of the exploits in Exploit-DB are in one of these two languages. In addition, Metasploit is written in Ruby, so being able to refer to this as necessary will be very useful. Its even better if you can write in one of these languages or another scripting language. This will help you with the playback scripts and it will be a very useful skill. Get the most out of PWK. Based on experiences, your learning style and experience may vary. He took note-taking as one of the best skills, and now as one of the activities that you should focus on during the course. Taking notes will help you keep your learning more effectively and, since the exam is open book, it can help you in the exam. If you choose to send a report for the lab and the exam, you can use this documentation to generate the lab report. The documentation can take many forms during the course: Notes, whether written by hand or typed Network diagrams Shell logs / command line logs Screenshots If in doubt, bring additional documentation. A couple of minutes here or there could work in the long term. I treated the lab as a real penetration test, where I documented each machine committed to: Enumeration / Recon information Vulnerability and exploit used to compromise Hashes / downloaded accounts Screenshot of access to the machine Privilege escalation information Any useful artifact (documentation, files, shared shared files, etc.) Recognition. The value of the recognition and counting phase cannot be emphasized enough. The exhaustive collection of information will help you identify vulnerabilities and understand how the network fits. The laboratory environment is really a network with interconnected components, and recognizing it as such during the recognition phase will make it much more successful. [Information security](URL researchers comment that understanding the relationship between machines will help to pivot between hosts and network segments. Understanding the role of the machine helps you determine how the machine could benefit you. Now we will talk about time management. There are several aspects in your time management throughout the course. Experts recommend not dividing your time between course material and laboratories. It is recommended to flip through the lab book to get a general understanding of the progression of the course, then go back and tour the labs, videos and exercises together. If you want to get the most out of your course, information security professionals suggest that you try to complete all the course material in about half the time of the lab, because the course material does not provide all the machines in the lab. The other half of the time can be used to work independently on the machines in the laboratory. If you are going to do a 60- or 90-day lab period and worry about not passing the OSCP exam on the first try, professionals recommend that you take an exam attempt about 15 days before the end of your lab time. If you do this and fail, you will have the opportunity to revisit the laboratory and review your weak areas before making another test attempt."
235,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,150000 Drupal websites got hacked by this new vulnerability,2,8g3koi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8g3koi/150000_drupal_websites_got_hacked_by_this_new/,2018-05-01 08:35:30,"The Drupal security team has fixed another Drupal remote code execution vulnerability, which suggests users to implement the updates offered immediately as the flaw is being exploited actively in the wild. The experts in [information security](URL comment that the vulnerability (CVE-2018-7602) affects versions 7.x and 8.x of Drupal. Users should update to v7.59 and 8.5.3 as soon as possible. Users who cannot implement the update can implement independent patches, but before doing so they have to apply the SA-CORE-2018-002 solution. This is the second occurrence in less than a month that a critical failure in the execution of the remote code has been connected. The first incident, CVE-2018-7600, affected the Drupal sites 8, 7 and 6, estimated at almost one million. Even though a professional found the vulnerability and revealed it responsibly, the attackers soon developed an exploit once security updates and patches were released. Unrepaired sites can be compromised. Its possible that the targeted attacks occurred before Wednesday, 2018-04-11, Drupals information security team recently shared. With the March update, Drupal added a global sanitation function, which is difficult to implement correctly, said Johannes Ullrich, CTO of SANS ISC. It is very difficult to disinfect and validate the data before it is clear how they are used, particularly if this is done for an existing and complex application such as Drupal. The second incident, CVE-2018-7602, is related to the previous one, was unearthed by the same researcher and members of the Drupal [information security](URL team, and is being exploited actively in the wild. Attacks in the wild Netlab 360 observed a large number of Internet scans against CVE-2018-7600. Attackers search for vulnerable Drupal installations, exploit the flaw and install cryptocurrency miners and DDoS-compatible software on compromised servers, as well as backdoors that allow them to access the system whenever they wish. It is expected that CVE-2018-7602 will be exploited with the same objectives. The Drupal team warns that, once updates are installed, administrators should check if their installation has been compromised and if there is a backdoor installed on the host. Simply updating Drupal will not remove the backdoors or fix the compromised sites, you must assume that the host is also compromised and that any other site on a compromised host is also compromised, they commented. If you find that your site is already patched, but you did not, it may be a sign that the site was compromised. Some attacks in the past have applied the patch as a way to ensure that only that attacker has control of the site."

Information security researchers from Computest, Daan Keuper and Thijs Alkemade, successfully tested their findings and exploited chains on the Volkswagen Golf GTE and Audi A3 Sportback e-tron models. The [information security](URL professionals commented that they used a cars Wi-Fi connection to exploit an exposed port and gain access to the cars IVI, manufactured by the company that supplies electronic products Harman. The experts gained access to the IVI systems root account, which allowed them to access other automobile data.  the attackers could listen to conversations that the driver is carrying out through the car, turn the microphone on and off, as well as access the full address book and the conversation history, said the Computest researchers. Due to the vulnerability, it is also possible to discover, through the navigation system, where the driver has been, and to follow the car live wherever it is at a given moment, said the information security researchers. The experts could have done more, but they stopped. Keuper and Alkemade comment that the IVI system is also indirectly connected to the cars acceleration and braking system, but they stopped investigating for fear that they could violate Volkswagens intellectual property. In addition to the WiFi attack vector, the researchers also found other vulnerabilities that could be exploited through USB debug ports located under the board. All of these defects were found in July 2017, and they reported all problems to Volkswagen, participating in meetings with the automaker. The vulnerability we identified should have been found during an adequate security test, the experts said. During the meeting with Volkswagen, it was felt that the reported vulnerability was not yet known, despite being used in tens of millions of vehicles around the world, this IVI system was not subjected to a formal safety test and the vulnerability was still unknown to them. Volkswagen already addressed the reported problems, despite the error of implementing an untested system within their cars, Volkswagen worked with the team of information security professionals to address the reported failures. The open interface in Golf GTE and Audi A3 was closed with an update of the infotainment software, the Volkswagen executives wrote in a letter. Although Volkswagen is closing the vulnerability in todays information and entertainment systems, professionals are still concerned. This is because the IVI system that they have hacked does not come with a wireless update system, which means that it cannot be updated with a software patch. On the other hand, in the conversations with Volkswagen, the [information security](URL experts comment that the automaker alluded to having solved the failures in the IVI systems that are still in production, but have not yet said how they plan to deal with the already sold cars . Information security professionals are withholding information about the exploitation of security flaws. The researchers made it clear that they will not reveal the exact services and ports they used to incorporate the VW Golf and Audi A3 models during the experiments. We decided not to provide full disclosure of our findings, we describe the process we followed, our attack strategy and the internal parts of the system, but not all the details about remote exploitable vulnerability, as we would consider it irresponsible  , wrote the researcher in a technical document."

The expert noticed that the composition box always hid the email addresses of named recipients without providing a way to inspect the actual email address, and discovered how to abuse this with mailto: links containing named recipients. The link mailto: support@paypal.com &lt;scam@phisher.example&gt; is indicated as support@paypal.com in the composition window of the Google inbox. To exploit this vulnerability, the target user only needs to click on a malicious link. The experts comment that it can also be activated by clicking on a direct link to the mailto: handler page in the inbox. This vulnerability has not yet been corrected. The information security professionals comment that the recipient support@paypal.com is being falsified in the composition window of the Google inbox. The real recipient is scam@phisher.example. In July of 2017, the expert noticed that Google had added information about emerging tools to this field in Inbox; this allowed users to manually confirm the recipients email address. The default display of the email address was still vulnerable to spoofing, another notice was sent via email to Google. After receiving no response for more than 8 months, another notification was sent via email in March 2018.

238,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,90% of SAP Implementations are Vulnerable to New SAP Vulnerability,1,8gll3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8gll3c/90_of_sap_implementations_are_vulnerable_to_new/,2018-05-03 08:42:33,"For the most part, SAP implementations continue to be affected by vulnerability in the security configuration initially documented in 2005, [information security](URL experts warn. Analysts comment that careless security configurations and unintended derivations of previously protected system configurations make SAP implementations vulnerable despite the release of security notes designed to address issues. According to Onapsis information security researchers, 90% of SAP systems were vulnerable to this error. This vulnerability affects SAP Netweaver and can be exploited by an unauthenticated remote attacker who has access to the system network. By attacking this vulnerability, one could obtain unrestricted access to the system, being able to compromise the platform and all the information it contains, extract data or turn off the system. The vulnerability affects all versions of SAP Netweaver. Since SAP Netweaver is the foundation of SAP implementations, 378,000 customers worldwide are affected, researchers say. The vulnerability exists within the default security configuration in each SAP product based on Netweaver. Even the next generation digital business suite S / 4HANA is affected. The information security researchers of Onapsis explain in a report where the vulnerability is detailed, that a protection scheme through ACL (access control list) ensures that the SAP application servers are registered within the SAP Message Server to function. This record is made using the internal port 39 &lt;xx&gt; (3900 by default), SAP explained in a Security Note that the port must be secure and only accessible by the IP addresses of the trusted application. The ACL of the message server is designed to verify which IP addresses can be registered by an application server and which ones are not; it is controlled by a profile parameter (ms / acl_info) that must contain a path to a file with a specific format. SAP published the details on how to correctly configure this access file in a Security Note. However, this parameter is configured with the default configuration, as well as with the contents of the ACL open, this allows any host with access to the network to the SAP Message Server to register an application server in the SAP system, explain [information security](URL professionals of Onapsis. At the time of exploiting the lack of a secure configuration of the message server ACL in an SAP system, an attacker can register a fake application server, which could then be abused to achieve total system compromise through attacks more complex. Professionals comment that, for an attack to be successful, an actor needs to take advantage of this incorrect configuration: access to the internal port of the Message Server with a default configuration in the ACL. This tells us that proper ACL configuration of SAP Message Server should mitigate the risks associated with the attack. JP Perez-Etchegoyen, CTO of Onapsis, commented that This year attention will be devoted to new vulnerabilities, such as IoT, Meltdown and Spectre; there is a more silent threat to the lurking that can be so serious and so wide. So interconnected and complex that disconnecting a system to implement a secure configuration can be very disruptive to the organization. It is essential that organizations make sure they take the time to implement the configuration. These updates should be planned and scheduled to have the least impact on the organization. Information security researchers recommend that organizations implement continuous controls and compliance checks in order to ensure that the relevant configurations do not affect the security posture of the system, as well as to execute an SAP security program that helps close the breach between the devices."

The company said that its team of [information security](URL experts found and solved the problem, also mentioned that its investigation does not show signs of non-compliance or misuse by anyone. The company did not specify how many passwords were affected; Reuters estimated more than 330 million. I want to emphasize that this is not a leak and our investigation has not shown signs of misuse, said a Twitter spokesman. We are sharing this information so that everyone can make an informed decision about the security of their account, he added. The spokesman did not comment on the vulnerability and how many users were affected.  Passwords were written to an internal registry before completing the hashing process, said Parag Agrawal, CTO of Twitter. This error was found by our security team, we eliminated the passwords and we are implementing plans to prevent this error from happening again. All users who opened their accounts on Thursday received a Twitter message asking them to take into account the possibility of changing their password in the services where they used the password. Twitter commented that it masks passwords using hash using bcrypt, this replaces the real password with a random set of characters stored in your system. However, the vulnerability caused passwords to be written to the companys internal computer system before the hash process was completed. Agrawal said Twitter is sharing information about the problem to help users make an informed decision about the security of their account. [Information security](URL professional Troy Hunt commented: The records are often largely automated, but it is certainly a massive oversight, he said. For the same reason, if the scope of the problem is that the passwords were captured in the internal records, the records were not exposed and subsequently cleaned up. This news is parallel to another incident this week, where Github revealed that he had discovered an introduced vulnerability that exposed a number of user passwords in plain text. GitHub also uses bcrypt for hash passwords, information security experts said. Twitter attracted attention at the beginning of the week after revealing that it sold access to data to a researcher linked to Cambridge Analytica. This increased the concerns of the security community about how companies protect users private information."
241,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Vulnerability in Oracle Access Manager exploited to bypass authentication and control the account of any user,1,8hrpeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8hrpeu/vulnerability_in_oracle_access_manager_exploited/,2018-05-08 08:40:49,"Wolfgang Ettlinger of SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, [information security](URL expert, found vulnerability in Oracle Access Manager that can be exploited remotely to bypass authentication and take over the account of any user or administrator on the affected systems. Professionals tell us that Oracle Access Management provides Web SSO with MFA, general authorization and session management, and standard SAML Federation and OAuth capabilities to allow secure access to mobile applications and the cloud. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-2879, relates a defective cryptographic format used by Oracle Access Manager. OAM is the Oracle Fusion Middleware component that handles authentication for web applications, said SEC Consult consultant Wolfgang Ettlinger. Small peculiarities of the cryptographic implementation had a real impact on the security of the product. When this vulnerability was exploited, arbitrary authentication tokens could be manufactured, which allowed us to supplant any user and break the main functionality of OAM. An attacker can exploit vulnerability by the way OAM handles encrypted messages to trick the software and accidentally discloses information that can be used to log in as other users, Ettlinger explained. An attacker can make a fill oracle attack to disclose the authorization cookie of an account; it can generate a script to create valid login keys for any desired user, including administrators. During an investigation, we found that a cryptographic format used by the OAM exhibits a serious flaw. When exploiting this vulnerability, we were able to create a session token. When a WebGate is presented with this token, it would accept it as a legitimate form of authentication and allow access to protected resources, explained the information security professional. On the other hand, the process of creating session cookies allows us to create a session cookie for an arbitrary user name, which allows us to impersonate any user. The versions of Oracle Access Management that were affected by the vulnerability are; 11g and 12c. The professionals used a simple Google Dork to find more than 11,800 OAM facilities, some belonging to high-profile organizations, including Oracle.

Recently, information security professional has shown that the Meltdown patch in Windows 10 can be circumvented. Alex Ionescu, a Windows Internals researcher, found that the Meltdown patch issued for Windows 10 is affected by a serious vulnerability that could be exploited to bypass it. Calling NtCallEnclave returned to the user space with the full directory of the kernel page table, completely undermining the mitigation, he said via Twitter. Ionescu also commented that Microsoft addressed the flaw with the release of the version of Windows 10 1803, which is the update of April 2018. Microsoft recognized the problem reported by the [information security](URL expert and is currently working on a solution to include in the 1790 version of Windows 10, autumn update, which is the only version, affected. Attackers could take advantage of Meltdown and Specter attacks to bypass memory isolation mechanisms and access sensitive data. The CVE-2017-5754 vulnerability, Meltdown, could allow attackers to read the full physical memory of target machines by stealing credentials, personal information and more. Meltdown exploits the speculative execution to break the isolation between the users applications and the operating system, in this way any application can access the systems memory. In the good news, we can know that, Meltdown attacks are not easy to perform and the risk of exploitation is considered low. On the other hand less pleasant, we know that, the timeline for the Meltdown patch is full of problems. Researchers commented on previous occasions that the first release was promptly suspended by Microsoft in January due to instability problems observed in AMD processors. In previous weeks, [information security](URL expert Ulf Frisk reported that part of the security of Meltdown and Specter that Windows updated has serious flaws. The expert could notice that the security updates of Meltdown and Spectre released by Microsoft in January and February for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Meltdown patch are affected by a vulnerability that attackers could take advantage of to read and write easily in memory.

According to the group of [information security](URL experts, it has been confirmed that the eight defects affect the CPUs manufactured by Intel Corporation, and likewise could affect the ARM and AMD chips. The experts commented that Intel plans to release patches in two phases: the first in May and the second in August. Protecting our customers data and guaranteeing the safeties of our products are key priorities, we work in collaboration with clients, partners, other manufacturers and researchers to understand and mitigate any problem that is identified, and part of this process involve booking blocks. CVE numbers, said Leslie Culbertson, EVP and general manager of product security at Intel, in a press release that addresses the new findings. We believe in the value of coordinated disclosure and will share additional details about any possible problems as we complete mitigations, and we continue to encourage everyone to keep their systems up to date. These vulnerabilities, which have been referred to as Spectre Next Generation (Spectre-NG), are similar to the previous vulnerabilities; when they are not patched, they can be exploited to steal information through a side channel attack that uses a low privilege application to read the memory of another, more secure application. Information security professionals commented that one of the errors seems to be significantly more dangerous than its predecessors; the attackers can exploit it to attack a virtual machine, and use it as a starting point to later attack its host system, or the virtual machines of other clients that operate on the same server. Cloud-based service providers, host systems and servers are especially threatened and Intels Software Guard Extensions (SGX) will not protect cloud systems from danger, experts said. Assuming they prove to be legitimate, the Spectre-NG vulnerability group can pose significantly higher risks for cloud operators and multi-tenant environments than the original Spectre variants, said security architecture chief at Juniper Networks. , Craig Dods in an email The information provided to the German technology site  seems to imply that some of the eight new vulnerabilities facilitate VM escape mechanisms, allows the hypervisor and / or other tenants of their own virtual machine to be compromised . In March and April, Intel announced measures to redesign and secure its chips, according to researchers, four of the errors have been classified as high risk, and the remaining four are considered medium risk. Several teams of researchers participated in the report of new errors to Intel, including Google Project Zero, which follows a 90-day public disclosure policy for discovered vulnerabilities. Based on this line, Google could reveal details about one of the vulnerabilities on May 7. Project Zero, along with other groups of independent researchers and academics, revealed the previous set of vulnerabilities of Spectre and Meltdown in January of this year. According to [information security](URL researchers, Microsoft is developing patches that will be distributed in the form of Windows updates, unlike microcode updates. It is almost inevitable that new variants of Spectre will emerge, said Satya Gupta, CTO and co-founder of Virsec. Now that the vulnerabilities of speculative execution have been publicized, many funded piracy groups are competing to find new ways to exploit them. These are advanced attacks that exploit small but repeatable flaws that miss important security controls on millions of processors. The applications will be vulnerable and some compensation controls will be effective, the attackers will look for cracks in other defenses that allow the exploitation of Spectre, added."

The criptockacking is becoming a plague that affects consumers around the world, and what are even worse, experts do not know how to deal with the situation. According to an investigation carried out by the [information security](URL professional Troo Mursch about the defective packages, more than 400 websites have been attacked by hackers with crypto-jacking last weekend. These sites are vulnerable because they use an outdated version of the Drupal Content Management System. The main victims were found in the USA since 123 US websites were identified UU France in second place with 26 infected sites, Canada 19, Germany 18 and Russia 17. Researchers commented that some government websites, including the Chihuahua government, are included in the victims; the Revenue Administration of Turkey, and the Higher Education Quality Improvement Project of Peru, Lenovo, the San Diego Zoo and the websites of the US educational institutions. UU Other important names within the list of victims are: The National Board of Labor Relations of EE. UU. University of California at Los Angeles, Board of Arizona Behavioral Health Examiners, and City of Marion websites. The [information security](URL researcher has closely followed the campaign, has managed to identify what it means to hijack the processing of the PC to generate Monero. Users may not know that their PC is being used to mine cryptocurrencies. All infected websites use a piece of similar JavaScript hosted on vuuwd.com. Which is an obfuscated code that affects the performance of the visitor, since he is obliged to dedicate 80% of his CPU resources to mining Monero? The miner who infects the PC is active in the browser and, as it loads the website, begins to consume the power of the processor for mining, say information security professionals. Hackers need to infect enough computers with crypto-miners to earn enough money. By mining, the processor slows down due to the heavy workload and an excessive amount of electricity is consumed. The Drupal CMS vulnerability makes it easier to launch code execution attacks, Drupalgeddon2. Although the defect was patched in March, there are still many sites that are outdated and vulnerable. If you are a website operator that uses Drupals content management system, you must update to the latest available version as soon as possible, Mursch wrote. After the publication of the information security expert was published over the weekend, few of the infected websites were disinfected on Monday morning. The campaign is still active and continually engages new websites, as until the weekend Mursch identified 348 infected websites and the number increased to more than 400 by Monday morning. In addition to exploiting Drupalgeddon2, cybercriminals are also installing malware to perform denial of service attacks on websites."

247,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,You must update 7-zip now! critical vulnerability found,1,8jf0wt,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8jf0wt/you_must_update_7zip_now_critical_vulnerability/,2018-05-15 05:19:45,"Just a couple of months ago, an information security expert, nicknamed LANDAVE or Dave, found security vulnerability in the 7-Zip utility. A group of information security professionals commented that 7-Zip contains a huge variety of file decompression tools that some users install as one of their most important complementary Windows applications. 7z knows how to extract data from most other file formats and is not only compatible with its own brand of mega-compressed files. ZIP files, gzip and bzip2 files, Unix tar and cpio files, Windows CAI and MSI files, Macintosh DMG files, CD (ISO) images and more, added with an optional two-pane file management interface that is perfect for the old school. [Information security](URL experts say that 7-Zip includes support for RAR files, and thats where the vulnerability is, it is believed to be inherited from the open source code of the UnRAR tool. 7-Zip has already been patched against this error, CVE-2018-10115; now LANDAVE has made public the details of its finding, and what it implied to find out how serious this vulnerability could be. Dave said the problem arose from a common conflict between complexity and security. The professional commented that the UnRAR code is very complex, it supports varieties of different level and compression format, and this includes a special type of compression system that links files before compressing them, which frequently expresses more bytes of compressed data that crushes each file independently. This solid option is included in the RAR file format because it improves compression by allowing repeated string matches even if they are in different files, instead of restricting the repeated data fragments to a file. When you have several small but similar files, for example, this results in many more repeated string matches being found, and the compression ratio is increased. What the security professional found is that the UnRAR decompression code, as used by 7-Zip, is not configured securely when he started using it, which tells us that his software could innocently lead to a serious flaw in the RAR code. In other words, some uninitialized variables in the UnRAR code opened the possibility of creating a trap storage file that would trick the UnRAR code into executing a hidden code in the data part of the trap file. This code enters furtively since the data is known as shellcode. These errors that allow Shellcode execution are known as Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities, a malicious actor can use a file, to run malware on your device, even if you just open the booby-atrapped file and look at it. Dave also created a proof of concept (PoC) exploit that demonstrated how to create a RAR file that was sneaky and unexpectedly starts the Calculator application. The [information security](URL researcher commented that if a PoC could show CALC.EXE without warning, it could be modified to execute any command, including malware, in an invisible way for the user. Daves goal of building a functioning exploit became easier because the applications included with 7-Zip had been created without support for the random allocation of address space (ASLR). 7-Zip tools will always load in the same directions, improving exploits because attackers can predict which practical pieces of executable code would already be loaded, and where, the security professional commented. Now, in some good news, the creator of 7-Zip not only patch the uninitialized variable vulnerability (CVE-2018-10115) in the product, but also to compile the updated version with ASLR enabled. These changes were launcher a week ago in 7-Zip version 18.05. The information security expert gives us some recommendations of what to do: If you are a 7-Zip user, be sure to use the latest version. If you are a Windows programmer, do not send any software that is not compatible with ASLR. Using Visual Studio, you can compile with the / DYNAMICBASE option. If you are a programmer, when creating new objects: initialize the data fields with safe and reasonable values."

This update of LG includes the solution for a serious problem of Android, from Google. The first error has to do with the fact that the LG keyboard supports handwriting modes in several languages. When a new language or an update is installed for an existing one, the device arrives at a coded server, from where it retrieves the requested language file. According to the team of experts, who reported the vulnerability, the problem is that the download is made through an insecure HTTP connection, exposing it to man-in-the-middle attacks. A remote attacker could download a malicious file instead of the language file. Regarding the second problem, [information security](URL experts comment that it is a validation error in the file system of LG. Resource files within the limited environment of the LG keyboard package can be modified; and, the LG keyboard application grants executable permissions for downloaded library files with the .so extension. Then, an attacker who has gained access to MITM through the first vulnerability can inject an unauthorized executable file and this only by adding the .so extension to a library download. By altering the files.txt metadata file, the Engine.properties file could be overwritten by a false one. The keyboard loads the library indicated in the Engine.properties configuration file at the start of the application, and the rogue library injected into the aforementioned file would load as soon as the keyboard process is restarted, explained Slava Makkaveev, information security researcher at Check Point. Once we manage to inject the lib rouge into Engine.properties, we just have to wait for the application to restart and load the library. LG treats these vulnerabilities as a flaw; they are exclusive to LG devices. The threat is remarkable: phones have a market share of approximately 16 percent in the US. LG released a patch for all of these in its May security update."

Microsoft greatly expanded the number of such packages, extending support from the initial Skylake 6th gen processor family to many more CPU series, [information security training](URL researchers said. This means that many Windows users who utilize Intel CPUs but have not received BIOS updates from their motherboard manufacturer may now be able to install the Spectre variant 2 (CVE 2017-5715) patch just by downloading a Windows update package from Microsofts portal. Information security professionals told; Microsoft did not initially plan to distribute microcode updates. These packages patch the Spectre vulnerability that Microsoft initially said it couldnt fix at the software level, and deferred the patching operations to OEMs. The OS maker later changed its mind because some OEMs were missing in action, failing to integrate Intels microcode fixes. Currently, Microsoft is embedding these Intel CPU microcode patches as updates to the operating systems CPU driver, an unorthodox method of delivering microcode updates, which have previously been left to OEM vendors only, usually delivered as BIOS updates. Microsofts custom updates are only meant for Windows 10 version 1709 and Windows Server, version 1709 (Datacenter, Standard) users, and not for Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 machines.

These VPNs include HotSpot Shield, PureVPN, and Zenmate. The purpose of using a VPN depends on the situation but mostly people opt-in for VPNs to fight online censorship by accessing websites that are blocked by their ISPs while some chose to use VPN for anonymity and better privacy, [information security training](URL professionals said. But when the VPN you thought was protecting your privacy was actually posing a threat to it. That means that now you can be under government surveillance or malicious organizations, hackers can track your IP address and identify your ISP or on a business level, it can allow attackers to carry distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. According to VPN Mentors blog post, in order to find vulnerabilities in HotSpot Shield, PureVPN, and Zenmate VPN Mentor hired three ethical hackers who after testing concluded all three VPN have been leaking IP address of the user, even when a VPN is in use posing a massive privacy threat. It must be noted that the vulnerabilities exist in the Chrome browser plugins for all three VPNs and not in the desktop or smartphone apps. As per [information security training](URL experts report, AnchorFrees HotSpot Shield was filled with three vulnerabilities. The first vulnerability (CVE-2018-7879) allowed remote attackers to cause a reload of the affected system or to remotely execute code. The second and third vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-7878 &amp; CVE-2018-7880) leaked IP and DNS addresses which poses a privacy threat to users since hackers can track user location and the ISP. It must be recognized that HotSpot Shield was quick to respond to VPN Mentor regarding the vulnerabilities and patched all vulnerabilities professionally and timely protecting millions of its users from what could be a serious threat if exploited. The fast response of Hotspot Shield is something we think is worth commending. We felt that they worked with our research team in a fast and serious manner and that they care for their users. They took our research as help for improvement rather than criticism, said the co-founder of VPN Mentor Mr. Ariel Hochstadt. In PureVPN and Zenmate, information security training researchers also found that loopholes similar to Hotspot Shield may leak user sites and IP addresses. However, because they did not receive a response from both manufacturers, they did not specify the vulnerabilities of both."

CRM is considered as a most critical asset by businesses. A data breach into CRM can be disastrous as it can destroy trust in the business and severely tarnish the brand as well as raising compliance issues. ERPScan made the disclosure at the Troopers security conference. The research indicates that over 500 vulnerable systems are currently available on the internet without a fix. The vulnerability exploits a flaw in the SAP NetWeaver platform, used to automate business processes. Executing an attack involves using a directory traversal vulnerability to read administrator credentials. Having logged into the CRM portal the traversal vulnerability can be used again to inject malicious code, the hacker can then call it anonymously from a remote server. This could allow attackers to take full control of a SAP CRM system and read all available information about a companys clients, [information security training](URL analysts said. It takes nothing to exploit those vulnerabilities, says Vahagn Vardanyan, information security training researcher at ERPScan. Perpetrators can remotely read any file in SAP CRM without authentication. We scanned the Internet and found nearly 500 SAP servers that are prone to it. Since the story was published SAP has issued a statement, SAP Product Security Response Team collaborates frequently with research companies like ERPScan to ensure a responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities. All vulnerabilities in question have been fixed using security notes 2547431 and 2565622. Both security notes were released as part of February patch day. We strongly advise our customers to secure their SAP landscape by applying the available security patches immediately. [Information security training](URL professionals recommended that SAP users apply all available patches as soon as possible and monitor their systems for malicious behavior and anomalies.

Although the gravity of damage has been controlled considerably still there is room for mitigation. Perhaps thats the reason why Microsoft has decided to roll out new bug bounty program which will focus on discovering speculative execution side channel flaws. Speculative Execution Side Channels refer to hardware vulnerability class that can lay a significant impact on CPU from not anyone but multiple manufacturers, [information security training](URL experts explain. This bug bounty program will remain open until December 31. Microsoft is offering an astonishing $250,000 as reward sum for discovering new categories of attacks specifically speculative execution attacks that are currently undisclosed. In recognition of that threat environment change, we are launching a bounty program to encourage research into the new class of vulnerability and the mitigations Microsoft has put in place to help mitigate this class of issues, stated Microsoft principal information security group manager, Phillip Misner. These vulnerabilities came into the light in January 2018 and it was also identified that three variants of Spectre and Meltdown are present. These can potentially allow hackers to hijack users data. The processors from a variety of manufacturers including; Intel, AMD, and ARM could be impacted by these security vulnerabilities, [information security training](URL researchers said. Microsoft has already prepared software and firmware updates to deal with the issue and secure its devices that have these processors installed. Microsoft believes that Meltdown and Spectre are just two of the many security bugs and therefore, simply mitigating these two flaws wont solve the issue completely and we need to find other bugs. This bounty program is intended as a way to foster that research and the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities related to these issues, revealed Misner in a post. The reason for initiating the program is not to gain an edge over its competitors but to allow safe and secure Windows experience to users. Thats why Microsoft is planning to take its competitors and tech community in confidence and disclose the findings of the bug bounty program to the affected parties. Misner noted Speculative execution side channel vulnerabilities require an industry response. To that end, Microsoft will share, under the principles of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, the research disclosed to us under this program so that affected parties can collaborate on solutions to these vulnerabilities. Together with information security researchers, we can build a more secure environment for customers. Information security training analysts of Microsoft explain that the bug bounty program will be having four levels. Microsoft is offering $200,000 for tier 2 discoveries, which involve speculative execution mitigation bypasses for Azure while tier 3 involves same vulnerabilities but for Windows. Tier 4 will deal with identification of new exploits for already known vulnerabilities and the award money would be $25,000. Tier 1 deals with serious Hyper-V vulnerabilities in Windows 10 and the successful hacker will be receiving $250,000 in reward. This Microsoft bug bounty program has been launched at a time when Intel is gearing up to make important CPU changes by redesigning its processors and ensure protection against serious attacks like Spectre. Moreover, Intel will be introducing next-gen Xeon processors (Cascade Lake) that will be loaded with advanced hardware protection features along with 8th generation Intel Core processors. Firmware updates are expected to provide protection to existing CPUs. Only last month, [information security training](URL experts identified 139 malware samples exploiting Meltdown &amp; Spectre flaws which means cyber criminals are already gearing up to target unsuspecting users. Consequently, the bug bounty and firmware updates can play a major role in protecting users from large-scale attacks."

AMD acknowledged 13 critical vulnerabilities and exploitable backdoors in its Ryzen and EPYC processors that were first disclosed earlier March by the information security training researchers at the firm CTS Labs. The CTS Labs researchers did not disclose any technical details about the vulnerabilities to avoid abuses. AMD plans to roll out firmware updates in the incoming weeks to address the flaws affecting millions of devices worldwide. The vulnerabilities could be potentially exploited to steal sensitive data, install malicious code on AMD-based systems, and gain full access to the compromised systems, as per statement of an [information security training](URL analyst said. The vulnerabilities expose servers, workstations, and laptops running vulnerable AMD Ryzen, Ryzen Pro, Ryzen Mobile or EPYC processors to attacks. It has to be noted that CTS-Labs promptly reported the flaws to AMD, Microsoft and a small number of companies that could produce patches and mitigations. The analysis conducted by the [information security training](URL experts revealed four classes (RYZENFALL, FALLOUT, CHIMERA, and MASTERKEY) of vulnerabilities affecting the AMD Zen architecture processors and chipsets that usually contain sensitive information such as passwords and encryption keys. The vulnerability could allow bypassing AMDs Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) technology and also Microsoft Windows Credential Guard. This week AMD published a press release. Its important to note that all the issues raised in the research require administrative access to the system, a type of access that effectively grants the user unrestricted access to the system and the right to delete, create or modify any of the folders or files on the computer, as well as change any settings. reads the press release published by AMD. Any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research. Differently from Meltdown and Spectre attacks, AMD patches are not expected to impact system performance, information security training researchers said. CTS Labs are skeptical about a rapid fix of the issues, they claimed that AMD could take several months to release patches for most of the vulnerabilities, even some of them could not be fixed."

Since a security patch for this vulnerability is now available, the [information security training](URL researcher has finally released technical details and proof-of-concept exploit code for the flaw to the public. In order to exploit this flaw, which resides in MSXML3 parser, the hacker needs to use Out-of-Band Data Retrieval attack technique by offering the victim access to his/her computer via Windows Remote Assistance. While setting up Windows Remote Assistance, the feature gives you two options, Invite someone to help you and Respond to someone who needs help. Selecting the first option helps users generate an invitation file, i.e. invitation.msrcincident, which contains XML data with a lot of parameters and values required for authentication. Since the parser does not properly validate the content, the attacker can simply send a specially crafted Remote Assistance invitation file containing a malicious payload to the victim, tricking the targeted computer to submit the content of specific files from known locations to a remote server controlled by the attackers. The stolen information could be submitted as part of the URL in HTTP request(s) to the attacker. In all cases, an attacker would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take action, [information security training](URL collaborator at Microsoft explains. This XXE vulnerability can be genuinely used in mass scale phishing attacks targeting individuals believing they are truly helping another individual with an IT problem. Totally unaware that the .msrcincident invitation file could potentially result in loss of sensitive information, Ahmed warns. Among patching other critical vulnerabilities fixed this month, Windows users are highly recommended to install the latest update for Windows Remote Assistance as soon as possible"

The new campaign uses the legitimate, open-source XMRig cryptominer in conjunction with exploiting the old vulnerability CVE-2013-2618, which is found in Cactis Network Weathermap plug-in, according to an information security training researcher team report. The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in editor.php in Network Weathermap before 0.97b and allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the map_title parameter. This active campaign is hitting primarily Japan, Taiwan, China, the U.S., and India. As to why theyre exploiting an old security flaw: Network Weathermap only has two publicly reported vulnerabilities so far, both from June 2014. Its possible these attackers are taking advantage not only of a security flaw for which can exploit is readily available but also of patch lag that occurs in organizations that use the open-source tool the [information security training](URL researcher team wrote. The team was able to trace the activity back to two usernames associated with two Monero wallets where $74,677 has been deposited as of March 21. However, the researchers team noted that the people behind this campaign have made in excess of $3 million when the Tesla hacks and Jenkins server vulnerability exploitation are included. In each of these cases XMRig was also used. The attackers do need to look for targets with a very specific set up in order to be successful. This includes having a web server running Linux (x86-64) and the server has to be publicly accessible. The Cacti plug-in has to be present and implemented with the Plugin Architecture working and an outdated Network Weathermap (0.97a and prior), the web server should not require authentication and finally the web server should be running with root permissions. Because turning a Linux server into a mining operation does require that an older vulnerability be left unpatched the best way to protect against such an attack is to keep systems updated with the latest patches, the [information security training](URL professionals suggested."

The malware targets customers of major banks. According to a blog post by researchers at Webroot, the updated Trickbot has continually undergone updates and changes in attempts to stay one step ahead of defenders. [Information security training](URL researchers said that they observed a module (tabDll32 / tabDll64) being downloaded by TrickBot that has not been seen in the wild before this time. The malware is still, however, uses the MS17-010 Eternalblue vulnerability. The new module named spreader_x86.dll, exports four functions like the other TrickBot modules. The file has an abnormally large rdata section which proves to be quite interesting because it contains two additional files intended to be used by spreader_x86.dll. The spreader module contains an additional executable SsExecutor_x86.exe and an additional module screenLocker_x86.dll, information security training researchers told. According to Jason Davison, advanced threat research analyst, the module screenLocker_x86.dll attempts to lock a users machine. Similarly, to the other TrickBot modules, this module was written in Delphi. This is the first time TrickBot has shown any attempt at locking the victims machine, he said. If the TrickBot developers are attempting to complete this locking functionality, this generates interesting speculation around the groups business model. Locking a victims computer before you are able to steal their banking credentials alerts the victim that they are infected, thus limiting the potential for credit card or bank theft. However, extorting victims to unlock their computer is a much simpler monetization scheme, he said. It was notable that this locking functionality is only deployed after lateral movement, meaning that it would be used to primarily target unpatched corporate networks. In a corporate setting (with unpatched machines) it is highly likely that backups would not exist as well. The authors appear to be getting to know their target audience and how to best extract money from them. On a corporate network, where users are unlikely to be regularly visiting targeted banking URLs, ex filtrating banking credentials is a less successful money-making model compared to the locking of potentially hundreds of machines, the [information security training](URL analyst said. The TrickBot authors continue to target various financial institutions across the world, using MS17-010 exploits in an attempt to successfully laterally move throughout a victims network. This is being coupled with an unfinished screenLocker module in a new possible attempt to extort money from victims. Davison warned that the TrickBot banking Trojan remains under continual development and testing in a constant effort by its developers to stay one step ahead. Andy Norton, director of threat intelligence at Lastline, told that its not just financial institutions that are targeted, it is the customers of financial institutions and the finance function that are always targeted. The reason is again, that the bad guys are closer to the money. The side effect of having multiple payloads in order to maximize the chance of making money is that, from a behavioral analysis alerting perspective these threats light up like a Christmas tree. Adding Dynamic or behavioral analysis to an organizations defense in depth strategy, will protect organizations from this type of threat, the [information security training](URL researcher said. Matt Walmsley, EMEA director at Vectra told that Trickbots use of a network worm means it is spreading like wildfire across vulnerable systems. Whilst there are technical workarounds one can take around the configuration of SMB v1 to try and mitigate against Trickbot, most enterprises remain blind in terms of spotting active attacks inside their network as they move laterally. And of course, the time old adage of patch, patch, and patch still rings true. Even in financial services that typically have a high level of security maturity, detection and isolation is key, but to do so in a time-critical manner is beyond the ability of manual threat hunting. If you want to get ahead of the attack it is imperative to spot the early indicators, and thats a job best done using automated threat hunting techniques powered by AI, he said."

OpenSSL versions 1.1.0h and 1.0.2o patch CVE-2018-0739, a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability discovered using Googles OSS-Fuzz service, which has helped find several flaws in OpenSSL in the past period. The security hole, rated moderate, is related to constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition. Constructed ASN.1 types with a recursive definition (such as can be found in PKCS7) could eventually exceed the stack given malicious input with excessive recursion, the OpenSSL Project said in its advisory. Another vulnerability, which only affects the 1.1.0 branch, is CVE-2018-0733. The information security analysts said that this is an implementation bug in the PA-RISC CRYPTO_memcmp function, and it allows an attacker to forge authenticated messages easier than it should be. The OpenSSL Project learned about this vulnerability in early March from IBM. Only HP-UX PA-RISC systems are impacted. OpenSSL 1.1.0h also fixes an overflow bug that could allow an attacker to access TLS-protected communications. The vulnerability, CVE-2017-3738, was first disclosed in December 2017, but since an attack is not easy to carry out the issue has been assigned a low severity rating and it has only been patched now. Information security training analysts said that four rounds of security updates were released for OpenSSL last year, and only one of the eight fixed vulnerabilities was classified as high severity."

Meltdown and Specter are probably the worst vulnerabilities discovered in the history of computing. These two security flaws were made public earlier this year and affect virtually all modern processors to be related to the way in which the Kernel and the CPU communicate with each other, says an [information security training](URL researcher. In addition, the complexity of these vulnerabilities makes their solution very complicated, so much so that, at times, the corresponding patches open new security breaches in the operating systems, just as Windows 7 has just happened. Microsofts first patches for Intels Meltdown CPU vulnerability created an even bigger problem in Windows 7 that allowed any unprivileged application to read kernel memory, states information security experts. Microsofts January and February patches stopped the Meltdown bug that exposed passwords in protected memory, but information security training researcher Ulf Frisk has discovered that the patches introduced a far worse kernel bug, which allows any process to read and write anywhere in kernel memory. Frisk says the vulnerability affects Windows 7 x64 and Windows 2008R2 with the January or February patches. The two faulty patches wrongly set a bit in the virtual-to-physical-memory translator known as PLM4 to allow any user-mode application to access the kernels page tables, according to Frisk. Intels CPU uses these page tables to translate the virtual memory of a process into physical memory. The correctly set bit would normally ensure the kernel has exclusive access to these tables. The User/Supervisor permission bit was set to User in the PML4 self-referencing entry. This made the page tables available to user mode code in every process. The page tables should normally only be accessible by the kernel itself, he said. The PML4 is the base of the 4-level in-memory page table hierarchy that the CPU Memory Management Unit (MMU) uses to translate the virtual addresses of a process into physical memory addresses in RAM. Also, the [information security training](URL professional says the bug would be trivially easy to use to access all physical memory on, due to the PML4 page table being located at a fixed memory address in Windows 7. This situation means an attacker will also be able to locate the Windows 7 page table that is now accessible by user-mode applications. Windows 7 already did the hard work of mapping in the required memory into every running process. Exploitation was just a matter of read and writes to already mapped in-process virtual memory, writes Frisk. Once read/write access has been gained to the page tables it will be trivially easy to gain access to the complete physical memory, unless it is additionally protected by Extended Page Tables (EPTs) used for Virtualization. All one [has] to do is to write own Page Table Entries (PTEs) into the page tables to access arbitrary physical memory. The [information security training](URL researcher Frisk advised all admins and users of Windows 7 and Windows 2008R2 to install Microsofts March patch to resolve it. Windows 10 and Windows 8.1 are unaffected."

According to [information security training](URL researchers, the iOS Camera App is affected by a bug that could be exploited by hackers to redirect users to a malicious website; the issue resides in the built-in QR code reader. The vulnerability affects the latest Apple iOS 11 for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. The problem ties a new feature that was implemented in iOS 11 to allow users to automatically read QR codes while using the camera app without requiring any third-party QR code reader app. To read a QR code, users need to open the Camera app on their Apple devices and point the iPhone or the iPad at a QR code, in this way if the code and URL, the system will give the users a notification with the link address. Tapping the notification the users can visit the URL in Safari browser, but according to the information security researcher Roman Mueller who discovered the vulnerability, the URL visited could be changed. The [information security training](URL expert discovered that the URL parser of built-in QR code reader for iOS camera app doesnt correctly detect the hostname in the URL making it possible to change the displayed URL in the notification and hijacking to users to malicious websites. The URL parser of the camera app has a problem here detecting the hostname in this URL in the same way as Safari does. wrote the expert in a post. It probably detects xxx\ as the username to be sent to facebook.com:443. While Safari might take the complete string xxx\@facebook.com as a username and 443 as the password to be sent to infosec.rm-it.de. This leads to a different hostname being displayed in the notification compared to what actually is opened in Safari. Mueller created a QR code containing the following URL: URL When he scanned it he noticed that the device was showing the following notification: Open facebook.com in Safari Once tapped it opened URL instead Facebook. The expert successfully tested the issue on his iPhone X running iOS 11.2.6. The information security training researcher had already reported this flaw to Apple in December last year, but Apple hasnt yet fixed the bug to the date. The vulnerability is very dangerous and opens the doors to numerous attack scenarios. Mueller reported the vulnerability to the Apple security team."

Experts found that CloudFronts CDN routing mechanism that linked a sites domain and subdomains to a specific server contained a flaw that allowed attackers to point misconfigured subdomains to their own endpoint instead, effectively hijacking the subdomain from legitimate CloudFront users. Custom script hijacks over 2,000 official subdomains. MindPoint [information security training](URL analyst Matt Westfall coded and deployed a proof-of-concept Python script that automatically scanned CloudFront domains and hijacked vulnerable subdomains, pointing the servers to a demo page he created. Westfall says he hijacked over 2,000 subdomains over the period of a few days just by using his script. Some of the most high-profile subdomains belonged to companies such as the Red Cross, Bloomberg, Reuters, Dow Jones, Harvard, University of Maryland, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and two US government agencies. When subdomains from a high-trust domain are hijacked, they can be set up as a watering hole for delivering malware that has a high likelihood of bypassing filtering mechanisms, the [information security training](URL professional says. These subdomains are perfect for spear-phishing attacks, being almost impossible to detect even by the most astute and security-hardened user. The expert notified Amazon of his findings, and in the span of three days, he transferred ownership of these vulnerable subdomains back to Amazon, who is now running a warning on the subdomains, hoping that the legitimate owners rectify the misconfigured CDNs. A number of discussions with both the AWS Security team and the CloudFront engineers have followed, Westfall said in a post detailing the hijacking attacks technical details. The CloudFront team accepts that the nuances of CloudFronts routing mechanism that led to this condition leave room for improvement. However, AWS has deemed that this is not a vulnerability in the CloudFront service. This week, Amazon has begun showing a popup in the AWS CloudFront console when a user removes a CNAME from a CloudFront distribution, alerting the user to keep DNS records in sync with their CloudFront distribution, a setting that would prevent the CloudFront distributions subdomain from getting hijacked. Amazon also launches new AWS security-focused tools. This new popup alert is part of a large number of security updates Amazon rolled out to customers. Amazon rolled out a new service named AWS Secrets Manager that simplifies credentials, passwords, and API keys management. Amazon rolled out a new service named AWS Firewall Manager that simplifies the management of AWS WAF firewalls across multiple accounts and servers. Amazon rolled out a new service named Private Certificate Authority (CA) that lets customers use private certificates without the need for specialized infrastructure. Amazon added support for encrypting data in transit for the Amazon Elastic File System (EFS). Information security training analysts said that last year, Amazon also rolled out significant changes to the AWS dashboard, adding visible warnings for situations when customers were leaving AWS buckets exposed to the public, a common misconfiguration that was at the base of many data breaches in the past few years."

National cyber security Chief Gulshan Rai said the 10 websites hosted by the National Informatics Centre went down after a hardware failure. The reaction of the defense minister, as well as the spokespersons of some of the other ministries was that there had been a hack. There is no coordinated cyber attack on website of central ministries. There was a hardware failure in the storage network system at the NIC which resulted in a number of government websites being serviced by that system going down. We are working to replace the hardware and these websites will be up soon, said Rai, the top cyber security official in the Prime Ministers Office The information security training professional said in all 10 government websites went down and few of them including that of the Central Vigilance Commission and civil aviation ministry have been restored. The inaccessibility of the government websites was reminiscent of a textbook distributed denial of service or DDOS attack where users cant access a website because bots load it with traffic and queries. The Mandarin character complicated matters further, but it turned out that it stands for Zen, after a design theme offered by Drupal, an open-source content management system for websites. The fact that the websites went down on account of a hardware failure is still worrying, say the [information security training](URL experts, as is the fact that they didnt seem to have a back-up. Defense minister Nirmala Sitharamans tweet said, Action is initiated after the hacking of MoD website. The website shall be restored shortly. Needless to say, every possible step required to prevent any such eventuality in the future will be taken. Users logging onto the defense ministry website were directed to an error page, and a display message read: The website encountered an unexpected error, please try again later. An official spokesperson said the National Informatics Centre (NIC), which hosts the MHA site, was upgrading the security system of the home ministry website. The spokesperson said the move was precautionary. It is a technical server issue, the NIC is looking into it, the website should be up soon, Raviraj Saratape, a spokesperson for the science and technology ministry, said. The CERT, which is the governments computer emergency response team under the ministry, had issued a notification stating vulnerability in the malware protection engine. It said this could help a remote attacker to execute code on the target system. The belief that the anomaly was created by a cyber criminal has a background. Authorities had temporarily taken down the ministry of home affairs website last year after a cyber attack was reported. A month before that, suspected Pakistan-affiliated operatives had hacked the official website of the elite National Security Guard (NSG) and defaced it with a profanity-laden message against the Prime Minister and anti-India content, [information security training](URL researchers said. In 2016, the websites and databases of seven Indian missions in Europe and Africa were reportedly hacked and data from their servers were allegedly dumped online. Hackers going by the name Kapustkiy and Kasimierz L on Twitter claimed to have breached the security of the official websites of the Indian missions in South Africa, Libya, Malawi, Mali, Italy, Switzerland and Romania."

This unencrypted protocol allows a bad actor, which could be an individual, hacktivist, terrorist, or hostile nation-state, to find the radio frequency assigned to an emergency system, craft malicious activation messages, and set off the emergency system. Seeber discovered this flaw while auditing the emergency alert system deployed across the city of San Francisco in 2016. He did not initially notify ATI Systems of the bug, but the recent incidents involving the Dallas tornado sirens warning system and the Hawaii nuclear missile alert system drove the researcher to contact ATI. In a statement issued today, ATI says it developed a patch for the issue reported by the Bastille researcher. ATI has created a patch which adds additional security features to the command packets sent over the radio. This is currently being tested and will be rolled out shortly, ATI says. The company added that these emergency alert systems are customized for each client and that each customer will have to reach out to the company for his own custom fix. According to [information security training](URL professionals, a patch for the San Francisco emergency alert system has already been applied last month. A single warning siren false alarm has the potential to cause widespread panic and endanger lives, said Chris Risley, CEO, Bastille Networks. Bastille informed ATI and San Francisco of the vulnerability 90 days ago, to give them time to put a patch in place. Were now disclosing SirenJack publicly to allow ATI Systems users to determine if their system has the SirenJack vulnerability. We also hope that other siren vendors investigate their own systems to patch and fix this type of vulnerability. URL"

Unfortunately, Outlook may not be as secure as we users would like to think. According to a report published by [information security training](URL experts at the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute, Outlook comes with a security bug that could trigger password hash leaks when users preview Rich Text Format emails that contains remotely hosted OLE objects. This security vulnerability exists because the Redmond giant doesnt use strict content verification and restrictions when loading items from a remote SMB server. On the other hand, the same vulnerability cannot be exploited when accessing web-hosted content as Microsoft applies much stricter restrictions when dealing with this type of content. Outlook doesnt load web-hosted images in emails in order to protect users IP addresses. However, when users access RTF email messages that contain OLE objects loaded from a remote SMB server, Outlook does load the respective images. This leads to a series of leaks that include IP address, domain name, and more as the reports explains: Outlook blocks remote web content due to the privacy risk of web bugs. But with a rich text email, the OLE object is loaded with no user interaction Here we can see than an SMB connection is being automatically negotiated. The only action that triggers this negotiation is Outlook previewing an email that is sent to it I can see that the following things are being leaked: IP address, domain name, user name, host name, SMB session key. A remote OLE object in a rich text email messages functions like a web bug on steroids. Microsoft partially fixes the problem. Microsoft recently rolled out a hotfix on Patch Tuesday to fix this security issue. According to [information security training](URL experts, this solution is not 100% safe as it fails to block all remote SMB attacks. Once this fix is installed, previewed email messages will no longer automatically connect to remote SMB servers. This fix helps to prevent the attacks outlined above. It is important to realize that even with this patch, a user is still a single click away from falling victim to the types of attacks described above. For example, if an email message has a UNC-style link that begins with \\, clicking the link initiates an SMB connection to the specified server."

As explained by the company, at least for now they will not solve the problem. The reason is that solving this security flaw requires a lot of work. Cyber security researcher Stefan Kanthak has discovered that the Skype update installer could be exploited with a DLL hijacking technique. This allows an attacker to trick an application into creating malicious code instead of the correct library. Consequently, an attacker would have the possibility of downloading a malicious DLL into a temporary folder accessible to the user. Once this is done, you can rename an existing DLL that can be modified by an unprivileged user, such as UXTheme.dll. The error works because the malicious DLL is found first when the application looks for the DLL it needs. Kanthak, indicates that a script or malware could remotely transfer a malicious DLL to that temporary folder. He adds that Windows offers several ways to do it. In addition the cyber security expert said that once an attacker obtains the necessary privileges, he could do anything. From there, an attacker could steal files, delete data or hijack them by running ransomware. Kanthak informed Microsoft about this error. However, the software giant said that issuing an arrangement would require a major code review. They affirmed that a new version would arrive, beyond a simple cyber security review."

Since 2012, he has performed in 21 countries and has focused on mobile platforms, perhaps because of the large number of Android devices without support that are still in operation. Recently they have developed a cross-platform remote access RAT Trojan called CrossRAT. It is undetectable and can infect Windows, MacOS, Linux and Solaris. According to a information security expert, among the malicious actions that can be carried out are being able to access remotely to manipulate files of the system, take screenshots, put into operation arbitrary executables and have persistent access to the infected device. The cyber security researchers say that Dark Caracal does not rely on any zero-day vulnerability, but uses basic social engineering through Facebook groups and WhatsApp messages. CrossRAT is built with Java, so it is easy to decompile it and reverse engineer it. CrossRAT, implements a file called hmar6.jar to check the operating system used and finish the installation process correctly. Then it tries to gather information about the infected system, including the version, the architecture and the kernel compilation. On Linux systems that use systemd, it is dedicated to consulting the init files to determine the distribution. Most of the popular distributions like, Ubuntu, Fedora, openSUSE, RHEL 7, Arch Linux, Mageia and Manjaro, use systemd. CrossRAT implements specific mechanisms for each operating system that are executed one or more times to cause a reboot and register the infected computer to the command and control server of Dark Caracal, allowing the attackers to send commands and extract data, this shows that the malware was created for the purpose of surveillance. It connects to the flexberry.com domain through port 2223. According to information security professionals its surprising that it has no predefined order to activate the keylogger, because the feature cannot be activated, from the command and control server, something that can be justified in that it is still at an early stage of development."

Recently, cyber security experts have detected a new SPAM campaign that distributes a series of malicious Word documents in order to infect users computers. At first it seemed that the documents used the classic Word macros, when analyzing them it was discovered that they use a new technique even to carry out the attacks. Hackers take advantage of the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability, a security flaw in the Office equation editor that allows code to be executed in the system. As per investigation by a firm specialized in information security, now the hackers send a DOCX document via e-mail, a document that seems harmless but, when it is executed, loads an embedded OLE object that downloads and opens an RTF document which is used to exploit the vulnerability, which executes a series of commands that finally download a VisualBasic script that, when executed, infects our system with a malware that steals our passwords and sends them to a remote server controlled by hackers. Microsoft in the security patches of January 2018 included a patch to mitigate the vulnerability, so if we have our system updated we will not have to worry about."

According to an information security researcher, a criminal group has made $3.4 million by compromising Jenkins servers and installing a Monero cryptocurrency miner called JenkinsMiner. The person responsible, has been running the XMRig miner on many versions of Windows, and has already secured him over $3 million worth of Monero crypto-currency. The criminal has now upped his game by targeting the powerful Jenkins CI server, giving him the capacity to generate even more coins, states a cyber security firm. Jenkins is the most popular open source automation server; it is maintained by CloudBees and the Jenkins community. The automation server supports developers build, test and deploy their applications, it has more than 133,000 active installations worldwide with more than 1 million users. The person behind the massive mining operation was leveraging the CVE-2017-1000353 RCE vulnerability in the Jenkins Java deserialization implementation. The vulnerability is due to lack of validation of the serialized object, its exploitation allowed the attackers to make Jenkins servers download and install the JenkinsMiner, according to a cyber security expert. The operation uses a hybridization of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and XMRig miner over the past months to target victims around the globe. The miner is capable of running on many platforms and Windows versions. With every campaign, the malware has gone through several updates and the mining pool used to transfer the profits is also changed. continues the statement. A good number of the downloads for the JenkinsMiner are from IP address located in China and assigned to the Huaian government information center, of course, we are not able to determine if the server was compromised or explicitly used by state-sponsored hackers. In January, information security expert Mikail Tun analyzed Jenkins servers exposed online discovering that many instances leak sensitive information. Mikail Tun said that Jenkins usually requires credentials to the code repository and access to an environment in which to deploy the code, usually GitHub, AWS, and Azure. Failure to configure the application correctly can expose data. The information security researcher discovered that many misconfigured systems provided guest or administrator permissions by default, while others allowed guest or admin access to anyone who registered an account."

However, this antivirus engine like many others has vulnerabilities, commented a data security expert. Just last December, Microsoft announced the release of an important security patch to fix vulnerabilities in the Windows 10 anti-malware engine. Now, a new vulnerability related to its anti-malware software was discovered in the latest version of its operating system. On this occasion, the vulnerability lies in the Anti-Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) component of Windows 10. The AMSI module allows an application to send any file to be scanned with a local antivirus and receives the results once analyzed. Although this tool can be used to analyze any type of file, Microsoft designed it especially thinking of analyzing PowerShell, VBScript and Ruby type scripts, which can easily include functions to evade conventional antivirus analysis systems. Anti-Malware Scan Interface stops scanning a script after a NULL character. As cyber security researchers have shown, the vulnerability in Windows Defender finds that this scanning engine starts to analyze any file or script but, when it encounters a NULL character, the scanning engine stops analyzing the script, giving it for good. In this way, hackers could hide all the malicious code below this NULL character so that, even if the script is analyzed, the malicious code goes unnoticed and is not detected. Microsoft was already aware of this vulnerability, and therefore, with the release of the last security patches last week, the company addressed and solved the vulnerability described above. Therefore, to protect ourselves from this vulnerability, what we must do is make sure that our Windows 10 is updated with the latest available security patches, specifically the security patches of February 2018. In addition, data security professionals recommend that the engineers of the main antivirus market review their security systems to verify that, like Microsofts anti-malware, they do not stop analyzing scripts after arriving at a NULL character."

Its rate alerts much to both companies and users. Hackers take advantage of the most popular sectors and where there are more users. One of these cases is Microsoft Office 365. Microsoft Office 365 offers us space in the cloud, and other services such as email, calendar, etc. Cyber security professionals recommend this for business solution, but also at the user level. Microsoft Office 365 differs from its normal version in that we pay for its use on a monthly basis. Paying through the official page, we avoid paying for the software completely. Now the ransomware affects users. One example is Cerber Ransomware, which pointed to Office 365 and flooded users inboxes with an Office document that invoked malware through macros. Also the WannaCry attack was designed to exploit a vulnerability of Microsoft. And now we have a new variety of ransomware, ShurL0ckr, designed to evade integrated malware protection in OneDrive and Google Drive. To protect data within Office 365, organizations must adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which offers guidance based on existing standards, guidelines and practices to better manage and reduce cyber security risk. Identity management, data loss prevention, and backup and recovery are three crucial areas to evaluate within the Cybersecurity framework of NIST, especially when transferring high priority data to a SaaS application such as Office 365. The ransomware encrypts all data and documents. It is what differentiates it from other types of malware. In return it asks for an economic rescue to release these files. Therefore, one of the data security professionals recommendations is to create backup copies frequently. With this we manage to save our important data and, in case of being affected by a ransomware, the loss will be less. Most of the ransomware comes through emails. Thats why experts also recommend configuring the Office 365 anti-spam protection policies. According to research by data security specialists, in most cases the users of a company are the gateway to the ransomware. You have to make sure that users have the necessary security software to be able to deal with these types of threats, know the social engineering techniques used, etc. Although this does not protect the ransomware by itself, it is a measure of data security to be taken into account. This allows us, in addition to entering the password, to enter credentials through a call, message or some notification. It is important to prevent them from accessing our accounts."

Baset claimed he discovered the issue, which he described as a logical error, within a few minutes of receiving an invitation to like a Facebook page on which he had liked a post. Looking at the emails source code, the researcher noticed that it included the name of the pages administrator and other details. A data security expert provided an explanation on why such information disclosure vulnerability can represent a problem to Facebook page administrators. For many individual Facebook pages, the administrator and the page will share an identity, so putting the administrator name in the pages email isnt really giving away much, the data security expert said. But for business or community pages, which might have a number of co-administrators, you wouldnt expect Facebook to reveal anything more than the name of the page itself. this protects individual employees from getting bombarded with comments, questions or even insults, in place of the account itself, the expert added. The data security researcher said this was the second time he reported a vulnerability to Facebook without having to write any code to demonstrate his findings. After being notified through its bug bounty program, Facebook acknowledged the vulnerability and decided to award the expert $2,500 for his findings. Facebook reported that last year it paid out more than $880,000 for 400 vulnerability reports submitted by white hat hackers."

It allows an attacker that has gained any authenticated access to trick the system into granting further access as a different user without knowledge of that users password. This could be used by an attacker who has compromised a low level limited access account to acquire access to third-party cloud services or it could be used by a hacker seeking access to reserved network areas. The vulnerability was discovered by the research team of a cyber security firm. According to the investigation, it affects many of the leading SSO providers and probably the majority of developers of SSO. Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is the protocol used by most SSO implementations. It is what allows authentication to be passed between a companys identity stores and, for example, a third-party service. Usually, a user will log onto the identity store. This contains the credentials that will allow the same user to access other services. SAML is used to pass authentication, via the browser, from the identity provider to the third-party service, granting access. The vulnerability is in how authentication is encoded by SAML in the providers response. The SAML authentication response contains two primary elements: the affirmation and the signature. The affirmation element says this NameID is authenticated. The signature element is designed to prevent the authenticated user NameID being changed at any point between the identity provider and the service being accessed. If the attacker can modify the NameID without invalidating the signature, that would be bad, comment the data security researchers. One of the causes of this vulnerability is a unexpected behavior of XML libraries like Pythons lxml or Rubys REXML,. Comments can be included in the signature, but the binding process of the SAML libraries tends to drop all text after the first text node to isolate the NameID. The cyber security researchers explain, As an attacker with access to the account user@user.com.evil.com, I can modify the SAML affirmation to change the NameID to user@user.com when processed by the SP. The seven characters are inserted before .evil.com. This causes the biding process to drop .evil.com, leaving the authenticated account as user@user.com. Not all SSO implementations are vulnerable to this glitch, but many are. All that is required is a genuine account that he can modify to his attack target, plus the relatively minor technical savvy to intercept and edit the SAML authentication as it passes through the browser. Different affected SSOs will have different specific recommendations, and it would be best to refer to them for guidance. Similarly, there are different recommendations for maintainers of identity or service providers. The data security professionals suggest implementing multi-factor authentication, because this vulnerability would only allow a bypass of a users first factor of authentication, but if your IdP is responsible for both first factor and second factor authentication, its likely that this vulnerability bypasses both The cyber security company has confirmed the vulnerability in: OneLogin  python-saml (CVE-2017-11427); OneLogin  ruby-saml (CVE-2017-11428); Clever  saml2-js (CVE-2017-11429); OmniAuth-SAML (CVE-2017-11430); Shibboleth (CVE-2018-0489); and Duo Network Gateway (CVE-2018-7340)."

Cyber security experts have discovered that Memcached servers fail to protect UDP ports, making them an easy target for hackers and their attacks on the service. The cyber security professionals indicate that this is a vulnerability of the solution development team when it comes to supporting the UDP protocol in their product. The investigation reports reveal that last week they observed some strange behavior of Memcached servers. Attackers sent packets of some bytes in size to UDP ports. Something not significant but in some occasions they were of considerable size. Starting from the sending of these larger packages, experts say that hackers can cause these to be sent to a specific IP address in response, that is the victims, the real objective of the DDoS attack. Cyber security researcher says that many people are not aware of the magnitude of the problem. If it were not a known solution of content caching we would be talking about a lesser evil or that would go unnoticed by cybercriminals.

According to cyber security experts, a new variant of the Spectre attack on devices that use Intel can be used to crack open Intels secure enclaves to view their memory. The SgxPectre side-channel attack affects programs with sensitive components protected by Intels SGX (Software Guard Extensions) enclaves. SGX is available in newer Intel Core chips and allows developers to selectively isolate sensitive application code and data to run in their own execution environment. This enclave is created by the CPU and allows sensitive parts of an application to run in its own memory region inside the enclave where its protected from system software, including hypervisors and the operating system. Microsoft also recently began supporting SGX in Azure allowing developers to protect data from the threat of rogue staff at its datacenters. As cyber security researchers from Ohio State University explain in a report about SgxPectre, the Meltdown and Spectre attacks on CPUs raise questions over SGXs resilience to them. It turns out that its not resilient and its just as difficult to fix. An attacker using SgxPectre can compromise the confidentiality of SGX enclaves and learn the content of the enclaves memory. The data security researchers explain the attack exploits the race condition between the injected, executed memory references, which lead to side-channel observable cache traces, and the latency of the branch resolution. The attack focuses on two hardware features of Intel CPUs that are designed to enhance a chips performance through speculative execution. These include branch prediction of enclave code, which can be manipulated by code outside the enclave, and implicit caching of memory caused by speculatively executed instructions. The branch prediction units used in the enclave mode for predicting branch targets are not thoroughly cleansed upon enclave entrance. Therefore, code outside the targeted enclave can manipulate the targets of the branch prediction inside the targeted enclave, the researchers explain. Implicit caching caused by speculatively executed instructions are not properly rolled back after these instructions are discarded, which means the speculatively executed instructions, though never committed to memory, may lead to cache state changes that are observable by the adversary. To exploit this vulnerability, the enclave code needs to display certain code patterns. However, these code patterns are present in Intels software developer kit (SDK) for building SGX programs. Rust-SGX and Graphene-SGX are vulnerable for the same reason. Data security professionals said that any code built with the SDKs will be affected. The attack can be mitigated by Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS), one of the fixes Intel shipped in its microcode updates for Spectre Variant 2. However, since microcode updates can be reverted, developers relying on SGX in the cloud would need to verify the CPU security version number during remote attestation. The cyber security researchers have released a vulnerability scanning tool for finding vulnerable code patterns in enclave programs, and plan to open-source SgxPectre exploits later. The issues were reported to Intel before the paper was published."

Pivotals Spring Framework a platform is widely used by development teams for building web applications. Spring Data REST builds on top of Spring Data repositories; it allows exposing hypermedia-driven HTTP resources for aggregates contained in the model. The components included in the Spring Data REST are used by developers to build Java applications that offer RESTful APIs to underlying Spring Data repositories. The vulnerability is similar to the weaknesses found in Apache Struts that resulted in the Equifax data breach. Information security training researchers at lgtm.com have discovered a remote code execution vulnerability that affects various projects in Pivotal Spring. reads the security advisory published by the company that discovers the flaw. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands on any machine that runs an application built using Spring Data REST. This vulnerability ties the way Springs own expression language (SpEL) is used in the Data REST component. The lack of validation of the user input allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on any machine that runs an application built using Spring Data REST. Virtually every modern web application will contain components that communicate through REST interfaces, ranging from online travel booking systems, mobile applications and internet banking services, comments the information security training professional. Pivotal issued a security patch for a vulnerability it refers to as DATAREST-1127 as part of its Spring Boot 2.0 update. Malicious PATCH requests submitted to spring-data-rest servers can use specially crafted JSON data to run arbitrary Java code. reads the security advisory published by Pivotal. Information security training researchers have worked closely with Pivotal to solve the issue and publicly disclose the issue, the intent was to give Spring Data REST users sufficient time to update their apps. The exploitation of the flaw in RESTful APIs could allow hackers to easily gain control over production servers and access sensitive information. This vulnerability in Spring Data REST is unfortunately very easy to exploit. As it is common for RESTful APIs to be publicly accessible, it potentially allows bad actors to easily gain control over production servers and obtain sensitive user data. explained the information security training specialist who discovered the flaw.

Until the flaw in Memcached servers can be fixed, information security training expert Carlos Morales said in a blog post, attacks like these are likely to continue. Memcached is an open source memory caching system that stores often-accessed data in RAM to speed up access times. But it wasnt designed for use on internet-connected systems, as access doesnt require authentication, as information security training professional comments. The Memcached open nature allows an attacker to plant a massive amount of data on an exposed server, and then use a spoofed get request to direct massive traffic to a victims IP address. This can overload the victims network and affect their service. As information security training specialist explained, the potential amplification of small amounts of data is huge: 15 bytes of data can generate a 750KB response, an amplification of 51,200x. The attack relies on spoofing UDP packets to function, which the Memcached team addressed in a recent patch released to address the amplification attack. The main feature of the patch is turning off UDP by default, which could eliminate the spread of terabyte DDoS attacks that use this vulnerability. With more than 100,000 vulnerable systems online, eliminating this source of DDoS attacks will be difficult. Akamai predicts that the popularity of such attacks will only grow, making those 100,000 systems main targets for attackers. Information security training researchers recommended that internet-facing Memcached servers be upgraded to the latest version and have UDP disabled. As with other major security vulnerabilities, this one has a patch available that the developer says can solve the problem. Future victims will likely be those that failed to update their Memcached installs."

An information security training researcher Corben Leo discovered the flaw late last year and contacted Nike through the companys dedicated email address for reporting security vulnerabilities, which it advertises on its bug bounty page. After Nike doesnt respond for more than three months, Leo contacted a cyber security news site, which also alerted the company to the vulnerability. The bug exploited an out-of-band XML external entities (OOB-XXE) flaw that abused how Nikes website parses XML-based files, allowing the researcher to read files directly on the server. OOB-XXE vulnerabilities are widely seen as difficult to carry out, but can be used to gain deep access to a servers internals. Gaining access to a servers files can disclose other avenues for exploitation, such as remote code execution or pivoting to other connected servers or databases. The exploit code, just over a dozen lines in Python, let Leo was able to capture the data stored on a Nike.com subdomain, to an external listening FTP server he operated, which spit out the files results line by line. A video of the exploit in action revealed the contents of the servers, passwd file, which included every username able to log in to the server, such as system administrators. A Nike spokesperson confirmed the flaw is now fixed, but downplayed any risk to other systems. MyNikeTeam.com site was a pilot site that was active for a few months last year and was hosted on a separate server to the main Nike.com site. It has now been retired to address this issue. We appreciate any notification that helps us maintain data security, the spokesperson said. Nike isnt just a sports apparel retail giant. In the past few years, the company has been aggressively pushing into the data-gathering market by implementing sports and activity tracking into its products, as well as creating its own line of wearables, a market it since exited from, but still integrates its technology with other branded wearables. An information security training specialist from Nike comment that the site was designed for wholesale customers and not ordinary consumers, but still allowed users to log in with their Nike.com username and password. Nike said its micro-service architecture and server setup meant user data was never at risk by the bug. A video and proof-of-concept (PoC) code was passed to Scott Helme, a UK-based information security training researcher and consultant, to independently review. The issue here is pretty severe and the information security training researcher found a very nice OOB-XXE injection vulnerability, said Helme. As can be seen in the demo video, the PoC extracted the contents of the passwd file on the host and sent them to a remote server under the control of the researcher, proving the vulnerability is valid and that data can be filtrated from the host. The response from Nike was to take the affected site offline but this doesnt address the concerns around any data that was processed and the access to other internal systems that an attacker would have had, the information security training consultant added. With a login form on the page its more than reasonable to assume that credentials were processed on the affected site whilst this vulnerability was present, the information security training expert said. Also, an attacker could have leveraged to probe other systems and services adjacent to, or accessible from, this particular host."

Cortana has been developed in a way that if enabled it listens and responds to voice commands at all times even when the computer is locked and the software also allows direct browsing to websites. The information security training researchers claim that an attacker can hack a computer by issuing voice commands and force it to visit a non-HTTPS website. In accordance to experts, the attack requires a USB network adapter which when attached to the victims PC, the traffic to the PC is intercepted and redirected to the malicious website that the attacker has loaded with malware. Using a mouse, an attacker can connect the targeted PC to any Wi-Fi network. On the other hand, the attack method relies upon having physical access to the target machine, which serves as the only obstacle to attackers. But, the physical access is needed only for compromising the first computer and not to amplify the attack. So this attack is not only limited to the physical access scenario but also can be used by attackers to expand their access and jump from one computer to another, Tal Beery told Motherboard. The information security training professionals explain; When a computer is infected, it can be forced to communicate with other computers available on the local network and spread the infection using a technique called ARP Poisoning. This method allows an infected PC to trick the machines on the local wireless network to route their incoming traffic via the attackers network. Shulman noted that even when a machine is locked, you can choose the network to which that machine is attached. Its interesting if its to abuse a locked computer but Its more interesting if it can be done remotely. Microsoft was informed about this issue and the company took immediate measures by passing Cortanas internet requests via Bing but the software still responds to requests when the PC is locked. To ensure that your computer stays protected, you need to disable Cortana on Windows 10 lock screen. Tal Beery said that the issue is caused by the developers penchant to introduce new interfaces into computers without properly assessing their security implications. Until the vulnerability is fixed, information security training specialists suggest to protect computers users can configure it to password-lock after a specific duration when the machine is inactive, which would prevent someone from infecting the computer by gaining physical access."

Various proof-of-concept scripts have been released to exploit the vulnerability. Hackers have recently been exploiting a vulnerability in the Memcached protocol that gives them the ability to create record-breaking amplification attacks, a type of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS). These attacks are trivial to implement, said an information security training researcher, as a botnet of computers is not needed in order to generate amounts of traffic necessary to paralyze a given system or network. Researchers claim to have discovered a way of mitigating the vulnerability in Memcached servers.An information security researcher team said it has disclosed the new kill switch to the authorities in a bid to lock down the flaw worldwide and prevent more damaging attacks. The Memcached open source memory caching system is found on over 95,000 servers worldwide, where it caches frequently used web pages to boost access times and performance. It was never meant to be internet accessible, so is not protected by any authentication mechanism, information security training specialist said. This means hackers can generate spoof requests to amplify DDoS attacks by up to 50,000 times. The same vulnerability can also be exploited via a simple debug command to steal any data cached on a targeted server, including confidential database records, website customer information, emails, API data, Hadoop information and more. Hackers could also maliciously modify the data and reinsert it into the cache without the owners knowledge. The newly discovered flush_all counter-measure sends a command to an attacking server to suppress current DDoS exploitation, and invalidates the cache including any potential malicious payload, an information security training consultant said. It has apparently been tested on live attacking servers and found to be 100% effective with no collateral damage caused. Memcached represents a new chapter in DDoS attack executions. Previously, the most recent record-breaking attacks were being orchestrated from relatively low bandwidth Internet of Things (IoT) devices, said the information security expert and Corero Network Security CEO, Ashley Stephenson. In contrast, these Memcached servers are typically connected to higher bandwidth networks and, as a result of high amplification factors, are delivering data avalanches to crippling effect. Unless operators of Memcached servers take action, these attacks will continue."

That exposure would now allow script kiddies to conduct large-scale DDoS attack as if the recent massive DDoS attack on Github and the worlds largest 1.7Tbps attack on an American firm werent enough. According to a list provided by an information security training firm, the following companies and websites have been hit by DDoS attacks through misconfigured Memcached servers. The list has been compiled by researchers using their ddosmon platform which is equipped with a dedicated DDoS botnet C&amp;C tracking system to provide insights.

The NRA National Rifle Association was already in news for all the wrong reasons after the Florida school shooting and since a group of students publicly urged the association to put a Federal ban on assault rifles. According to information security training experts, multiple domains owned by NRA suffered a series of massive DDoS attack between 27th  28t February forcing them to go offline. The incident was also noticed by users on Twitter who shared screenshots of the sites at the time they went offline. Besides the United States and China, attackers have also targeted cyberinfrastructure in Brazil, Canada, South Korea, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

According to information security training researcher Renato Marinho, the Apache Solr attackers are using the critical remote code execution vulnerability tagged as CVE-2017-12629. The Apache Software Foundation released a fix for this in October. Solr is a widely used Apache program for building search functionality into websites. Marinho reckons the Solr attackers are the same group who installed Monero miners on vulnerable Oracle WebLogic servers to generate the equivalent of $226,000 in Monero. Now that most Oracle WebLogic servers are fixed, miscreants had to move to another target, the information security expert Marinho wrote in a blog. Within nine days, from February 28 to March 8, this single campaign exploited 1,416 vulnerable Apache Solr servers to deploy Monero XMRig miners across the globe. Its not known how much Monero the attackers have generated from compromised Solr servers because theyre using a proxy to access Monero miner pools, which allows them to hide their Monero wallet addresses, Marinho told. Servers, as opposed to PCs, are an attractive target for cryptomining in general because theyre more likely to be running on powerful CPUs. The attackers are scanning the internet for available Solr servers and using a publicly known exploit that was released in October. After compromising a machine, the attackers load a bash script that deploys the XMRig miner and sets up tasks to ensure the miner is chugging away day and night. Admins will be able to see a process called fs-manager running on affected machines connected to the miner pool through the address pool-proxy.com on port 8080. The information security training specialist notes that IBM InfoSphere version 11.5, JBoss Data Grid versions 7.0.0, 7.1.0, JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) versions 6, 7, 7.0.8, and JBoss Enterprise Portal Platform version 6 may also be vulnerable to this attack because it exploits vulnerability in a shared library."
286,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Vulnerability Reporting Delays by China,1,848o86,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/848o86/vulnerability_reporting_delays_by_china/,2018-03-14 10:14:37,"According to an information security firm, China is attempting to cover up inexplicable delays in public reporting of high-risk software security holes by changing the dates of vulnerability publication to its national vulnerability database so they match those in the U.S. database. A previous investigation, in November, discovered that China is finding and disclosing information on software security holes faster than the United States, except when those vulnerabilities are high risk and might be used in targeted attacks. Now the information security firm Recorded Future has discovered that China National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD) altered the original publication dates for at least 267 vulnerabilities in its research published in November 2017. The [information security training](URL expert said it expects the changes were made to conceal evidence it revealed in its previous report. CNNVD is managed by Chinas Ministry of State Security (MSS). CNNVD takes longer to publish high threat vulnerabilities than low threat vulnerabilities, Priscilla Moriuchi, information security training researcher. Chinas National Vulnerability Database has a website but appears to be separate from the Chinas Ministry of State Security MSS, the firm said in previous research. MSS is akin to the US Central Intelligence Agency. Unlike the CIA, however, MSS is not just a foreign intelligence service, but it also has a large, and arguably more important domestic intelligence mandate. Recognizing the importance of the domestic mission is key to understanding why the MSS would manipulate data that is primarily consumed by Chinese or regional users. In other words, China is in no hurry to publish information about serious vulnerabilities because it wants to give MSS time to evaluate how the government might use them in offensive cyber operations. CNNVDs outright manipulation of these dates implicitly confirmed this assessment, the firm said. Now it seems China also is trying to cover its tracks and hide its intent. The dates changed in the CNNVD were for vulnerabilities that the U.S. NVD had reported in six days and the CNNVD took more than twice as long as its average of 13 days to report. Information security training analysts first noticed the discrepancies between publication dates in two Microsoft Office security holes identified as outliers in its November report. The initial CNNVD publication dates for the two vulnerabilities had been backdated to match NVD and erase the publication lag, the information security firm said in its report. Screenshots of the vulnerabilities records from November and February, respectively, are provided in the report, highlighting the date alteration. The information security firm found that 267 of the 268 CNNVD original publication dates had been altered since November 17. Moreover, each date was changed post-publication to approximate or beat publication date in the U.S. vulnerability database. What we found was that CNNVD had changed the publication date to hide the publication lag, information security training professional Moriuchi said.This would hide the evidence of (Ministry of State Security) influence and any other processes that would create the publication lag in the first place and it would limit the methods we were using and any other organizations would use to anticipate Chinese APT behavior. The firm identified 74 new outlier vulnerabilities, published between September 13 and November 16, 71 of which were backdated and the publication lags erased, researchers said. From a public service and transparency perspective, there could be larger liability issues for companies and institutions that rely solely on CNNVD data, researchers said. If a company is victimized by an exploit for a vulnerability during the altered period of time, unless they kept a historical record of all CNNVD initial report dates, they could face questions about why they did not remediate a vulnerability for which they did not know about, according to the firm report. Additionally, China recently instituted a Cybersecurity Law (CSL) mandating that companies operating in China adopt a tiered system of network security protections, [information security training](URL ) researchers said. The law allows the state to hold companies both legally and financially responsible for what officials deem a network security incident. In light of the activity uncovered by Recorded Future, for a foreign multinational company to comply with all the provisions of the CSL could mean that it may at the same time violate Western laws or regulations against cooperating with Chinese security and intelligence services. Moriuchi said that the more worrying issue is Chinas willingness to cloud or distort information to serve its ends. After all, vulnerabilities published on the US NVD or Chinas CNNVD have already been publicly disclosed. That means they are unlike so-called vulnerability equities: undisclosed software vulnerabilities that state intelligence agencies discover (or purchase) and may keep secret for use in offensive cyber operations."
287,vulnerability,u_webimprints09,Hackers steal data from Air-Gapped PCs with microphones &amp; speakers,1,84r188,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/84r188/hackers_steal_data_from_airgapped_pcs_with/,2018-03-16 10:27:35,"A research team from Israels Ben-Gurion University of the Negev s cyber security research center has discovered a new way of data extraction from air-gapped computers via using passive devices like earphones, headphones, and speakers. Now, the same research center has claimed to be able to use computer speakers and headphones to act as microphones and receive data. The devices can be used to send back the signals and make the otherwise safe practice of air-gapping less secure. As per the new technique by [information security training](URL professionals, data is extracted in the form of inaudible ultrasonic sound waves and transmission occurs between two computers installed in the same room while data is shared without using microphones. The research team created a custom protocol to carry out data transmission between two computers. One of them would be air-gapped while the other is connected to the internet and used to further relay the data. Through the attack, researchers claim to carry out speaker-to-headphone, headphone-to-headphone, and speaker-to-speaker data exfiltration. Findings of this research were published by ArXiv on Friday in an academic paper titled MOSQUITO: Covert Ultrasonic Transmissions between Two Air-Gapped Computers using Speaker-to-Speaker Communication. [information security training](URL analysts explained that their research shows how speakers can secretly be used to carry out data transmission between unconnected computers located within a distance of 9 meters. The reason why they used speakers is that these can be considered microphones working in reverse order; speakers convert electronic signals into acoustic signals whereas microphones convert acoustic signals into electric. The conversion is assisted by a diaphragm in each of these devices, which can be used to reverse the process. This process of reversing the mechanism of a device like a speaker is called jack retasking. A majority of new audio chipsets can be used for jack retasking because these offer an option of altering the audio port function through software. Malware can be used to reconfigure a speaker or headphone so that it acts like a microphone given that the device is unpowered and passive. The paper reads: The fact that loudspeakers, headphones and earphones are physically built like microphones, coupled with the fact that an audio ports role in the PC can be altered programmatically, changing it from output to input, creates a vulnerability which can be abused by attackers. In the MOSQUITO attack, the [information security training](URL researchers used infected an air-gapped computer and could also be used to modulate or transform locally stored documents into audio signals. These signals could easily be relayed to another computer using headphones, earbuds or speakers. The receiving computer would also be infected with malware and will convert connected speakers or headphones using jack retasking technique to make them serve as a microphone. The catch is that most of the PCs now have passive speakers while these have active, powered headphones, earbuds, and speakers. Researchers could achieve data transmission successfully at the rate of 166 bit/sec using frequencies ranging between 18 to 24 kHz. There was just 1% error rate when data was transmitted to a 1kb binary file within the distance of 3meters. If the distance is increased to up to 9 meters, a 10 bit/sec transmission rate was achieved with the same error rate. Authors also provided various mitigation techniques but admitted that all had their limitations. These techniques included designing speakers and headphones equipped with onboard amplifiers to prevent their use as a microphone. Alternately, an ultrasonic jammer can be used and ultrasonic transmissions can be scanned. The software can be developed for preventing jack retasking and using UEFI/BIOS to fully disable audio hardware. Although there is another more practical solution for disconnecting the headphones or speakers it is not a very feasible method. While information security training analysts believes that monitoring ultrasonic band is a much more practical and reliable solution but when applied, it is bound to raise false alarms."

It seems that hackers stole hundreds of reports using security vulnerability in an online tool used by the police. According to [information security training](URL researchers, Gwent Police used an online tool allowing the public to file reports against crimes or other incidents to them but little did they know a critical security flaw existed in the tool that led hackers to steal confidential reports filed by 450 people in the last two years. Authorities removed the online tool from the server after identifying the breach, but they did not inform the victims, according to report. The UKs Information Commissioners Office (ICO) has taken strict notice and currently investigating the incident. As per investigation, the information security training analysts also found out that the online tool used by the public to file reports was developed by forces digital development team and considered to be unique to the force. On the other hand, Gwent Police spokesperson did not confirm if the breach took place. There has been no other form of communication (complaints or any malicious activity on our security system). It was concluded that there was a high probability no data had been accessed and no risk to any individuals, said the spokesperson. In an email conversation, Jan van Vliet, VP and GM, EMEA at Digital Guardian said that: Public and private organizations alike have a duty of care, not to mention legal obligation, to protect data. By failing to discover the security vulnerabilities of their online tool and appearing to disregard security best practices, Gwent Police has acted negligently. If GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation) was already in enforcement, the potential repercussions for Gwent Police could be far greater as it appears that it was in violation of two requirements of the regulation. First, under the GPDR, companies are required to use appropriate measures to protect all personal data. Second, companies are obliged to report suspected incidents to the authorities within 72 hours, which Gwent doesnt do. The incident also reminds us of the dangers of not notifying the affected parties. Gwent Police has failed to notify victims of the potential breach, putting those affected at further risk. If personal details got into the wrong hands, hackers could have targeted victims through phishing and social engineering attacks in this case the victims would have had no reason to believe anything was suspicious, information security professional told. The [information security training](URL community has been working on tools to overcome the habit in which companies do not inform victims about data breaches. In December, University of California San Diego (UCSD) developed Tripwire Tool, a prototype tool that would identify if websites have been compromised and suffered data breaches. In the same way, Mozilla announced its joining hands with HaveIBeenPwned.com (HIBP), a popular data breach notification website to send an in-browser alert to Firefox browser users whether the website they are visiting was previously hacked and if their login credentials have been involved in a data breach."

Just as hackers take advantage of vulnerabilities, they also take advantage of the fear, and for that reason they have created a lot of fake web pages that offer updates for Flash Player but that, in reality, are used for other purposes, such as advertising and even mine cryptocurrencies using the users CPU. As we can read on the net, information security experts from international institute of cyber security have detected a considerable number of web pages that deceive the user to download a Flash update that, in reality, is used for other purposes. When we enter the page in question, it will automatically downloads a file, java-player.exe, that supposedly tries to pass itself off as a Flash update but, actually, when we execute it, it loads a process in our memory of the device that uses 100% of our CPU to mine cryptocurrencies. To ensure some persistence, this malware creates a scheduled task in the system so that the cryptocurrency mining software will automatically run every time we restart our computer, said a specialist in information security. While the installer that we have linked before (link to VirusTotal) is not detected by much antivirus software since it started operating relatively recently, the mining process that is loaded in the system is, so any antivirus updated will be able to detect it and eliminate it to stop using our hardware to generate revenue for hackers. In addition, applications such as Malwarebytes Anti-Malware will help us keep our device equally clean. How should I update Adobe Flash Player safely? To avoid falling into this type of scams information security experts from WebImprints said, it is best to ensure that we update our Adobe Flash Player always from your main website. On this website we will always find the latest version available (currently 28.0.0.161) so that, if we still have this plug-in installed on the computer for some reason, at least we can be protected from some of the countless security flaws it hides this software. Also, if we are users of Windows 10, it is advisable to download security updates from Windows Update, since these updates hide Flash Player patches, and Google Chrome users should check that their web browser is updated correctly that the Google Flash plug-in does not hide any vulnerability either. Finally, we must be wary of websites that indicate that Flash, or some other add-on, are outdated and offer us the possibility to download an update from those links. As per investigation by various information security companies, this type of sites always hide scams with which hackers can monitor all our activity, steal personal or banking data or display advertising to use our hardware to mine cryptocurrencies."

OS, the Google operating system for the desktop. For his part, Alex Birsan discovered that anyone could have access to the internal data of Google Issue Tracker, something for which he was rewarding with $15,600. Through its Vulnerability Research Scholarship Program, the giant gave $125,000 to 50 researchers in information security from around the world, while giving another $ 50,000 to improve the security of Open Source software as part of its Patch Rewards Program. Discovering security problems that affect Android has become a priority for Google for years, so it rewarded with between 1,000 and 5,000 dollars to those who discovered remote code executions in applications hosted in the Play Store. Although the total amount paid in 2017 may seem high, the reality is that it is slightly lower than last year, when Google paid in total 3 million dollars. On the other hand, the company has announced for this year a new category with rewards of $ 1,000 for researchers in information security that covers vulnerabilities that could end up in the theft of private data of the user, information transmitted without encryption or failures that result in access to protected components of the applications.

The most recent Microsoft weekly update package focused on two relevant vulnerabilities, mentioned [**network security**](URL and ethical hacking experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security. First, a fix was released for a flaw that, used in conjunction with a [**Google Chrome**](URL exploit, could allow hackers to take control of a Windows system prior to version 10. Second, a vulnerability that has apparently been exploited by at least two malicious hacker groups has been patched. The vulnerability is exploitable in Windows operating system versions between 8 and 10 and, according to network security experts, abuses the Windows graphical subsystem to perform a local privilege escalation. If the attack is successful, hackers could take full control of the victims machine. Last month we detected an attempt to exploit a new vulnerability in Microsoft Windows; subsequent analyses led to the discovery of a zero-day exploit in win32k.sys, network security experts who reported the vulnerability mentioned. The vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2019-0797**, is a condition present in the win32k driver that exists due to inadequate synchronization between NtDCompositionDiscardFrame and NtDCompositionDestroyConnection, the experts added. As for their exploitation, the specialists believe that the vulnerability has been exploited mainly by two groups of malicious hackers, FruityArmor and SandCat. FruityArmor has been active for about three years, exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities against some government organizations. On the other hand, SandCat is a group recently identified by some cybersecurity firms and agencies. [**Microsoft**](URL announced the release of an update patch after receiving the vulnerability report. The company took advantage of the patchs announcement to recommend to its users to install the updates as soon as possible; they also recommend users to follow up on the scheduled updates. Updates that companies like Microsoft launch regularly are one of the most elementary protection measures against exploiting vulnerabilities, the specialists mention. Users must also remain alert to any new report on zero-day vulnerabilities. Windows operating system users, whether individuals or business customers, should be sure to implement the appropriate security measures for their systems such as unique passwords and multi factor authentication."

According to [**network security**](URL and ethical hacking specialists of the International Institute of Cyber Security, resulting from the attack access to the records of the hospital were blocked, so the organization had to pay a ransom to recover their access. According to the hospital director, the records were encrypted last Christmas and no staff members were able to access them. The compromised records contained information such as: * Full names * Dates of birth * Addresses * Social Security numbers * Patient Medical Details The institution confirmed that, for the most part, patients are children and adolescents from low-income families. As network security experts report, hospital managers had to pay a ransom of thousands of dollars to get back access to the records. So far, we dont have any evidence to show that more confidential information has been compromised, said Jill Rogers, hospital director. Rogers added that the compromised information contained about ten years of organization Records. Hospital officials did not specify what the ransom amount was, nor did they provide technical details about the attack. As to why they waited so far to reveal the incident, they mentioned that they decided to reveal the attack until they had the certainty of what exactly happened and what consequences were generated. Delaware Law states that any organization that works with personal information from state residents must report an incident like this within the first 60 days after the attack was detected, according to network security specialists. The hospital has offered a year of free financial monitoring services to users affected by the incident. We deeply regret what happened and reaffirm our commitment to protecting the privacy of your information, mentions a statement from the organization. Multiple cybersecurity firms agree that ransomware attacks continue to become more and more frequent. In most cases, an attack starts when an employee clicks on a malicious link and is redirected to a committed web site.

This malicious software was first detected in February and the number of hackers who have bought or used it is still unknown. We recently discovered a new malware variant against points of sale available in criminal forums, the research experts mentioned. Also, we found the payloads associated with the malware, its infrastructure and its control panel. According to researchers, this malware has a functional design and is very easy to use; No advanced hacking skills are required to run GlitchPOS, added the ethical hacker. The attackers have been deploying the malware through a malicious email, by disguising it as a very simple videogame. The malware is protected by a packer developed in VisualBasic, which decrypts a library (the payload of malware) encrypted with the UPX packer. When the payload is decrypted, GlitchPOS is executed, which captures the point of sale system memory. As for the payload, this is really very small and has few functions, such as registering infected systems, receiving tasks from C2, and extracting the payment card data. The experts believe that, before GlitchPOS, the developers had already designed more malicious code, since they consider that Edbitss, author of the malware, had already participated in the development of the DiamondFox L!NK botnet, which gives criminals the resources they need to carry out a wide variety of attacks, such as DDoS attacks or credential theft. The researchers found several similarities between this botnet and GlitchPOS, so they believe that both were developed by the same hacker. Attacks with GlitchPOS have become very popular over the past month. Companies like Forever 21 have revealed that they have been victims of this malware, which would have compromised customers from multiple retail stores. A point-of-sale solutions developer announced that GlitchPOS has committed these systems mainly to restaurants and clothing stores."

The situation is that the company has decided to patch each compromised router, one by one, instead of implementing a general fix for all affected devices. This situation becomes even more complicated because there are already reports of threat actors exploiting this vulnerability. The hijacking of domestic routers to integrate them into the botnet Mirai is a clear example of this exploitation campaign. Even four years before Huawei received the report of this vulnerability, a cybersecurity firm discovered the same flaw present in another router model, thanks to an independent investigation. The company publicly acknowledged the vulnerability until November 2017, suggesting that users might take temporary mitigation measures or replace previous model routers with updated versions. A few months ago, a researcher discovered that Huaweis vulnerable routers were being used to house a botnet composed of more than 18000 devices committed to a malware variant of the Mirai botnet. According to the expert, this botnet would not have existed if Huawei had launched a firmware correction for all its devices."

After the incident was known, Verifications.io website was shutdown and no representative of the company issued a single statement. There is not much information about this company; in addition, it is believed that its operators work in anonymity due to the dubious tactics they employ. Bob Diachenko, specialist in finding exposed databases, was the one who reported to the administrators of the site of Verificatios.io on the massive exposure of data; hours later, the companys website was offline. It is still unknown if any malicious user managed to access the exposed database, although this possibility should not be ruled out, considers the expert. Diachenko added that the passwords and payment card details were not exposed, although it is possible to find some financial details of the exposed users, such as annual revenues, workplaces, types of cards, etc. Diachenko concluded by saying, maybe this is the biggest database Ive ever reported. Usually, marketing companies work with verification services like the one offered by Verifications.io to send massive emails to huge email lists that require validation, that is to say, whether they are active or even real. These types of security incidents are especially dangerous for victims, as they expose them to an increased risk of [**spam**](URL campaigns, unwanted calls, or even identity fraud."

The cybersecurity specialist known as Larry Cashdollar discovered that a hacker, or group of hackers, is conducting a new phishing attack that takes advantage of Google Transalate. This malicious campaign targets Facebook and Google accounts and, according to the expert, is much harder to detect when using the mobile version of a browser. Attackers send phishing emails to potential victims, presenting them as security alerts generated by Google to report access to user accounts from an unknown Windows device; after posing the scenario to the victims the email shows a button with the phrase Consulting activity. When this button is clicked, the victim is redirected to a Google Translate session that opens the phishing page, shown as a Google login page. The [**network security**](URL expert stressed that users of the desktop version of the browser could detect this attack at first glance, as the translators bar is visible on the home screen. However, this is very difficult to detect in mobile browsers. The use of Google Translate has a variety of purposes, but the main one is that the URL contains a legitimate Google domain, mentions the network security specialist. Although this tactic might be successful in some cases, especially on mobile devices, it is virtually impossible for a desktop user not to see the Translators toolbar on the home page, added Larry Cashdollar. In successful cases, once the victim enters their Google credentials on the phishing page, they will be sent to the attacker by email, thanks to a malicious script. If the attacker receives the users Google accesses, they will perform a second attack trying to get the Facebook access credentials. The expert mentions that the design of the phishing page for Facebook is very poor and is not properly optimized for mobile devices, so it was very easy to detect the attempted fraud. Some attackers pay more attention to details than others; in this case, the scam was easily detected when checking the page; Still, this does not mean that phishing is not a risk faced by every day individuals and organizations of all kinds, concluded Cashdollar. Experts recommend paying attention to details before getting carried away by messages like this. Reviewing the sender, the URL and the structure of the messages received are simple but helpful measures to mitigate this kind of risk."

The consequences that this incident caused are still unknown, but the affected clients report that the most visible effect at first sight is the aggregation of about 700 entries to the ***/etc/hosts*** file that redirects a request package to the IP address 0.0.0.0. A QNAP client, identified in the companys forum as ianch99, stated that this incident prevented their [**antivirus software**](URL from updating automatically, as all requests for updating to the vendors site were hidden. Some other users say that MalwareRemover, a tool included in all QNAP devices, has multiple flaws, although specialists in network security have not been able to confirm whether there is any relationship between these two security issues. Updates can be installed if additional entries are removed, but they will be re-activated after the system is rebooted, reports user ianch99. A Reddit user subsequently published a script, allegedly developed by QNAP itself, to correct this error; apparently this is the only known solution for this incident so far. Multiple clients of the company externalized their concern about the companys lack of communication about this incident; Many of QNAP users might be able to do something to correct the problem if the company shared more information, a user posted in the companys public chat. Outstanding members of the cybersecurity community have asked QNAP for an official statement, but the company has not yet responded to these requests. According to specialists in network security, a couple of years ago a critical failure was discovered in the firmware of the Taiwan established company, which caused severe damage to the data of the RAID units due to wrong performed calculations. Weeks later this glitch was corrected with a software update. The ***/etc/hosts*** file causes domain searches made from the host machine to go to specific IP addresses; the regular use that customers give it on a regular basis is to force the blocking of unwanted sites. Although this is very easy to use, this same simplicity makes it an interesting target for malicious program developers, who try to disable anti-malware solution updates to have a greater rate of success in their attacks.

The researchers found this malware in the MetaMask app, a plugin that allows Ethereum users to perform transactions through conventional websites. This plugin is available for Firefox and Chrome, but the company does not have mobile applications for any operating system, which means that the attackers created a fake app from the company to achieve their goals. The fake MetaMask app has already been removed from Play Store, although experts in network security do not rule out the possibility that variants of this malicious software are present in other applications available in the Google app store. When analyzing the cryptocurrency addresses associated with this malware, it was discovered that the attackers have extracted 0.12868189 Bitcoin ($460 USD) and 0.00909752827411204 Ethereum (just equivalent to $1. 05 USD).

SHAREit has more than one billion users worldwide and is used to share files from Android, iOS, Windows and Mac systems. Through this platform, users can share videos, music and other files on different devices. The SHAREit version for Android operating system, which has about 500 million of users, suffers two vulnerabilities: one is an authentication omission flaw and the other one is an arbitrary file downloading vulnerability. The vulnerabilities had been discovered in December 2017 and corrected in March 2018, although technical details about the errors were revealed just a few days ago. Network security specialists mention that the details were kept hidden due to the vulnerabilitys impact, ease of execution, and wide range of attack. Network security experts found that if a user without a valid session searches for a non-existent page, instead of displaying the [**error 404**](URL page, SHAREit replies with an empty page and adds the user to the recognized devices, authenticating the unauthorized user. Vulnerabilities can be exploited in a shared WiFi network to intercept the traffic of a device, among other malicious tasks; the attacker can even gain unrestricted access to the storage of the compromised device. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker should simply send a ***curl*** command that references the path of the target file; the specialists emphasize that you should know the exact location of the file you are pointing to. The experts developed a proof of concept (nicknamed DUMPit!) with which they managed to download about 3000 different files (about 2 GB of information) in less than 8 minutes. SHAREit received the vulnerability report in January 2018, although it did not respond to the experts until a month later, when the time limit was about to finish so that the details of the vulnerability would be revealed to the public.

A cybersecurity firm discovered these PDF documents, stating that they establish contact with a remote domain that stores the extracted information, such as the victims IP address, operating system version, browser version and PDF path stored on the computer. Network security specialists claim that the attack is only presented in [**Chrome**](URL as they tried to open these PDF documents in tools such as [**Adobe Reader**](URL and the connection between the remote domain and the file was not presented. According to experts, there are two different sets of PDF exploiting this vulnerability; it is believed that these files started circulating since October 2017. During the investigation it was discovered that the first group of malicious PDF files has sent data from the user to a domain registered as readnotify.com, whereas, according to the investigators, the second group of files sent the information to the address Zuxjk0dftoamimorjl9dfhr44vap3fr7ovgi76w.burpcollaborator.net. Although network security experts did not find additional malicious code in these files, they note that this information gathering campaign might be useful in detailing the profiles of potential victims of future cyberattacks. However, security expert Patrick Warder mentions that these documents were not designed as malicious content, even though they exploit vulnerability in Chrome. The expert claims that these files were assembled using a service called PDF tracking, which allows to track the activity related to a PDF, in addition, this feature exists since 2010. So far this is all that is known about these PDF files. It is not known whether they were designed by a group of hackers, whether they are part of a series of tests, or whether they were intended for a legitimate purpose.

The vulnerability CVE-2019-1663 gained notoriety after being publicly disclosed during the last week of February, receiving a score of 9.8/10 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scale. According to network security experts, the vulnerability was scored so high because of its ease of exploitation and that no advanced coding skills are required. In addition the flaw bypasses the entire authentication process and a router can be attacked remotely. Among the affected router models are Cisco RV110, RV130 and RV215, mainly used in households and small businesses. Thats why users of these devices are unfamiliar with any updating policies so its normal for hackers to find vulnerable computers even after Cisco corrected the bug. According to experts in network security, theres about 12k of these devices functioning, and it is possible to find them with tools like Shodan very easily. Some members of the cybersecurity community claim that this vulnerability was caused by a neglect of Cisco encoders, which used a function considered insecure (known as string copy). The experts explained that the use of this function caused the authentication mechanism of the routers to be exposed to a buffer overflow, because of this the attackers injected commands that they executed with administrator privileges during the authentication process. Manufacturers recommend that the users of these devices apply the updates as soon as possible. If a user believes that his router could have been compromised, it is advisable to update the firmware, the experts mention."

Kostas Drakonakis, Panagiotis Ilia and Jason Polakis, a group of Greek researchers on [**cybersecurity**](URL issues, recently published a document entitled Privacy risks in public location metadata. In this, researchers claim to have shown that location metadata allows inferring sensitive information, which could be used for malicious purposes. Some authoritarian regimes could pursue campaigns of persecution against activists or opponents, claimed the investigators. In 2015, the risks to the privacy of users associated with Twitter location metadata began to be investigated; since then, the social network has given its users greater control over their location data, such as the restriction of access to the precise coordinates. Currently, Twitter is no longer able to access the exact location of the user by default. Twitter never attaches the users location without their consent. If someone decides to share their location through a tweet, the location is also available through our APIs, but the users express consent must be granted. However, experts in cybersecurity believe that the implementation of these changes has not sufficiently reduced the privacy risks, as Twitter still has a history of location data through its developer API. For example, mobile Twitter versions released before April 2015 contain the precise GPS coordinates attached to the tweets by default. In the sample we analyzed we discovered that tweets with very general location tags (like city name, for example) also contain GPS coordinates as metadata, Polakis mentioned. As of April 2015, tweets with this kind of location tag stopped displaying coordinates as metadata, suggesting that this is the date on which the social network began with the implementation of these changes, the expert added. Researchers suggest that the Twitter policy that allowed attaching these location metadata represents a serious privacy problem that should be addressed as soon as possible. This is an imperceptible privacy violation for users of the social network, as their coordinates are contained as metadata returned by the API invisible on the website or Twitter mobile app. The worst thing is that these metadata are still visible through the API, the experts mentioned. The treatment of this kind of information is one of the greatest challenges that companies face in the midst of technological age; they are so useful in the orientation of marketing campaigns that companies have not tried to stop this kind of practices, although this could cause inconvenience in the future. For example, in recent days, the Los Angeles prosecutor filed a lawsuit against the IBM meteorological company for allegedly treating the data collected through the Weather Channel application inappropriately.

According to reports, this attack was presented thanks to a problem known to the developers of blockchain since the emergence of these virtual assets. The cryptocurrencies are only safe while users are honest in maintaining the blockchain that registers the transactions. Coinbase [**cybersecurity**](URL expert Mark Nesbitt mentioned that this attack (known as the 51% attack) was presented because the attackers took control over the half the processing power of the computers that store the blockchain of Ethereum Classic. This allowed the attackers to create alternative transactions of some currencies, in other words, to spend twice the same coin. Through Twitter, Ethereum mentioned that they had detected a problem, but did not contemplate that it was a 51% attack nor had evidence to indicate that some currency had been spent twice by the same user. Coinbase allegedly detected an attack, but did not contact the Ethereum Classic team, they mentioned. According to reports of experts on cybersecurity, the currencies that allegedly would have been spent twice were worth about $460k USD. Coinbase believe that the potential to deploy this type of attack is inherent to any cryptocurrency blockchain, so they rule out that Ethereum Classic or any other virtual asset is especially vulnerable to a 51% attack.

To achieve this, the new office will depend on coordinated work by the entire government, based on the activities of the Executive Office of the U.S. presidency, with a director appointed by the President himself. Although [**China**](URL is not explicitly mentioned in the bill, the main purpose of this office will be to halt the Chinese governments medium-and long-term plans to consolidate itself as a technological powerhouse, relegating the United States to a secondary role with the help of cyberattack campaigns. China continues to conduct coordinated attacks on U.S. intellectual property, its trade organizations and computer networks with full backing from the Chinese Communist Party, said Senator Rubio recently. A coordinated approach is needed to counteract this kind of critical threat and to ensure the protection of technologies developed in the United States. We must do everything we can to avoid the theft of critical developments, as well as avoid the interference in our IT infrastructure, Rubio added. For his part, Warner added: The Chinese government will not hesitate to use all its cyber weapons to overcome the technology developed in the U.S. and establish itself as a higher economic power. We look forward to working with the executive branch to coordinate action protocols and response to these threats. For some [**cybersecurity**](URL experts, mitigating these risks will not be an easy task, as two major problems have been identified. First, the growth and sophistication of Chinese government-sponsored hacker groups, who in recent years have deployed attack campaigns with ever-increasing scope and damage capacity. Second, there is the apparent pressure from the Chinese government that foreign companies operating in China deliver their technology to a Chinese partner. However, according to experts in cybersecurity, this is not obligatory and is carried out less frequently than in the past (the Tesla plant in China, for example, is 100% owned by Tesla) Donald Trumps administration has resorted to this to justify the trade war between the two countries.

The list of vulnerabilities features: * Incorrect validation of the SCP client directory name (CVE-2018-20685) * The SCP client did not receive the validation of the name of the received object (CVE-2019-6111) * Counterfeit client SCP through object name (CVE-2019-6109) * SCP Client spoofing using stderr (CVE-2019-6110) Because vulnerabilities affect the implementation of the SCP protocol, all SCP client applications, including OpenSSH, Putty, and WinSCP, uses SCP as the standard for transferring files. WinSCP solved the problems with the release of version 5.14 last October, and the patch is also included in the current version 5.14.4. The vulnerability CVE-2018-20685 was corrected in the implementation of the SCP protocol last November, although the correction has not been officially published by the providers. The other three vulnerabilities remain unpatched. However, if you are concerned about a malicious SCP server had compromised your system, you can configure it to use SFTP (secure FTP) if possible. Alternatively, the network security expert also provided a solution to reinforce SCP against most server-side manipulation attempts, which you can apply directly, although it may cause some problems. Possibly affected users are encouraged to stay on the lookout for the release of security patches as well as apply them to their systems as soon as they are available. "

According to reports, malicious users could have stolen login tokens; the attackers only needed the victims to click on a specially crafted link. A cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, in conjunction with an invalidated subdomain, enabled cybersecurity experts to evade the protection measures implemented by the login control system used to access Fortnite. Single Sign-On (SSO) systems may be useful, but only while the platform accessed is not vulnerable, as considered by [**network security**](URL When properly implemented, user authentication passes into the hands of a third party developer, which authorizes access to the platform via a one-use token. Researchers from a network security firm managed to exploit the vulnerability to request the single token on a second occasion and then redirect it to a compromised site, from where it could be stolen. The researchers concluded that Epic Games used an invalidated domain for their login page (accounts.epicgames.com), which could be redirected to another site. After redirecting the token to the vulnerable site, experts were able to steal it with a JavaScript code injection. For the attack to succeed, the victim is required to click on a specially crafted phishing link. When the victim accesses Fortnite, the login page is redirected to the attackers website, where the token will be stolen. This attack may not be the most elaborated one, but attackers require certain technical expertise beyond those required to deploy phishing campaigns or brute force attacks. As an attack of average complexity, the investigators do not rule out that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild, although this is hardly verifiable. On the other hand, Epic Games issued a statement mentioning that the vulnerability was corrected in early December 2018, but omitted to mention whether there are any evidence that the bug has been exploited at some point. Fortnite has become incredibly popular, with almost 80 million players a month, plus about 200 million players registered on the platform."

The man was reported missing in Costa Rica since last September 2018. According to reports recovered by [**network security**](URL specialists, a dozen people have been arrested in connection with this crime; the arrests were carried out by the police agencies of Spain and Costa Rica. Creighton Kopkos family had to pay the aforementioned ransom through a Bitcoin transaction valued at $950k USD, however, once the transaction was completed, the kidnappers stopped communicating with the victims family. To date, the businessmans whereabouts remain unknown. According to the investigations, the kidnappers would have fled from Costa Rica to Cuba and subsequently flew to Spain in November 2018. Once they arrived in Spanish territory, the kidnappers would have rented an apartment in Zaragoza, where they would be eventually arrested. Multiple criminal groups have shown special interest in the world of cryptocurrency, so the accumulation of Bitcoin has become a serious matter, as mentioned by the specialists in network security. According to reports from the authorities, this same criminal group impersonated a team of students interested in learning about virtual currencies to contact Bitcoin users, blackmailing and/or cheating them to get access passwords to their online cryptocurrency wallets. In recent times, there have been cases where, in exchange for releasing a family hostage, criminal groups ask victims to pay through this kind of virtual assets, hoping to maintain their anonymity to keep the authorities away and, of course, keep committing crimes. Cybersecurity experts from the International Cyber Security Institute fear that such crimes will become a widely practiced trend in the future. "

It has useful functions like folder sharing, besides it is available for tablets and smartphones, although not everything is good news. Network security and ethical hacking analysts from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that this application runs a hidden server that could leave a device exposed to cyberattacks or data theft. Nearly 300 million of Android users have downloaded ES File Explorer, which makes it one of the most popular apps in Play Store. Because of this, the vulnerability could affect an incredibly high number of people. According to an investigation by experts in [**network security**](URL the ES File Explorer is running a hidden server, which could grant access to any other user connected to the same network at the moment the application starts and connects. Thus, another user connected to the same network would have access to the files stored in our devices without us noticing the intrusion. Baptiste Robert, who is in charge of the investigation, claims that this vulnerability exposes any kind of files. The attacker could access images, videos, applications and even access the memory card, mentions the network security expert. Experts highlight that the chances of successfully executing this attack are minimal, as its execution depends on the attacker and the victim being connected to the same network (to the same WiFi connection, basically), in addition to medium skill hacking knowledge. However, researchers do not dismiss any malicious user from developing an application capable of exploiting this vulnerability. However, it must be taken seriously the fact that ES File Explorer, the most popular file manager of Android, contains a vulnerability that allows the access and theft of the data and files stored in a smartphone. Although, as mentioned, it is a very complex attack that requires the conjunction of multiple variables and ability on the attackers side. Prior to publishing their research, the experts notified the application developers of the vulnerability, but they have not received any response. Android is the most used operating system in smart devices, which makes it one of the most attacked targets by malicious users. As a precaution, experts in cybersecurity recommend users to only install applications that are in the official store, as well as the option to resort to specific security tools for Android devices, such as antivirus or password management software."

Laura Lyons, a housewife, was cooking when she heard a noise similar to an emergency alert, followed by a voice announcing an attack with North Korean ballistic missiles heading directly to Chicago, Ohio and Los Angeles. The voice warned that the U.S. would retaliate against North Korea, also mentioned that the inhabitants of the affected areas had three hours to evacuate, said Lyons. It sounded so real, it was very noisy and caught our attention immediately, and those were distressing moments. Lyons and her husband remained in their home, terrified but also confused, as nothing related to the alleged attack was mentioned on their television. Moments later, they realized that their Nest [**surveillance camera**](URL had been responsible for transmitting the alarming news through one of the family TVs. After the moment of panic (the woman even called at 911), the family theorized that the incident could be the responsibility of a hacker. According to reports of network security specialists, Nest was aware of some similar incidents, but the company decided not to notify its customers. A couple of days later, a company supervisor showed up at Lyons house, mentioning that what happened was probably a third-party hack, which would have been able to access the familys Nest camera. Hours after the incident, Lyons shared her experience in a Facebook group, where other Nest users shared some similar incidents. Company spokespersons claim that this is an isolated incident, adding that there is no evidence to think of a company data breach; it is worth noting that Nest is owned by Google. Incidents of this nature may be due to customers using passwords which were compromised in more than one online service. Measures such as the implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) almost completely dismiss this kind of security risk, the spokespersons of the company mentioned. Network security specialists say this is a problem that has increased in recent times. Last December, for example, a family in Houston received a death scare when a hacker infiltrated the signal from their baby monitor and began threatening to kidnap the child. In another incident in Arizona, a hacker used a Nest camera to warn his owner that his security was flimsy, and even offered him some safety tips. Walt Nadkarni, a cybersecurity expert at College of William &amp; Mary, recently conducted an investigation into security flaws in this type of devices. Our studies of the Nest platform show that it is generally safe, at least in comparison with other similar options on the market. Nadkarni also opined about the risks of recycle passwords: Just one of the services we use must be compromised so hackers can access the rest of our online accounts, so the use of password managing software or multi factor authentication are highly recommended, the expert concluded.

All that the attacker requires to exploit these vulnerabilities is to deceive an iPhone X user to open a specially designed web page from the Safari browser of their device. Still, not every iOS hacker has the knowledge and skills needed to find and exploit these vulnerabilities. Discovered by the [**network security**](URL investigator Qixun Zhao of the Chinese firm Qihoo 360, this exploit takes advantage of two security vulnerabilities revealed last year in an ethical hacking event. Subsequently, the vulnerabilities were reported to the Apple security teams. On the other hand, Zhao revealed some details of the jailbreak, in addition to a proof of concept which the expert has dubbed Chaos, after Apple launched the iOS 12.1.3 update, where the vulnerabilities reported were supposed to be corrected.

Moodys, the investment rating agency, recently announced the inclusion of cybersecurity risks for its credit ratings process, through which the risks of massive data breach any organization could face will be measured. This measure could not come at a better time, and there is an expectation of the role the rating agency can play. In this new mission it will be critical for Moodys to create a system that collects complete and reliable data, including information taken from the companies themselves, as well as from external sources. According to experts in [**network security**](URL there are two ways to get this information. First, the qualifier can rely on data from external providers to undertake cybersecurity assessments. As a second method of information gathering, there is the data protected by the companies themselves, obtained through internal tools and monitoring. External data will be more valuable to some companies than to others. A large chain of retailers, for example, with an important market presence, will be more likely to encompass a larger area of cyberthreats. In an ideal world, Moodys could require companies to have any internal information they need as part of their scope of work. Although in practice, there is no guarantee that a company will provide a complete picture of its operations. A company could deny Moodys access to certain information because of its own security policies. However, Moodys must solve these constraints with creativity. External data provides coverage for a crucial segment of a companys network and serves to verify the possibility that it is not providing clear and complete information to the qualifier. On the other hand, internal information is the main source of detailed information about a company. The next challenge for Moodys will be to develop these data sources, since they will originate from multiple sources working with different concepts and formats that are not necessarily consistent with each other, so the unification of criteria to analyze the cyber risks in organizations of different branches will be critical to Moodys, consider network security experts. Finally, the quality of the information that Moodys can collect will have a direct impact on the quality of their ratings. If Moodys can build a platform that integrates data from internal and external vendors, it can create a reliable rating much faster and more reliably. For many experts in fields such as finance or cybersecurity, Moodys decision could not come at a better time. We have reached the point where we are no longer surprised by incidents of massive data breaches, so it is necessary for organizations to consider the consequences that an incident of this magnitude can generate."

Although it has not even been a month since it was identified, Anatova ransomware has already infected hundreds of computers around the world, report [**network security**](URL specialists. According to the research, the countries with the most Anatova infections so far are the United States, Germany, France and Belgium. The malware expert Alexandre Mundo claims that Anatova is hidden using the icon of a game or application for the victim to download the malicious software. If downloaded, installed and executed, Anatova is capable of encrypting the files in the compromised machine; in addition to that it can encrypt files in shared networks, an especially dangerous scenario for larger organizations. According to specialists in network security, the Anatova ransomware uses the algorithm Salsa20 for encryption, leaving aside files of less than 1 MB to attack large companies in a smaller window of time. The ransom demanded by the criminals consists of 10 units of Dash cryptocurrency, whose value is currently around $700 USD each. In his report, Mundo mentions: According to what we know so far, the developers behind Anatova must be highly qualified hackers; each malware sample contains a unique key of its own, among other features that are not frequently found in other ransomware families. The researchers noticed that Anatova looks for a flag with a value capable of activating the loading of two additional DLLs. This might indicate that Anatova is ready to be modular, or it could be an indication that developers will integrate other functions into the code in the future, says Mundo. In addition, the ransomware bypasses the analysis through a series of defensive tactics. It can, for example, encrypt most of its strings, using multiple decryption keys embedded in the executable file. It even has a black list of usernames, where it looks for terms like tester, malware, or analyst; if Anatova finds similar terms in the username, it simply does not run. Finally, the ransomware is able to clean any record of the machines memory in order to avoid downloading information that could be useful to develop programs to eliminate the encryption. The researchers emphasize that Anatova was designed not to translate devices located in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, as well as some territories in Asia; sometimes this could provide the on the authors of malicious software, although it is not a rule that is fulfilled without exception."

The specialist estimates that nearly 5 million users could have been exposed during the latest malicious campaign, in which the attackers resorted to the use of steganography so that security systems could not detect their payloads. The more sophisticated the detection of malvertising becomes, the hackers also develop better methods to evade security systems and achieve the goals of their malicious campaigns, Stein mentions. Techniques such as steganography are useful for delivering payloads without relying on encoded chains or voluminous search tables.

On its website, Eskom Group is defined as an energy company established in Johannesburg, South Africa, and is responsible for supplying 95% of the electric energy employed in South African territory, in addition to 45% of the electricity consumed throughout the African continent. According to [**network security**](URL specialists reports, these two incidents have exposed Eskoms network credentials, customer details, payment card information, and business details that the company considers confidential. A security investigator known as .SS.! on Twitter discovered the companys information, concluding that it was stolen using Azorult, a trojan used for password theft. . SS.! has been dedicating a few years to the search for compromised business devices to notify companies about their security flaws. According to the investigator, everything indicates that the information was stolen from a users machine with access to the companys internal network. Among the stolen information are Eskom network login passwords, business email accounts, and screenshots of the compromised PC at the time of installation of Azorult, among other confidential data. Thanks to the screenshot found by the investigator, the company discovered that the Azorult Trojan was hidden as a download file of The Sims 4 videogame. According to specialists in network security, the download of pirated software has always been one of the main vectors of malware infection, although this trend has shown an alarming growth in recent times. Some sites to download this kind of software offer adware packages that supposedly install the desired material, however, when executed they also install unwanted software, such as Trojans, ransomware, adware or browser extensions. The situation worsened for Eskom after Devin Stokes, an expert in cybersecurity, found one of the companys unsecured databases, which remained online for weeks, maybe months. Some screenshots shared by the investigator show that this database hosted information from Eskom customers, payment details, energy consumption information, among other data. Through a statement, the company reported that the incident is already under investigation: The Eskom Groups IT team is conducting an internal research to determine if our confidential information has been compromised. We will reveal more details once our analyses are completed."

So far, the infection has already reached over 100k computers over the past four days due to a supply chain attack; the number of infected computers keeps growing along the hours. What keeps attracting the attention of the cybersecurity community is that, unlike other malware variants, this new ransomware does not demand a ransom payment in Bitcoin. Instead, hackers demand victims a payment for 110 yen (about $16 USD), figure that must be transferred through WeChat Pay, a function to perform transactions through the most widely used messaging service in China. **Password theft** So far, the evidence suggests that this malicious program has only affected users in China, unlike similar outbreaks, such as WannaCry or NotPetya. In addition, this malware seems to have an additional password theft feature, for credentials used in services such as Alipay, Taobao, Tmall, AliWangWang and QQ. Apparently the ransomware steals access credentials to these platforms and sends them to a remote server. According to reports of a China-based digital forensics firm, the operators of this campaign managed to deploy their attack by injecting malicious code into the EasyLanguage programming software, used by most of the app developers in China. This program modified for malicious purposes was intended to inject the code of the ransomware into each app and software product compiled through EasyLanguage, making the virus spread incredibly quickly. Over 100k users in China who installed any of the infected developments are now in a compromising situation. This ransomware strain has shown to be able to encrypt all files of the infected system, with the exception of files with **gif, exe and tmp** extensions. **Stolen digital signatures** To avoid antivirus solutions, hackers signed the malicious code with a seemingly reliable digital signature from Tencent Technologies, and they try not to encrypt files in specific directories, such as Tencent Games, League of Legends, tmp, rtl and program. According to experts in [**digital forensics**](URL once the ransomware encrypts the users files, a text file appears demanding the user to make the payment of 110 yen to the WeChat account linked to the malicious software. The attackers mention that the user only has a three-day deadline to make the payment and receive the keys to restore their files. If the ransom is not covered in the time marked by the attackers, the program starts an automatic process of deleting the encryption key from a remote server. According to the collected evidence, the ransom note mentions that the files have been encrypted using the DES encryption algorithm, but in fact, the data is encrypted using an XOR cipher, a much less secure one that stores a copy of the encryption key in the victims system in the following location: ***%user%\\AppData\\Roaming\\unname\_1989\\dataFile\\appCfg.cfg*** A tool to remove encryption is already in development thanks to this information. In addition, after receiving the reports of this attack campaign, WeChat suspended the account in which the attackers were receiving the ransom payment."

Researchers at Toyotas **InfoTechnology Center**, Takuya Yoshida and Tsuyoshi Toyama, are part of the team that developed **Portable Automotive Security Testbed** (PASTA), an open source test platform for researchers and digital forensics specialists testing cars in developing process. Upon arriving in London, the researchers made a demonstration of the tool, mentioning that [**Toyota**](URL plans to make known the software specifications through Github, as well as plan to launch it on sale once finished, starting in Japan. The most alluring fact about the development of this tool, in addition to its 8 kg of weight, is that most car manufacturers have ignored or dismissed previous investigations into cybersecurity in their products, even though this kind of jobs expose the gaps in some of the automated and networked functions in the vehicles. The fact that Toyota is developing this tool and wills to share its specifications through open source platforms such as Github could mean a major change in the automotive industry. There is a lag in the development of cybersecurity in the automotive industry, Toyama said on his arrival in the UK. Even so, car manufacturers, including Toyota, are preparing for the new generation cyberattacks, the expert said. According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, there is still a lot of work space in the field of car cybersecurity. This is the main reason why this tool was developed, to help researchers explore how the engine control units (ECU) of the automobile work, as well as the CAN protocol used to establish communication between the different elements of the vehicle, in addition to search and test exploits and vulnerabilities. The investigator specified that the tool is not designed to test in a moving car, as its objective is to provide a safe platform for researchers, something that would not be possible with a tool for moving vehicles. However, the tool developed by Toyota is capable of simulating the remote operation of the wheels, brakes, windows and other features of the car. It is small and portable so that users can study, investigate and hack anywhere, said Toyama. The PASTA platform contains four ECU inside, as well as LED panels that the investigator can control to run any test of the operation of the automobile system or attacks such as the injection of CAN messages. It includes ODBII and RS232C ports, as well as a port for debugging or binary hacking. The researchers integrated a management simulation program into the tool, as well as a car model to demonstrate some ways in which it can be used. PASTA can also be used for research and development purposes with real vehicles, which would allow car manufacturers to analyze how a function developed by some third party affects the operation and safety of the vehicle, for example."

According to experts, this law will allow Australian authorities to force companies such as Google, Facebook, etc., to provide access to encrypted communications from their users in cases where it is deemed necessary. According to the Australian government, approving this law implies providing law enforcement agencies with a fundamental tool for combating and preventing high-impact crime, such as terrorist attacks, narcotics trafficking, arms smuggling, or children sexual exploitation. This bill was supported by the main Representatives political forces in Australia, so it was sent to the upper house. Thus, the Anti encryption law could enter into force at the beginning of 2019. Although details of the actual scope of this law are still unknown, it is clear that it contains guidelines necessary for technology companies to provide assistance to the Australian Government at three different levels: * **Request for technical assistance**: technology companies are requested to provide voluntary assistance to law enforcement agencies. In other words, companies must eliminate electronic protection, provide technical information, install software, place information in a particular format, and facilitate access to devices or services * **Technical assistance notice**: instead of asking the company for assistance, this level of action implies that the company is flexible with the authorities in cases where they have the means to intervene a communication (when there is no encryption, for example) * **Notice of technical capabilities**: This notice, issued by the attorney General, will require companies to develop new capabilities to decrypt communications required by the Australian police In other words, these guidelines would force technology companies to modify their software and infrastructure to access encrypted communications via backdoor, reaching information that would be impossible to access in other ways. It should be noted that companies that do not adhere to this new regulatory framework could face severe economic sanctions. According to specialists in digital forensics, the document states that no company will be forced to implement a systemic weakness in its software or hardware, nor can they be forced to eliminate electronic protections, such as encryption. On the other hand, the legislation establishes measures aimed at facilitating legal access to information through two different ways: * Decrypting encrypted technologies * Access to communications and data in points where there is no encryption We encourage the Government to maintain its intention not to weaken encryption or to force suppliers to build weaknesses in their products the Bill stipulates. In this way, the Australian authorities intend to break into the encrypted communications of the users of these services without forcing the companies to disrupt the encryption of their developments, as well as exploiting the possibility of accessing unencrypted communications. It is obvious that to achieve these objectives companies like Apple, Samsung, Google or WhatsApp must collaborate with the Government, although the position of all major providers of this kind of services is not yet known. Australia integrates the [**Five Eyes**](URL alliance with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand, so that specialists in digital forensics and cybersecurity consider that, if approved in Australia, the Anti encryption law could find counterparts in the rest of the member countries of this alliance."

Apparently all the experts needed to perform the attack were a laptop and various devices worth about $1.5k USD. The AKA (**Authentication and Key Agreement**) protocol is intended to provide security between mobile phones and base stations, and had been exploited in the past using surveillance devices such as the [**Stingray**](URL used by some police agencies. In the research carried out by experts in digital forensics from countries such as Germany and Norway, the existence of a new attack vector against any of the variants of the AKA protocol, including the version for 5G networks, is confirmed. Moreover, experts say this is a much more invasive attack than its predecessors. This is a serious problem because we faced with a logical vulnerability in AKA, which means that the security problem is not limited to a single implementation of the protocol, so it is inconvenient for users of last generation networks and for mobile phones that use 3G deployment. AKA is a challenge-response protocol based on symmetric cryptography and a sequence number (SQN) to verify the freshness of the challenges, preventing repetition attacks, mentions the experts report. Thanks to the discovery of previous vulnerabilities in cellular networks, especially the susceptibility of the smartphones to the IMCI receptors (similar to the Stingray), **3rd Generation Partnership Project** (3GPP), organism in charge of the standards in mobile telephony, modified the AKA protocol in 5G generation with asymmetric encryption to protect users during the communication process. However, this new version of AKA still uses sequence numbers (SQN), so the digital forensics investigators decided to check if the protocol was still vulnerable. During the investigation, they discovered that the lack of randomness would allow them to infringe the SQN protection mechanism. It has been shown that partially learning SQN produces a new class of attacks against mobile phone users; although the attacker must start with a fake base station, the attack can be extended even if the victim moves away from the attack area, the experts mentioned. Even when the victim uses his cell phone outside the attack area, some of their activity can be leaked to another attacker once the user enters the attack area again. The vulnerability occurs because an attacker can send authentication challenges to the users system at different times, retrieve the SQN, and exploit its values to violate the confidentiality of the SQN. To carry out their proof of concept, the experts only required a laptop, a radio peripheral, a smart card reader, and the **OpenLTE** software. In total, the researchers claimed to have spent about $1.5k USD, not counting the laptop (which, according to experts, can be replaced by a Raspberry Pi, obtaining the same results). Experts say they have already notified 3GPP, as well as giving notice to manufacturers like Ericsson, Huawei and Nokia. An update is expected to be released as soon as possible, but only for mobile phones operating with 5G technology."

According to reports of specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this attack technique works against the wireless network protocols [**WPA/WPA2**](URL with roaming functions based on Pairwise Master Key identifier (PMKID) enabled. Steube discovered this attack variant while conducting an investigation related to the security protocol WiFi WPA3. The technique allows attackers to retrieve Pre Shared Keys (PSK) and use them to hack the targeted WiFi network, thus accessing the victims Internet traffic data. However, it differs from other WiFi hacking techniques; this attack does not require capturing a four-way LAN Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAPOL) authentication handshake. According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this attack is carried out in the Robust Security Network Information Element (RSN IE), using a single EAPOL framework after requesting it from the access point. This attack variant was discovered incidentally while we were looking for ways to attack the new [**WPA3**](URL security standard. On the other hand, hacking this new standard would be much more complex because of its modern key-setting protocol known as Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), the expert mentioned. According to Steube, the main difference between this new method and the rest of the known attacks is that this attack does not require the capture of the complete EAPOL binding protocol, because it is done in the RSN IE element of a single EAPOL frame. The RSN protocol allows you to establish secure communications over 802.11 wireless networks. It uses the PMKID key to establish a connection between client and an access point. According to the experts report, the attack is carried out as follows: * Run ***hcxdumptool*** to request the PMKID from the access point and return the frame received as a file (in ***pcapng*** format) ***$ ./hcxdumptool -o test.pcapng -i wlp39s0f3u4u5 enable\_status*** * Run the ***hcxpcaptool*** tool to convert the captured data from the ***pcapng*** format to a hash format accepted by Hashcat ***$ ./hcxpcaptool -z test.16800 test.pcapng*** * Start the **Hashcat** cracking tool (v 4.2.0 or higher versions) and decrypt it. The hash mode we need to use is 16800 ***$ ./hashcat -m 16800 test.16800 -a 3 -w 3 ?l?l?l?l?l?lt!*** This will restore the password of the victims WiFi network. Steube points out that he ignores in how many routers exactly this attack works, but he believes that the attack could be functional against all WiFi 802.11 i/p/q/r networks with roaming capabilities enabled. In other words, the attack would work against most modern routers, adds Steube."

This campaign has been identified as **Stolen Pencil**, and among its victims are universities with specialties in biometric engineering. The attackers assure the persistence of the campaign through the use of standard tools, but according to reports of specialists in digital forensics, their operational security is deficient, since it has been concluded that the attackers use Korean keyboards, open browsers and English-Korean translator. According to the analysis published by the experts it is still not possible to determine what is the main objective of this campaign, although they add that this group of malicious actors is specialist in access credential theft. Potential victims receive a phishing email that redirects them to a website; subsequently, the attacker will try to get the victim to download a malicious Chrome extension, the experts mentioned. Once the attack is completed, malicious actors try to gain persistence in the victims system using tools such as Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and maintain access, the report says. The malicious extension loads JavaScript from a different website. This extension allows attackers to access data from all the websites that the victim visits, so experts deduce that hackers try to steal cookies and passwords right from the browser. According to the report of the experts in [**digital forensics**](URL no malware has been used during the Stolen Pencil campaign. Instead this hacker group has resorted to the use of RPD to access victims records. In addition, experts have found evidence of remote access to compromised systems on a daily basis.

Among the tools found are KPortSca, PsExec, the Eternal exploit set, and tools such as Network Password Recovery, Remote Desktop PassView, SniffPass and WebBrowserPassView. It is likely that this campaign will only be a small sample of the scope of the activities of this group of hackers. After analyzing the methods and tools used by these malicious actors, the experts have concluded that the attacks came from North Korea. While we were able to get information on hackers tools, techniques and procedures behind the Stolen Pencil campaign, it is clear that this is just a small glimpse of their activities.

According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this operation was launched last November, with agencies across Europe chasing multiple members of gangs dedicated to money laundering and other crimes throughout dark web. Europol stated through a press release that 235 people were arrested during this operation, mostly for crimes related to money counterfeiting. In addition, the agency reported that 300 houses were raided. A key factor for the success of this operation was the carelessness of one of the suspects, as their limited security measures allowed a data leaking that the agencies used to track an illegal transaction.

According to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, it is very difficult for hackers to break elliptical curve [**cryptography**](URL although new studies say they would be able to alter the perception of confidence in the most commercially used certification authorities. According to Elias Heftrig, a digital forensics expert at the **Fraunhofer Institute for Information Technology Security**, five of seventeen certification authorities are vulnerable to IP fragmentation attacks. Certification authorities that use **Domain Validation** (DV) to authenticate domain property were selected and scanned to detect this class of vulnerabilities. This attack exploits DNS cache poisoning and deceives the certification authority into issuing fraudulent certificates for domains that do not rightfully belong to the attacker, the investigators explained. Another group of specialists discovered some shortcomings in the implementations of elliptical curve cryptography in real scenarios. However, this research revealed nothing serious enough to force users to resort to weaker cryptography. The finding of these [**digital forensics**](URL experts came from passive Internet scans for TLS on a large number of ports, as well as Secure Shell (SSH) and IPsec, in a series of tests designed to measure the support of the elliptical curve and the behavior of the implementation. Researchers Luke Valenta and Nick Sullivan also performed active measurements to estimate server vulnerability to known attacks against elliptical curve deployments, including support for weak curves, invalid bend attacks, and curve spin attacks, they mention in their reports. Around 0.77% of HTTPS hosts, 0.04% of SSH hosts and 4.04% of IKEV2 hosts that support elliptical curves do not perform curve validation checks as specified in elliptical curve standards, experts said. These vulnerabilities have the potential to be used in elliptical curve parameter degradation attacks, known as CurveSwap attacks. Even so, when this variant of attack was put into practice, the investigators were unable to execute malicious actions as they were theoretically posed. Valenta mentioned that there are other easier methods in which a nation state could attack a system that attempts to degrade the connections of elliptical curves. In addition, the expert added that there could still be poorly configured servers available, so the possibility of this attack should not be completely ruled out. After scanning, the investigators proceeded to examine the source code for elliptical curve implementations, finding instances where libraries cannot perform point validation for JSON web encryption, as well as some coding deficiencies in multiplication algorithms."

The company has assured its users that this is not a measure in response to a security breach or some other cyberattack, but it is a preventive decision with which they will try to anticipate the actions of malicious hackers who could attempt to take advantage of some users who manage the same passwords to access different platforms and services. Due to recent data breach incidents (Marriott and Quora, for example), Citrix began noticing some signs of a credential stuffing attack on ShareFile systems, which generated concern among their cybersecurity and digital forensics teams, as they believed that the attackers were using the information obtained from other security breaches to try accessing ShareFile accounts. We have made this decision immediately to mitigate the risks for our ShareFile customers by forcing a password reset, said Stan Black, a Citrix manager, through the companys blog. We know that this decision could generate some drawbacks for our users, but we felt that it was necessary to stop any attempt to steal information. [**Digital forensics**](URL specialists recommend ShareFile users to enable the multi-factor authentication option to access their accounts. Dana Tamir, an information security expert, says that enabling two-factor authentication is an essential way to validate the identity of users and protect against cyberattack techniques such as credential stuffing. Tools like ShareFile are one of the main targets for hackers, because they contain valuable and confidential data, said Tamir. Restoring user passwords is not enough to prevent security incidents, as new passwords could also be stolen with relative ease, the expert concluded. Restoring passwords is usually a flimsy security measure, as people tend to modify only some characters of their current passwords in order to avoid the need to remember a new one. In addition, the implementation of multi-factor authentication is not an absolute solution against data theft, since many files shared across platforms such as ShareFile are not suitable with multi-factor authentication due to their inherent features, so they remain unsecured."

This time, the authority that has decided to fine the company is **Italian Competition Authority** (ICA), according to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security. The authorities stated that Facebook violated the Italian **Consumer Code**, so it will be imposed two fines with a total value of about $11M USD. The ICA states that the social network violated several articles of the Consumer Code because it erroneously informed consumers of the use that Facebook makes with their personal data. The ICA determined that Facebook does not explicitly inform people how their personal information will be used for commercial purposes at the time they are registered on the platform. According to a statement from the ICA, Facebook emphasizes the gratuitousness of the service, but omits to inform about the commercial use that is given to users data. The companys privacy notices are ambiguous and no appropriate distinction is made between the use of personal information to complete a user profile and use for commercial purposes, the ICA statement mentions. The Italian authorities also discovered that Facebook intentionally sends its consumer data to websites and third-party apps for commercial purposes without the users express consent, which represents a violation of articles 24 and 25 from the Consumer Code. In addition, according to experts in cybersecurity and [**digital forensics**](URL if users change these default configurations, they face restrictions on the use of Facebooks platform. Authorities rulings on issues like this help to form precedents for corporate action in the future, considers Abhishek Iyer, an expert in digital forensics. Over the next few years, regulatory authorities must specify truly functional policy frameworks to protect user information that companies like Facebook have access to, adds the expert. Iyer also believes that users must have the right to revoke any permission to share information with third parties without facing reprisals or limitations on the use of any online service. This is the second time that European authorities impose fines for Facebook; previously, the United Kingdom had already fined the social network with $645k USD because of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which data of over 80 million users were leaked for third parties. Although these are considerable figures, these fines represent only a slight annoyance to Facebook and its $5 billion USD net earnings per quarter. However, experts in digital forensics commented that this could change due to the entry into force of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which establishes that companies that do not comply are faced with fines equivalent to 4% of their annual incomes. Under this legislation, companies with Facebooks earnings level would face fines of up to $1.6 billion USD in the event of a violation of the GDPR."

According to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this project has already begun to generate serious security concerns, even though it is still in the bidding phase. **Viktor Vekselberg**, close to the Russian government, has been linked to C5, a group of companies that has worked closely with **Amazon Web Services** (AWS), leaders in the career of the Pentagons contract award. Both C5 and AWS have stated that the C5 group is not involved in any form in the bidding of the JEDI project. On the other hand, the Pentagon has refused to make any statements about it, in compliance with the confidentiality of the bidding process. **Amazon Web Services and C5 Capital** AWS has become the worlds largest cloud computing service provider, controlling a third of the entire market for this kind of services. On the other hand, C5 is a relatively new group, but in a few years it has made a capital close to $120M USD for investment in cybersecurity. Although they have collaborated on various cloud projects, both companies deny keeping close links. C5 Accelerate, one of the companies that integrate C5, says on its website that it is developing a cluster of cloud accelerators in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the U.S., in collaboration with AWS. However, C5 maintains that it has never participated in a bid along with AWS, stating that it has worked with companies like IBM and Microsoft, without distinction. Nonetheless, according to experts in [**digital forensics**](URL **Teresa Carlson** and **Andre Pienaar**, representatives of AWS and C5, have traveled multiple countries promoting the relationship between the two companies. **Andre Pienaar and his links with Russia** Pienaar, the man behind C5, is a South African citizen who keeps close relations with many of the most important people in different industrial branches. On the payroll of C5 Capital, one of its most important companies, are some of the most influential names within military and security elites, whether in the east or the west.

The hackers behind this campaign, known as **Operation Sharpshooter**, are deploying malware associated with [**Lazarus**](URL hacking group, the same organization behind the cyberattacks against **Sony** in 2014. Experts in [**digital forensics**](URL and cybersecurity who first found this campaign believe that malicious actors might be gathering information regarding intelligence activities in multiple countries with the purpose of planning future cyberattacks against nuclear, energetic, financial and defense organizations. According to the specialists, during this operation the hackers take advantage of an implant in the memory to unload and to recover a second stage implant for their later exploitation. During last October and November, the **Rising Sun** implant began to appear in organizations around the world, mainly in the U.S., the experts mentioned in their analysis. Like other similar cyberattack campaigns, English-speaking organizations and English-speaking regional offices are attacked in Operation Sharpshooter. The operators of this campaign have been engaged in collecting information about people of interest or organizations that manage relevant data. These attackers are conducting multiple phishing attacks, sending a link that redirects victims to an infected Word file, allegedly sent by a human factor recruiter. The message that the victims receive is written in English and describes jobs in non-existent companies. The URLs attached to the document are associated with an IP address located in the U.S. and the Dropbox document management platform. Macros included in the malicious Word document use a built-in shell code to inject the Sharpshooter download software into Word memory. According to experts in digital forensics, the Macros act as a download program for the Rising Sun implant, the second stage implant that runs in the memory and collects information about the victims machine. Rising Sun includes dozens of backdoor features, including capabilities to kill processes and overwrite files on the disk. The binary is downloaded into the Startup folder to gain persistence in the infected system. Experts noted that campaign operators also download a second Word document from the control server, which they believe is used as bait to hide the malicious program. The experts noted that Rising Sun implant uses the source code of Trojan Duuzer, the backdoor that the group of hackers Lazarus used in the attacks against Sony Pictures. In addition, experts found other similarities with the attack campaign against Sony; for example, the documents used to distribute the Rising Sun malicious load contain metadata indicating that it was created using a Korean version of Word. Finally, the specialists consider that the operators of the Sharpshooter operation could also be leaving false traces to hinder the workings of the police agencies."

The vulnerabilities were present in the users Microsoft accounts, from Office files to Outlook emails, according to [**digital forensics**](URL specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security. In other words, all kinds of Microsoft accounts (over 400 million) and all kinds of data were exposed to hacking. If chained, the bugs would become the perfect attack vector to access the Microsoft account of any user; all the attacker required was for the user to click on a link. According to the report published by Sahad Nk, a Microsoft sub-domain (success.office.com) was not properly configured, allowing it to take control using a CNAME record, a record that connects one domain to another. Using the log, Sahad was able to locate the poorly configured subdomain and link it to his personal Azure instance to get full control of the subdomain and all of its data. Although this already seems serious by itself, the real problem for Microsoft is that the applications of Office, Sway and Store could be deceived with relative ease to transfer their login tokens to other domains in control of possible attackers when a user logs into their Microsoft account. As soon as the victim interacts with the specially designed link received by email, it will log into the **Microsoft Live** registration system. When victims enter their user name, password and 2FA code (if enabled) an account access token will be generated allowing users to login without re-entering their credentials. If someone gets this access token, its like getting users credentials itself, the digital forensics experts mentioned. Therefore, an attacker can easily enter the account without alerting the original owner or alerting Microsoft about the unauthorized access. The malicious link is designed in a way that forces the Microsoft login system to transfer the account token to the controlled subdomain. In this case, the subdomain was controlled by Sahad; however, if a malicious attacker controlled it, it was possible to put a large number of Microsoft accounts at risk. The most disturbing thing is that the malicious link seems authentic because the user is still entering through the legitimate Microsoft login system. The bug was corrected by Microsoft shortly after receiving the report; the amount of the bounty that the company gave to the expert was not disclosed."

According to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, every time a user browses on the Internet is exposed to bugs and inefficient or malicious practices that could compromise the security of their information. Here are some simple practices to reinforce our Internet security. **Using security software** The use of security programs and tools is a good measure to avoid the entry of [**malware**](URL or any malicious software in our systems, even more when browsing the Internet, where the attackers are always lurking. **Backups could be useful** A basic measure to protect ourselves from data loss is backing up our information, either due to a cyberattack or to hardware damage. Having a security copy of your information gives you an additional layer of protection against the ransomware or some data erasure software. **Think of a secure password** Cybersecurity and [**digital forensics**](URL experts have repeated it again and again: never use your date of birth, relative names or other commonly used as a password. A secure password mitigates the risks of dictionary or brute force attacks. **Sensitive information encryption** Users should consider encrypting information considered as sensitive when sending it by email or storing it in the cloud, there are multiple options for users with any level of knowledge. **Remember to always log out** Log out from every platform you use, especially when using a device that does not belong to you. Public-use computers may contain a keylogger or some type of software that registers a users login keys. **Store your passwords in a safe space** Never store your passwords in text files or notepads on your computer, in case of loss, all your access codes would be compromised. Consider using password management software. **Keep alert of system upgrades** Software bugs appear frequently in all systems. Keeping your software updated will help you stay safe from exploiting any vulnerability present in your system. **Avoid public WiFi networks** You must be careful with the use of public networks; digital forensics experts mention that malicious users often try to compromising them to extract information. Using VPN services is an interesting alternative for private browsing. **Enable security alerts** You can choose to receive a security alert when using an online banking service or similar. In the event that a malicious user tries to access one of your accounts, one of these alerts might help your bank determine an illegitimate access attempt. **Think before you click** Resort to common sense; dont click on misleading links or ads, never open an email if youre not sure its from a legit user. Once you learn how to distinguish malicious content online it is easier to keep your information secure."

However, this time is a little different. The malware discovered by[ **cybersecurity**](URL experts uses steganography (a technique to hide content within a digital graphic image in a way that is invisible to an observer) to hide the commands embedded in an image (in this case a meme) posted on Twitter. This trojan identified as **TROJAN.MSIL.BERBOMTHUM.AA** shows interesting behavior because malware commands are received via legitimate Twitter traffic and uses a harmless-looking meme and cannot be deleted unless the account where it was published is removed from the platform, mentions the report of cybersecurity specialists. The Twitter communication team reported that it closed the malicious account last December 13th. The attackers hid the command **/print** within the memes, which allowed them to take screenshots of the compromised machine, in addition to sending them to a command and control server, whose address was obtained through a URL encoded in PasteBin. In addition, **BERBOMTHUM** malware reviews the Twitter account used by attackers and downloads and analyzes meme files and extracts the command that they include. The Twitter account used by attackers was created in 2017 and contained only two memes, which were published in October 25 and 26. These images were used to send the **/print** command to the BERBOMTHUM malware. The commands used by the attackers and their tasks are:  **/print**  Performs screen captures  **/processos**  Retrieves the list of running processes  **/clip**  Captures the contents of the Clipboard  **/username**  Retrieves user name from infected machines  **/docs**  Retrieves file names from a predefined route According to experts on cybersecurity, this malicious software is at an early stage of development, so more similar incidents are not discarded in the future.

This new algorithm, developed by a team of specialists from the UK and China, is based on the implementation of a **Generative Antagonistic Network** (GAN), a special class of artificial intelligence algorithms useful in scenarios where the algorithm does not have access to large amounts of data for learning. According to experts in [**cybersecurity**](URL a classification machine learning algorithm usually requires millions of data points to train before it can perform a task with the required accuracy degree. On the other hand, a GAN algorithm has the advantage of being able to work with a much smaller amount of data to start learning thanks to a GAN using a generative complement to produce similar data. The generated data points are then fed to a solver algorithm that tries to guess the output. The experts who developed this algorithm applied the same concept to break the CAPTCHA text, which had only been tested with machine learning algorithms that required large amounts of initial data points. The researchers mentioned that, in a real environment, an attacker would not be able to generate millions of CAPTCHA in real time without being detected or banned from the website. Therefore, for the investigation only 500 text based CAPTCHA present in 32 of the 50 most visited sites according to Amazons Alexa were used. The data list to train the algorithm includes text CAPTCHA from sites like Wikipedia, Microsoft, EBay and Google. &amp;#x200B; URL After compiling and training the solver to generate 200k artificial CAPTCHA, cybersecurity experts tested their algorithms against multiple text CAPTCHA systems used in the network, which had previously also tested other algorithms.

The worst part is that things didnt get any better; new **malware** families, government-sponsored attacks, and many more incidents have kept the cybersecurity community busy. Some of the most dangerous cyberthreats that were presented this year are: **Spectre and Meltdown** Just started the year and several [**cybersecurity**](URL specialists began to report the CPU vulnerabilities known as Spectre and Meltdown. Present on the Intel, IBM, ARM and AMD chips, it was discovered that these vulnerabilities could be exploited through a side channel attack for the purpose of stealing confidential information stored on the device by deceiving the compromised computers programs. Prior to its public disclosure, multiple industry organizations worked together to develop security patches for these failures, which generated some mistimes, such as slowing down the affected devices, if not enough, in the following months some variants of the vulnerabilities continued to appear, as well as other speculative execution vulnerabilities, such as Foreshadow. Companies like Intel mentioned that their next generation of chips will be designed to avoid the presence of this kind of flaws. **GandCrab** GandCrab encryption software became the most widely used tool in[ **ransomware**](URL attacks this 2018. Unlike conventional attacks, GandCrab is based on exploitation kits such as RIG, GrandSoft and Fallout to deploy its attacks; in addition, GandCrab demands ransom in the cryptocurrency Dash. According to an analysis of a cybersecurity firm, hackers behind GandCrab could have generated about $700k USD in earnings. **VPNFilter** VPNFilter is a modular malware program allegedly developed by the Russian hacker group known as Fancy Bear. Present in a wide range of routers, this malware is capable of performing DDoS attacks, data leaking and cyber spying tasks. At a later stage, VPNFilter is able to even propagate much more quickly through multiple endpoints, leak information and encrypt its own malicious traffic. **Coinhive** The use of cryptocurrency mining software increased considerably this year. Among the many programs available, Coinhive was consecrated as the most widely used mining software, especially for focusing on the digital currency Monero, an anonymous asset whose transactions are very difficult to trace. Coinhive is explicitly used in some sites, although most of its users are malicious hackers who inject the miner inadvertently into unsuspecting websites or administrator machines. **Magecart** This is a malware used for the theft of payment card data used at least by six malicious hacker organizations around the world.

Windows Sandbox will use Windows containers, a function of the operating system to work in the cloud, which means that the company is trying to make this new function available to any user, as considered by experts in cybersecurity. As for the tool operation, once Windows Sandbox is enabled the tool will be ready to use. After you open Windows Sandbox with administrator permissions, it will display an environment similar to a virtual computer or container, from which you can manipulate the operating system in isolation, without compromising the actual operating system. Users can copy any executable in the sandbox and open it there in a completely secure way. In this tool, the system administrator will be able to corroborate whether an application is harmless or malicious, only affecting the sandbox environment. Microsoft expects the introduction of Windows Sandbox to help build a safer environment for large-system administrators, as well as for users with enough knowledge to handle this kind of tools."

Several security firms reported that over one million children in the United States were victims of identity fraud during 2017, resulting in losses of around $2.6M USD. According to experts in cybersecurity, given the limited or null financial records that a child has, it is very easy for criminals to open fake bank accounts on behalf of the infants, among other similar activities. In this incident also highlights the importance of phishing for cybercriminals, since, according to estimates of multiple security signatures, phishing is a common element in most data breaches, because about 90% of these incidents start with fraudulent email campaigns."

Most viruses found on [**Twitter**](URL for example, are spread at an accelerated rate through links attached on tweets that offer discounts or some kind of user-alluring software, according to cybersecurity and ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Problems begin when someone clicks on one of these links, as they may bring adware, spyware or some variant of ransomware to the users device. Here are some tips from [**cybersecurity**](URL specialists to keep you safe from this kind of threats. **Methods of virus distribution in social networks** The main way of distributing this kind of malicious software is through posts, tweets, etc., which contain attached links. For example, a tweet can be posted by any Twitter account or sent as a direct message (DM) to some unsuspecting users. These posts usually try to attract users with messages such as those shown below: * Did you know that Google is hiring people to work from home? Sounds good, dont you think? **{malicious link}** * Sign up and download this incredible app  available only for today: **{malicious link}** * I just discovered the stalkers in my profile: **{malicious link}** * WOW! You can see who visits your TWITTER profile!: **{malicious link}** According to experts in cybersecurity, the web links most used to spread viruses turn out to be random and shortened URLs, such as: * Bit.ly links * Vid.me links * Adf.ly links * TinyURL sites These sites are used to shorten URLs and are not risky by themselves, but often hackers use them to hide some variant of virus and deploy it through malicious links, adding JavaScript and creating links with automatic downloads. **Types of viruses in social network platforms** According to experts in cybersecurity, there are several problems that a user can face after clicking on some malicious link. Some examples are shown below. **Phishing sites** False login pages, surveys, or fake retailers sites, are different kinds of phishing, one of the most commonly used cyberattack techniques today. Out of the different types of phishing, the most widespread is the one that announces the website of some store with the purpose of deceiving the user to enter his personal information in a fake site. The image of companies like Ray-Ban and Nike is widely used in this kind of attacks. **Malicious links** Another major threat to the use of social networks is malware infection. These links could redirect the user to a site to download and autorun a malware file (drive-by downloads), with the risk of infecting your system with some malicious software variant such as: * Cryptocurrency mining virus * Ransomware * Trojans * Botnets Recently, a gigantic botnet was discovered using more than 3 million of fake Twitter accounts and 100k bots distributing links across the web. **Fake technical support sites** One of the most used variants. Sometimes a link embedded in a Facebook post or a tweet can redirect the user to a page that claims that the users computer is not working. The attackers try to convince the user to call a fake technical support phone, from where the fake support employee will ask the user for sensitive information, or even access to their equipment. It is recommended not to call those numbers under any circumstances. **Remove social network viruses** Cybersecurity specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend that, before beginning to remove a virus, users must back up their information. Subsequently, the user must follow the recommendations listed below: * Start your PC in safe mode to isolate and delete any files and malicious objects * Find files created by social network viruses on your PC If it doesnt work, its recommended to use advanced anti-malware scanning software, so you can automatically remove any malware-related files found on the various social networking platforms."

According to reports, this [**ransomware**](URL was recently discovered in mid-November. IPMI is a set of computer interface specifications for a standalone computer subsystem that provides management and monitoring functions independently of the CPU, firmware (BIOS or UEFI), and host operating system. It is integrated into the servers motherboards or could be installed as an additional card and allows remote computer management. According to experts reports on [**cybersecurity**](URL a misconfigured IPMI interface could allow an attacker to remotely access a system and control it using the factory access credentials.

In one of the infection cases we analyzed, sysadmins did not change the default passwords for the IPMI interface. Another victim claimed that the admin user function was disabled, but somehow the attackers got access by exploiting vulnerability. Experts noted that once the user gained access to the server, attackers would restart the computer in single-user mode to gain root access, then downloaded and compiled the ccrypt encryption program. After encrypting the files, the attackers send the ransom note that contains the instructions for performing the transfer and restoring the files. Attackers use the email address junglesec@anonymousspeech\[.\]com to communicate with victims and demand 0.3 Bitcoin. According to expert reports on cybersecurity, some victims have made the transfers, but never received a response from hackers. Experts recommend protecting the IPMI interface by changing the default password and configuring ACLs that allow only certain IP addresses to access the IPMI interface."

By individual records, a hacker can get up to $10 USD, while the larger volumes of information reach numbers of between $490 to $800 USD, depending on the forum in which these records are offered. Emily Wilson, a cybersecurity specialist, has been warning multiple companies and organizations about this malicious activity for a while. However, most of the stolen records are already or have been available in a number of very popular dark web forums. In many of these markets, information is identified with the tag USA KIDS FULLZ. It is reasonable to think that cybercriminals gain access to these data through some point of access to the computer infrastructure of hospitals or government systems. In the case of the file identified as USA KIDS FULLZ , the seller claims that the records have been extracted from a hospital network, said the specialist. Wilson believes there is an enormous probability that stolen information will be used as part of a credit scam scheme. Children affected by this data breach should be between 8 and 18 years of age, they may not be involved in any financial activity. Hackers take advantage of this to use their data and open bank accounts to their name, she added. In further details on this research, hackers post their ads on dark web forums promoting them as information belonging to children of good families, who can provide and pay expensive medical services. According to specialists in cybersecurity, the trade in personal data of minors could become a serious problem in the future.

IBM argues that, so far, it has no evidence to claim that a users personal information has been compromised. On the other hand, HP has refused to make any comments regarding these accusations. This cyberattack campaign mentioned by the cybersecurity experts might be related in some way to the malicious campaigns sponsored by the Chinese government, according to the member countries of the [**Five Eyes**](URL group (United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand). Recently, U.S. secretary of State Mike Pompeo and national security officer Kirstjen Nielsen made a serious calling to the Chinese government to act responsibly after the detection of a broad campaign of cyberattacks against intellectual property and sensitive trade data on American territory, in addition to Europe and several parts of Asia. A few weeks ago, U.S. prosecutors formally charged two Chinese citizens, allegedly linked to an Asian espionage agency, pointing them as guilty of crimes such as espionage, theft of confidential data from the U.S. government and different companies around the world. In American territory, Chinese spies would have attacked NASA, the Navy, and the Department of Energy, as the experts in cybersecurity reported. The two Chinese citizens, now accused of conspiring to commit computer crimes against dozens of organizations in the United States and the rest of the world, would be related to the Intelligence division of the Ministry of State Security of China, according to the U.S. Federal agencies. FBI director Chris Wray recently stated: There is no organization that represents a more severe threat to our economy and our computer systems than the Chinese government. According to Wray, the Chinese governments goal is to surpass America as a world-leading superpower at any costs. The Chinese government has already spoken out to deny the accusations of the U.S. authorities. According to various international media, China has described these allegations as defamatory, proceeding to file a new complaint against the U.S. government, the same measure that China adopted just a couple of months ago, due to the boycott against Chinese companies like Huawei and ZTE, driven by the United States and its allies."

According to reports from multiple experts, a malicious actor could access a voicemail system to take control over services such as [**WhatsApp**](URL LinkedIn, Netflix or PayPal. The cybersecurity and mobile security expert Martin Vigo recently presented an investigation in which he states that the PIN that protects these voicemailing services is much easier to crack than a traditional password, which can lead to accounts hacking in different services. Automated phone calls are commonly used to use functions such as password reset, account verification, and more. A hacker could compromise these functions, exploiting some old programming weaknesses with updated tools and intervening in a users voicemail. The [**cybersecurity**](URL expert resorted to the use of some simple hacking techniques for phone calls, this time applied to the hack of a voicemailing service. Once a service has been compromised, hackers can start listening to the messages the victim uses to reset their password. Hackers might even infer the users PIN if it is typed into the victims device. Vigo wrote an automated script capable of violating most of the four-digit PIN used by voicemailing systems without the victims knowledge. The investigator published the code of his Voicemailcracker on GitHub (omitting the brute force function), hoping to help for the correction of this kind of weak points. When carrying out a demonstration, Vigo showed how a voicemailing system works the same with the brute force function activated, verifying that it could access services such as PayPal or WhatsApp which have a PIN verification system. Voicemailcracker uses Twilio, a Voice Over Internet Protocol service that allows you to manage phone calls automatically. Voicemailcracker launches hundreds of phone calls at the same time to interact with voicemailing systems and use brute force against the PIN, all without the victims knowledge, concluded the expert. The investigator also revealed other possible attack vectors, such as a backdoor to the voicemailing system, eliminating the need to make thousands of phone calls, an attack that requires minimal interaction from the victim.

According to cybersecurity and ethical hacking experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, hackers have already found a method to load the console with pirated games, moreover, the lack of adequate security measures by Sony have facilitated these tasks. Two hackers specialized in consoles, known on GitHub as ***yifanlu*** and ***madmonkey1907***, managed to download the PlayStation Classic code from the UART serial port of the system a few days after the launch. Subsequently, ***yifanlu*** explained that the most vulnerable elements of the system were signed and encrypted with a key embedded in the device. In other words, Sonys [**cybersecurity**](URL team approved the launch and distribution of the console with the unlock keys hidden within the very same device. During the streaming of the hacking process through Twitch, hackers discovered that the PlayStation Classic does not seem to perform some sort of sensitive code signature checking at the system booting. Thanks to this omission, it is relatively easy for hackers to load any kind of payload into the hardware from a USB device. Hackers verified this weakness by loading a PlayStation game different to the default games. This information has already generated some open source projects that allow those with a PlayStation Classic console to load a USB stick with a properly formatted payload for the hardware to recognize and run any PlayStation game; there have also been reports of some non-functional hacking methods that could brick the console system, so cybersecurity experts recommend to be careful when performing such actions. The relative ease of the PlayStation Classichacking method contrasts with the complexity to hack their counterparts released to the market by Nintendo. According to reports, to hack a NES Classic Edition console, you need to download the contents of the system on a computer via USB; then you need to modify the downloaded files and re-flash the system kernel using a specially crafted tool. Because of its price, which many consider too high, its poor list of games, and failures in availability, the PlayStation Classic console is already considered a failure of Sony in its attempt to exploit gamers nostalgia.

Data resolution LLC offers software hosting, enterprise continuity systems, cloud computing and data center services for over 30k companies around the world. The incident was revealed by renowned [**cybersecurity**](URL researcher Brian Krebs, who mentioned that the infection could have occurred because of ransomware **Ryuk**. Just a few days ago, this [**ransomware**](URL variant infected the systems of some newspapers in the United States, shutting down their printing and generating delays in the distribution of the papers in some areas of the U.S. West Coast. According to the first investigations, the malicious actors would have seized access keys and logged in during the last Christmas Eve to accede to the networks of the company and to inject the ransomware Ryuk. It seems that hackers have not committed any data theft of the company, as their only goal was to extort Data Resolution managers to make a payment and recover the encrypted data. During the incident, the attackers took control of the companys data center domain, thanks to what they managed to block any authorized access for a few moments, said the cybersecurity expert. The security notice that the company sent to its clients mentions that Data Resolution closed its network to stop the progress of the infection, in addition to be able to begin the process of elimination of the ransomware, restoration of its systems and retrieval of information. According to reports from some cybersecurity firms, the ransomware Ryuk is one of the main weapons used by the group of hackers known as **APT Lazarus**, linked to the North Korean government. Apparently, Ryuk keeps various similarities with the Hermes malware, used by this group of malicious actors. A ransomware-based attack campaign was recently discovered directed against organizations around the world allegedly linked to North Korea. This campaign seems to be perfectly planned, with cybercriminals aiming at different companies and encrypting hundreds of PCs, storage units and data centers in each infected organization. Some reports collected even confirm that some companies made significant payments to retrieve their information, transferring figures ranging from 15 to 50 Bitcoin. According to estimates made by the U.S. authorities, this campaign of attacks would have generated gains of up to $640k USD for the attackers."

The exposed information would have been identified on September 13th, after Abine found a file with email addresses, information on the IP used by its clients to log into Blur, as well as encrypted information related with users passwords. Apparently, this file has been exposed since January 6th, 2018. The main work of the Blur service is to ensure and enhance the Internet privacy experience of its users, offering password management services, as well as payment card, email addresses, and phone number protection and masking. For its part, Abine is responsible for encrypting passwords, using bcrypt and a single salt for each of its users. These unique features are present in the companys exposed file, instead of the real passwords, according to experts in [**cybersecurity**](URL However, it is known that this user password-related information could help an attacker gain access to any online account protected by these services in the event that the user has linked those services using the same email address. According to the security alert published by Abine, until now there is no evidence that the sensitive data of any user has been compromised. We believe that the data of our users remain secured. There is no evidence suggesting that the data stored in Blur (protected payment cards, email and phones) have been compromised, mentions a post on the Abine blog. Cybersecurity experts point out that Abine has not provided further details about the incident, such as the exact number of victims or how the bucket was exposed in the first place. Early research suggests that a misconfigured [**Amazon S3**](URL bucket contained the exposed file, so data from about 2.4 million users would have been exposed during the incident. This incident represents a hard blow to Abine, because password management services are considered more reliable to manage a large number of access keys to different services without the need to memorize different keys or establish a same password for every platform, running as an additional security layer. As a security measure, the company suggests its users to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) and, if possible, reset all their passwords. "

Anyone could exploit this vulnerability, be they family, friends, or strangers. The flaw has already been reported to Microsoft. Kunushevci, a young researcher from Kosovo, claims to be a common user of Skype for Android. It was during this routine use that he detected an anomalous behavior in the application related to the way in which it accesses the files stored in the smartphone. Noticing this, the investigator decided to start a small ethical hacking project to find out what was happening with the Skype service. Recently, while I was using the application, I felt the need to check an option that apparently granted more permits than it should, said the young [**cybersecurity**](URL expert. Kunushevci discovered that when a Skype call is answered, the application continues with its normal operation, allowing actions such as access to the phones files or search for contacts, regardless of whether the phone was blocked or not when the call was received. Just like multiple flaws found in the iOS system over the years, this vulnerability is due to a slight oversight in systems security. In this case, Skype allows users to access other functions by omitting any additional step of identity verification. I think this vulnerability is rather a design flaw, the expert mentions. Before posting any vulnerability report, Kunushevci reported the flaw to Microsoft, waiting for the company to launch an update to correct this bug. According to reports of experts on cybersecurity, this would have been corrected in the Skype update last December 23. The bug affects all versions of Skype for Android, according to Kunushevci. However, the vulnerabilitys scope seems to vary depending on the version of the operating system. Despite being only 19 years old, Kunushevci claims to have several years of experience in researching these issues. As he mentioned, his interest started from the age of 12 when he was looking for solutions for common flaws on his PC. A couple of years later, he was already fully focused in the field of vulnerability research, accessing some bounty programs for his reports."

[**Privacy International**](URL (PI), a UK-based non-profit organization, has reported on this incident: An example of this is the Kayak app (used for travel search and price comparison). This app sends to Facebook detailed information about the searches that its users carry out, such as flight schedules, departure dates, airports or airlines. The NGO has carried out an analysis of the data that these applications have provided to the social network, identifying that much of this information is tied to the category of personal data of the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Advertisers try to link data about user behavior across different platforms. If all of these data from different sites are combined, you can set up a detailed user profile, including interests, routines, or online activity, the PI report mentions. Cybersecurity experts found that services such as TripAdvisor, Skyscanner, Kayak and Yelp sent to Facebook the users data at the time of starting the app. Among other data, PI mentions that apps send to Facebook information such as device configuration, location, language and time zone. According to reports of cybersecurity specialists, both Skyscanner and TripAdvisor assured PI that they were unaware of this fact, thanking the NGO for alerting their teams about these drawbacks. Skyscanner published a statement mentioning that: Since we received these reports we launched a priority update for our app, so it will stop sending information to Facebook. Also, we will begin an audit in our systems to make the necessary modifications to guarantee the respect to the privacy of our users. On the other hand, Facebook keeps generating scandals related to the users privacy. Last December, several media reported that the social network shared the private messages of its users with services such as Netflix, Spotify and even a Canadian bank. Also, cybersecurity researchers said that Facebook gave Microsoft, Sony, Amazon, among others, the ability to get the email addresses of their users contacts for a long time until 2017, in addition to granting manufacturers like Apple the ability to implement special features on their devices when connected to the Facebook platform.

In the lawsuit filed with the Los Angeles Superior Court, the prosecutor states that this application, owned by the IBM Weather Company, does not inform users clearly of how their data is shared by the application at the time of collecting their location data. When requesting users permission to track their location data, the app omits to mention that TWC shares that information with third parties. The company also does not inform that these data will be used for advertising purposes and other commercial purposes not related to the services provided by the app, is mentioned in the lawsuit. Instead, the app intentionally misleading suggests that this information will be used for users to receive personalized weather information, such as forecasts and alerts.

The Los Angeles government alleges that TWC puts corporate profits above the privacy of its users, deceiving them to grant this kind of permissions to the app. The prosecution will work to stop this alleged hoax, the prosecutor said. This lawsuit was filed after cybersecurity specialists pointed to the way in which apps pose their privacy policies to users. In this case, the lawsuit claims that TWC has managed to convince about 80% of the users to grant such permissions.

The decree, signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, was published on Tuesday and will enter into force in six months. This way, when a Russian citizen registers in a messaging service, the operator of that service must verify the registration data through its mobile operator, which will have 20 minutes to respond to each request for information and it will need to record information about the messaging applications that each client uses. If the user changes their mobile telephone operator and registers with a new vendor, they will be forced to go through the identification process again. The responsibility for all this lies with the messaging service providers. According to Alexander Zharov, head of Roskomnadzor, the Russian media regulatory entity, the main goal of this measure is to fight the use of anonymity in messaging services. Zharov declared to information security and [digital forensics](URL specialists that this new measure is a necessary step to create a safe communication environment for citizens and the State in general. The official also reported that MTS, the Russian network provider, said that the system would require new technical improvements by operators, but that the databases that are needed are already implemented. However, it is not clear what will happen in cases where users have a foreign SIM card. This new measure is the new adding to a growing list of government policies that restrict the freedom of Internet use in Russia. According to reports of specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, in last July came into force a data retention law that forces the telecomm providers to store details of the communications of all users, with the purpose of helping the Russian authorities in future investigations. That measure was definitely an expensive move for mobile phone providers operating in Russia, each of which should invest about $550M USD over the next 5 years to comply with the implementation of the systems required by this law. Encrypted messaging service providers have been asked to provide access to their users chats, if required by the authorities. Telegram, the messaging app founded by Russian businessman Pavel Durov, has been banned in Russia since last April because of its refusal to deliver those encryption keys. The use of virtual private networks (VPNs) has also been banned in Russia since last year. Russian citizens have even been legally prosecuted for sharing in their social network profiles prohibited information or feelings considered extremist, which can range from sympathy with terrorist movements to criticism of Vladimir Putin or the Russian Orthodox Church.

Although the government in India claims to fight this crime on a regular basis, these supposed efforts are not yet reflected in practice. The Indian Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) is in the process of creating a unit designed to address this activity at darknet. When will be ready this new unit is not clear at this time, but it seems to be a first step in the right direction. Regarding this panorama, WCCB officials mention: There is evidence that criminals use darknet on a wide scale to smuggle illegal specimens of the wildlife of endangered species, as well as their derivatives, such as elephant ivory, rhino horns and stuff. The use of encrypted messaging applications, such as Telegram, Signal and WhatsApp, makes it difficult for our cybersecurity and digital forensics teams to link this activity with malicious actors in the real world. At the moment, the only course of action is to intensify the monitoring efforts of this activity. This new unit will help monitor this animal traffic, although it will be very difficult to take immediate action against traffickers. A notable trend is how hunters have created their own slang derived from the Indian language to offer these goods in darknet. This language is constantly evolving, making it even more difficult to get an overview of the current species trafficking context. There is a lot of work ahead for the Indian authorities, but it is really worthwhile for the government to invest in the safeguarding of the species in a critical situation."

The security problem in the Content Management System (CMS) was discovered by Simon Scannell, a cybersecurity and digital forensics researcher, who said in a blog post that this design error specifically affects WooCommerce, a popular WordPress plugin that has been downloaded over four million times. The vulnerability allows store managers to delete certain files on the server and then take control over any administrator account, the investigator says in his security report. According to reports from information security and [digital forensics](URL specialists, this plugin has been developed by Automattic and is a free e-commerce system for websites based on WordPress. Scannell found the file deletion bug in the software which, by itself, is not considered a critical flaw, since the greatest damage an attacker could cause would be to remove the index.php pages and cause a denial of service (DDoS) condition. However, when combined with the flaw in the WordPress design, this becomes a critical security error. This problem in WordPress, which continues without being patched, derives from the way in which the CMS assigns capacities to different roles. When its defined the store manager role that uses this plugin, the **edit\_users**capability is configured to allow users with these privileges to edit client accounts. Even if the plugin is disabled, this account privilege is stored in the central WordPress database. By default, the edit\_users function allows the account holder to edit any user, including administrator accounts. To prevent this from being abused, WooCommerce specifies that you can only edit accounts with the client role, but these metadata additions, possible thanks to the current\_user\_can() functionality, are only active when the plugin is enabled. Thats where the problem lies. Because the flaw in the WordPress design maintains the store manager function stored separately from the plugin, if WooCommerce is disabled, attackers who can access one of these accounts are not limited by changes in metadata. This means that if WooCommerce was disabled for some reason, the privilege check that restricts administrators from editing other admins store would not run, producing this default behavior in the plugin allowing the editing of any users information, says Scannell. This would allow store managers to update the password for the administrator account and then control the entire site. If a threat actor is able to successfully perform a phishing campaign and get the credentials of a store admin account or use XSS vulnerability for the same purpose, then the attack string becomes possible."

These new collaborative spaces will be designed to bring together the best technological talents, [Department of Defense](URL innovators and private sector investigators to solve the most important problem facing cybersecurity in the US: the workforce. Members of the US Army Cyber Brigade, nicknamed ARCYBER, and the leaders of the Digital Defense Service (DDS) were in Augusta last Thursday to announce the opening of a new workspace designed to house technology teams, cultivate talent and promote innovative ways to solve cybersecurity challenges, reports a Departments statement. These new spaces have been named Tatooine, a reference to the desert planet that was the adoptive home of Luke Skywalker, character of the Star Wars film franchise. Tatooine will be a central point for technical talent throughout the army, a place to write code and solve high-impact problems, said DDS director, Chris Lynch, at the presentation of the new facilities last Thursday. Together, men and women, professionals and technicians of cybersecurity and digital forensics are finding new ways to quickly resolve the challenges we face. At this center, the soldiers and technology experts at the DDS will work together on several pilot programs, known internally as Jyn Erso (another Star Wars reference), to help the Department in its war efforts and train soldiers to adapt and respond to future needs and problems. The first of these pilot programs will focus on the detection of drones, the active hunting of cyber threats in the Department of Defense (DoD) networks and the design of better training systems for the military working in computer science areas. To help the military solve the technical and talent management challenges, the US Army DDS and Cyber Command have partnered to bring together technically endowed soldiers with civilian private sector talents to rapidly develop the cyber capabilities needed at present, mentioned ARCYBER commander, Lt. Stephen Fogarty. This innovative partnership will solve complex problems and serve as a powerful staff retention and recruitment tool. Military personnel interested in joining these or other pilot programs can register through a special Google Hire portal created for the program. In addition to the collaboration between ARCYBER and DDS, this space will also host academic and industrial tasks through programs such as the reward for bug report Hack the Army or the Civilian Hiring-as-a-Service pilot, which seeks to count with more civilians specializing in [digital forensics](URL and information technology. Technology has become the new battlefield, Lynch said. Recruiting, supporting and retaining technical talent in the military can present unique challenges, from training to compensation, and ensuring opportunities for growth and participation in a rapidly evolving field."

The server that leaked the personal information of the clients of the financial institution, which remained exposed online without password, was discovered three weeks ago by Bob Diachenko, an information security and digital forensics expert of the cybersecurity firm Hacken. Most of the data on the server seemed to have been encrypted and required a key to decrypt and access them, but the investigator says that over 680k records were stored in simple text accessible to anyone who has found the database online. Simple text logs, says the expert in [digital forensics](URL contained the personal data of American Express customers in India, such as phone numbers, full names, email addresses and a small description of the type of card handled by the user. The data are not too confidential, but malicious actors could use them to drive spam campaigns or targeted advertising. On the other hand, encrypted information, a total of 2,332,115 entries, contained more sensitive information. Based on the MongoDB table header, the investigator deduced that these records included customer names, addresses, Aadhar numbers (personal identification key of India population), permanent account numbers (used by taxpayers in India) and phone numbers. Other tables within the exposed MongoDB database also contained links and access details for accounts in the americanexpressindia.co.in domain. After a thorough analysis, I have come to the conclusion that the database was managed by one of the subcontractors responsible for SEO or generation of American Express leads, Diachenko said. Many entries contained fields such as CampaignID, prequalstatus, LeadID etc. Diachenko has reported that American Express India eliminated the unsecured server on the same day that the security alert was published, although the investigator admits that he does not know how long the server in question was exposed online. However, American Express India stated that a subsequent investigation did not discover any evidence of unauthorized access, suggesting that Diachenko might have been the only one who accessed to the server during the period in which it remained exposed. Diachenko has mentioned that it could not track the SEO service company that managed the vulnerable server; American Express did not disclose this information either. The spokespersons of the financial institution have also not issued any additional statements. A couple of weeks ago, Diachenko also discovered a leak of records information from Mindbody, one of the largest business management service providers in the US, as well as a data leak from a Maryland consultancy that handles funds for the Democratic Party."

In a report released a few days ago, the cybersecurity firm described malware as a tool designed to intercept and approve fraudulent cash withdrawal applications in ATMs before they reach the server underlying switching applications from the bank that processes them. This malware is an executable file that can be injected into a legitimate process on the application servers running IBMs AIX operating system. All of the application servers that the Lazarus hackers have managed to compromise with this malware were running unsupported versions of AIX, mentions the security report. Theft not only affects banks, but any organization running a production environment with obsolete or unsupported equipment and software, says Jon DiMaggio, chief of intelligence at Symantec. The financial loss and media strike that accompanies the Lazarus attacks far outweigh the cost of updating the obsolete infrastructure. At the very least, financial institutions must use updated and compatible systems and software to minimize the risk of monetary losses and confidential customer data, as considered by specialist in cybersecurity and digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security. In a notice released on October 2, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the US Treasury Department mentioned that the attacks of the FatCash campaign, as it is known in America, has represented costs for banks of even tens of million dollars. The notice reported two incidents in particular, one in 2017 and the other in 2018, where the Lazarus hackers perpetrated simultaneous cash withdrawals in ATMs throughout over 20 countries. According to the notice, in each of the multiple attacks of Lazarus, the hacker group configured and implemented legitimate scripts on the applications servers to intercept and respond to fraudulent ATM withdrawal requests. But Symantecs research has shown that the executable that allows fraudulent activity is, in fact, a malware. Symantec has baptized malware as Trojan.Fastcash, mentioning that it complies with two main functions. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL and cybersecurity, one of these functions is to monitor and read the main account number (PAN) in all incoming ATM traffic. The malware is designed to block all the traffic that contains the PANs previously identified as belonging to the attackers. It then generates a fake response that approves the fraudulent request, so the attackers ensure that their fraudulent applications will succeed. Hackers decided to attack smaller banks with fewer technological resources in places like Asia and Africa; maybe because larger financial institutions would probably have better security measures, as DiMaggio considers. The vulnerable version of the AIX server was simply what was in the environment that the attacker was addressing. It was not the driving force of the attack, but a characteristic of the specific environment that the attacker had access to, the expert says."

The first hacking attack on FIFA, in 2017, led to the publication of the failed anti doping tests of multiple soccer players, was attributed to the Russian group of hackers known as Fancy Bear or APT28. Gianni Infantino, president of the international institution, admitted the new hacking incident as he spoke to the press after a FIFA council meeting last week in Kigali, Rwanda, and told the media that FIFA is preparing a report on the incident. Even so, the digital forensics and cybersecurity community believes that there are still no clarity or technical details about this second attack, although the first FIFA investigations suggest that some officials of the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) would have been the victims of a phishing campaign. Until last Tuesday, this organization had not found traces of a hacking. According to information security and digital forensics specialists, the first to access the recently leaked FIFA documents were Football Leaks, a platform that shares leaked information, known as the football version of [WikiLeaks](URL Football Leaks supplied the leaked documents to a consortium of European media organizations called European Investigative collaborations (IEC), and IEC members began publishing a series of stories based in part on these documents in the recent days.

BCMPUPnP\_Hunter was first seen last September; in mid-October, the researchers managed to collect the first samples of this [botnet](URL Digital forensics experts noted that the interaction between the botnet and the potential victim requires several steps to complete, starting with the destination scan of TCP 5431 port. After scanning, verification is made of the UDP 1900 port of destination and the target is expected to send the appropriate vulnerable URL, mentions the security report published by the specialists. After getting the correct URL, it takes another 4 packet exchanges for the attacker to find out where the Shellcode execution start address is in memory so that the exploit payload can be created and sent to the target. Experts noted that the extent of infection is really large; the amount of IP found is approximately 100k in each analysis. Once the attacked device is compromised, the attacker implements a proxy network (TCP-proxy) that communicates with widely used mail servers such as Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, etc. This suggests that botnet may have been involved in spam campaigns. The geographic distribution of scanned IP in the last 7 days revealed that most of the infected devices are found in India, the United States and China. [Digital forensics](URL experts tested the scanners and discovered at least 116 different types of infected devices. According to reports from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the malware sample analyzed by the experts is composed of the main body and a shell code that is apparently designed specifically to download the main sample and run. The main function of the shellcode is to download the main sample of C2 (109.248.9.17:8738) and execute it, the analysis continues. Shell code has a total length of 432 bytes, very well organized and written. It seems that the authors have advanced hacking skills, they are not amateur hackers. The main sample includes an exploit for the BroadCom UPnP vulnerability and the proxy access network module. The main sample can scan four C2 instruction codes, enable port scanning, and find a potentially vulnerable target, empty concurrent task, access the proxy network. The botnet was probably designed to send traffic to servers of known mail service providers. Researchers believe that the proxy network established by the botnet is used for spam due to connections made only through TCP port 25."

According to a recent report we have received, data of almost all Pakistani banks have been hacked, said retired Captain Mohammad Shoaib, director of Cybercrime area at the FIA last Tuesday. The comment made by Captain Mohammad Shoaib came after the discovery made by the information security firm about a new deposit of Pakistani credit and debit cards in [dark web](URL forums. The agency is investigating more than 100 cases related to this security breach. Over 100 cases have been registered in the FIA and are under investigation. We have made several related arrests, including an international gang of hackers, said Captain Shoaib. The data found in dark web forums include 20k debit card details from Pakistani citizens. The data belongs to clients of most of the banks operating in the country, according to reports of specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Captain Shoaib mentioned that hackers behind the security breach are operating outside Pakistani territory and attacking multiple banking institutions. Large sums of money have been stolen from peoples accounts, he added. This recent attack has made it quite clear that it is necessary to improve the security system of our banks. The FIA notified its findings to all the banks of the country and convened a meeting with its representatives with the intention of responding to the incident, mitigating the damage and improving the security of the banks in general. Banks are responsible for protecting the money that people choose to store in them, Shoaib said. They are also responsible if their security measures are so weak that they facilitate access to malicious agents. It is still unclear when the security breach occurred and how the attackers gained access to banking systems. Pakistani banks face a serious security emergency, last week a cyber attack on Bank Islami allowed attackers to steal at least 2.6 million of Pakistani rupees from their accounts (about $20k USD). Last weekend, some Pakistani banks suspended the use of their debit cards out of the country, and blocked all international transactions made with their cards. One of Pakistans most important financial institutions informed its customers that its online mobile banking services would be temporarily suspended from November 3 until a new notice. The Pakistan governments information security and [digital forensics](URL team published a report detailing the extent of data leaking, as well as a possible timeline. The government experts believe that the data was obtained through the technique of cloning payment cards known as card skimming. According to the report, the first card database was put on sale on the site JokerStash. These databases, identified as PAKISTANWORLD-EU-MIX-01, contain over 11k records, of which more than 8k are related to at least nine Pakistani banks. These cards were offered for sale in various cybercrime forums for prices of between $100 and $160 USD. "

According to reports of cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, one out of every 500 sites (from a list of the million most visited websites) contains scripts to mine without the users consent, in what is known as [cryptojacking](URL Cryptojacking can generate disastrous consequences for its victims, such as the weakening and death of infected computers and smartphones, due to CPU overhead, exploiting them beyond their capabilities, as well as excessive increments in electric power using. A device attacked with cryptojacking sees its productivity reduced (including its critical operations) as the system performance degrades considerably. This attack could also compromise the security of the confidential data stored on the affected systems. Some specialists in digital forensics believe that the most frightening thing about cryptojacking is that it can go unnoticed for long periods of time. Any endpoint is at risk, so its worth asking: how to protect our endpoints from the effects of cryptojacking? Why do cybercriminals feel so tempted to carry out cryptojacking attacks? Unlike the ransomware, the cryptocurrency mining is stealthier and can be really difficult to detect, it also eliminates the hassle of demanding victims for a ransom. The mining can represent a constant source of income for hackers, especially when thousands of systems are attacked together. An average device can generate about 0.25 dollars a day. It may not seem like much, but that figure changes when systems are attacked in a massive way. The gains increase according to the hash rate (the speed at which a particular mining machine operates) and the increase in the consumption of electric energy. In a cryptojacking campaign analyzed by a [digital forensics](URL firm, attackers generated about $704 USD a day ($257k USD in a year) using vulnerable endpoints. Five other related campaigns were discovered simultaneously, accumulating a total of over $1M USD. Given the little awareness of these kinds of problems, it is very likely that these massive attack campaigns will continue to be present in the future. **Attack vectors** **Email**: In the past an attacker launched a campaign via email falsifying a job application. The email contained a Word document that appeared to be a CV, which led the victims to enable macro content, thus initiating the download of Monero mining software. **Exploits**: It has been seen that hackers exploit vulnerabilities in developments such as Adobe Flash, while others use malware delivery channels such as Smokeloader. The most significant thing about this exploit is its ability to run for months (even years) on infected systems. In addition, known exploits, such as EternalBlue, used to exploit vulnerabilities in SMEs for the well-known WannaCry campaign, are now being used to deploy cryptojacking software. **Other variants**: Hackers also resort to other pathways of infection such as injecting code by exploiting browser plugins, reliable system processes, and websites that incorporate JavaScript. This allows mining while using the browser. **Avoid being victims of cryptojacking** Digital forensics specialists provide some tips to address this problem in the best possible way. **Prevent**: Blocking and preventing difficult-to-detect mining threats before they reach our endpoints is essential. This is possible by taking advantage of several preventive engines that go beyond the traditional antivirus, and applying advanced capacities like exploit prevention, and the advanced sandboxing. **Detect**: We know that the danger cannot be completely avoided. Therefore, it is important to have visibility of what happens after a file has successfully entered an environment. This is possible by continuously monitoring and analyzing the command line, file and process activity at each endpoint. **Respond**: When the cryptojacking is detected, it is forced to respond quickly to contain the threat. Automated responses block malicious connections that emanate from all endpoints. This approach minimizes the risks of any collateral damage."

Cybersecurity researcher Artem Moskowsky was responsible for finding this flaw, which allowed anyone to generate license keys to access material available only by purchasing a license. Digital forensics specialists estimate that there are millions of people who use Steam to buy and download games. Mr. Moskowsky informed Valve, owners of Steam, receiving $20k USD in return, thanks to the companys vulnerability bounty program. This type of program allows companies to reward cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL experts who make the security issues known directly to companies so they can be repaid, rather than disclosing the information online. Moskowsky claims that he discovered the issue in a circumstantial way while browsing the Steam Partners portal. This portal allows game developers to generate license keys for their software, allowing them to deliver a copy to their fans or experts on the subject for testing before being available to the public. The expert discovered that by modifying the request, anyone was allowed to generate thousands of codes for any game they want. In theory, this could be sold on any black market forum online. I managed to overlook the ownership verification of the game by changing only one parameter, reports the expert. Valve granted him $15k USD for discovering the error, plus a bonus of $5k USD for informing the company privately about the error.

VirtualBox is an open source virtualization software developed by Oracle and has been widely used, as reported by experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security. According to the analysis of Sergey Zelenyuk, the problems of memory corruption are responsible for this zero day [vulnerability](URL also mentions that the exploit is 100% reliable. The vulnerability affects the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) network card (E1000) if the network mode is set to Network Address translation (NAT). The problem prevails in a virtualization software-shared code base, which is available literally on all operating systems. According to experts in digital forensics, this vulnerability is not specific to this platform or some operating system mainly because it is present in a shared code base. Zelenyuk has also shown the steps to follow to exploit vulnerability. Through the exploitation of this flaw, an attacker can evade the virtual environment of a guest computer and gain direct and easy access to the Ring 3 privilege layer, which is used to execute the encoding of most user programs with minimum privileges. Zelenyuk discovered that the error can be exploited on those virtual machines that have been configured with the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) network adapter only when NAT mode is enabled, while the default setting allows the system guest can access external networks. Zelenyuk explains clearly the error in his blog: The Intel PRO/1000 MT has a zero-day vulnerability that allows an attacker with administrator privileges to operate as a guest to escape a host3 ring. The attacker can then use existing techniques to escalate privileges to ring 0 through /dev/vboxdrv. In addition, he stated that it is important to understand the way this failure is exploited, because it is the key to understanding how context descriptors are processed before data descriptors. Zelenyuk demonstrated how the conditions needed to obtain a buffer overflow are activated, which can be exploited to evade the virtual operating systems confinements. The digital forensics expert used package descriptors to produce a suboverflow condition in data segments that cause the network adapter to locate package data from the network by searching the system memory. Next, Zelenyuk read the guest operating system data in a stack buffer to create an overflow condition. This led to overwriting of function pointers, which can be understood as a stack overflow condition. Zelenyuk further explained in its technical report that the exploit depends on two overflow conditions and the vendor access to the Ring 3 level permissions, therefore, to control the host operating system, it is necessary to obtain a privilege escalation. An attacker can do that by linking another vulnerability to achieve greater privileges, which is a difficult process but certainly not impossible, according to Zelenyuk."

Since then, organizations are working on compliance with the high security standards demanded by GDPR, considered to be the most stringent privacy and data protection act so far. According to cybersecurity and digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, one of the key issues addressed by GDPR is the responsibility of data controllers and processors, which we will discuss below. **Government responsibilities** 1. Accountability and governance This is one of the basic principles of GDPR, considered experts in digital forensics. It establishes that, as an organization, a data processor must be able to demonstrate that the processing is done according to the requirements of GDPR. 1. Data protection by default and by design As an organization, the controllers must comply with different measures: * Starting from data protection as the core of security designs. In an IT company, there must be data protection methodologies throughout all its developments, business architecture, etc. * Implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that, by default, only the personal data required for each specific purpose of the process is processed. * Minimize stored data and consider using pseudonyms. This can be accomplished by asking some simple questions like: * Does your organization really need this data? * Do you need it to be personal? * Is it absolutely necessary to use these data? * Are the data visible only to those who really need to see them? 1. Records of processing activities In an organization with over 250 employees, controllers must keep a record of processing activities: * What data are processed and why? * How long will it be processed and stored? * To what kind of organization these data are disclosed, including recipients in other countries or international organizations. * In addition to digital backup, there must be a physical record of processing * This is mandatory because the regulators can request this data. 1. Cooperation with the regulatory authorities The controllers, processors and their representatives shall cooperate, upon request, with the supervisory authority for the fulfillment of the GDPR. **Data processors** * When processing is performed on behalf of a controller, the controller will use only processors that offer sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures. * The processor will not co-operate another processor without the specific or general written prior authorization of the data controller. * Data processing will be governed by a contract or other legal act linking the processor and controller. * The contract, or legal act, shall stipulate, in particular, that the processor: * Shall handle personal data only in the documented instructions of the controller. Processors should do nothing more than the driver indicates. * Will ensure that persons authorized to process personal data work under a legal obligation of confidentiality. * Will help the controller through appropriate technical and organizational measures taking into account the nature of the processing. **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)** This is a risk assessment, considered experts in [digital forensics](URL and cybersecurity. DPIA is required under the following scenarios: * Processing and profiles design with significant effects. * Large-scale special category data. * Systematic monitoring of public access areas. **What should there be in a DPIA?** * The full description of the processing. * If this process is required. * Possible risks to fundamental rights and freedom of stakeholders. * Risk management: If a risk occurs, how can the data controller act? It will always be advisable, when we are starting a new project or a new application, to perform a DPIA. It can give us more information on how to manage, protect, and store controller data. **Data Protection Officer (DPO)** You will need a DPO if: * You are a public authority. * You conduct systematic monitoring of large-scale data subjects. * You process a large amount of special category information or criminal records. **What tasks must the DPO accomplish?** * Advice * Monitoring compliance with GDPA * Driving the DPIA **Security Incidents Notification** Although your organization meets all GDPR standards, a security breach can still happens. This section discusses what to do if a driver is aware of a data breach on a system. 1. Appropriate technical and organizational security measures Controllers must comply with appropriate information security policies based on the risk to people, not the risk to the organization. Both the controller and the data processor must take steps to ensure that any natural person acting under the authority of the controller or the processor that has access to the personal data does not process them, except in accordance with the instructions of the controller. 1. Notify the regulator in the event of a violation of personal data The data processor must notify the regulatory authorities within 72 hours after the data breach is discovered. 1. Notify data subjects in the event of a violation of personal data It is the responsibility of the data controller to identify whether the security breach is high or low risk. The data processor will be able to contact a lawyer to see if they have to notify the subject of the data or not."

It is still unclear whether the incident was the result of an error or because of a cyberattack on the BGP protocol. Route hijacking, also known as BGP hijacking, occurs when routing tables for IP address groups are intentionally or accidentally corrupted. Recently, Chris C. Demchak and Yuval Shavitt, specialists in cybersecurity and digital forensics, revealed that in recent years, China Telecom has been misdirecting Internet traffic through [China](URL China Telecom is currently present in North American networks with 10 Points of Presence (PoPs)  eight in the United States and two in Canada  which cover the main exchange points. The two investigators noted that the telecomm company uses the PoPs to hijack traffic through China, which has happened several times in recent years. Within BGPs forwarding tables, the administrators of each AS announce to their neighbors as the IP address blocks of their AS, either to use them as a destination or as a convenient transit node, the investigators indicate. Errors can occur given the complexity of BGPs configuration, and these possible errors offer hackers an opportunity to hijack traffic. If the AS1 network announces erroneously through its BGP that it possesses an IP blocking which is actually owned by the AS2 network, the traffic of an Internet part destined to AS2 will be routed through AS1. If the erroneous announcement was maliciously fixed, there is a BGP hijacking, the experts on cybersecurity and digital forensics mention. BGPs most recent leaks were reported for the first time by the ThousandEyes network monitoring firm, traffic to Google services, including Google Search, G Suite and various Google Cloud services, went through TransTelecom in Russia, the Internet service provider from Nigeria MainOne, and China Telecom. On November 12th, 2018, between 1:00 pm and 2:23 pm PST, ThousandEyes noticed problems connecting to G Suite, a critical application for our organization. In reviewing the ThousandEyes Endpoint Agent Statistics, we noticed that this was affecting all users in the ThousandEyes office, mentions the firms report. The interruption not only affected G Suite, but also Google Search, as well as Google Analytics. What caught our attention was that the traffic to Google Search was being reduced in China Telecom. Why does traffic from a San Francisco office running through Google reach China? We also noticed a Russian Internet service provider on the traffic route, which definitely generated some concerns for our teams. The cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL community speculates that the origin of this leak was the BGP matchmaking relationship between the Nigerian supplier MainOne and China Telecom, however it is unclear whether BGP leaks were the result of an intentional attack or poor configuration in MainOne. On the other hand, Google has confirmed that the root cause of the incident was external to the companys systems and has started an internal investigation in this regard."

The compromised data includes passport numbers, identity card numbers, email addresses, and the attackers got access to credit card details, although the exposed information varies for each passenger affected. According to reports of experts in digital forensics, Cathays IT staff discovered unauthorized access to systems that stored data up to 9.4 million people. Hackers also accessed 403 credit card numbers overdue and twenty-seven credit card numbers were granted, just without their CCV. Cathay Pacific notified the incident to local authorities and legislators. The airline also created a website for customers concerned about the status of their personal information. Now, the company has admitted that it was under attack for three months, in addition to admitting it took six months to disclose the data theft. In the official announcement issued by the airline, the company stated that it had detected anomalous activity since the beginning of March 2018. Later, Cathay Pacific confirmed to be aware that in March it was under a large-scale attack on its servers. The attacks continued during the investigation. During this phase of the investigation, Cathay was the subject of new and more intense attacks during March, April and May. These continuous attacks meant that the companys security incident response resources should remain focused on containment and prevention. Repair activities began as part of this effort and continued throughout the process. Despite the fact that the number of successful attacks decreased, we remain concerned that new attacks could occur, report Cathay [digital forensics](URL experts. Cybersecurity specialists and authorities questioned the companys decision to keep the security breach undisclosed for six long months, a situation that could have exposed its customers to additional risks depending on the nature of the stolen data. The company explained the delay was because it spent a lot of time restoring their systems to know exactly what information the attackers accessed."

According to government procurement data, the DEA paid a company in Houston, Texas, called Cowboy Streetlight Concealments LLC, approximately $22k USD since June 2018 for video recording and playback equipment. On the other hand, ICE paid about $28k USD to Cowboy Streetlight Concealments by the same period of time. It is not known exactly where the DEA and ICE cameras were installed, or where the next operatives will take place. ICE offices in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio have released funds for recent acquisitions of Cowboy Streetlight; the latest DEA purchases were financed by the Agencys Technology for Investigation Office, as reported by experts in digital forensics. Christie Crawford, owner of Cowboy Streetlight in conjunction with her husband, a Houston police officer, claims not to be at liberty to discuss in detail the contracts the company signed with federal agencies. Basically, there are companies that will build concealments for the government and thats what we do. They specify whats best for them, and we do it. Thats probably all I can say for the moment, Crawford mentioned. However, she added: I can say this: we are all always under surveillance. No matter if you are driving down the street or visiting a friend, if the government has a reason to watch you, it has the resources to do so. A few days ago, the DEA issued a request for concealments made for the PTZ Network Camera \[Pan-Tilt-Zoom\], cellular modem, cellular compression device, noting that the Government intended to award the contract to Obsidian Integration LLC, a company in Oregon that has a considerable number of clients in the federal government. In addition to hiding the cameras in the streetlights, the DEA has also placed covert surveillance cameras inside traffic barrels, a product specially designed and offered by several manufacturers. And, as reported by specialists in [digital forensics](URL the DEA operates a network of traffic signals with integrated enrollment readers. Chad Marlow, a lawyer and policy advisor for American Civil Liberties believes that efforts to put hidden cameras on the streets have been previously proposed by local authorities, usually as part of a system of smart public lighting. It basically has the ability to turn every streetlight into a surveillance device, a frightening possibility, said Marlow. In most jurisdictions, the local police or the Department of public works is authorized to make these decisions unilaterally and in secret. There is no public debate or supervision. The impact of surveillance cameras will increase as the development of facial recognition algorithms is becoming more common among law enforcement agencies. Amazon has been particularly interested in equipping the cameras operated by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with facial recognition systems, according to emails recently discovered by the organization Project on the Government Oversight."
424,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,63 new vulnerabilities found in Windows,1,9yua0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9yua0m/63_new_vulnerabilities_found_in_windows/,2018-11-21 04:31:57," **The company recommends users to update their systems as soon as possible, because among the errors found there are zero-day vulnerabilities** Last Tuesday Microsoft has launched a new round of security updates for the Windows operating system and other [Microsoft](URL products, reported experts in digital forensics and cybersecurity from the International Institute of Cyber Security. This month, Windows users and sysadmins must immediately take care of updating to correct a total of 63 security vulnerabilities, of which 12 are considered critical, 49 relevant, one moderated and one low-severity. Two of the errors solved by the technology giant this month had not been publicly disclosed until now; in addition, specialists in digital forensics report that one of the vulnerabilities is being actively exploited in real environments by multiple groups of cybercriminals. **Zero-day vulnerability exploited** The zero-day vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-8589**, was detected and reported for the first time by researchers from a Russian cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL and its being exploited in real scenarios by multiple advanced persistent threat groups. The error resides in the Win32k component (win32k.sys), and if successfully exploited, it could allow a malicious program to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode and raise the privileges of the attacker on an affected Windows 7, Server 2008, or Server 2008 R2 system, allowing them to take control. The exploit was executed by the first stage of a malware installer to obtain the necessary privileges for its persistence in the victims system. So far, we have detected a very limited number of successful exploits of this vulnerability, researchers mentioned. **Two zero-day vulnerabilities disclosed** The other two recently disclosed zero-day vulnerabilities (and of which no evidence of exploitation has been found) reside in the Windows Advanced Local Procedure Call service (ALPC) and the Microsoft BitLocker security feature. The ALPC-related vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-8584**, is a privilege escalation vulnerability that could be exploited when running an application specially designed to execute arbitrary code in the local context system security and take control of an affected system. APLC facilitates safe and high-speed data transfer between one or more processes in user mode. The second publicly disclosed vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-8566**, occurs when Windows unduly suspends BitLocker device encryption, which could allow an attacker with physical access to an off system to omit security and get access to encrypted data. BitLocker caught the attention of the cybersecurity community in early November for a security issue that could expose some Windows users encrypted data due to default configuration and poor encryption in self-encryption solid state units. Of the 12 critical bugs, 8 are memory corruption vulnerabilities in the Chakra script engine present due to the way the script engine handles objects in the Microsoft Edge browser. All of these 8 errors could be exploited to corrupt the memory, allowing an attacker to execute code in the context of the current user. Three of the remaining vulnerabilities are remote code execution errors on the TFTP server of Windows Deployment Services, all residing because of the way the affected software handles objects in memory. The latest critical vulnerability is also a remote code execution flaw found in Microsoft Dynamics 365 version 8. The error exists when the server cannot properly disinfect web requests to an affected Dynamics server."

Ron Masas, the security investigator who discovered the problem, mentioned in a security report that this new bug resided in the Facebook search system. When browsing the [Facebook](URL search results and in their HTML I noticed that each result contained an iframe element, probably used for the companys internal monitoring, said Masas. The investigator says that by looking at this, he realized that when searching for an iframe inside the search results page, he could determine whether a search query had given a positive or negative result. By simply using basic yes or no questions, the digital forensics expert says he could infer if users liked a particular page, if they have taken photos in certain geographical locations, if they have contacts of a particular ethnicity or religion in their friends list, if they have shared posts with some specific text, among many other highly confidential details. These search queries, even if they did not expose details directly to the user, themselves exposed second-hand information that could reveal user habits, identity, preferences, or circle of friends. It is important to mention that an attacker could not run these search queries through the Facebook Search feature available on any profile. To eliminate this restriction, Masas created a malicious webpage to lure unsuspecting users. If the user interacts with this page, even by just clicking, the page automatically executes the malicious JavaScript code that automates these search queries in a new tab. Masas mentions in his report that an attacker could use a technique known as tab under to force the opening of the Facebook search page within a background tab, which keeps the user focused on the main malicious page while it remains hidden, disguised as an online game, a streaming platform or a news site, for example. Because the tab under technique is used regularly today to promote intrusive ads, most users dont even pay attention to the opening of the tab in the background, believing it to be an ad more. While the user interacts with the malicious page, the script designed by the [digital forensics](URL investigator automates a series of Facebook searches through the Facebook graphics API, counting the number of iframes that search results obtained through the fb.frames.length property, and recording the results. It is very likely that, while the error was available, the attack was more efficient on mobile devices, where the tabs are not visible on the screen, showing only a small open tab counter, which users often ignore. In addition, the attack also does not need to open individual tabs for each search query, allowing the attacker to reload the existing tab with a new search URL at short intervals."

Italian politicians, for example, seem to completely ignore the importance of the 5G infrastructure for the countrys growth and possible effects on national security, while senior German officials plan to ban from their biddings Chinese companies like [Huawei](URL because they are concerned about their information security, as reported by specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Germany is not the first country to prohibit the participation of Chinese firms in the implementation of its 5G infrastructure. Australia and the United States, for example, have announced such decisions earlier. We have serious concerns about that. My recommendation is to take the same measure as the governments of Australia and the United States, mentioned a senior official of the German government involved in the internal debate on 5G technology. Officials from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Security in Germany were informed by Australian and American digital forensics experts on the risks of working with Chinese vendors such as Huawei in the implementation of their 5G infrastructure. An intense debate is growing in Germany and information security experts fear that this may cause a delay in the implementation of the 5G infrastructure, planned for 2019. Officials fear the possible interference of Chinese intelligence, a situation that is contemplated in Chinas National Intelligence Act, adopted in 2017, which states that Chinese organizations and citizens must, in accordance with the law, support, cooperate and collaborate in the work of national intelligence. [Digital forensics](URL experts believe that companies like Huawei could support the Chinese government in cyber spying activities or that Chinese intelligence could compromise the teams developed by firms like ZTE and Huawei. Cyber security has always been our top priority and our backgrounds support us in providing safe products and solutions for our customers in Germany and anywhere in the world, said a spokesperson for Huawei. Huawei believes that there are political motivations behind the decision to ban its participation in the US and Australia auctions, a decision based on a misleading and limited interpretation of Chinas legislation. Last week, after an Australian media published a story claiming that Chinese intelligence had used Huawei employees to get access codes to infiltrate a foreign network, the company denied that it has ever provided or asked to provide customer information to any government or organization, reported cybersecurity specialists. Following the Australian governments decision to exclude Chinese companies from participating in the implementation of their 5G network, there is great uncertainty for companies like Huawei, said a senior industry official who asked for anonymity due to sensitivity of the subject. Huawei fears a possible domino effect; the company believes that this prohibition could be extended to all the countries of the European Community."
427,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,New variants of Meltdown and Spectre cause information leaks,1,9z5c9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9z5c9r/new_variants_of_meltdown_and_spectre_cause/,2018-11-22 04:35:30," **Developers insist that existing defenses will be enough to contain attacks, but experts disagree** Information security and digital forensic investigators have discovered a new set of transient execution attacks on modern CPUs that allow a local attacker to gain access to the systems privileged data, confirming predictions made when the cybersecurity community revealed the [Spectre](URL and Meltdown vulnerabilities at the beginning of the year. In short, these security failures can be exploited by malicious users and potentially remove passwords, encryption keys, and other sensitive information. To date, there is no knowledge of any software that exploits these vulnerabilities in the wild, however, this have been a wake-up call for the semiconductor industry, a situation that forced manufacturers to make new designs of silicon and tool chain changes. Digital forensics investigators described seven new transient execution attacks, consisting of two new variants of Meltdown (Meltdown-PK on Intel and Meltdown-BR on Intel and AMD) and five new Spectre branches for previously described flaws known as Specter-PHT and Specter-BTB. The researchers say they have already informed the companies involved. When Spectre gains access to transient data, Meltdown prevents isolation between applications and the operating system when evaluating out-of-order transients after a CPU exception to read kernel memory. Previously, five variants of Meltdown were publicly disclosed: Meltdown-US (Meltdown), Meltdown-P (Foreshadow), Meltdown-GP (Variant 3a), Meltdown-NM (Lazy FP) and Meltdown-RW (variant 1.2). The digital forensics investigators propose two more: Meltdown-PK and Meltdown-BR. The Meltdown-PK attack can override a defense on the Intel Skylake-SP server chips called memory protection keys for user space (PKU), allowing processes to modify the access permissions of a memory page from the user space, without a syscall/hypercall. For its part, Meltdown-BR provides a way to bypass linked checks, which generate exceptions when an out-of-bound value is encountered. It exploits the transient execution after such an exception to capture information outside of the limits that would otherwise not be accessible, the experts in [digital forensics](URL report. Researchers demonstrated the attack on an Intel Skylake i5-6200U CPU with MPX support, an AMD 2013 E2-2000 and an AMD 2017 Ryzen Threadripper 1920X. They point out that this is the first time that a Meltdown-style transient execution attack can take advantage of exception handling delays in AMD hardware. As for the new approaches to confuse the predictor of the branch in the attacks Specter-PHT and Specter-BTB, the researchers carried out the vulnerability proof of concept on Intel Skylake i5-6200U and Haswell i7-4790, in AMD Ryzen 1950X and Ryzen Threadripper 1920X, and on an Arm-based NVIDIA Jetson TX1. Researchers say that all vendors have processors that are vulnerable to these attack variants. CVEs for these security flaws have not yet been assigned. In a statement, an Intel spokesperson dismissed the possible risks. The vulnerabilities documented in this research can be fully addressed by applying the existing mitigation techniques for Spectre and Meltdown, including those documented earlier in this document and elsewhere by other manufacturers of Chips, the spokesperson mentions. An ARM spokesman said: The recent vulnerabilities of Spectre and Meltdown identified by a group of researchers can be addressed by applying existing mitigations. For its part, AMD has not issued any statement regarding the investigation."

During the first day of the event Pwn2Own Tokyo 2018, the participants, experts on cybersecurity and digital forensics, hacked Apples [iPhone X](URL devices, Samsungs Galaxy S9 and Xiaomis Mi 6, generating revenues of more than $225k USD. The novelty of this edition of Pwn2Own was the implementation of a specific hacking session for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The second day, the organizers delivered rewards of $100k USD for one iPhone and two Xiaomi hacks. The day began with the triumph of the team Fluoroacetato composed by experts in information security and [digital forensics](URL Amat Cama and Richard Zhu, who hacked an iPhone X exploiting a Just-In-Time (JIT) vulnerability and an out of bonds flaw. Specialists received $50k USD for leaking device information, successfully extracting a previously deleted photo from the hacked device. In another test, the Fluoroacetate team failed in their attempt to demonstrate a base-band exploit directed against iPhone X devices in time, but the experts successfully exploited an overflow of integers in the web browsers JavaScript engine Xiaomi to leak an image stored in the phone, earning $25k USD. Researchers Georgi Geshev, Fabi Beterke and Rob Miller of the LaterMWR Labs team also failed in their attempt to hack an iPhone X in the browser category, as they were unable to use their exploit chain within the time the test allowed them. Later, this team hacked the Xiaomi Mi6 in the browser category using a download error along with a stealth app installation to load their custom application and leak the images of the device, thanks to this the team won $25k USD. The organizers reported the vulnerabilities found to the respective vendors, who paid a total of $325k USD for 18 zero-day vulnerabilities, of which $110k USD were paid for vulnerability reports on iPhone X. These security bugs could have been exploited by a persistent attacker or a surveillance company to compromise a device through the browser or Wi-Fi feature. This type of vulnerability can reach much higher prices in the cybercrime community. Overall, we grant a total of $325k USD during the two days of the event, buying 18 zero-day exploits. Manufacturers and developers received reports of these errors and now have 90 days to launch security patches to address these vulnerabilities. Once the updates are published, the user must remain attentive to their implementation, is mentioned on the official website of Pwn2Own Tokyo 2018."

The ruling, dictated in recent days in a Florida district court, is part of a five-year legal battle of Gregory Faulls representatives against John McAfee, who spent some time living in Belize before his neighbors demise. At the time, the local newspaper San Pedro Sun reported the death of Faull. The man, a 52-year-old American retiree was found by his housekeeper in the living room of his house with a gunshot wound to the back of his head at the end of 2012, the local media reported. Although the local police wanted to interrogate McAfee as a potential witness to the incident, the millionaire, who is the founder of the [McAfee](URL antivirus software firm, was outside his home in Belize. Despite the fact that the investigation of the crime was being stopped, the relatives of Faull presented a civil case against McAfee, according to the information that is known in the industry of computer security and digital forensics. The court will issue a judgment for non-compliance with respect to the plaintiffs liability and against the defendant for the wrongful death of Gregory V. Faull, ruled the US District judge, Gregory Presnell, who had previously closed the case Against McAfee until a ruling by the US Court of Appeals was issued, forcing the reopening of the legal process. John McAfee, however, does not seem to have been involved in the legal process, judging by the surprising lack of legal records presented by him in the case, to the point that he had not even hired a lawyer. The Faull defense allegation was therefore successfully applied to the default trial against McAfee. A January 2019 bank test was scheduled to determine what damages the antivirus company owner will have to pay. According to reports of experts in [digital forensics](URL on one occasion local police raided the property of McAfee for claims on an alleged drug production and storage campaign, as well as being accused of carrying unlicensed firearms. After the raid, the Belize authorities withdrew all charges against the employer. However, the biggest controversy during McAfees stay in Belize has been the death of its neighbor, Gregory Faull. Faull, who was last seen alive on a Saturday in November 2012, filed a formal complaint against McAfee for the latters bad behavior, complaining about his habit of shooting weapons and the misconduct of his dogs. When the police searched the home of McAfee, wanting to interrogate the software developer company owner at once for the disappearance of their neighbor, he was not there. A few weeks later, McAfee reappeared in Guatemala, after illegally entering that country, as he himself admitted, to try to obtain political asylum. The McAfee application did not bear fruit and eventually returned to the United States."

According to specialists in digital forensics, Docker containers are very popular because they allow virtualization at the operating system level. This allows you to run applications in a lighter virtual environment, complete with all the dependencies you need. The researchers at a cybersecurity firm found that the cybercriminals are taking advantage of the poorly configured Docker services to add their own containers, which are run by a Monero mining script. The infection is spread automatically through scripts and utilities already existing in the attacked system, in a tactic known by [digital forensics](URL experts as living off the earth. Among these scripts and utilities are Docker, wget, CURL, Bash, Iproute2, MASSCAN, apt-get, yum, Up2date, Pacman, dpkg-Query and SYSTEMD. According to the research carried out by this firm, once the attacker arrives at a vulnerable host Docker, it starts a container and executes commands to download and start auto.sh, a script that helps to extend the operation. It also checks the system for specific packages and downloads the missing ones to continue proliferation to other hosts. The script auto.sh is also responsible for initiating the task of Monero mining executing another script called MoneroOcean. This miner is available for free download on GitHub, but the authors of this campaign actually use a variant hosted on Pastebin. You can jump to different hosts after scanning network subnets connected to infected hosts; the IP addresses of the misconfigured Docker daemons are stored in a text file, processed by additional scripts called test.sh and test3.sh. Its purpose is to traverse each IP address in the list and connect to remote hosts using the Docker client tool. All of these scripts are hosted on a server that was running until the time the investigation was done. Different mining software called XM is also stored on the server; it is considered marked as malicious by 24 different antiviruses on the site VirusTotal. This is not the first time the auto.sh script is used for cryptojacking. In mid-October an attack campaign was detected in which a script with the same name was detected. Getting to Docker over the network safely is easily achieved by executing communication over TLS. This is possible when the tlsverify indicator is enabled and the definition of a trust certificate for the  Tlscacert  flag. Under this configuration, the daemon Docker only accepts authenticated connections with a trusted certificate. When in client mode, Docker connects only to servers that have a trusted certificate. In conjunction with cloud computing technology, services exposed to the public Internet are easy prey for perpetrators of any kind of computer threat."

According to reports of specialists in digital forensics and information security, only the approval of President Trump is needed to make this concrete. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act, which was passed in the Senate in October and in the House of Representatives this week, essentially reconverts NPPD as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, CISA will be responsible for leading the programs to protect critical infrastructure and cyber security, develop associated policies and coordinate security matters with private sector and federal entities. The new agency will have a cyber security division, an infrastructure security division and an emergency communications division. Christopher Krebs, the current undersecretary of the NPPD, will lead CISA. The reorganization will optimize cybersecurity within DHS, while improving its ability to engage with government and some industry sectors, Krebs said in a statement this week. Giving the NPPD a name that reflects what it really does will help to better protect the nations critical infrastructure and cybernetic platforms, he added. This law arises in a context of growing threats to the critical infrastructure and the US industry by rival nations and increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals groups. The concerns of the American government have been increasing over the past few months. Geopolitical tensions between the US and countries like China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran have only exacerbated those concerns. However, the big question posed by experts in [digital forensics](URL is whether rearranging NPPD in a new agency really is a significant change in the interests of cybersecurity. Im concerned that the only name change does not elevate performance levels to what the nation needs, says Alan Paller, a specialist in information security issues. Paller points out that there has been some sort of internal battle between NPPD and the DHS Science and Technology Group, which is responsible for researching, developing, testing and evaluating technologies in support of the DHS mission. On the other hand, Colin Bastable, an expert in cybersecurity, says that the feds need a cybersecurity division for businesses, non-federal assets and consumers, in a similar way to the FBI. DHS will never address the problems that citizens and private companies face because of cybercrime because the main focus of DHS is the federal government, says Bastable. A federal cybersecurity office would focus on protecting Americans as consumers and employees, and the companies that employ them. It would be responsible for investigating and attacking the cyber criminal gangs and anticipating possible attacks. From the perspective of cybersecurity, DHS will always focus on federal infrastructure and critical systems, says Bastable. Despite how great the DHS structure is, it will never be enough to fight the cyber threats we face."

According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, among other things, Sakura is in charge of supervising the organization of the Olympic Games of Tokyo 2020, he also monitors that the country is safe from hacking campaigns during the event. Since I was 25 I let my staff and secretaries do those activities, he said in response to a question from the independent legislator Masato Imai. Ive never used a computer in my life. According to a chronicle of Japanese media: Masato Imai, surprised by Sakuradas statements, replied, I find it incredible that someone who is responsible for the cybersecurity and digital forensics policy of a country has never used a computer. But Sakurada said, It is a matter that must be treated by the government as a whole. Im sure were not making a mistake. Sakurada also was not able to respond in a proper way to basic questions about technology. When a legislator asked him if USB drives can be used in nuclear power stations, Sakurada redirected the question to other experts because he ignored those technical details. Sakurada argues that his main task is to monitor the organization of the Olympics, but now many doubt whether it is really qualified to carry out this mission. Sakurada also showed a lack of knowledge when asked how much the sporting event would cost, or whether North Korean officials will be allowed to attend, claiming that he had not prepared a question session. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL Sakurada was appointed minister of [cybersecurity](URL in October by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, after his re-election as leader of the Liberal Democrat Party and the reorganization of the cabinet. The Japanese official has always been a controversial man. For example, in 2016, he used an extremely offensive language to refer to South Korean women who were forced to work in Japans military brothels before and during World War II, illiteracy occupation prostitutes, alleging that propaganda had created a misconception that these women were victims. Sakurada later apologized and recanted her statement. The problem of technological ignorance is not limited to this case. There are also many digital illiterate politicians in the United States, although it may not be as much as Sakurada. For example, the member of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy complained once that the Conservatives were being censored on Twitter. It turns out that I was looking at a marked retweet that contained potentially sensitive content, a function that I ignored can be modified with the account preferences. Some politicians also resist the use of email. I dont like email, said Senator Lindsey Graham. Ive never sent one. In the past, the late Senator John McCain, Pat Roberts, and Richard C. Shelby also admitted that they rarely used the email or did not use it at all."

Anonymous sources of the company reported to various media platforms that the attack was developed over four days and that ransomware operators demanded that the company pay a thousand Bitcoin in ransom, the equivalent of $6.45M USD. Media Prima computer systems have been completely compromised and infected with ransomware in the last four days, the anonymous source said. The attackers demanded a payment in Bitcoin in exchange for the keys to get back the companys information. Some recognized members of the cybersecurity and digital forensics community requested a statement from Media Prima. On the other hand, the company did not confirm or deny the incident, limiting itself to declare: Thank you for the interest. We regret to have to inform you that Media Prima has declined to answer those questions. Another source, however, states that the attack was not as serious as it was reported in the first instance, adding that the company refused to make the payment demanded by the attackers. The email system from our office was affected, but we have migrated to G Suite. The hackers demanded Bitcoins, but they will not receive any payment from us, declared the second anonymous source. [Digital forensics](URL specialists do not know which variant of ransomware would have been used against the company. It is also unclear whether operators had direct access to physical systems (implying that they would have acted with the collaboration of company personnel) or whether they used social engineering schemes to enter the Media Prime infrastructure and deploy the attack. It is worth noting that ransomware operators often use social engineering to deceive victims into granting internal access. Whatever the case, going for the amount requested by the operators, the attack was most likely directed. According to reports of cybersecurity and digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the average recovery time of a company that has undergone a cyber attack is 50 days, in addition to the financial costs and damages to the reputation of the attacked organization."

According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the BSI, the Office of computer security in Germany, mentioned that they wanted a manageable security level and defined the security features that they believed should be available by design and by default on routers. The German government seeks to protect routers from via Internet attacks by adopting measures such as: * Restriction of default LAN/WiFi services to DNS, HTTP/HTTPS, DHCP/DHCPv6 and ICMPV6, and a minimum set of services available in the public interface * Ensure that guest WiFi services do not have access to the device settings * Set the default WPA2 encryption to a minimum, with a secure password that excludes identifiers such as the manufacturer, model, or MAC address * Robust password protection in the configuration interface, secured by HTTPS if available on the WAN interface * Mandatory firewall features * Remote configuration must be disabled by default, and can only be accessed through an encrypted, server-authenticated connection * User-controlled firmware updates, with option for automatic updates These recommendations also indicate that the factory reset must render the router to a secure default state, and all personal data should be removed from the unit during this process. Over the past weekend, OpenWRT digital forensics experts and the Chaos Computer Club (CCC) went on to declare that they consider these inadequate recommendations. BSI said these recommendations are the result of two years of consultations with suppliers, network operators, and consumer advocacy agencies. OpenWRT and CCC estimate that there was too much consideration for vendor opinion and very little attention to consumer concerns. According to OpenWRT, two user protection measures have been left out of the BSI recommendations list. Providers should inform users how long they plan to launch backup for their products with security updates; in addition, customers must have the right to install custom software (such as OpenWRT), even after the official vendor support ends. On the other hand, the CCC said that the current security scheme has failed, as companies provide a minimum security standard, according to the convenience of manufacturers. CCC mentioned that it is unclear how these new policies would counteract computer threats such as Heartbleed, Sambacry or the botnet BCMUPnP, recently discovered earlier this month. Hauke Mehrtens, a [digital forensics](URL expert from OpenWrt stated that disabling the user to install firmware like OpenWrt raises doubts about the seriousness with which governments address computer security.

The announcement is part of the plans of various companies to migrate to the use of the passwordless Internet through the implementation of WebAuthn, the key technology to complete this transition. According to cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists, the implementation of this technology involves the use of biometrics (such as facial or fingerprints recognition) or other [authentication](URL methods rather than continuing to use the username/password system. Although this is a relevant measure for Internet users security, it is still necessary to go through a long implementation process, in which users will have to be persuaded to adopt new forms of authentication for access to the various digital platforms. The use of the password is relatively simple for any Internet user, so this method has prevailed as the most used. On the other hand, passwordless authentication works differently, it can be complicated to understand and involves the need to learn new acronyms or concepts, such as FIDO2, WebAuthn, or CTAP, so specialists in digital forensics will try to explain in a general way how passwordless authentication works. **Passwordless logins** When someone uses a website, the most common way to register is by choosing a username and password. Once the user shares this data with the website, any kind of control is lost on what the site does with their key words; users just can trust that the website will store and process that information in a secure way. Based on the number of data security incidents recently occurred, we can deduce that this expectation is not always fulfilled. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL with passwordless authentication, users will no longer depend on the website storing their information correctly. This is because public-key cryptography is used, which authenticates the user using two cryptographic keys: a private key, which is secret, and a public one. The user saves their secret key, and grants the public key to the website when gets registered. Because this key will be public, users should not be concerned that their confidential information is compromised in case of a data breach. The public key can only unlock things that were locked using the corresponding private key. On the other hand, the user authenticates using their private key to encrypt a challenge (a very large randomly selected number) sent by the website and then will make the site decrypt it with the public key. If the encryption/decryption sequence works and the web server recovers the users challenge, the passwordless authentication process is completed. For this to work properly, the user will need an authenticator, a key manager and a set of rules that will allow their computer, their browser, and the websites the user visits, to collaborate to complete the process. **WebAuthn** WebAuthn is an API that websites and browsers can use to enable authentication by using public key cryptography instead of passwords. The main browsers already manage WebAuthn; the next step is for websites to invest to implement this code change. Instead of requesting that the user enter their username/password, websites can perform authentication using the JavaScript code embedded on their web pages. The code uses the WebAuthn API to request browsers to generate credentials when the user registers in a website, or to get the login credentials. Although the JavaScript code is downloaded with the webpage and runs on the users machine, in their browser, it is still considered part of the website, so you cannot rely on access to your private key or any other secret. **Authenticators** By default, websites do not pay attention to the way the user generates or manages their private keys, so they can use the most convenient method for each individual. Users can adopt the authentication included in their operating system, such as Windows Hello, Microsofts face recognition, or a remote authenticator, a smartphone, for example. **Putting all the pieces together** A possible scenario is that the user wants to authenticate using their fingerprints. When logging into a website, the code on the login page uses the WebAuthn API to ask the browser to sign a challenge using the private key. The browser passes the challenge to the authenticator, and the authenticator asks the user to sign the challenge, what the user does by putting their finger on the fingerprint scanner. The authenticator verifies the users fingerprint, signs the challenge and forwards it to the browser, returning it to the client-side JavaScript code, which eventually returns it to the website server, completing the process. Explained in this way it may seem complex, but the users required interaction is minimal, as considered by digital forensics specialists."

The worst part of this issue is that these apps have been installed by about half a million users (560k, to be more precise). Stefanko reported, through a Twitter thread, these apps, which were developed by Luiz or Pinto; when installed, the apps hid their icons to deceive the users, forcing them to install another app, which drastically reduces the performance of the affected device. The digital forensics researcher considers that the cause of the device performance deficit could be the stealthy installation of a cryptocurrency mining malware, which render slow the smartphones to extract the digital assets using its processing capacity. Stefanko has not been able to confirm what type of malware that is being distributed through these Android games, because there is also the possibility that it is an adware, which infests devices with advertising to generate illegal revenue thanks to the little caution from Android users. According to information provided by the malicious software analysis website VirusTotal, at least fifteen of the leading antivirus scan firms have found a Trojan functional for Android in these apps. According to reports of specialists in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the Trojan in question is called **HEUR:Trojan.Androidos.Piom.Yqm**, and uses advertising as its main method to generate profits. The malware uses different methods to show Android users as many ads as possible, even by installing an adware. These Trojans can get root privileges to hide in the system folder, which makes them difficult to eradicate, the analysis managers mentioned. Stefanko reported malicious apps to the Google teams in charge of Play Store last Monday. However, this is a new company failure in its mission to protect its users against any type of malware on its official platforms. The cybersecurity and digital forensics community has been warning Google users about the possible risks of downloading third-party apps, but now it seems that it is also necessary to take precaution measures for apps hosted in Play Store. If you want to download an app for Android, be sure to check the comments and reviews that other users have made about these, as this can work as a fundamental prevention measure. It is also recommended to keep your device updated and regularly perform antimalware analysis; multiple options are available on the official software platforms, such as Play Store."

This office is responsible for managing and providing the postal service throughout the United States, and is one of the few government agencies explicitly mentioned in the United States Constitution. According to reports from experts in digital forensics, the flaw is linked to a weakness of authentication in an application programming interface (API) for the Postal Services **Informed Visibility** program, designed to help enterprise customers to track their mail in real time. According to the investigators who revealed the security incident, the API in question was scheduled to accept any number of wildcard search parameters, which allowed any usps.com account holder to perform queries in the system to get details of accounts belonging to other users. In other words, an attacker may have obtained email addresses, usernames, user IDs, account numbers, addresses, phone numbers, and postal information for up to 60 million users with account at usps.com. APIs are becoming a double-edged weapon when it comes to Internet-scale connectivity and B2B security. The APIs, when unsafe, break the premise of the connectivity they have helped to establish, says Setu Kulkarni, a [digital forensics](URL specialist at WhiteHat Security. **The Postal Service fixes the vulnerability almost a year later** The API authentication vulnerability also allowed any Postal Service user to request account changes for other users, for example, they could modify their email addresses, phone numbers, or other sensitive details.

Although it has not been confirmed, researchers are believed to have discovered the vulnerability and reported it responsibly to the Postal Service officials; however, the office ignored the warnings, leaving users data unprotected for almost 12 months, until a journalist contacted the Postal Service on behalf of the investigators. Subsequently, the Portal service corrected the problem (a task that only took them 48 hours), said journalist Brian Krebs. Although there is no evidence so far that someone has exploited the vulnerability, it is known that it remained present for almost a year, so the panorama doesnt seem so good, said Paul Bischoff, a digital rights activist. On the other hand, the Postal Service stated: So far we do not have information to confirm that the vulnerability has been exploited. The Postal Service continues to investigate the incident to ensure that any malicious user will be processed by the authorities."

Sources close to the problem report that US officials are pressuring countries that host American military bases to prohibit the use of Huawei equipment on their wireless networks and Internet. The United States Army uses secure networks for its communications involving the most sensitive information, but the authorities have been worried, as much of its traffic is still shifted through commercial networks in countries like Germany, Italy and Japan, reported the digital forensics specialists. US officials have repeatedly met with government representatives and telecom executives in other countries, inviting them to stop using Huawei products on their networks, whether for commercial or government use. The US authorities believe that Huawei devices are more prone to cyberattacks, and that they could allow the Chinese government to spy on communications or disable the **Internet of Things**(IoT) connections. An American official, who has requested to remain anonymous, stated: We are continually collaborating with countries around the world to establish guidelines on cyberthreats against our telecommunications structures. The information security landscape becomes more complex with the transition to 5G technology, which is being carried out by multiple governments. On the other hand, Huawei has stated that its equipment is used by customers in about 200 countries; in addition, 46 out of the 50 largest telecom companies in the world have implemented the use of Huawei devices, so it cannot be considered an untrustworthy company. At Huawei we were surprised by the posture that the US government has taken. The US is trying to extend this stance beyond its jurisdiction, which we consider reprehensible. Huawei firmly believes that our partners and customers will make the right decision based on their own judgment and on the companys background, a spokesperson recently mentioned. US intelligence officials have expressed concern about the safety of products manufactured by Huawei, in addition to ZTE, another Chinese company. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL last August the Pentagon ordered stores in their military bases to stop selling the products developed by these two companies, mainly smartphones, as they consider threats to American cybersecurity. Some other EU-allied countries have already taken steps to cut Huaweis involvement in their infrastructures. Last August, Huawei announced that the Australian Government had banned its participation in the bidding for the implementation of 5G technology in its telecommunications infrastructure. This situation is present in the midst of a conflict between China and the United States, as each country has imposed tariff rates on the others products. The presidents of both countries will meet soon."

The company offers real-time data management solutions; its main product is the open enterprise infrastructure, PI System, which allows connecting data, systems and people based on sensors. OSIsoft customers use PI System to collect, analyze, and view data to improve their internal processes, according to experts in cybersecurity and digital forensics. Malicious actors used stolen credentials to remotely access the companys systems, as reported in the companys incident notification, filed with the California Attorney General Office. OSIsoft is experiencing a security incident that could affect employees, interns, consultants and contractors. Stolen credentials were used to remotely access OSIsofts computers, the company mentioned in the [data breach](URL notification. OSIsofts [digital forensics](URL experts alerted the IT team about anomalous actions in the companys systems. Our information security service provider has collected direct evidence of the attack, as well as access theft, a situation involving 29 computers and 135 accounts. The evidence has allowed us to conclude that all OSI domain accounts have been affected. Threat actors would have accessed the OSI domain logon account name, email address, and user password. Although Active Directory (AD) uses cryptographic protection methods, users personal credentials may have been compromised. Thanks to the notification that the company presented to the California prosecutor, it has been possible to know that the company is not exactly aware of when the incident was presented, since OSIsoft has stated that it occurred sometime between March 23 2017 and July 26 2018. The company is still investigating the security breach, meanwhile, has developed a risk mitigation strategy. OSIsoft is re-establishing committed passwords, also encourages affected users to change their passwords for other platforms if they are the same passwords they use for their OSI account, and invite the user to inform the enterprise on suspicious activities, as well as disabling or restricting remote access and file sharing functions on users devices."

The experts used the Magic Blue [smart bulbs](URL which feature the communication via Bluetooth 4.0. The devices are manufactured by a Chinese company, called Zengge and can be controlled by Android and iOS applications. The company has important clients, such as Philips, among others. Digital forensics specialists focused their study on devices that use the Low-Energy Attribute Protocol (ATT) to establish communication. The first test carried out by the experts consisted in detecting the communication between the smart bulbs and the pairing mobile app. The pairing method used by researchers is **Just Works**. [Digital forensics](URL experts paired a mobile phone with an Android operating system with the **iLight**application and began detecting traffic while using the smart bulbs color-changing feature. In this way, the research team found the commands sent by the mobile application to the smart bulbs. The computer reverse-engineered the mobile application using a tool called **JADX**. Once they got full control over the device, the specialists began to develop an app that takes advantage of the smart bulbs light to transfer information between the compromised device and the attacker. In their proof-of-concept report, the specialists mentioned: Our plan for data exfiltration was to use the light of these devices as a mean for transferring information from the compromised device to the attackers location. Light reaches wider distances, which was our main goal. Lets imagine the next scenario: a BLE smartphone gets compromised with some malware variant to steal the users credentials. Stolen information could be sent to an attacker using a BLE smart bulb in a nearby location. In their attack, the experts used a smartphone connected to a telescope to receive the leaked data without raising the users suspicion. It was necessary to create two apps for data leaking, one was installed on the victims smartphone, and the other on the attackers mobile device to receive and interpret the leaked data. We created two applications, the first to send the leaked data and the second one to receive them. The application that transmits the information changes the intensity of the blue light on the smart bulb. The app has two modalities: normal mode and silent mode. The first can be visible to the human eye, but the silent mode is very difficult to detect due to the variations of the shades of blue used, the experts mentioned. These methods are functional in every smart bulb that allows an attacker to take control of them. In the future, we would like to create a better proof of concept that allows us to test a database of vulnerable smart bulbs, we have also considered the implementation of artificial intelligence to learn about other classes of smart bulbs, the experts concluded."

The fraudulent campaign, known as **3ve**, has been active since 2014, at least, according to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security. However, the malicious activities of its operators peaked last year, turning it into a large-scale business and generating about $30M USD in profits for the cybercriminals. Meanwhile, the US **Department of Justice** (DoJ) reported that it has initiated an indictment of 13 criminal charges against 8 people in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, who allegedly worked as campaign operators. The 3ve operation employed various tactics during its activity time, such as creating its own botnets, spoofing websites, hijacking IP addresses, using proxies to hide real IP and infecting victims computers with malware, all with the purpose of generating fake clicks in online advertising. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL 3ve involved 1.7 million computers infected with malware, more than 80 servers and over a thousand fake websites through more than one million compromised IP addresses to generate from 3 to 12 billion ad bids requests daily. According to the reports of Google and the participating cybersecurity firms, this fraudulent scheme was named 3ve because it is based on a set of three different sub operations, with each taking its own measures to avoid detection, in addition, each one is based on different architectures that use several components. Operators constantly changed their methods to hide 3ve bots, allowing this operation to keep growing even after its traffic was detected. When they were blocked in any site, they would reappear in a new one, Google mentions. The three operations used in 3ve are: 1. **Boaxxe Malware Scheme (3ve. 1)** The first of the three 3ve sub operations were powered by botnets operating in data centers across Europe and the US. This operation used the Boaxxe botnet, also known as Miuref and Methbot, to obtain the IP addresses used to send the traffic proxy of the infected devices in the data centers and to visit fake and real web pages. As the time run, the operation transcended false requests on desktops, also reaching traffic on mobile devices with Android. 1. **Kovter malware Scheme (3ve. 2)** Here they used fake domains to sell fake inventories to advertisers. However, instead of using proxies to hide, campaign operators used a custom navigation agent on more than 700k computers infected with Kovter malware. This operation used redirect servers, ordering infected computers to visit spoofed web pages. 1. **IP data Centers (3ve. 3)** The third sub operation associated with 3ve was similar to 3ve.1. Bots were set up in some data centers, but to cover their tracks, operators used the IP addresses of other data centers, as proxies, rather than residential computers. **End of Operation 3ve** After 3ves activity grew in 2017, Google, along with other digital forensics firms that had detected the operation, began its shot down operation. Thanks to this joint work, the FBI managed to seize 31 domains and 89 servers that were part of the structure of 3ve. Private organizations also helped blacklisting the 3ve infrastructure involved in the advertising fraud scheme and traffic to malicious domains."

This time, the victim is **Atrium Health**, wellness and health program provider, formerly known as Carolinas HealthCare Systems. After **AccuDoc Solutions**, one of its third party providers, was hacked, Atrium Health announced that about 2.65 million patient records might have been compromised. Information that may be exposed includes patients insurance policy data, medical file number, bills, address, dates of birth, and social security numbers. Third-party risk management is not a single security matter, this kind of incidents is important due to the increase in severity and frequency with which they are presented, affecting the growth of organizations that use this joint work model, says George Wrenn, cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL specialist. Each party involved must have the necessary information to take appropriate actions0. Organizations must have the best risk management methods involved in managing high volumes of data, adds the expert. According to the statement released by AccuDoc and Atrium Health, both organizations had relevant security measures. When AccuDoc discovered unauthorized access to their systems, the companys executives ordered a digital forensics investigation to ensure the protection of the compromised databases and improve the established security controls. The company informed Atrium Health about the incident on October 1st. The organization keeps monitoring its computer systems hoping to detect some indication of new anomalous activities. AccuDoc also mentions that, so far, they have no evidence to confirm that personal information has been extracted from their systems. Atrium Health, on the other hand, has its own digital forensics research team, which is conducting a review of their systems independently of AccuDocs research; both organizations are in contact with the FBI for any new signs of malicious behavior in their systems. Just when we thought that the protection of personal data in the [healthcare](URL sector showed signs of improvement, data breach in Atrium Health arrived, thus 2018 have been consolidated as a year of records in terms of health cybersecurity incidents, says Pravin Kothari, information security specialists."

In addition, it was reported that pirated copies of the game released online were intercepted by data miners to obtain all the games hidden information. While the games official release date is December 7th, some people seem desperate to know all the content that [Nintendo](URL has included in the game. The controversy began last Wednesday when someone posted an image of the alleged packaging of the game for retailers. A few days later, specialists in digital forensics and cybersecurity began to spread the word that the game was being sold in advance and relatively wide by certain retail vendors in Mexico; soon, the pirated versions of the game would begin to appear online. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL the leaks were caused, in part, by a Nintendo Switch console hacking method, which the company has not been able to patch. This hack allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the devices system; the situation got worse by the intervention of data miners, who checked the data and codes of the leaked game with hexadecimal editors looking to extract any content that is hiding in the videogame (as a list of characters available in the game, or unlockable elements). Allegedly, some hackers have managed to develop their own pirated versions of the game and then have them marketed online, although there are also online testimonials stating that these pirated copies can crash a Nintendo Switch console. Despite the enormous efforts of Nintendo to protect its developments, it seems that its software and hardware are too attractive for hackers to try to bypass the security and anti hacking mechanisms."

According to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this adware played a fundamental role in compromising the security measures of online use of the machines where it was installed, accessing financial information from the user and making variants of the attack known as **Man-in-the-Middle** in private connections, thanks to which an attacker could have gained access to the machine system to spy on the users encrypted communications. The United States District Court of the Northern District of California granted the initial approval of the agreement on November 21, four months after Lenovo and the consumers filed before the tribunal to end the action against spyware installed on the laptops. After the collective lawsuit, Lenovo reached an agreement to pay $7.3M USD to customers who found adware preinstalled on their devices, jeopardizing their privacy. During the time that this practice was made public, [Lenovo](URL dedicated itself to deny the accusations, as well as claimed to be unaware that some third party had exploited some of its applications. In addition, the company claims that since 2015 had stopped selling Superfish software with its equipment. While Lenovo has never been in agreement with the allegations contained in the collective lawsuit, the company is glad to finally close this case which has taken more than two years of legal proceedings. To date Lenovo is not aware of a single case in which a third party has been able to exploit a vulnerability to gain access to user communications, the company statement mentions. Back in 2015, Robert Graham, a specialist in [digital forensics](URL analyzed Superfish software, later recounting his findings: Superfish software can be considered malicious in many ways. It is designed to intercept any type of encrypted connection. However, it does so in a very poor way, leaving the system exposed to the NSA-style intelligence agencies or malicious hackers, who could spy on users private banking operations, Graham said. In 2017, Lenovo agreed with the Federal Trade Commission, Connecticut and 31 other states to pay $3.5M USD due to a similar controversy. The company was also committed to changing the way it sells its equipment. In addition, in a besides agreement, the company paid $3.5M USD to the State authorities."

Researchers from a cybersecurity firm published a proof of concept for this unauthorized command execution vulnerability, mentioning that the error persists in the Zoom messaging function; the vulnerability, tracked as **CVE-2018-15715**, has been considered of critical gravity, and has a **CVSS** score of 3.0/9.9. This vulnerability could be exploited if certain scenarios are presented such as: * A malicious Zoom meeting participant * An attacker on the local access network (LAN) * A remote attacker on a wide area network (WAN) could theoretically use this vulnerability to hijack a Zoom meeting in progress Attackers could use this vulnerability to perform otherwise restricted operations at Zoom conferences, said David Wells, a digital forensics specialist. The vulnerability comes from an internal Zoom messaging pump flaw, a mechanism that this application uses to send and wait for messages. This means that a potential attacker, remotely and without authentication, could create and send a **User Datagram Protocol** (UDP) message, and would be interpreted as a reliable transmission Control protocol message used by the authorized Zoom servers. This attack is especially dangerous because it can be done by both the participants of a Zoom conference and a remote attacker capable of creating a counterfeit UDP package, because they can infiltrate without problems in an existing UDP session, find a Zoom conference underway and trigger the attack, the [digital forensics](URL expert mentioned. From that point, the malicious actor could perform various harmful operations, such as hijacking screen controllers, identity spoofing to send or receive messages addressed to other conference participants, or even expelling other participants from the conference. For example, in the proof of concept published by Wells, it was shown how a malicious participant could send UDP packets to take control of a display of the presenter to start his calculator. Exploiting such vulnerability can be extremely damaging and poses a serious risk to a companys reputation, says Wells. Even if a single of the more than 700,000 companies working with Zoom Software were presented, the impact would be significant. This kind of vulnerability is particularly detrimental to a company, as said by specialists in digital forensics. Companies like Cisco and Adobe have also experienced problems with this kind of computer errors in their videoconferencing systems. Just a few days ago, Cisco was correcting a series of flaws in its [WebEx](URL conferencing system that allowed remote code execution.

The company most recently affected by security breaches on ElasticSearch servers is **Sky Brazil**, one of the largest pay television service providers in South America. Fabio Castro, a specialist in [digital forensics](URL in Brazil, said that Sky Brazil left an ElasticSearch server exposed online for about ten days, possibly more. Castro says that at the end of November he discovered the server belonging to Sky Brazil, indexed by **Shodan**, the well-known search tool to track devices connected to the Internet. Although initially the specialist did not know to whom the unprotected server (which could be accessed from two different IP addresses) belonged, when investigating the leaked information it was possible to infer the identity of the owners of the server. The digital forensics specialist mentions that the server stored records and API data that belonged to Sky Brazil. In total, Castro found 28.7 GB of login files and a 429.1 GB of API data. Among the leaked data, the expert mentions, personal information files of over 32 million residential and commercial clients were found. Personal data includes names, addresses and phone numbers, birth dates, billing details, and encrypted passwords, as reported by Castro. Castro mentions that he discovered the server last week, but has reason to believe that it may have been indexed by Shodan since mid-October at least. The specialist reports that he informed the company about this massive leak last week. Although the company has not communicated directly with Castro, he claims that the server was secured on Monday morning, Brazil time. In this way, the company expects to restrict access to this information from external users. In the worst possible scenario, some malicious actor could have gotten the data from Sky Brazil, which could be very useful in online fraudulent campaigns (such as the known [spear phishing](URL attack). As it contains sensitive information of affected users, a campaign of this class is more likely to infect users with malware or obtain more sensitive details, such as login credentials or financial data. This is not the first time that a Brazilian organization leaves an ElasticShare server exposed. A few weeks ago, the Sao Paulo Federation of Industries exposed personal information about 24 million people online. According to experts in digital forensics, the main reason for these massive data leaks is that the administrators of ElasticShare servers do not configure the passwords of their servers, which are later exposed on the Internet, where any user with no specific knowledge can access, copy or download any information stored in cache."

This is not a minor recognition, even PewDiePie fans have designed a campaign known as Bro Army, designed to recruit friends and family members of the Swedish vlogger subscribers, in order to keep him at the top of the video platform. But this dispute has reached new and unthinkable levels. [Digital forensics](URL specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security report that some person or group hacked printers from around the world to print propaganda in favor of PewDiePie.

Through a Twitter account, identified as **TheHackerGiraffe**, the attacker or attackers mentioned some details about this incident: This is how the PewDiePie printer hack happened: * I was bored after playing Destiny for 4 hours in a row and decided I wanted to hack something. So I thought of any vulnerable protocol I could find in Shodan * While playing with [Shodan](URL it occurred to me that I could hack printers from around the world to printed anything * I was horrified to find over 800k vulnerable ports. I chose the first 50k printers I found running on port 9100 and downloaded the list of Shodan * After thinking what message I could print, it occurred to me that it would be best to print a message in support of PewDiePie After I left the script running, I did this Twitter account, other one on Reddit, and I waited for people to find me. According to reports of experts in digital forensics, the hacker used a tool called PRET, a printer exploit rootkit, which, according to GitHub, allows hackers to capture, manipulate, or print jobs to access file systems and device memory, with the possibility of damaging the hardware as well. The hacker claims that he did not act with any malicious purpose, but did so to raise awareness of printer users about how vulnerable these devices can be. People underestimate the ease with which a hacker could exploit these vulnerabilities; I could have stolen files, installed malware or even caused physical damage to any device. The worst thing is that downloading, creating and executing these scripts took me less than half an hour. Experts in digital forensics recommend applying some security measures to prevent this type of attack; properly configuring a firewall, changing the default password or even turning off your device when you do not use it can help you to stay safe from some attack vectors."

This motion is related to a case filed during last summer, for which the **Department of Justice** (DoJ) conceal any related documents. This case deals with the DoJ attempt to obtain a federal court order with which they would have forced Facebook to include a backdoor in Messenger. According to experts in digital forensics, the **FBI** sought to access the voice communications of suspected members of the criminal gang MS-13, active throughout North America. The research agency stated that it already had text messages from members of the gang, but it was impossible to access voice communications via Messenger, because they were protected with encryption. The court did not issue this order, as Facebook took defensive measures, mentioning that complying with this mandate would be virtually impossible for the social network, as it would require investing a huge sum of money and rewriting its messaging application altogether. Now, the ACLU wants an American court to reveal what happened in the secret judicial proceedings surrounding this case. People have to be heard about the laws that govern us, the organization mentioned in the past few days. During the past summer, a legal dispute, which we considered could have affected the private communications of millions of Americans, was completely discussed in secret. According to cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL specialists, the ACLU seeks to establish a legal precedent, forcing the DoJ to publicly disclose this legal process. If successful, DoJ and the FBI will be prevented from trying to force similar legal processes against other companies in the technology and communications industry in the future. This is the second time that the United States is trying to force a technological service provider to implement encryption backdoors in its developments, Apple being the company affected by pressure from the US authorities. However, while the FBI case against Apple was public domain, the Facebook Messenger case was very little known, until some media noticed several legal documents last September. In short, people have the right to monitor the type of surveillance that is implemented in their communications, mention ACLU spokespersons. The ACLUs motion was presented shortly before the US Vice-attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, asked for the implementation of backdoors in widely used technology services again."

This research was carried out by a cybersecurity firm, which analyzed the security incidents raised in the 500 companies with the most revenues in the whole world. One of the main conclusions that this analysis showed is that during the last quarter, the pharmaceutical companies suffered the most [**cyberattacks**](URL averaging 71 malicious campaigns in each company in this sector, which means that the cyberattacks against the drug industry grew 149% over the same period last year. Drug-developing companies are an attractive target for cybercriminals, as they safeguard a large amount of intellectual property on new drugs or compounds. Specialists in [**digital forensics**](URL believe that if an attacker gets access to information about new researches, they will surely find potential buyers in the black market. Speaking of all industrial sectors in general, email fraud campaigns have also been on the rise; according to the investigation, email attack attempts grew 80% for all industrial sectors analyzed compared to the last quarter of 2017. In many cases, malicious actors try to deceive some employees in order to gain access to enterprise networks. According to the research, a common tactic is that hackers spoof the email addresses of a companys managers, trying to trick lower-tier employees into revealing data or even making money transfers. Although it seems a rudimentary form of cyberattack has proved successful, so the practice continues to be presented. According to specialists in digital forensics, many of the biggest data violations began with a simple spoofed message. Behind the pharmaceutical sector, the construction companies were the second most attacked industrial branch, averaging 61 attacks in each organization. Completing the podium are real estate companies, with 54 attacks on average during the last quarter. As for the annual figures, the drug industry is maintained in the first place, averaging 288 attacks per company throughout the 2018. On this occasion, real estate companies are left with second place, averaging 277 attacks in each company throughout the current year. Digital forensics specialists suggest some ways that organizations can protect themselves from cyberattacks, such as training their employees to detect and report malicious emails, as well as having a backup plan in case cyberattack."

Maybe youd like to think twice because, according to cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this would violate policies of the US government. In the past days the **Department of Justice** (DOJ) revealed an indictment before a grand jury against two Iranian hackers, allegedly responsible for the SamSam ransomware campaign. As part of the evidence in this case, the US Department of Treasurys **Office of Foreign Assets Control** (OFAC) presented online cryptocurrency wallet addresses linked to individuals who participated in the conversion of ransomware payments to fiduciary currency. This is the first time that OFAC publicly provides digital currency addresses attributable to individuals subject to criminal prosecution, the Department of Treasury said. In this particular case, the cryptocurrency addresses were linked to the Iranian residents named **Ali Khorashadizadeh** and **Mohammad Ghorbaniyan**, who facilitated the exchange of ransomware payments to the Iranian currency. The addresses attributed to these individuals (**1AjZPMsnmpdK2Rv9KQNfMurTXinscVro9V** and **149w62rY42aZBox8fGcmqNsXUzSStKeq8C**) contain a total of 5 901 Bitcoin. According to the current exchange rate of Bitcoin, this equates to over $23M USD. According to experts in digital forensics, the OFAC has also added both Iranian citizens to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN), which means that American individuals and organizations are prohibited from conducting any kind of transaction with them. This decision could also affect companies and people outside the US. As a result of this sanction, anyone who performs a transaction with Khorashadizadeh and Ghorbaniyan may be subject to secondary penalties, mentions the OFAC announcement. Because of this, if a user was infected ransomware and wants to pay the ransom, they should be very careful not to send money to these Bitcoin addresses. If so, they could face fines much higher than the ransomware payment. This decision also affects the data recovery companies, as well as the negotiators expert in this kind of incidents, since they interact in a constant way with the ransomware developers. Companies that offer response services to this kind of incidents will now need to take the necessary precautions and avoid at all costs any transaction with the individuals designated by the US government in order to avoid fines or any other possible legal consequence. The OFAC has made it clear; any US company that performs a cryptocurrency transfer, no matter the reason, will need to review the OFAC address list, says Bill Siegel, an expert on cybersecurity. Although it continues to be a gray area, paying to recover encrypted files with ransomware has become a common practice in the industry. The Department of Treasury has taken the first step towards a necessary minimum regulatory state. With the increase in ransomware attack cases, companies that offer data recovery services have also grown. However, many experts in [**digital forensics**](URL consider that many of these companies lack the necessary knowledge to recover the encrypted information, limiting themselves to negotiate with the developers of the malware and paying for the ransom requested by the attackers."

The comments of the Department of Justice official were followed by recent criticisms of the US justice system for their actions, as reported by specialists in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security. So far, members of government-supported hacking groups have been considered out-of-bounds in terms of criminal prosecution, and have been given the same protections as intelligence officers and military combatants. Many legal experts argued that these hackers had committed no crime because they simply acted on orders received from superiors running intelligence operations. However, in the most recent years, the United States have decided to break with this unwritten rule among nations with advanced cybersecurity capabilities. The first indictment occurred in 2014, when the United States accused five Chinese hackers, members of Unit 61398 of the third Department of the Peoples Liberation Army of China (PLA) for attacks on a number of US government agencies and private companies. The United States then accused three other hackers in the Asian country in 2017, alleging that they attacked US companies on behalf of the Chinese state under the guise of Boyusec, a Chinese digital forensics company. More recently, in March 2018, the United States accused nine Iranian hackers employed by the Mabna Institute. The DOJ held that the nine hackers carried out their activities on behalf of the body of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard. The following indictment came in July 2018, when the US accused 12 Russian hackers of the attacks on the Democratic Party. The policies of the DOJ have attracted criticism from many sectors, now the institution has decided to respond. There are some who question the US governments approach to dealing with hackers sponsored by other governments, often because many arrests have not been made, said Adam Hickey, Deputy General Attorney of the DOJ National Security Division. It is easy to forget that, until recently, such charges had not been heard, because for a long time this was considered only a problem of intelligence, without considering the disruption and deterrence, which are our objectives in dealing with terrorism, espionage and other threats of national security. But imagine a world in which there are no criminal charges, no formal accusations against these activities. It would be the work of the private sector only to accuse the culprits; what message does this send to foreign hackers? The official argues that these accused hackers have taken intelligence activities to a criminal field. According to specialists in digital forensics, the purpose of the US is for other countries to take similar measures against the criminal computer activities that governments have disguised as intelligence activities."

According to experts in digital forensics, this device would be able to track your movements through every room in your home. However, [Facebook](URL seems to be aware of how difficult it will be to rely on this device. In its advertising campaign, the company focused primarily on privacy and security, emphasizing the decisions that were made to make Portal as safe and less threatening as possible. This includes simple hardware designs, such as a camera cover, which can be closed when not in use, as well as more technical design features such as the inclusion of an artificial intelligence running Portal on the same device, rather of the Facebook Servers. These measures provide more peace of mind about stored data because that means that artificial intelligence is learning on the device instead of collecting data, sending it, analyzing it, and submitting the results to Portal, said Carolina Milanesi, specialist in [digital forensics](URL The specialist believes that Facebook adopts this focus on privacy as part of its marketing campaign, but also shows that it has listened to the demands of its users. The company knows that the confidence of the public has declined, so it will not be easy to sell this product. With Portal It also changes the approach of connecting with other people on Facebook, because now it will focus on connecting users with their closest social circle, instead of sharing their information with a broader network. At this time, Facebook is not in a good place with regard to the confidence of its users, given the latest events said Milanesi. The first reaction will surely be a resounding no, I wont bring this device to my house', considers the specialist. But she also considers that the general public might not be so concerned about the privacy of his information as much as those familiar with the subject, the case of Cambridge Analytica is an example of this behavior. Ultimately, Portal can be a very attractive device for those who enjoy acquiring the most advanced gadgets. According to cybersecurity and digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the revenues generated by the smart speaker market are expected to reach 10 billion dollars for the year 2022, so Facebook does not want to be left behind in this market because of its recent security drawbacks."

SpankChain is an Ethereum-based smart contact that uses Ethereum and a smart token called BOOTY to tip adult models during their online live shows. According to the security report published by SpankChain developers, the attack occurred around 6 PM last Saturday; the attacker would have stolen 165.38 units of Ethereum and immobilized more than 1.2k BOOTY tokens due to an error in his smart payment contract. At 6 PM on Saturday afternoon, an unknown attacker exhausted 165.38 Ethereum (about $38k USD) from our smart payment channel contract, which caused $4k USD in BOOTY tokens to remain immobilized, reports the SpankChain digital forensics teams announcement. Out of the Ethereum units and BOOTY tokens stolen/immobilized, 34.99 Ethereum (about $8k USD) and 1271.88 BOOTY tokens (about $9.3 USD in total), belong to the users, the remainder belongs to SpankChain. This attack was not evident until Sunday at 7 PM, which caused them to disconnect their camera service Spank.live. SpankChain plans to replace the $9.3k USD in Ethereum that were stolen from its users. They also plan to keep their webcam service offline while correcting bugs and updating to a new payment channel contract. **The attack was possible thanks to a reentry flaw** According to the announcement of the SpankChain digital forensics team, in the attack a reentry vulnerability was used to steal the cryptocurrency of the compromised site. A re-entry attack occurs when an attacker is able to repeatedly call a function in the smart contract before the previous functions finish its execution. This allows the attackers to repeatedly withdraw the cryptocurrency before the contract realizes that there is no balance. In other words, the attack capitalized a reentry error, much like the one used in the attack on The DAO, mention the operators of SpankChain. The attacker created a malicious contract masked as an ERC20 token, where the transfer function was executed multiple times to extract the virtual assets from the site. Reports indicate that SpankChain would have opted not to do a security audit in past months, as this would have worth between $30k and $50k USD, considering that the price was too high. This is further proof that there is no price too high to ensure the security of a site compared to the price you have to pay after a cyberattack."

A cybersecurity and digital forensics firm has begun to investigate the reasons behind this significant increase in attacks with cryptocurrency mining software, reporting that, during September this year, the most common malware were the crypto miners, being CoinHive the most used in its kind, just like last year. While Coinhive currently affects 19% of organizations worldwide, researchers also reported that the Dorkbot Trojan remained in second place with a 7% global impact. The report also noted a significant increase in Coinhive attacks against PCs. Also, the attackers used the Coinhive mining malware to target iPhone devices, which coincided with an increase in attacks against users of the Safari browser, used on Apple gadgets. Behind CoinHive and Dorkbot, in the third place in the attack index is Cryptoloot. The operators of both tools request to the sites where they operate a portion of the profits generated by the [cryptojacking](URL Cryptoloot demands a smaller percentage than CoinHive. Cryptocurrency mining continues to be a major threat to global organizations, said Maya Horowitz, a [digital forensics](URL specialist in charge of the investigation, in a press release. The most interesting thing weve noticed is the increase in attacks against iPhone devices and other gadgets that use the Safari browser over the last month. These attacks on Apple devices do not use new features, so we continue to investigate the possible reasons behind this behavior. As the investigators publish their conclusions, these kinds of attacks are a reminder that mobile devices are an element that is often overlooked on the attack surface of an organization, so it is essential that these devices are protected with a comprehensive threat-prevention solution to prevent them from being a weak link in the organizational structure. According to reports of specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the vulnerability known as Microsoft IIS WebDAV ScStoragePathFromUrl Buffer Overflow (**CVE-2017-7269**) has been the most exploited flaw against organizations around the world, with 48% of the attacks on companies in total during the first eight months of 2018."

According to the annual report on the state of privacy and security of a cybersecurity and digital forensics firm, 75% of the employees surveyed present a moderate or serious risk to the data security of their organization, while 85% of the financial-areas workers show a lack of data security and privacy information habits and knowledge. Tom Pendergast, [digital forensics](URL specialist in charge of the investigation, mentions that more than 1,000 employees of companies in the United States were surveyed to quantify the state of privacy and security awareness in 2018. This year, the number of people considered as a risk to the security of their organizations increased considerably with respect to the last report made by the firm last year. Overall, the results show an unsatisfactory trend, as respondents got worse results in all areas compared to the previous year, says Pendergast. Still, I would be really surprised if, in five years, there is no significant improvement. There is growing cultural and business awareness on the need to cover the privacy of information, the expert mentions. The firm based its study on a variety of questions based on real world cases, such as the correct identification of personal information, connection to public WiFi habits, and detection of [phishing](URL emails. From the answers obtained, respondents were divided into three categories of risk: risky, rookie and heroic. Among the main findings of the research are: * Respondents performance was worse this year in all categories that were measured. Respondents qualifications were unsatisfactory in categories like identification of malware, phishing emails and risks in the use of social networks * Managers showed more risky habits than lower posts employees in the categories of malware and malicious emails identification. Only 69% of managers responded correctly, in contrast to 86% of lower-level employees * Out of the seven industrial sectors surveyed, employees in finance areas obtained the lowest scores. 85% showed a worrisome lack of knowledge in cybersecurity and data protection measures * 14% of all surveyed employees cannot identify phishing emails For the digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this 14% of unaware employees is more than enough for hackers to find a way to attack an organization, because a single mistake could let malware enter the structure of a company. Only one person is required to click the wrong place for this threat to enter the organization. If this happens, the information of everyone who works there will be compromised."

On October 4, the Department of Defense (DoD) identified an intrusion into information binding with DoD personnel requiring a notification to Congress, said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Buccino, a Pentagon spokesman, in a statement to various media. The DoD continues to collect additional information about the incident, which implies the possible compromise of this information from DoD personnel guarded by a single commercial provider who provided travel management services to this institution, mentioned Lieutenant Colonel. This supplier administered a small percentage of DoD general travel management Services. The incident, which seems to have affected about 30k military and civilian personnel, resulted in some of the personal information and payment card data being compromised, as reported by [digital forensics](URL experts working on the case. The Pentagon reports that its directors were informed about data breach on October 4, although it is not ruled out that the incident has started months ago. The [Pentagon](URL also reports that it will not appoint the affected provider for security reasons and ongoing contracts. Lieutenant Colonel Buccino mentioned that the DoD has taken steps to terminate the contractual relationship of this company with the US government. This incident has been revealed after the US General Accountability Office (GAO) warned that the DOD was lagging behind the issue of cybersecurity, jeopardizing the proper protection of US weapon controller systems. The GAO has long insisted on information security deficiencies, which have been ignored or minimized in the absence of risk samples in real scenarios. Although the GAO has warned about cyber risks for decades, until recently, the DoD gave no importance to the cybersecurity of weapons systems, the GAO said in a statement. Digital forensics experts believe that the problem in general is a poor approach to the systems password security. Several weapons systems used commercial or open source software, but never changed the default password, allowing GAO researchers to search the Internet password and gain administrator privileges, says the GAO. Still, American military and intelligence agencies are not completely sure about how easy it would be for hackers to attack these systems in a real scenario. The authors of the GAO report have been unable to distinguish between exploitable remotely and exploitable from the Internet, those are two different things, considers Jake Williams, an information security consultant."

[NotPetya](URL was unleashed in June of last year, and at first it was believed to be another global ransomware attack, similar to the WannaCry outbreak, but it turned out to be a wiper disguised as ransomware. While this malware has ransomware components, NotPetya cannot decrypt victims files, even if the ransom payment is made. NotPetya claimed thousands of victims around the world, including top-profile companies in its areas, critical infrastructure providers and financial services organizations, attacking giants such as the pharmaceutical company Merck, or Maersk, the most important shipping company in the world. According to Anton Cherepanov and Robert Lipovsky, experts in [digital forensics](URL the malware BlackEnergy, responsible for the blackouts of 2015 in Ukraine, contains the same component of KillDisk encryption seen in the malware NotPetya, which is a Telebots trading mark. In the final stage of their attacks, the Telebots group always used KillDisk malware to overwrite files with specific file extensions on victims storage units, the experts reported. They also discovered that the outbreak began to spread from companies hit by a backdoor of Telebots, after compromising financial software M.E.Doc, widely used in Ukraine. On the other hand, Industroyer was the code used in the attacks against the Ukrainian electricity grid in December 2016. Both Industroyer and BlackEnergy attacked the same Ukrainian networks. There was no strong evidence linking the two codes with the same APT until the researchers discovered important similarities in the code, linking with Telebots through the analysis of a recent backdoor. In fact, the most recently malware developed by Telebots, called Win32/Exaramel, appears to be an improved version of the backdoor Industroyer. It was detected while attacking an organization in Ukraine, extracting information. Win32/Exaramel copies files, automatically compresses and encrypts them and sends them to the command and control server (C2). Analyzed in detail, the Code of WIN32/Exaramel shows the close relation that it saves with Industroyer. For one, the backdoor Win32/Exaramel is initially implemented thanks to a dropper, which starts a Windows service called Wsmprovav , with the description Windows Check AV. The attackers are grouping their potential victims according to the security solutions they use, the investigators said in a safety notice. Similar behavior can be found in the Industroyer toolset, specifically, some of Industroyers backdoors also disguised themselves as an AV-related service, implemented with the name Avtask.exe, and the same grouping was used. Although researchers preferred not to say that these attacks are financed by some government, digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that these attacks could be attributable to the Russian intelligence agencies."

Investigators from a cybersecurity firm reported the discovery of different communications in dark web offering a lot of voter databases last Monday, including personal identifying information and [voting history](URL of people who have participated in elections. This represents the first incident of voter registration data for sale in hacking communities this 2018, as reported by experts in [digital forensics](URL The discovery takes place weeks before the midterm elections in the United States, to be held in next November. With the mid-term elections of November 2018 to only four weeks, malicious actors could use the availability and validity of voter registrations, if combined with other possibly compromised data, to disrupt the electoral process or carry out a large-scale identity theft, the investigators mentioned. Given the demand from illicit suppliers for weekly updates of voter registrations and their high reputation in hacking forums, we evaluated with moderate confidence that attackers could have permanent access to databases and/or contact with Government officials in the states where this occurs. The investigators did not explicitly name the hacking forum where they found this information. This incident affects 19 states; 23 million of total records on sale cover only three of the 19 affected territories. The affected states are Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. According to researchers, voter list prices range from $150 to $12k USD, depending on the state where the database came from. These prices may be related to the number of voter registrations found in each database. Records contain voter data, including full name, phone numbers, physical addresses, voting history, and other unspecified data related to previous electoral processes. We estimate that all content reported could exceed 35 million records, the researchers mentioned. According to reports of experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, a high profile actor is organizing a crowd funding campaign to buy each of these databases. It is believed that, after the purchase, the databases will be made available to the members of the hacking forum, with early access for those who invested in the crowd funding The US authorities concern about voter data security continues to grow as the day of the vote approaches."
468,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Vulnerability in voting machines has not been corrected after 11 years,1,9qfsdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9qfsdp/vulnerability_in_voting_machines_has_not_been/,2018-10-23 04:07:16," **No measure has been taken to solve this flaw** We all prefer to think that the voting systems in our countries are efficient and that the votes counting are always accurate. Whether the vote is issued through a paper ballot or even electronically, there must be some confidence measure involved in the process. But what would happen if we could no longer have confidence in the way in which peoples votes are counted? Would that change the way we see the whole process? It is normal to think that the government would do anything as long as these electoral processes are carried out without security drawbacks. The worrying thing is that apparently thats not the case. It turns out that experts in digital forensics have reported the existence of a serious vulnerability affecting [voting machines](URL even worse, its existence was reported 11 years ago and nothing has yet been done to correct it. The problem affects the M650 high-speed ballot scanner, which is made by Election Systems &amp; Software and is used in 23 out of the 50 American states. The disturbing findings were summarized by digital forensics specialists in the most recent DEF CON in Las Vegas. These machines can be hacked with an infected removable Zip drive that could transmit malware. The machines also have a built-in network port that can also be used to transmit an infection. According to researchers, the M650 scanner counts ballots for entire counties, which means that if the device is compromised, the attack could easily impact an election. This leads us to ask why no one has done anything to fix this flaw if it was reported since 2007. **M650 is not the only security concern** In many ways, this machine, which scans about 3000 ballots per minute, is a symbol of what is considered an obsolete electoral infrastructure. For many reasons, the technology used to count the votes has not kept pace with current cybersecurity demands. Election Systems &amp; Software, manufacturer of the M650, believes that its security protections are strong enough for hacking these devices to be very difficult, especially in a real world environment. Being questioned about why this vulnerability has not been corrected after so long, the company did not make any statement, although they recently stopped announcing this team on their website. Still, [digital forensics](URL experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that these types of problems will not disappear soon, because this vulnerability is not the only or the most serious security problem of the current electronic voting infrastructure. In the meantime, the voters will be compromised until someone does something. Touchscreen voting machines have been shown to be vulnerable previously, and now the ballot scanning machines seem to be vulnerable too."

Most of the attacks were carried out by hostile foreign states, according to the figures revealed by the [National Cyber Security Centre](URL (NCSC). Since it was set up in 2016, the NCSC, which is part of the UK intelligence agency (GCHQ), has worked to stop an average of more than 10 attacks per week. The NCSC is denouncing a series of unacceptable behaviors by hostile States, also has established communication with companies throughout the British territory to inform them about the best security measures to protect themselves from these attacks, said Ciaran Martin, executive director of the NCSC. In the same way we are improving our critical systems. We are helping to make the use of the Internet safer automatically. According to the experts in [digital forensics](URL of the NCSC, many of the cyberattacks targeting the United Kingdom were the work of the Russian intelligence agency, known as GRU. The cybersecurity agency found that the attacks commanded by GRU included attempts to undermine the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), disruption of transport systems in Ukraine and destabilize countries with democratic systems and even some private companies. NCSC annual report, recently published, provides for the first time details of the tactics used by its incident management team, which works behind the scenes to coordinate defenses against cybersecurity incidents in the UK. The agency said that its efforts reduced by more than half the UK score in the global phishing attack index, a method widely used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to various computer systems, making it come down from 5.3% to 2.4%. The Active Cyber Defense Initiative (ACD), which aims to protect the UK from massive hacking attacks, has eliminated over 138k phishing sites hosted on British networks between September 2017 and August 2018. The NCSC collaborates with the industry to meet its goals. A conference of government professionals and cybersecurity industry in Glasgow will be held next year to talk about best practices in the field. Jeremy Fleming, director of GCHQ, said the NCSC has become a leading organization in the world in just two years, and is the first line of defense to thwart the growing cyber menace of hostile States. The NCSC was inaugurated in October 2016 as part of the British governments national cyber security strategy, with a budget of 1.9 billion, aiming to improve the UKs cybernetic panorama and address the gap in cyber security capabilities of the country, report experts in digital forensics. The agency manages the national cybersecurity incidents, performs threat analysis in real time and provides advice to different sectors of industry and government."
470,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,The Pentagon is looking for new talents in IT,1,9r1755,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9r1755/the_pentagon_is_looking_for_new_talents_in_it/,2018-10-25 03:28:10," **The Department of Defense is testing new methods for recruiting young professionals in technological areas** Like many federal agencies, the Department of Defense (DoD) is struggling to attract, recruit and retain young and talented employees in the IT field. Data from the Office of Personnel Administration indicate that the DoD has approximately 6.6 professionals in it with over 60 years old for each employee under 30 years old, as reported by digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security. These figures increase the complexity of the national security challenges the [Pentagon](URL is facing, which is now trying to keep pace with China and Russia, as well as securing its dominance in the global IT field. Reversing this trend will not happen by act of magic, and the Pentagons chief technology officer, Dana Deasy, is addressing the challenge directly. Our biggest challenges within the DoD are complex and amazing, and we need creative people who want to work in this complex and amazing world, said Dana Deasy last Monday at a cybersecurity event. In principle, the Pentagon has begun to follow up young talent in IT, in a system similar to that used by university recruiters to youth athletes, rather than the traditional method of hiring staff used by the government. University recruiters do not issue press releases, write job descriptions, and wait patiently for someone to occupy their vacancies. Instead of doing so, Deasy said, they invite the best high school players to the campus, show them the facilities and meet with former players who have become professionals. During the summer, Deasy said she has received students from the University of Virginia on a specific career day for issues such as cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL The students spent the day touring the NSA, CIA, Secret Service and Pentagon facilities in what Deasy called real-time recruitment. The main goal, consider Deasy, is that the outstanding college students are attracted to government work, and consider it as an option as much as working for companies like Google or Amazon. It is believed that pay is the main problem that government agencies have to compete for technological talent with the private sector. In certain fields, such as cybersecurity and digital forensics, a prominent professional aspires to earn two or three times more money by working for a private company than for a federal agency, although some professionals also consider factors such as policies, values and mission of an organization before accepting a job. Successful companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google are promoted among young people as interesting and innovative places to work, where they can make a difference. These types of companies pay well, but they are also known to the vast majority of young people, even without real interest in technology, mentions the official. Some government agencies, like the Peace Corps, have discovered how to promote themselves successfully among young people. The Peace Corps relates to high school and university students in person and through social networks, plus it has a very high recruitment rate despite offering lower salaries. The Peace Corps Twitter page, with 1.5 million followers, is filled with thousands of photos of recruits making a difference around the world. Few government agencies are marketed on such a successful scale, but Deasy believes the Pentagon is taking small steps in that direction."

Vulnerabilities can be combined to allow an attacker full control over one of these devices, which gives the hacker the ability to alter the firmware, steal chat records, images or even access video live feeds. Vecna has already launched security updates for two of the five [vulnerabilities](URL and is in the process of addressing the remaining three errors. Vulnerabilities have been reported as: * CVE-2018-8858: Credentials protection deficiencies  patch pending * CVE-2018-17931: Inadequate access control (USB)  patch pending * CVE-2018-17933: Incorrect authorization (XMPP client)  patch pending * CVE-2018-8860: Confidential information leaking  firmware updated * CVE-2018-8866: Remote Code Execution  solved The flaws were discovered earlier this year by Dan Regalado, a cybersecurity and digital forensics specialist. Vulnerabilities affect Vecna VGo Celia, a telepresence robot that can be deployed in some certain space but controlled from a remote location. Telepresence robots are equipped with a microphone and a video camera and are placed on mobile platforms. Its use is very common in hospitals to allow doctors to remotely monitor patients, in schools, to allow sick children to attend classes or for teachers to teach remotely, or in factories to allow technical inspections for authorized personnel. Because the robot performs firmware updates via HTTP, an attacker with access to the same network segment where the robot is connected can intercept the update, said the digital forensics expert in his report on the subject. An attacker could infect the firmware with malicious code or analyze it for vulnerabilities that could be exploited later. Regalado discovered that the developers of Vecna had left an active developer tool in the robot that renders it vulnerable to a lot of attacks. This tool, a CGI script, allowed the attacker to execute commands with root privileges on the device. The expert says the attacker can use this vulnerability to access the internal functions of the robot, but could also use the infected robot to attack other devices on an organizations internal network. Vecna has already solved the vulnerabilities CVE-2018-8860 and CVE-2018-8866, but Regalado says that there is another equally serious error. It says that the CVE-2018-17931 error allows an attacker to connect a USB drive in a robot and its firmware will run a file hosted on the USB drive (/config/startup.script) with root privileges, which gives the attacker the opportunity to hijack the device. Regalado also discovered CVE-2018-8858. This vulnerability allows an attacker to retrieve the WiFi passwords used by the robot to connect to an organizations internal network. CVE-2018-17933, the last of the three unsolved vulnerabilities, resides in the XMPP client, which is the heart of the robot firmware, which functions as a tunnel between the remote user and the internal functions of the robot."
472,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Hackers have their eyes on keyless cars,1,9rbve4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9rbve4/hackers_have_their_eyes_on_keyless_cars/,2018-10-26 03:30:42," **These are the most common ways a cybercriminal can compromise a connected car** Opening a car without needing to use a key may seem very convenient, but experts in digital forensics believe that it may not be a completely safe feature. There are more and more of these cars in circulation, which has also provoked the growth of an unusual practice, the key fob hacking. With the help of very economical and easy-to-find technology and electronic accessories, the signal from these key fobs can be intercepted or blocked relatively easily. Just imagine, a thief opens your car and takes it without firing any alarms, a truly alarming scenario. According to FBI reports, car theft cases have entered a downward spiral since 1991, when they showed their highest peaks. However, these figures have been moving slowly, but steadily, since 2015. In fact, there was an increase of 3.8% in car theft cases in 2015, an increase of 7.4% in 2016 and another increase of 4.1% just in the first half of 2017. To fight this upward trend and prevent your car from becoming a more statistic in car theft, awareness on this issue is a fundamental element. So, to be better prepared against this new criminal wave, [digital forensics](URL experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security report on the main methods for hacking the system of a keyless car: **The relay** Keeping your key fob on always represents a serious threat for your cars safety. As long as the keys are within range of the signal, anyone can open the car and the system will think it is the owner. Thats why newer car models will not unlock until the key fob is one foot away at least. However, criminals can get relatively cheap relay boxes that capture key fob signals up to 300 feet away and then transmit them to the victims car. This is how it works: A thief gets up close to your car with the relay box, while an accomplice scans your home with another device as well. When the key fob signal is captured, it is transmitted to the relay box closest to your car, so the vehicle will open. In other words, your keys could be in your house and the criminals could walk to your car and open it. This is not just a hypothesis, since multiple cases have already been presented. According to German Automotive Club, the car models most vulnerable to this attack are: **Audi:** A3, A4, A6 **BMW:** 730d **Citroen:** DS4 CrossBack **Ford:** Galaxy, Eco-Sport **Honda:** HR-V **Hyundai:** Santa Fe CRDi **Kia:** Optima **Lexus:** RX 450h **Mazda:** CX-5 **Mini:** Clubman **Mitsubishi:** Outlander **Nissan:** Qashqai, Leaf **Vauxhall:** Ampera **Range Rover:** Evoque **Renault:** Traffic **Ssangyong:** Tivoli XDi **Subaru:** Levorg **Toyota:** Rav4 **Volkswagen:** Golf GTD, Touran 5T &amp;#x200B; **Remote interference** In this scenario, criminals will block your signal, so when you issue a lock command from your key fob, it will not reach your car and the doors will remain unlocked, so the thieves have free access to your car. Security advice: To prevent this from happening, always check your cars doors manually before moving away. You can also install a steer lock to prevent car thieves from driving the vehicle, even if they already got in. &amp;#x200B; **Tire pressure sensor hijacking** This is a recent technique, but it has already been put into action: criminals hijack their tire sensors to send false readings on tire pressure. What do they look for? This way they can force the driver to stop their car, thus generating the conditions to attack them. It sounds a little crazy, but this scheme is being put into practice. Security advice: If you need to check your tires, always stop in a public, well-lightened, crowded area, preferably at a service station or in a workshop where you can ask for help. &amp;#x200B; **Telematic Exploit** One of the most recent words related to these cars is something called telematics. What is telematics? It is a connected system that can remotely monitor the behavior of your vehicle. These data may include your cars location, speed, mileage, tire pressure, fuel usage, braking, engine and battery status, driver behavior, and more. But everything that is connected to the Internet is vulnerable and exploitable, telematics is no exception. If hackers manage to intercept your connection, they can track your vehicle and even remotely control it, a frightening possibility. Security advice: Before purchasing a car with a built-in telematic system, consult an information security and digital forensics expert about the cybersecurity measures required by a car connected to the Internet. If your car has this system, make sure the software is always updated. &amp;#x200B; **Network attacks** In addition to the possibility of compromising a car through telematics, hackers can also generate denial-of-service conditions to attack your car and potentially collapse critical functions such as airbags, manual brakes and door locks. Since some connected cars even have built-in WiFi features, this attack is completely feasible. Just like conventional WiFi networks, they can even steal your personal data if they manage to infiltrate your cars local network. Besides, its a matter of physical security. Remember, modern cars are handled basically by multiple computers and engine control modules (ECM) and if a hacker manages to shut down these systems, your physical integrity would be in serious danger. Security advice: It is strictly mandatory to change your cars WiFi network password in a regular basis. &amp;#x200B; **On-board diagnostic Hack (OBD)** Did you know that virtually all cars have a diagnostic port on board? Commonly known as OBD, this is an interface that allows mechanics to access your cars data to read error codes, statistics and even program new keys. It turns out that anyone can buy exploit kits that use this port to replicate keys and program new ones to use in the theft of other vehicles. Thats something no one will want to experience for themselves. Security advice: Always go with a reliable mechanic. In addition, manually locking the steering wheel always helps. &amp;#x200B; **Phishing in the car** This old-school attack is also opening its way to attacking cars connected to the Internet, specifically the models with integrated browser. Thats right; hackers use the classic phishing scheme to send emails and messages with malicious links and attached files that can install [malware](URL on your cars system. As usual, once the malware is installed, anything could happen. Even worse, car systems do not have built-in malware protections, so it can be difficult to detect. Security advice: Always keep the best practices in computer security, even in your car. Never open emails or suspicious messages, or follow links from unknown sources. &amp;#x200B; **What about car insurance?** Unfortunately, the increase in car theft not only raises the risk for your keyless car, but it can also raise insurance rates. If you have a keyless car, check your cars safety and see if it is covered against such incidents. Since these crimes are relatively new, there may be some confusion as to who should be held responsible for one of these crimes; will it be the driver, manufacturer or developer of the car software? According to a specialized firm, most car insurance policies have already solved this scenario: * Drivers have an insurance policy that covers manual and self-driving modes * If the driver of a self-driving vehicle inflicts injury or damages to a third party, this third party may claim the drivers car insurance no matter what driving mode the car was in when the accident occurred. * Here is the part that covers car theft due to key fob hacking and wireless devices. Apparently, drivers will not be responsible for flaws and vulnerabilities in their car systems and may file a claim if they are injured or have suffered losses due to such errors In reference to the theft and hacking of cars using the relay box, the firm said that insurance companies will pay while the owner has taken reasonable measures to protect their vehicle. However, if your particular car model is a common theft target, insurance companies could charge higher premiums. &amp;#x200B; **To stop relay attacks** It is important to have the best possible protection against these new car crimes. There are some very easy ways to block key fob attacks. You can purchase a signal lock bag that to store the key fob, such as a shielded RFID lock bag, as reported by experts in [digital forensics](URL &amp;#x200B; **The refrigerator could work** If you dont want to spend money, you can put your key fob in the refrigerator or freezer. The multiple layers of metal block the signal from your key fob. Just consult with the manufacturer of the device to ensure that the low temperatures do not damage your key fob. &amp;#x200B; **Even the microwave is a good choice** If you do not want to freeze your key fob, digital forensics experts recommend storing it in the microwave oven (just remember not to turn it on). Keep your key fob in the microwave and criminals will not be able to catch its signal. &amp;#x200B; **Wrap your key fob in foil** Since the metal blocks the signal from your key fob, you can also wrap it in foil. While that is the easiest solution, it could also be inadequate if it is not done well. Also, you may have to buy rolls and rolls of paper. You can also make a box lined with aluminum foil to store your keys, if you are in the mood to do crafts."

The company mentions that its policies are always clear about how the developers are enabled to handle the data, and that the investigations carried out by external organizations have made some mistakes, like confusing some ordinary functions in apps with user data access permissions. If an application violates our access to personal data policy, we take action immediately, Google said in a statement. Many free applications track the behavior of their users through many different digital services, allowing developers to create detailed profiles of people using the application. According to [digital forensics](URL specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, these data may include age, sex, location and information about other applications on a smartphone. Data can be used for a number of purposes, including targeted advertising, credit scoring, or specially-designed political campaign messages, researchers mentioned. Revenues from online advertising are estimated to exceed $59 billion USD per year in the United States alone. Many people are unaware of how the data they share in applications comes at the hands of advertising entrepreneurs, data brokers and other organizations, says Nigel Shadbolt, who is in charge of the research. Business people are desperate to reach as many views and clicks as possible that there is not the slightest notion of control. The data tended to focus on large companies and their subsidiaries. Digital forensics experts found that more than 88% of free applications in Google Play shared information with Alphabet-owned companies. In addition, nearly 43% of applications share data with Facebook, while significant percentages share data with Twitter, Verizon, Microsoft, and Amazon. Researchers also found news applications, and applications targeted at children, who share information with large corporations. On the other hand, Google mentions: Google and Google Play have clear policies and guidelines on how third-party developers and applications can handle user data; we require developers to be clear and request the explicit consent of the user to share their data. If an application violates our policies, we act immediately. The company added that it did not agree with the methodology used during this investigation. This research misunderstands some ordinary functional services in applications, such as error reporting and analysis, and how applications share data to deliver those services, Google said. However, activist Frederike Kaltheuner, from Privacy International, said it has become impossible for the average user to understand how their data is used, limiting their ability to decide what information they want to share to use the services of a mobile application. Companies monitor people, use the collected data to make a profile and then reach people in a way that most of us would find intrusive and very surprising, he said. This is no longer about the need to collect data to show relevant ads for the user, it is about maximizing the benefit of companies at the expense of violating peoples fundamental rights, added Kaltheuner."

People worry about thinking that their smart speakers or security systems in their homes are compromised, because compromising any of these services could cause serious consequences for anyone. However, the consequences could be much worse if hackers focus their efforts on attacking medical infrastructure. Medical devices are widely used; in addition, this market shows expected growth of 3% annual, at least until 2022. Specialists in ethical hacking and digital forensics have contacted the manufacturers of these devices after exposing the vulnerabilities in their products. Historically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have remained neutral about the role these professionals should play in exposing the weak points of technology in the health sector. But this is changing as the agency reports that it is collaborating with ethical hackers and using the research that professionals develop to design their policies. A recent example is a pacemaker manufactured by Medtronic. Billy Rios and Jonathan Butts, two cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL investigators, found a vulnerability that would allow a hacker to change the device settings remotely, potentially causing serious consequences. The FDA and Medtronic issued safety alerts on pacemakers. In addition, Medtronic stopped issuing updates for these devices until an effective way to fix the problem was found. However, the company stated that it was not possible to manipulate the devices remotely. It also said that the vulnerability was under control and that it was not a threat to the patient. The two ethical hackers continued to work with Medtronic for months, and then presented their research to the FDA, which continued with their own analysis. The FDA said its research coincided with that of cybersecurity experts, forcing Medtronic to admit that vulnerability could affect patients if it was not resolved. Such progress emphasizes why the FDAs collaboration with ethical hackers could be as beneficial to both the technological community and consumers. In short, the researchers tried for months to get the manufacturer to take their research seriously, without success. It was the FDAs intervention which helped the company recognizes the severity of the incident. If such partnerships continue to occur, patients could access safer products, as ethical hackers gain greater recognition for their research. **Thinking ahead** Apparently this will not be the only case of collaboration between the FDA and ethical hackers. According to Jeff Shuren, an FDA official, there is awareness of the crucial role that cybersecurity researchers play in monitoring medical devices security. Shuren also noted that the FDA encourages manufacturers to rely on ethical hackers, especially if companies do not have an area of specialists in the field to correct possible failures in their products before they are released to market. According to reports from the International Institute of Cyber Security, some other ways to manipulate medical devices include altering their functioning or reporting incorrect readings that could influence a patients treatment or diagnosis. Hackers could also make diagnostic equipment, like magnetic resonance machines, collapse."

Under this new regulatory framework, companies and entities that provide blockchain-based information services operating in China will have to ask users to register their real names and ID card numbers, censor content considered a threat to national security and store user data to allow official inspections. Chinese Cyberspace Administration issued the draft law on its website last Friday for public consultation until November 2. It is not yet defined when this new regulation will enter into force. According to experts in digital forensics, the new regulation arrives after an activist published an open letter about a supposed cover-up of sexual harassment in an important university over 20 years ago in the Ethereum blockchain, after the post was censored on platforms such as WeChat and Weibo. The activist attached the letter to an Ethereum transaction directed towards him, something similar to leaving a bank receipt. But as all transaction logs are public in Ethereum, any user was able to access the letter. A fundamental issue that this new regulation does not address is that blockchain is a technology in which data cannot be changed or erased, which conflicts with Chinese laws, says Xu Kai, a Beijing-based lawyer. The new rules also lack application procedures to protect the rights of blockchain platforms, Xu said. Blockchain-based social network platforms generally allow users to post anonymously, without an outside entity controlling their data. A popular example is the startup of Steemit in the United States, where users can get exchangeable tokens to publish, discover, and comment on others content. There is still no similar emerging service in China. Matters, a Chinese version of Reddit based on blockchain, for now is only available upon invitation in a trial version. China has already implemented laws that require real-name logging to use online services, from social networking apps to online discussion forums. The latest rules aimed at blockchain media platforms are in line with existing legislation, in force after Beijing implemented its comprehensive cybersecurity law in 2017 that has generated concerns among information security and [digital forensics](URL experts about users privacy. This new set of regulations gives the Chinese authorities the power to enter the facilities of any company that provides Internet services and inspect and copy data relevant to cybersecurity. Last September, Chinas central bank issued a decree prohibiting transactions with virtual assets and crowd funding campaigns involving digital tokens. Last August, the main Internet control agency closed numerous blockchain and cryptocurrency news accounts from the WeChat app, alleging regulations on online content providers."
476,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,A jQuery plugin has been exploitable for 8 years,1,9rmi7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9rmi7c/a_jquery_plugin_has_been_exploitable_for_8_years/,2018-10-27 03:57:04," **Different ways of exploiting the flaw have been widely spread too** Out of the thousands of plugins for the [jQuery](URL framework, one of the most popular has hosted for at least three years an oversight in the code that remained hidden for the cybersecurity and digital forensics community, despite the availability of tutorials explaining how it could be exploited. The vulnerability affects the jQuery File Upload widget, widely used, and allows an attacker to load arbitrary files on web servers, including shell commands to send commands. Security Update enabled vulnerability 8 years ago Larry Cashdollar, a digital forensics expert, found the flaw by analyzing the widgets code and was able to load a web shell and execute commands on a test server that he set up. Along with Sebastian Tschan, the plugin developer, the investigator discovered that the flaw was caused by a change introduced in Apache 2.3.9, which deactivated by default the .htaccess files that stored the security settings related to the folder. Unless the administrator had enabled it manually, the .htaccess files were omitted. One reason for this was to protect the administrator system configuration by preventing users from customizing security settings in individual folders. Another reason is to improve performance, because the server no longer had to check the .htaccess file when accessing a directory. After Apache 2.3.9., plugins that use .htaccess files to impose access restrictions no longer benefit from the custom folder access security settings. This was also the case with jQuery File Upload, which adds files to a root directory. Tracked as CVE-2018-9206, the encoding vulnerability is no longer present in the latest version of jQuery File Upload. [Digital forensics](URL experts changed the code to allow only the types of GIF, JPG, JPEG, and PNG image files by default. Tschan provided instructions on how to enable more content without running security risks. **The flaw spread to other projects** The popularity of jQuery File Upload provoked thousands of derivative projects; many of them used the defective code. There are over 7.8k variations at this time, and Cashdollar says there are cases where vulnerabilities are present, even if the original code was modified to meet custom needs. The investigator came to this conclusion after reviewing some of the forks, where he noticed three common variations. Later he created a proof of concept of the exploit trying to find one of the differences and to load a PHP shell. Ive done some tests with the 1000 branches of the original code and it seems that only 36 were vulnerability-free. I found that they only needed a small modification in the exploit to work in most cases, says Cashdollar. jQuery File Upload has remained vulnerable since the launch of Apache 2.3.9., eight years ago. On the other hand, this flaw did not go unnoticed all this time; moreover, the method to exploit it has been widely disseminated for at least three years. A 2015 video, even available on Youtube, details the instructions on how to find vulnerable websites and how to modify them. More recent vulnerability videos are also available."

The West Haven authorities mentioned that their offices were victims of a [ransomware](URL attack originated from outside the United States, according to the investigation conducted by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). According to Mayor Nancy Rossi, the attack, held on Tuesday of last week, disabled 23 servers, after which the officials decided to pay the amount requested by the attackers to unlock the servers. The payment was made in Bitcoin. The attack occurred between 2:49 p.m. and 3:16 a.m. last Tuesday, said the mayor in a statement. Our IT manager, David W. Richards, notified the city hall, the local police and the federal authorities. Rossi added, Restoring data from one of our critical systems occurred shortly after the transaction was complete. Last week a similar incident arose against the Onslow Water and Sewerage Authority (ONWASA). The attack, which occurred last week, was perpetrated using a sophisticated ransomware, limiting the capabilities of the institutions computer systems, as reported by experts in [digital forensics](URL Unlike the attack on West Haven, this time the authorities chose not to pay the ransom demanded. ONWASA mentioned that an email from hackers was received, who are also believed to be located outside the United States. The office didnt mention the ransom fee, but they decided not to pay it. Instead, a team of local, state, and federal agencies is cooperating to restore the attacked systems, according to company reports. Often, ransomware is used to cover up other criminal activities. For example, attackers can use the attack as a distraction to make copies of the encrypted data. A cybercriminal could also open a backdoor in the attacked system. According to the two recently attacked organizations, their data is not compromised. These two incidents seem to show an increase in cyber actions against municipal structures. On October 17, the city of Muscatine, Iowa, reported that its financial servers were attacked with ransomware; the scarce details available include that the citys IT staff is trying to isolate the compromised servers and restore their operations. In addition, the Indiana National Guard said that a server with sensitive information from civilian and military personnel had been encrypted with ransomware. **Pay or not to pay the ransom?** The decision to pay or not to pay has to do with individual circumstances. Any organization, private or public, needs to evaluate and determine its ability to resolve such incidents, says Thomas Pore, an information security expert. How much does it cost an organization to interrupt its operations for a ransomware attack? Understanding the real impact of the attack will help decision makers to implement strategic solutions to overcome incidents like this, he says. Ransomware victims must refrain from making any payments unless it is a life or death situation, considers Joseph Carson, a digital forensics expert. Paying this cybercriminals will only enrich them and encourage the development of more advanced malicious tools. Moreover, the lack of backup also affects organizations. Digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that paying for the release of encrypted files with ransomware is a risky bet, as there is no guarantee that the cybercriminals will restore the compromised files or systems once the payment is made, so it is best to prevent such attacks as far as possible, making the members of the organizations aware of cybersecurity risks and creating backups of their sensitive information."

Now, it has been revealed that the petrochemical plants in Saudi Arabia have become the new target of these cybercriminal groups, who are thought to have national states supporting their operations against other countries. Hackers reportedly responsible for sabotaging a Saudi petrochemical plant in 2017 through a malware infection were supported by the Russian government. It should be noted that last year, the industrial control system installed in the oil and gas facilities of Saudi Arabia was attacked with malware. A cybersecurity and digital forensics firm had been investigating the attack on Saudi Arabias National Industrialization Company since December 17. In its latest report, the firm revealed that this malware, known as Trisis or Triton, was a very advanced tool and could have generated a critical security situation at the plant. It was also reported that the malware attack was part of a research operation conducted by the Russian technical research centre, the Central Scientific Research Institute of Chemistry and Mechanics (CNIIHM) in Moscow. The operation was carried out under the code name TEMP.Veles and the attack with the malware Triton was launched against the oil and gas facilities of Saudi Arabia in the framework of this program. It should be noted that the Triton malware was developed to sabotage the industrial control systems manufactured by Schneider Electric. These systems are generally implemented in oil and gas installations. The investigation reveals that the hackers behind TEMP operation managed to infiltrate the systems of the Saudi organization, injecting them with malware that was finally distributed throughout the network. Subsequently, they were able to install and run the Triton malware to cause considerable physical damage to the systems by shutting down the plants security controls. The firm that conducted the investigation also shared evidence suggesting the involvement of the Russian government in the attack. It was reported that the IP address used by malicious actors was linked to the CNIIHM, while records also showed that the main TEMP.Veles operations were held during Russias standard business hours. In addition, most of the initial development and testing of malware is linked to an unidentified person working in CNIIHM at the time of Triton development. According to the researchers, multiple unique tools were deployed in the target environment. Some of the same tools were evaluated in a single-user malware testing environment. While we know that TEMP.Veles implemented Tritons attack framework, we have no specific evidence to prove that CNIIHM developed or not this malware. The experts dismiss the participation of an internal agent of the company in this particular attack, stating that the scope and extent of the operation is such that it could not have been successful without the participation of an institution. However, it is unlikely that Russia will award the authorship of these attacks; as considered by experts in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security. Globally, Russia has not faced any major reactions despite being indicted more than once for launching malware attacks on public and private organizations in many countries."

Cathay Pacific announced this Wednesday night that a wide range of data, including passenger names, birth dates, phone numbers, email addresses and passport numbers, were exposed after their information systems were hacked earlier this year. We regret any concern that this security incident could cause our passengers, said Rupert Hogg, airline CEO, in a statement. The Hong Kong-based company is in the process of contacting all the people affected by data theft, he added. This is the latest security breach that has hit a major international airline after the scandal aroused in [British Airways](URL when a group of hackers, allegedly Magecart, hacked the website and mobile application of British Airways, stealing information from hundreds of thousands of users. Hackers who attacked Cathay Pacific gained access to 27 credit card numbers, but without the respective card security codes, plus another 403 credit card numbers overdue, according to reports from experts in digital forensics. The airline reports that there is still no evidence that the customers personal data has been misused, adding that the passwords of the compromised cards were not put at risk at any time. Cathay Pacific reports that it discovered evidence of suspicious activity on its network last March and that it took immediate steps to contain the event and investigate it with the help of a cybersecurity firm. The airline confirmed last May that the personal data had been compromised and has since then, its been analyzing the data to identify the affected passengers. Cathay Pacific shares fell by more than 5% in morning operations on the Hong Kong stock exchange, a few hours after the security breach was announced. The company has notified the authorities in Hong Kong, and has also created a website dedicated to solving questions about the incident (infosecurity.cathaypacific.com) in addition to enabling a call center to help its customers to verify the security status of their information. The airline said the content of the information accessed by hackers varies from passenger to passenger. This information includes approximately 860k passport numbers and 245k numbers of Hong Kong identity cards. This year, Cathay Pacific was ranked as the sixth best airline in the world by Skytrax, a London-based company that provides consultancy services for carriers and airports. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL the company could face legal actions for deficiencies in the protection of personal information, as was the case with British Airways. Last September, just hours after the airline security incident was revealed, a British law firm announced that it would launch a collective legal action for 500 million pounds against British Airways, calculating that each person affected by the incident could claim up to 1 250 pounds in compensation.

The bug (not yet assigned CVE code, as it has just been discovered) is a privilege escalation zero-day vulnerability in Microsoft Data Sharing Services (dssvc. dll). This is a local service that runs as a LocalSystem account with broad privileges, and allows data to be distributed between applications. According to the expert who published the proof of concept, the error allows malicious users to delete application libraries (ddl files), which means that the affected applications will look for their libraries in other places. If an application finds its way to a user written location, it gives the attacker the opportunity to load their own malicious library, putting the information stored on the machine at risk. Mitja Kolsek, a specialist in digital forensics, detailed the potential of this vulnerability. Even a user with few privileges can make a request to this service for an undocumented function, and this function verifies whether the requesting user has permissions to create a file in a location, he explained. To do so, overrides the user who requests it, try to create an empty file, remember if the creation of the file was successful and then delete it. Therefore, vulnerability can open the door to a series of malicious activities. This could be exploited to facilitate lateral movement within an organization or even for potentially destructive purposes, such as removing key system files, making a system inoperable, said Tom Parsons, an expert on cybersecurity. In the proof of concept, a program called Deletebug.exe Removes a file from the system of the attacked computer, which means that a user can no longer restart it. Therefore, the machine becomes completely inoperable. What the proof of concept does, in simple terms, is that it calls the function in Data Sharing Service, which tells to perform an operation in the pci.sys file in a temporary folder and expect this file to be created. Then, it quickly traces that file to pci.sys in the system folder (where the user could not delete it), explained Kolsec. As a result, the system file is deleted. Will Dormann, analyst of vulnerabilities in CERT/CC, in conjunction with Mitja Kolsec, were able to confirm the presence of the vulnerability and then exploit it on Windows 10 machines that had all the patches and updates available. Through Twitter, Dormann added that Data Sharing Service does not appear to be present in Windows 8.1 and earlier systems. [Digital forensics](URL experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security were able to confirm that the vulnerability only works on Windows 10 and Server 2016 and 2019. In addition, they report that the bug allows non admin users to remove any files by abusing a new Windows service that does not verify any previously granted permission. Although Microsoft has not yet issued any statement regarding this vulnerability, a micropatch from the 0Patch organization has proven to be effective in successfully blocking the vulnerability, generating a ACCES DENIED message against any attempt to user suplantation. A zero-day vulnerability was also discovered last September in Microsoft Task Scehduler. The company patched up the vulnerability a few days later."

You must know the feeling of anguish when imagining yourself in a situation similar to that of the film protagonist; now imagine that the story adapts to you, real-time horror, adjusting the plot to your level of attention to scare you to death. Experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that this can be possible thanks to the 5G technology. When most people think of 5G, they envision a high-bandwidth connection that allows them to download full seasons of their favorite shows in a matter of minutes. But the 5G technology has a greater potential, being able to reinvent the way to visualize multimedia content, but it could also affect the users privacy. Dan Garraway, co-founder of the [interactive video](URL company Wirewax, said in an interview: Currently, a video is done in a very similar way to how a TV show is done. The change is to convert a video into an exchange experience between emitter and receiver. The audience interacts with what they watch and makes things happen. Custom made horror movies? Wirewax will try to implement the interactive video based on the front camera of the users phone to make adjustments to the content of the video in real time. It may sound like science fiction, but according to reports from experts in digital forensics, one of the main features of 5G is the ability to establish an ultra-sensitive connection virtually without any lag, which means that the network and systems would be fast enough to react to the users physical reactions. The first 5G compatible smartphones will arrive next year and, although this type of multimedia content does not yet exists, is a market with enormous potential, according to financial estimates. According to the first forecasts, 5G technology will drive the annual revenues of multimedia applications up to $67 billion USD in a decade. **Generation leap** Before thinking about the inability to create interactive content with 5G technology, consider how the jump from 3G to 4G LTE changed the way we access a lot of content. The fact of being able to watch and upload the video in a mobile device reinvented the way we watch TV in addition to the way of doing big business. For example, a decade ago, when Netflix was about to complete its transition to streaming, its annual revenues were $1.4 billion USD. Now, their annual income has grown more than 10 times, reaching $15,806 billion USD. The availability of content generated by 4G technology allowed a massive improvement of the video distribution, considered experts in cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL With 5G technology, new forms of multimedia content can be fully generated in a mobile device environment, says Jim Spare, COO of the interactive video company Eko. The 5G potential for video is based on several major changes in how content is distributed and created. The most important are the low latency or the delay response time of the network. The delay time with 4G is approximately 20 milliseconds, but with 5G is reduced to just 1 millisecond. 5G technologies are also better for handling large amounts of data. According to studies by specialists in digital forensics, the video is already one of the online activities with the highest volume of data, with almost 58% of the Internet traffic of 2018. 5G not only lightens that load, it can also make new types of video accessible. The speed and capacity of 5G technology also make it possible for the video to be created in real time according to the users responses. As movies and shows are generated by computer, the content becomes more changeable, says Garraway."

One of these devices is specially designed for Twitter use only, and is usable only through a WiFi network. Is being said that his third iPhone is as insecure as any other iPhone. The former official has mentioned that despite repeated warnings that spies could hear their calls, Trump has refused to stop using the phone. The president likes to keep his personal iPhone with him, as his personal contacts information is stored there. According to reports from the New York Times (NYT), American espionage agencies are aware that China and Russia were spying on the presidents phone calls, while intercepting communications with foreign officials. If true, this can lead to the largest and most significant security breach of communications in the White House, says Payton, who served in the George W. Bush administration and is now the CEO of a security firm. Americas antagonistic nations now have a direct line to the presidents confidential ideas and conversations. With the information obtained from Trumps calls, foreign national states could learn to exploit the weaknesses of the American leader to the detriment of Americas interests. Amidst the current trade tensions, thanks to this espionage campaign, China has learned how Trump thinks, what arguments tend to influence him and who he is inclined to listen to, reports NYT. **Direct line to the presidents ideas** According to reports of experts in [digital forensics](URL telecommunications spy devices, known as Stingray, were being used to intercept cell phone signals near the White House, allegedly operated under the auspices of different foreign governments. According to NYT, the Secret Service has asked Trump to change his phones each 30 days to make way for new security software, which has annoyed the temperamental president. During his campaign, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton for using an unsafe email server while being secretary of state. Trumps administration also ordered a government-wide ban on all technologies developed by ZTE and Huawei Chinese manufacturers as a preventive cybersecurity measure. In his period, Barack Obama used a Blackberry device that looked less attractive but was in fact more protected, although he occasionally committed the carelessness of using his collaborators phones to make personal calls. During his second term, Obama switched to an iPhone with limited functions, regulating the use of the devices camera and microphone."

The news has been released two weeks after the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report detailing cybersecurity issues in some of the Defense Departments weapons systems. A package that includes a three-year contract and an indefinite amount that spans the three bug reporting organizations will attract more hackers to verify the Department of Defense websites, hardware, and physical systems. Finding innovative ways to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen security has never been more important, said Chris Lynch, a [digital forensics](URL expert from the Department of Defense, in a statement. When our adversaries carry out malicious attacks, they do not stop and do not fail to explore all their possibilities. The expansion of our security and collaborative work allows us to build a deeper bank of technological talent and offer more diverse perspectives to protect and defend our assets. We are excited to see that the program continues to grow and generates benefits for the entire Department. Since the start of the Hack the Pentagon program in 2016, cybersecurity and digital forensics experts who have participated in it have reported more than 5k code vulnerabilities, and have executed six public demonstrations, including Hack the Marine Corps the most recent Department of Defense cybersecurity event, last August. Other hacking sessions have focused on the Air Force systems, the Army and the Defense Travel Service. In the current environment, joint security work is critical because all systems are vulnerable and there is a massive shortage of resources trained to address these incidents, said Ashish Gupta, CEO and president of Bugcrowd, on his personal blog. While we cannot control the actions of our adversaries, we can control our most vulnerable points. But we can only do so if we know our systems well enough, he mentioned. In accordance with the contract, the government expects companies to execute at least eight limited-time samples and five continuous samples during the first year of the contract. Each program will last between three months and a full year. The amounts offered by the program have not been disclosed. It may not be surprising that the Pentagon is expanding its approach to include physical systems. The news of this expansion occurs shortly after the GAO described the Department of Defense as a unit that is just beginning to deal with the scale of vulnerabilities in its offensive military team. The GAO reported that in the tests applied to the major weapon systems in development, the evaluators were able to take control of the systems with relative ease and to operate largely without being detected. The departments weapons are more computer-operated than ever, so its not surprising that there are more attack vectors, the GAO report mentions. However, until relatively recently, the Department of Defense had not prioritized the work of cybersecurity. For digital forensics experts, this news is a big step in the right direction. The Pentagon has made significant progress in this area in recent years, said Jim OGorman, an expert in cybersecurity. To continue this positive drive, they must continue to emphasize the importance of testing and invest in increased training to develop the skills of their security teams."

According to the report published by Shinde, the two vulnerable parameters in question are: * **modulepath**: To set a directory path to search for X Server modules * **logfile**: To set up a new log file for the Xorg server, instead of using the default log file found in/var/log/Xorg.n.log on most platforms In a security notice, Xorg mentioned: When the X server is run with elevated privileges, the modulepath argument can be used to specify an unsafe path to the modules to be loaded on the X server, allowing you to execute unprivileged code in the privileged process. On the other hand, a cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL firm mentioned: An incorrect permission check for the modulepath and logfile options when the Xorg X server is launched allows unprivileged users the ability to log on to the system at through the physical console to scale their privileges and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Security investigator Matthew Hickey shared by Twitter a proof of concept of exploitation code of this vulnerability, mentioning that an attacker can literally take care of the affected systems with 3 commands or less. The X.Org Foundation has now launched the 1.20.3 version of the X.Org server with security patches to fix the problem. Popular Linux distributions like OpenBSD, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat and Fedora have posted the corresponding alerts confirming the presence of the problem and mentioning that they are already working on the release of the update patches for each distribution."

Threat actors have shown special interest in developing projects to bypass the implementation of the Completely Automated Public Turing Test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, most commonly known as [CAPTCHA](URL as reported by researchers specializing in digital forensics and cybersecurity. According to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the CAPTCHA is designed to stop automated spam online by requiring users to verify text or images that are only recognizable to humans. Popular CAPTCHA uses include minimizing the effectiveness of bots in deploying distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, creating email accounts, and purchasing event tickets online. Currently, malicious actors who want to automate these activities or other harmful online operations have a great interest in bypassing the CAPTCHA. Cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL experts recently discovered a series of discussions among malicious hackers about the bypass of CAPTCHA in an English speaking basic-level Search Engine Optimization (SEO) forum. A threat actor raised the question of how to omit CAPTCHA using Python and Selenium scripts, and members responded with various suggested tips and tactics. Common shared recommendations among threat actors included the use of several legitimate and open-source CAPTCHA bypass services, most of which are designed to help people with visual disabilities or dyslexia. However, analysts also observed two illicit tools for sale that, according to their developers, are able to bypass CAPTCHA. The first tool appears to be a stolen copy of some social media marketing software that automates friends adding, while the second is a type of SEO software frequently abused by threat actors to spread spam by email or in the comment sections of different platforms. According to its developers, this second tool is able to decode more than 400 types of CAPTCHA in its default form, and supposedly can decode even more variants using a plugin sold separately. The analysts responsible for the investigation have not confirmed that neither of the two tools is capable of performing the announced tasks. The increase in the frequency with which this issue arises in different forums of black hat hacking has been constant since the middle of last year, but so far there seems to be no evidence that these discussions have motivated any new activity in practice. Since the CAPTCHA is a vital tool in combating the automation of online malicious activities such as DDoS attacks and spam distribution, the possibility of malicious hackers being able to circumvent the CAPTCHA continues to be the reason for discussion among the cybersecurity community. Given the level of interest this topic has reached in the deep and dark web forums, digital forensic experts predict that threat actors will continue to seek methods to bypass this program. Organizations that use CAPTCHA to defend their websites and networks must be aware of the ongoing efforts of malicious actors to overlook this test, and if these efforts are successful, they must tailor their security tactics to suit the threat levels."

According to the investigators, producing a document that delivers the malicious payload is pretty easy. According to digital forensics experts, to carry out this attack, an attacker must first create a Word document, fill it with the most appropriate content for their purposes, then use Insert  Online video option, add a YouTube video to the document and save the file. The saved file must be unpacked, either with a specific tool or by changing the .docx extension to a .zip extension and unzipping it. These actions allow the attacker to access an XML file named document.xml in the Word folder, open it and edit it. Instead of the YouTube iframe code for the video (included after the embeddedHtml parameter), the attacker can choose to put a malicious HTML or JavaScript code, and then save the changes, update the package.docx and find a way to deliver the file to the victim and get them to open the file and click on the built-in video to access its content. This interaction with the video will activate the download of the built-in executable file when the victim opens the Internet Explorer Download Manager. A window will appear asking the attack victim whether to run or save the file, but they will not be warned about the possible dangers of doing so. For their bad fortune, many users do not think twice before clicking, approving the execution of malicious load. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL Attackers could use this feature for malicious purposes such as phishing, as the document will show the attached video with a link to YouTube, while disguise a hidden HTML/JavaScript code that will run on background and could lead to a subsequent malicious code execution scenario. **So, what do users can do?** Experts claim this incident should be considered as a vulnerability with the potential to affect all users with Office 2016 and earlier versions of the productivity suite. Microsoft has already been notified of the vulnerability, but the enterprise has reported that for now they do not plan to do anything about it because the software is correctly interpreting the HTML as it is designed. But if the feature begins to become more widely abused, the company might end up launching some update patch. According to reports of specialists in digital forensics, a similar situation occurred last year when, after a considerable increase in the malware campaigns that abused the Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) function in Word; Microsoft initially said it was a function, not a vulnerability, and simply offered risk mitigation tips to an attack scenario, but eventually ended up disabling DDE by default to stop the rise of function abuses."

According to the research carried out, 0x-booter was first detected on October 17, 2018; the operators of the tool assure that this has more than 500 Gbps of power and 20k bots to abuse. During a regular monitoring day, the team of digital forensics experts recently discovered a new platform offering the DDoS for hire service called 0x-booter, reports the security notice. Appeared for the first time on October 17, 2018, the 0x-booter platform is available to anyone who registers on the tools website. As shown below, this service comes with an explicitly defined user interface that allows practically anyone to learn to use the service. This DDoS-for-hire service is powered by the botnet Bushido IoT; researchers believe that the service has less capacity and fewer bots than it claims. In the analyses performed, the 0x-booter service was able to carry out attacks of 424,825 Gbps, using a little more than 16k bots. Still, the service has the potential to create serious problems for the attacked websites. This paid service allows users to drive different attacks, mainly in the transport and application layers. The prices for the 0x-booter service are located in a range of between $20 and $150 USD, depending on various parameters, including the number of attacks, the duration of an attack, and the customer service offered by the operators. Researchers were able to discover the following .JSON files that provided information about this service: * php: This file contains a list of all DDoS attack methods available with their corresponding value of attacks made * php: This file contains a list of dates with the corresponding number of all attack methods made per day According to the second file content, the service has been used to deploy more than 300 DDoS attacks from October 14th to this date. According to experts in digital forensics, the botnet Bushido is operated by a group called ZULLSEC and was detected for the first time by the security investigators from the MalwareMustDie organization, which also discovered the [Mirai botnet](URL at the time. Bushido is a modified version of Mirai, but optimized for launching DDoS attacks, as well as implementing more options. After analyzing both the website and the botnet, we found that the codes used have been copied and pasted from an open source, modifying it for malicious actors own purposes, the security report continues. Even the 0x-Booter website is based on another booter/stresser named Ninjaboot, whose source code leaked into hacking forums last year. Even though the botnet Bushido has its own name, it takes a lot of the Mirai code. Experts noted that thanks to this service, any user with a few dollars and almost no knowledge could cause considerable damage."

The 12 packages were discovered in two different scans by a researcher under the pseudonym Bertus, all malicious loads have already been eliminated from PyPI. All the packages were copied and worked according to a similar pattern. Its creators copied the code from popular packages and created a new library, but with a slightly modified names. For example, four packages (Diango, Djago, Dajngo, Djanga) are spelling modifications of Django, the name of a very popular framework. According to the report of the [digital forensics](URL expert, the people behind these packages added malicious code to these newly created, but completely functional projects, and more specifically to the setup.py files. These files contain a set of instructions that Python library installers, such as pip, automatically execute when downloading and configuring a new package within a Python project. The reason for including this additional code was to perform several malicious actions for each malicious library. Bertus discovered a first set of 11 malicious packages on October 13 and another malicious package on October 21. The first set of malicious libraries would attempt to collect data on each infected environment, get boot persistence, or even open a reverse shell on remote workstations. For its part, the last package found, called colourama, was looking for access to the finances of the victim, hijacking the clipboard of the infected users operating system, where it would scan looking for similar strings to a Bitcoin address, which it would replace with the attackers own Bitcoin address in an attempt to hijack the payments or transfers made in the victims online wallet. This package also imitated the name of a popular Python library, called colorama. According to the PyPI Statistics Service, 54 users had downloaded the package one month before it was retired. The attackers Bitcoin address contained only $40 USD in virtual assets, so cybersecurity and digital forensics experts were able to verify that this series of malicious actions did not generate Bitcoin profits for the attackers. Bertus was interviewed by a cybersecurity firm via email: After discovering malicious libraries, I notified the PyPI administrators, who eliminated the packages, he said. In addition, they also blocked the name colourama for future packet registrations. The investigator claims he discovered the 12 packages by using an automated system designed by him to scan the PyPI repository for packages with similar names, technically known as typo packages. Bertus says he created the scanner after seeing a security alert sent by the Slovak National Security office last year, warning Python developers about ten malicious libraries loaded into PyPI. These libraries also used typo packages and spent weeks until the PyPI were discovered. According to reports of experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, Bertus is improving his Python scanner, while continuing to perform periodic reviews to find more typo packages."

The mechanisms implemented by the manufacturers to block repairs or unauthorized changes, such as firmware code that disable third-party replacements, can be legally bypassed to correct or modify [smartphones](URL tablets, smartwatches, routers and other wireless access points and personal digital assistants. This ruling is even extended to cars, trucks and tractors. So far, manufacturers had tried to block unofficial repairs for various reasons; in part to prevent people from making dubious replacements or implementing backdoors, but to a greater extent to ensure that customers will have to invest in costly manufacturer-supported services. Digital Rights Management (DRM) is also used to ensure that people use only official printer ink cartridges or ground coffee beans on specific machines. According to specialists in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, bypassing these restrictions could cause manufacturers to launch deliberately blocked devices, accusations of copyright infringements, and trials, because DRM is protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). These new rules came into force in the United States on Sunday, October 28. **Still, be careful with these new measures** Although any user can develop the software or hardware tools needed to alter the DRM, no one is allowed to sell or seemingly distribute this kind of tools. Therefore, anyone can pay for one of these services, but those who make them cannot share the method used. The ruling only granted exemptions from use, but not tool exemptions, says Cory Doctorow, a [digital forensics](URL specialist. The expert believes that this ruling could cause people to download malware or other malicious software that is impersonating such tools to alter the DRM. This means people will end up downloading illegal tools. If there is not going to be a legal market for these tools, the user is at risk of suffering a cyberattack. Without knowing it, people might be adding very damaging malware variants to their systems. Even if someone reveals a method to alter the DRM and distributes it as free or open source material, this could be taken as an abusive use. Distributing a toolkit to alter DRM seems to be a gray area in legislation. This prohibition may also extend to open source tools; the new rules are written quite broadly, said Mitch Elzol, a legal specialist. The law says it is illegal to trade these tools, including their manufacture and sale, but it could also refer to teaching about the use and elaboration of these tools. The situation is the same for researchers in cybersecurity. While this new regulatory framework allows for product testing, they may not be allowed to share the results of their research, thereby limiting the number of studies that may be published."

The error in the Windows API broadFileSystemAccess could have given a malicious developer of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) access to all documents, photos, downloads and files of a user stored in OneDrive. The incident was detected by digital forensics expert Sbastien Lachance, who created a business application that collapsed suddenly in the October 2018 Windows 10 update, also known as Build 1809; this version of the update is currently waiting for Microsoft to complete data-loss bug correction tests. Regularly, UWP applications are restricted to certain folder locations, but developers can also request access to other locations, provided the user grants permission to the application. As Microsoft points out, the broadFileSystemAccess API provides access to all the files a user has access to. Microsoft promoted the role as a way for developers to make their UWP applications easier to use. This is a restricted capacity. In the first use, the system will ask the user to allow access. The access can be configured in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; File system, explains Microsoft. If you send an application to the store declaring this capability, you will need to provide additional descriptions of why your application requires this capability and how you intend to use it. The problem is that, until version 1809, users did not receive the permission request and the API could be used to access the entire file system. According to Lachance, the dialogue is intended to be shown to a user in the first use of the application. Microsoft recognized that this is a privacy issue and therefore disables the value of the wide-access file system. If users are concerned that an installed application has obtained access to a wider file margin than the default, users can limit that access in Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; file. According to specialists in [digital forensics](URL developers who previously used the API can also find that their UWP applications are now blocked when users change to version 1809."

An audit conducted by the US Department of the Interiors inspector general found that a US Geological Service (USGS) network at the Earth Resource Observation and Science Center (EROS), an installation of satellite images in South Dakota, was infected with malware after an unidentified employee visited thousands of pornographic sites hosting the malicious content, which was downloaded and installed on his job laptop, thanks to which it extended to the USGS network. Digital forensics investigators discovered that many of the pornographic images were subsequently stored in an unauthorized USB device and on a personal cell phone with an Android operative system, which was connected to the computer owned by the US government. In addition to the USGS network, the employees phone in question was also infected with malware. These findings were made public in a security report at the beginning of October, but were largely unnoticed, receiving almost no dissemination by the government. It is already undesirable that, at this stage, a government-controlled agency should remind its officials that it is forbidden to access this kind of content at work, especially on a government-owned computer, considered the inspector general in charge of the investigation. The inspector general did not mention the measures that will be taken against the employee. The US Department of the Interiors [digital forensics](URL team has identified two vulnerabilities in the USGS IT Security guidelines: access to websites and open USB ports, the security report says. Theres a positive side in this incident. The EROS Center, which controls and archives images of the earths surface, does not operate any classified network, said a spokesman of the inspector general of the Department in a statement, discarding any significant malicious activity against the networks of the government. The spokesman did not specify what type of malware was identified, only mentioning that the malware found helps to enable data leaking and is also associated with some variants of ransomware. Digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that the best measure is for the USGS to impose a blacklist policy on unauthorized websites, as well as regularly monitor the web usage history of the employees. It is also recommended that the agency set limits on its USB-use policy, restricting employees to the use of removable media on government devices. The USGS is in the process of evaluating new policies to strengthen the security of its networks."

The truth is those malicious actors, whether extern or members of the organization are always lurking around the critical systems of a company, and whenever they have the slightest chance to exploit any vulnerability or bypass security systems, they will do so. The various types of fraud persist, and frankly, it is not realistic to believe that companies can take measures that eradicate it definitively. But combating fraud does not have to be an unproductive task. Cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security bring you three useful tips to help companies fight fraud, specifically cyber fraud: **Think like a malicious actor** Antifraud systems may be effective, but they will not stop a criminal. The main challenge is to anticipate the opponents next move. To be able to get into an adversarys head, cybersecurity and digital forensics professionals should consider what motivates malicious hackers and what their goals might be in the organization. Threat actors are always looking for similar things: payment card data, personal identifying information, log in credentials, and other types of data and sensitive personal information. It is also necessary to consider the methods that scammers use to hinder existing controls to access an organizations systems. Two-factor authentication (2FA) can protect payment card data but what about other forms of electronic payment such as gift cards? Generally, this type of electronic assets does not have antifraud protection such as bank cards, which makes them an easy target for the cybercriminals. Research by specialists in [digital forensics](URL conclude that, in recent years, the number of illicit transactions related to electronic assets and gift cards has been increasing. Thinking like a fraud actor means considering all the options available to an attacker and admitting that certain systems or processes may have deficiencies. Identifying any weakness in existing antifraud programs can help companies to be better prepared for the worst of scenarios. **Monitor criminal forums in deep and dark web** Thinking like a criminal is just a part of the strategy. To anticipate a possible cyber fraud accurately, it is important to have an idea of the issues that are trendy among the [cybercrime](URL community. Not every organization considers this scenario, but it is important to have trusted people who are aware of todays deep and dark web. Some forums of deep and dark web focus on fraud, and in these forums, certain trends arise. For example, discussions related to the weak antifraud controls of online payment systems eventually manifested themselves empirically in more payment card frauds. The monitoring of deep and dark web can be one of the main sources of information on the new tactics and schemes of fraud used. But since access to these challenging and risky online communities, it is necessary for organizations to work with experts on the subject, avoiding security risks due to the nature of the information and the content that is handled in deep and dark web. **Determine possible links** Many experts in digital forensics have linked different types of fraud with certain geographic regions, forcing companies to make a great effort to better understand new schemes and tactics of fraud. This helps to establish causal relationships between the linguistic or cultural characteristics of a particular region with a certain type of specific fraud. But in recent years, new communities of cybercriminals have emerged rapidly in many more regions. Latin America is one of those examples. While scammers in Latin America were considered unsophisticated, disorganized, and unlikely to represent a real threat, these communities have evolved substantially. Many companies that previously had no reason to monitor the cybercriminals in this region of the world now strive to understand and combat the threats caused by scammers in Latin America. As threats and indicators can vary substantially in different regions and communities, monitoring these variations and new developments is a necessity for companies and anti-fraud teams."

In a somewhat unforeseen way, the British Government has embarked on a campaign against the digital asset industry. The FCAs research not only reaffirms its view that the cryptocurrency lacks an intrinsic value, but that the financial authorities are even considering banning some of the different alternatives available in the virtual assets market. Ultimately, the report details the actions that the UK Government is carrying out to keep the crown safe from unreliable cryptocurrency companies and token selling scammers, while warning the general public to make their own research before investing in any of these virtual currencies. According to reports of digital forensics and cybersecurity experts, a possible prohibition of certain types of cryptocurrencies will be solved in the first quarter of 2019. On the other hand, these types of investment tools are already being used by American brokers on Wall Street. The British government also seeks to regulate all cryptocurrency-related services, such as online wallets and exchanges. There are substantial potential risks associated with cryptocurrencies, and the most immediate priorities for the authorities are to mitigate consumer risks and market integrity, and to prevent the use of virtual assets for illicit activities, states the FCA. While the authorities recognize that cryptocurrencies have the potential to bring benefits to markets, businesses and consumers, there are also considerable risks and the British authorities will do all they can to mitigate them. Whats more, according to reports from cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL the FCA is willing to implement one of the most comprehensive responses against money laundering to eliminate the illicit activity related to Bitcoin. It is clear that the FCA already maintains a certain level of mistrust with respect to current cryptocurrencies platforms, but they have not dismissed the possibility that virtual assets represent more of an advantage for todays markets. Virtual assets do not have an intrinsic value and therefore investors should consider losing everything abruptly, the FCA warns. There is evidence that the current generation of cryptoassets offers benefits, but this is a rapidly developing market and benefits may arise in the future. By the end of this year, the FCA considers that it will have clarified which cryptocurrencies are within the current regulations and whether or not to extend the limits to suit the blockchain industry."

Mike Burgess, director general of the Australian Signals Directorate, said that his experts in information security and digital forensics have supported the governments decision to ban the two Chinese companies from participating in the implementation of their 5g network last August, companies he called high-risk providers. It was the first time the agency revealed such information. My advice was to exclude these high-risk providers from all of the 5G networks which are currently under development, Burgess said in a recently released statement. The next generation of telecommunications networks will be at the top of each countrys critical national infrastructure list, he said. 5G technology will reinforce the communications that Australians rely on every day, from our health systems to the cars and the operation of our energy and water supply, Burgess said. The risks could not be greater, so we took the most precautions. According to cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, Huawei was banned from bidding on contracts for Australias broadband network in 2011. The Chinese government accused the Australian authorities of dismissing both companies under ideological criteria, completely putting aside any evidence to support their accusations against these companies. Cooperation between Chinese and Australian companies is mutually beneficial in nature. Australia should encourage cooperation between the two sides instead of making excuses to deliberately obstruct joint work, said Lu Kang, spokesman for the Chinese government. We urge the Australian authorities to eliminate ideological bias and provide equal conditions for the operations of Chinese companies in their territory, he added. Burgesss warning came when a group of experts in digital forensics and information security expressed concern about the growing collaboration between Australian universities and the scientists of the Peoples Liberation Army of China in several research programs. The researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Alex Joske, said that some Chinese scientists hide their military background by claiming that they arrive in Australia as academics from non-existent institutions. According to a report presented by Joske, since 2007, the Peoples Liberation Army of China has sponsored more than 2k military scientists and engineers to study abroad, Australia being one of its main destinations. The report recommended that universities collaborate with allied countries on strategic research issues. On the other hand, the Minister of Education, Dan Tehan, said that universities are autonomous institutions that can decide for themselves on issues such as research and collaboration, in addition to complying with all the security standards of the Australian government to work with foreigners. Australian universities carefully assess student requests from all countries and communicate with defense and security agencies as needed, reports the Minister in a statement. The Defense Trades Controls Act gives the government and the Department of Defense the task of providing information on any technology or research with possible military applications, as reported by experts in digital forensics. This legislation is under review, and Joske believes it should be expanded to prevent military scientists from countries like China from accessing this kind of researches while they are in Australian territory. The 5G networks will begin their commercial services in Australia next year."

Radisson Rewards takes this incident seriously and is conducting a thorough investigation to help prevent something like this from happening again in the future. Technical details about this security breach are not yet made public. Anyways, cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend that the holders of these accounts be wary of possible scams carried out by cybercriminals in possession of the stolen data. The official declaration of Radisson Hotel Group on the incident mentions that the affected members of their global loyalty program, Radisson Rewards, should be informed about the security incident that occurred last October. According to the company, the data security incident impacted less than 10% of the accounts of the Radisson Rewards members and did not commit the payment card data. The companys investigation has determined that the information to which it was accessed is limited to personal data, such as name, address, country of residence, email address and, in some cases, company where it works and telephone number. The cybersecurity community is in the expectation of further reports on the incident."

The user, named Gabriel Landau, discovered that Bing was showing a search result directed to users who searched for the phrase Download Chrome linked to an unofficial site (called googleonline2018\[.\]com). Digital forensics experts consider that, if he had been less cautious, Landau might have been deceived by malicious users to download undesirable code from this unauthorized site directly on his computer. This is a highly probable scenario; in the search result promoted by Bing, the domain was listed as google.com, but the link actually led to anyone who clicked on it to a different domain. Gabriel Landau posted about the incident in his Twitter account: New Laptop with Windows 10. I almost fell into a trap trying to install Chrome. I need an explanation of Bing, mentions the user in a tweet, attaching a video that shows the malicious link. In the video, Landau downloads the fake Chrome installer (something little recommended for users without enough knowledge) and verifies that the signature of the software corresponds to a company called Alpha Criteria instead of Microsoft. According to reports from experts in digital forensics, Microsoft responded to the incident by saying that it has eliminated malicious Bing ads, and that the account associated with this site has been deleted. Microsoft will also implement a webpage where users can report low quality ads (such as malvertising). Of course, that doesnt explain how this ad in Bings search results claimed to bring the user to the legitimate Chrome download site. Even worse, experts in digital forensics had reported incidents of that nature for six months, without the company ruling on it or eliminating this type of content from the search results of its browser. In April, [digital forensics](URL specialist Lawrence Abrams described how the search for Chrome download in Bing resulted in an ad that seemed to redirect users to the official Chrome download page in the google.com domain, but actually carried them to the fake site googlechrome2018\[.\]net. Although this ad was removed time after, the real problem is that these incidents keep happening. Microsoft needs to implement more efficient measures to prevent these misleading and malicious ads from appearing in its browsers search results. Cybersecurity and digital forensics experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that the only thing left to do to users is to continue reporting this kind of content and wait for the company to take these reports seriously in the future. Gabriel Landau asked the team in charge of Bing what measures they would take to address this situation, the company has not yet responded."

Hackers used malware similar to Stuxnet, the cyber weapon used in the attack on an Iranian nuclear plant in 2010, interfering with the Tehran governments nuclear program. According to the claims of the experts in digital forensics, the government of Iran has admitted in the most recent days that they are facing again an attack similar to that suffered almost 10 years ago, but this time the attackers use a more violent, advanced and sophisticated malware variant than before, affecting critical network and infrastructure. Stuxnet is the result of a joint operation carried out by the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel, in addition to the alleged participation of the GCHQ. **Iran blames Israel for the attack** The Iranian government points to Israel as guilty of the attacks. No Israeli official has made any comments on this accusations but it is known that in recent months the Mossad has carried out various operations against Iran. Earlier this year, cyber spies leaked a large number of documents (paper files and digital) detailing a clandestine nuclear weapons program in Iran. Last September, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented to the UN alleged evidence of the Iranian governments nuclear activity in the territories of Iran, Syria, and Lebanon. A few days ago, Gholamreza Jalali, the head of the Iranian Civil Defense Agency, confirmed that the governments [digital forensics](URL experts discovered and neutralized a new strain of Stuxnet in their networks. Recently, we discovered a new generation of Stuxnet that consisted of several parties trying to get into our systems, said Jalali, according to the Iranian government official media. Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, calls for action against the intensified efforts of Irans enemies to infiltrate his country: In the face of the complex practices of our enemies, our civil defenses must face these activities through scientific, accurate and up-to-date work, Ayatollah Khamenei said to civil defense officials, who are in charge of areas such as the countrys cyber security."

It is a dizzying world and there are many different types of exchanges and purchases to make. Some people try to make money from the volatility of [cryptocurrencies](URL prices through short-term daily transactions. According to experts in digital forensics from the International Institute of Cyber Security, others seek to maintain long-term investments and expect the cryptocurrency to buy a store of value. All this makes buying and marketing cryptocurrencies a fun and potentially profitable activity. But those who are wrapped up in this activity face the risk of making visceral decisions. To mitigate potential risks and avoid losing money in the virtual assets market, it is crucial to keep emotions under control. Experts in digital forensics and cybersecurity bring the following list of tips to keep your emotions from dominating your business. **Design a plan** The most important thing before you go into the virtual assets business is to have a clear idea of what your goal is when investing money. Before buying any cryptocurrency you have to ask a series of questions: * Do these types of assets fit my current financial situation? Do I have any other savings? If not, is this a good way to generate revenue? * Can I afford losing money if my investment doesnt work? * Do I know well the risks and volatility of the cryptocurrency market? * How should I invest my virtual assets? Do I have to buy or exchange? **Investigate before you act** It is essential to investigate some background on the cryptocurrencies and technology that supports them. Be sure to read the technical documents of the project of your interest. Look for virtual assets that have solid technology and an active community behind. Although these variables do not guarantee profit, [digital forensics](URL experts believe that they do help to minimize the possible risks. **Choose the right exchange platform** Try to choose the right platform to perform your operations. Some bags have almost hundreds of coins available for purchase and trade, while others have only a few. Some factors to consider are the place where the different exchanges reside, available currencies and cyber security options provided by their operators. **Know your limits** You must be responsible at the moment of investing. The amount you want to spend depends on your personal plan. Investing in virtual assets carries a significant risk, so you only have to spend an amount that you can afford to lose. Once you set your limit, stick to it. Spending beyond your limits can bring serious consequences. **Use Limit Orders** Limit orders can protect you from losses if the cryptocurrency prices fall abruptly. A limit order allows you to set the lowest limit that will allow your cryptocurrency price to drop before you sell. For example, you buy a coin at $20 per unit. If you expect the value to rise rapidly, you can set a limit order to $19.99. If the price drops dramatically, the platform will automatically sell the coins for $19.99. Most of the exchanges have a limit order system. **Dont blindly trust the market charts** Cryptocurrency prices fluctuate dramatically. This is part of the allure of this business. Prices can change in just seconds, which generates profit opportunities. Observing market charts can generate false expectations for investors, paying too much for worthless currencies, or selling valuable assets for nothing. While market charts are good references, trusting them can be detrimental for investors."

According to reports, attackers could exploit vulnerabilities simply by approaching a sufficient distance (between 100 and 300 feet away from vulnerable devices). A compromised access point could allow an attacker to take control of it, capture all traffic, and then use the compromised device as an access path for further internal attacks. The vulnerability affects Hewlett-Packards Aruba Enterprise and Ciscos Meraki [WiFi access points](URL which represent a large percentage of the hardware used in corporations, according to researchers from a cybersecurity and digital forensics firm. The two flaws were discovered at the beginning of the year and publicly disclosed in recent days. An unauthenticated user can deploy devastating attacks on enterprise networks without being detected from a location near vulnerable devices, such as the company lobby, for example, said Ben Seri, one of the digital forensics specialists in charge of the investigation. Texas Instruments released the update patches for the vulnerable hardware last Thursday. It is expected that Cisco launches patches for three wireless access points from the Aironet series (1542 AP, 1815 AP, 4800 ap), along with patches for their Cisco Meraki series access points (MR33, MR30H, MR74, MR53E), in upcoming days. On the other hand, updating patches for the access points Aruba 3xx and IAP-3xx t have already been launched. **About vulnerabilities** The first vulnerability (CVE-2018-16986) is linked to the Texas Instrument cc2640/50 chips used in Cisco and Cisco Meraki access points. This vulnerability is a remote code execution flaw on the BLE chip and can be exploited by an attacker from a nearby location. First, the attacker sends multiple benign streaming messages, known as advertising packages, which will be stored in the vulnerable chips memory on the selected device, the experts mentioned. Next, the attacker sends the overflow package, which is a slightly modified standard advertising package: a specific bit in its heading on instead of off. This bit causes the chip to allocate package information to a much larger space than it really needs, triggering a memory overflow. The filtered memory is exploited by the attackers to ease the execution of malicious code on the chip. A backdoor is opened and the attacker can use it to control the chip wirelessly. From there, hackers can manipulate the main processor of the wireless access point and control it locally and then remotely. The use of Texas Instrument chips is so common that an attacker could enter the lobby of any company, search for the available WiFi networks and start the attack, said Nadir Izrael, an expert in cybersecurity and digital forensics. The second vulnerability (CVE-2018-7080) was discovered in the Texas Instrument air firmware download feature used in the Aruba WiFi Access Point Series 300 that also uses the chip BLE. This vulnerability is technically a backdoor on the BLE chips that was designed as a development tool, but is active at these access points according to the experts. It allows an attacker to access and install a completely new and different version of the firmware, rewriting the operating system of the device."

As if it was not enough, the perpetrators claim to have details of a total of 120 million accounts, information that they are trying to sell, although there are reasons to doubt this figure. On the other hand, Facebook claims that its security has not been compromised again after the scandal of September, when it was revealed that over 30 million accounts were compromised due to a flaw in one of the Facebook features. Experts in [digital forensics](URL believe that the conversations of these 80k accounts have been obtained due to malicious browser extensions. The company maintains that the necessary measures are already being taken to ensure that incidents of this kind are not re-introduced in the future. According to the first investigations carried out, most of the affected users are in Russia and Ukraine, although the users affected by this incident are also counted in the United States, Brazil, United Kingdom and other places of the world. Hackers offered access to compromised accounts for 10 cents each. However, the announcement was taken offline in the past hours, according to the monitoring of experts in digital forensics and cybersecurity. Weve contacted browser developers to make sure that the malicious extensions we were able to identify are no longer available to download in their stores, said Guy Rosen, Facebook executive. We have also communicated with the police and have worked with local authorities to remove any website that displays information from the Facebook accounts. **Private conversations** This anomalous behavior was first detected in September when a message from a user nicknamed FBSaler appeared on an English-language Internet forum. We have personal information from Facebook users for sale. Our database includes 120 million accounts, the user wrote. Several cybersecurity and digital forensics firms examined the incident and concluded that over 81k of the profiles published online as a sample of the database contained private messages. Data from other 176k accounts were also leaked, although some of the information, including email addresses and phone numbers, could have been obtained due to user carelessness. **Who will be responsible for this?** Personal purchase assistants, bookmarking applications and even some videogames are offered from various browsers such as Chrome, Opera and Firefox as third-party extensions. According to Facebook, it was one of those extensions that silently oversaw the activity of the victims on the platform and sent personal details and private conversations to hackers who try to profit from their data. Facebook has not explicitly named the extensions supposedly involved, but the company claims that this time the leak was not their fault. Independent cybersecurity experts believe that if unauthorized extensions were the cause, browser developers could share some responsibility for not examining the programs, assuming they were distributed through their marketplaces. Still, it seems that Facebook will be the most affected company by this new incident of leaked personal information. The social network has had a terrible year in terms of data security and is sure its going to face more questions about its ability to respond to situations like this that affect a large number of people."

Reports from this weekend claim that, in 2009, there was a security breach in the communication channels of American espionage bodies after the Iranian government infiltrated a series of websites that the CIA had used to communicate to their sources in places like Iran and China. Were still dealing with the consequences, said a former national security officer this month. Dozens of people around the world were killed because of this security breach. It was believed that the communications leaking was due to a simple search on Google. After some suspicions about the United States spying on its nuclear program, Iran began to counterattack. After a double agent showed the Iranian government one of the sites used by the CIA, Asians were able to use Google to identify other sites that the intelligence agency was using and began to intercept their communications, as experts in digital forensics reported. Because Google continually searches for information on the entire worlds websites, it can function as a tremendous research tool, even for counter-espionage purposes, the report says. Googles search capabilities allow users to use advanced operators, such as AND, OR and others, much more sophisticated to eliminate and isolate online websites and data with extreme specificity, the report mentions. As a result, Iran anticipated the actions of the US and arrested many agents. Some were executed, though others managed to escape. Once the Iranian government was able to track the sites, they shared these information-leaking techniques with other allied nations, which used the information to eliminate the CIAs communication channels in their own territories. What Iran did was to hunt systems aggressively, a former intelligence officer said. Their labors did not merely protect themselves. According to former intelligence agency officials, this reached its peak in an incident in 2012 in China, where 30 agents working for the US were captured and executed. Previously it was thought that more than a dozen had been killed. According to reports of cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, a CIA defense contractor named John Reidy said that more than a decade ago he warned the agency that its communications systems were pretty insecure. A year later he was fired by the agency, a measure he claims was retaliation for not being silent about the vulnerabilities of the agencys espionage systems. Reidy said he tried to convince the CIA Inspector General although no one did anything to solve the problem. This is one of the most catastrophic intelligence failures since 9/11, said Irvin McCullough, national security analyst. The only response from the agency was to dismiss the person who warned what was about to happen."

The new bill, called the Consumer Data Protection Act (CDPA), is just a draft for the moment, but Senator Wyden has published a working version, soliciting public an specialized critics and collaboration. In its current form, this new law would give new powers to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to enforce consumer privacy rights, as reported by experts in digital forensics and cybersecurity. To begin with, the bill would establish minimum standards of cybersecurity and privacy that companies would be obliged to meet or, if not, deal with FTC measures. If companies fail, they risk fines similar to those set by the GDPR, which could reach up to 4% of a companys annual revenue. In addition, CDPA would also require large companies to submit annual privacy reports to the FTC. According to the bill, any company that manages the private data of more than 50 million users or has annual revenues of more than $1 billion USD will have to do so. The senior executives of these large companies, such as the executive directors, the privacy directors or the directors of information security, will have to respond personally for these reports. The reports should detail how the company complied with the new CDPA privacy rules. If executives lie or fail to disclose security violations in these reports, they could face up to 20 years in prison. Among the new privacy protections mentioned in the bill, Senator Wyden proposes that the FTC establish and implement a system whereby consumers have the option of not sharing their personal information with companies. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the CDPA would also prohibit companies from not allowing users to access their services if they choose not to share their personal data. Instead, the law would allow companies to charge a user to access their sites or services with the equivalent of user data as an entry fee. In addition, in what appears to be an exact copy of a page in the European Community data regulation, the CDPA would also provide users with a way to review the personal information that a company has collected about them and know who it has been shared with. Last but not least, the bill will also generate more than 175 new jobs in the FTC for employees who monitor the privacy of U.S. consumers, although the bill will also require the FTC to create an API that Developers can use to create applications, which in turn would help consumers solicit, receive, and process the information they are entitled to under this law, and manage their opt-out preferences."

As reported by specialists in digital forensics and cybersecurity from the International Institute of Cyber Security, many of these cameras are connected to the Internet, and can be accessed either intentionally or inadvertently, so that other users access their transmissions. You can find a vulnerable device anywhere, from business, to schools and homes. A new tool allows you to locate the exposed security cameras on a map. While some researchers would normally have to track open device lists with tools like Shodan, Kamerka allows users to enter an address to find the cameras nearby on a map. The tool highlights in a tangible way the prevalence of unsafe cameras that surround us and that anyone can use and utilize potentially for surveillance or espionage. You can search all over the world if there is a camera exposed in a sensitive place, mentions the expert in [digital forensics](URL who developed the tool, identified with the alias Woj-Ciech, in a publication on his blog. As Woj-Ciech explains, Kamerka joins several different pieces of Python code. The tool uses Shodan to find the cameras exposed in the first place (those who run the tool must have a Shodan account with a key API). It then uses Geopy, a Python module that facilitates geolocation of addresses, landmarks, and cities. The final ingredient is Folium, a Python library that handles the creation of the map. After a user enters the desired location, the script returns a list of found devices and creates the HTML-based map. By opening this in a browser, users can scroll and zoom in the inspected area by clicking on the markers to reveal the IP address of the cameras discovered, report experts in digital forensics. Any user with sufficient knowledge can use Kamerka to search for cameras in Washington DC, or perhaps in their own neighborhood, continues Woj-Ciech. The expert claims he has even found cameras near one of Amazons secret stores recently documented by WikiLeaks. Cybersecurity and digital forensics specialists were able to verify that the tool works after testing it in different locations such as London, New York and Paris. Not all the results threw completely exposed security cameras; some required other authentication steps, or were login administrator panels instead of a security camera transmission. No live streaming was found during the tests, but camera control panels with known and predictable default passwords were found, as well as other open control panels but these were not performing live streaming at that time. Needless to say that using this tool in other devices is not recommended. [***DOWNLOAD KAMERKA***](URL"
505,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Vulnerabilities in self encrypted SSD allow attackers to bypass disk encryption,1,9vmkqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9vmkqy/vulnerabilities_in_self_encrypted_ssd_allow/,2018-11-10 04:47:49," **Master passwords and flawed standards implementations allow attackers to access encrypted data without having to know the users password** Researchers in digital forensics and cybersecurity based in the Netherlands revealed the presence of vulnerabilities in some solid state drives (SSD) that allow an attacker to bypass the disk [encryption](URL function and access local data without knowing the user-selected encryption password. Vulnerabilities only affect SSD models that support hardware-based encryption, where disk encryption operations are carried out through an integrated local chip, separated from the main CPU. These devices, also known as self encrypting units, have become very popular recently, after it was demonstrated that software-level disk encryption was vulnerable to attacks in which hackers stole the encryption password from the computers RAM memory. But in a recently published digital forensics report, researchers Carlo Meijer and Bernard van Gastal, claim to have identified vulnerabilities in the firmware of these units. These vulnerabilities affect ATA security and TCG Opal, two specifications for the implementation of hardware-based encryption in SSD. The two experts argue that the SSD units they analyzed allowed users to set a password that decrypted their data, but also supported the so-called master password set by the SSD vendor. Any attacker who reads an SSD manual can use this master password to access the users encrypted password, effectively omitting the user-set password. The only way users would be safe is by changing the master password or by modifying the Master password capacity  setting to maximum, which effectively disables it. But the master password problem was just one of the multiple flaws that the investigators discovered. Digital forensics experts also found that due to incorrect implementations of the TCG Opal specifications, the user-selected password and the real-disk encryption keys were not cryptographically linked. In other words, an attacker can take the value of the disks encryption key, which is stored inside the chip, and use it to decrypt the local data without having to know the users true password. The absence of this property is catastrophic, the investigators said. In fact, the protection of user data no longer depends on a secret password. All the information needed to recover the users data is stored in the unit itself and can be retrieved. Because they had limited access to solid state units, Meijer and van Gastal said they only tested their findings on a small number of devices, but claim that all the devices they tested proved to be vulnerable. They tested both internal and external SSD (USB-based) with hardware-based encryption support, and believe that other brands and models from many other vendors may also be vulnerable to these errors. Crucial and Samsung, two of the companies whose solid state units were analyzed by experts, have already released update patches for their respective developments. According to experts in [digital forensics](URL from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the problems encountered can be especially dangerous for Windows users, this due to the default behavior of Windows BitLocker, a system of software-level disk encryption included in the Windows operating system. According to researchers, each time BitLocker detects a hardware-based encryption device; the application differs from the data encryption process to the hardware device and will not encrypt user data at the software level, leaving them vulnerable to any interference from a malicious actor."

As information security and digital forensics expert from the International Institute of Cyber Security announced, the three groups that coordinate operation Black Week have today leaked new data in various online sites and databases. Among the leaked data are full names, telephone numbers and email addresses of the employees and officials of various research institutes of the National Research Council, the databases of Equitalia and the Ministry of Economic Development in Italy. Confidential data leaked belongs to the members of the Lega Nord del Trentino, Fratelli DItalia and the Democratic Party of the city of Siena, and also include names and surnames of members of Assopolizia (a national Association of Policemen) of Rome and employees of the Central Archives Institute of Italy, which is ironically the institution responsible for developing national standards and guidelines for the creation of digital database and file information systems. From this incident you can get a couple of conclusions: Anonymous has diversified its aims by attacking the Directorate General for Energy Activities of the Ministry of Economic Development in addition to a site taken at random. Italian officials have been able to verify the information leaked in the databases published by Anonymous, verifying that the names, surnames, telephones and passwords of the workers of some attacked entities present in the databases reported are real. In the case of the employees of the Ministry of Economic Development, experts in digital forensics were able to verify that the leaked data did not correspond to the workers of the Italian Government unit. According to Professor Rocco de Nicola, a cybersecurity expert at an Italian university, It is time for anyone who establishes a site to do so with special attention to the privacy and security it will provide to their users information. Several websites were also harmed during the Black Week campaign. This time the turn was for the website of Fratelli DItalia, a post-fascist party, whose home page has been replaced by the mask of Anonymous. The attacks, the modifications to its pages, the disclosure of the email files, the names and the leaked telephones are part of the commemoration of the anniversary of the so-called Powder Conjure, perpetrated by the English revolutionary Guy Fawkes, whose image has become the banner of this group of cyber activists. This attack campaign is also the contribution of Anonymous Italy to the march of the million masks against power abuses by any person committed in any part of the world, carried out simultaneously in Milan and Amsterdam. It is also believed that hundreds of people with Guy Fawkes masks will invade the streets of cities and capitals such as London and Brisbane, Germany, Norway, the Philippines and even Nepal. According to cybersecurity and [digital forensics](URL specialists, this protest has been politically motivated since the first Anonymous announcement on October 28, inviting people to react against their governments: If you see what we see, if you think what we think, and if you look like we do, we ask you to join us and stop accepting the lies and the gag that puts us the state, mentions the message of the activists. With this information leaking campaign, Anonymous reaffirms that privacy is not a joke and that an increasingly digital society is an increasingly fragile society."

According to this report, you can see a significant increase in the rate of software vulnerabilities that are being exploited to be able to control a critical network resource. Todays environments defy how we analyze and manage vulnerabilities. With expanding attack surfaces that include physical and virtual environments, complex web applications that change frequently, and the avalanche of alerts that all this produces, its no wonder that vulnerabilities continue to accumulate. Moreover, as code and systems become more complex and more interconnected, the probability of introducing vulnerabilities into a network environment becomes inevitable. Experts in ethical hacking mention that when new vulnerabilities are exploited, the attacker will bypass the security controls on a system. This can lead to the leaking of sensitive information, privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary code, among many other types of cyberattack. Of a total of 268 penetration tests performed, the most common vulnerabilities found were: SMBRelay (to deploy Man-in-the-Middle attacks) Cross-Site scripting (XSS) Clickjacking Escalation of local privileges SQL Injection Identify vulnerabilities in a modern environment Malicious hackers operate according to the activity of experts in ethical hacking; at the time when the vulnerability is revealed, the hunt begins, as malicious hackers know that many organizations cannot keep up with them. This means that, as ethical hackers, not only do we need the ability to detect vulnerabilities quickly, but we also need to patch them as soon as possible. Knowing this, the monthly vulnerability scan is no longer enough, taking into account that environments change steadily. The more complex an environment is, the more difficult it will be to detect vulnerabilities with conventional techniques, which is why lots of organizations look for ethical hacking specialists solutions to analyze expansive and constantly changing environments. Prioritize critical vulnerabilities Finding a new vulnerability is the first step, knowing which one to prioritize the next. Thats why ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security agree that pentesters should work with tools not only to detect the present vulnerabilities, but also to prioritize these vulnerabilities depending on which are the biggest threats to an organization at any given time. If you have wide visibility on an environment, you can prioritize what vulnerabilities to address based on actual threat data and even automate some of the recovery steps. In compensation, vulnerabilities can be patched much faster, reducing the timeframe of an attacker and fortifying the security of organizations."

Ethical hacking experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that these regulations represent a significant change in the way the business community manages and protects consumer information. Despite the implementation of these regulations, the approval of the cybersecurity regulations of the New York State Department of Financial Services (23 NYCRR 500) has been unnoticed, the deadline to comply with this Act was September 4. This is a set of regulations of the New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) that establishes new cybersecurity requirements in all financial institutions covered by this law. This law shall apply to all entities operating under license, registration or charter of the Department of Financial Services of New York, or otherwise governed by DFS. While its counterparts GDPR and CaCPA refer to the duty to maintain safety practices and procedures equivalent to the risk of harm to consumers, the New York regulation explicitly demands a strong and unique application security program. As marked in section 500.08: The cybersecurity program of each Covered Entity will include written procedures, guidelines and standards designed to ensure the use of safe development practices by the Covered Entity, as well as procedures to evaluate or test the security of in house and external applications used by the Covered Entity in its technological environment. In other words, it is the duty of organizations to comply with an application security standard, while speaking of in house applications, as well as external developments, this law ensures that any software used by these organizations is analyzed, in addition, the law specifies that continuous analyses should be implemented. Organizations that employ less than 10 people, who have produced less than $5M USD in annual gross revenues in each of the last three years, or have less than $10M USD in total assets at the end of the year are exempt from compliance with certain requirements of the regulation. Ethical hacking specialists mention that the cybersecurity budget of an organization is usually invested for network protection, but application code vulnerabilities are the primary goal of hackers. This can be seen in any case of high-profile data theft known, where vulnerabilities lie in some unrepaired software, that is one of the reasons why this law includes a specific section of security in applications."

In recent days, British Airways placed an article on its website explaining details of the incident, although the technical specifications were scarce, the statement reported that: Payments through your main website were affected Payments through your mobile application were affected This occurred between 22:58 August 21, 2018 until 21:45 on September 5, 2018 The report also clearly stated that the information was stolen from British Airways website and mobile app, but did not mention any other security breaches, such as database or server attacks, anything that would indicate that the breach affected more than the payment information entered on the website. Given the nature of the case, some experts in ethical hacking already have a prime suspect, the group of hackers known as Magecart. Magecart, a known rival Since 2015, web-based paying card frauds have been reported operated by the hacking group Magecart. Traditionally, criminals use devices known as card skimmers  devices hidden within credit card readers in ATMs, fuel pumps and other devices  to steal credit card data. Magecart uses a variety of digital devices. Magecart injects scripts designed to steal confidential data that consumers enter into online payment forms on e-commerce websites directly or through affected third-party vendors used by these sites. Recently, Magecarts operatives placed one of these digital skimmers on Ticketmaster websites, through a committed third-party service. The first step in linking this group of hackers with the attack on British Airways consisted of reviewing previous Magecart detections. Finding instances of Magecart is so common for any cybersecurity firm that anyone could get at least one hourly alert of sites at risk for skimming code infection. As believed after the first investigations of the case, Magecart created a customized infrastructure to adapt to the website and mobile app of British Airways specifically and avoid detection for as long as possible. Although it is not possible to know how much information the attackers accessed on the British Airways servers, the fact that they were able to modify a resource for the site, by simply using a 22 lines script, suggests that the access was substantial. This is a clear reminder of how vulnerable the assets stored in the network are. Experts in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security have warned on several occasions about Magecart attacks since its detection in 2015, mentioning that although the Magecart attack on British Airways was not an attack of an external vendor such as the attack to Ticketmaster, does commit the information of the payment data of the users. Companies, especially those that collect confidential financial data, must realize that they must consider the security of their forms, but also the controls that influence what happens with the payment information once the customer sends it."

However, Amazon customers should not worry about this, as this policy will not harm any user until he/she begins to use Amazon Pay for legitimate transactions. This policy implies that any of the Indian government agencies that come to know about any illegal transfer of funds on Amazon Pay, must first ask Amazon for access to their information. According ethical hacking specialists, in its Privacy Policy, the company states that: We may be asked to share the mentioned information with government authorities, regulators and/or agencies with the purpose of verifying the identity of the users or for prevention, detection and investigation, including cyber-incidents, prosecution and punishment of offences. You accept and authorize APIPL (the company that hosts Amazon Pay) to disclose your information, if required by law. The Amazon Pay service is also available in its home country, the United States, but the information disclosure rules are totally different. According to specialists in ethical hacking and cybersecurity, in the United States, they have to inform the public about how many requests for data exchange have been received from government agencies and how many cases the information has been shared. The details of the questions must also be disclosed."

If this law is passed, according to the established terms, the Department of Labor would provide grants to organizations that develop or expand cybersecurity learning initiatives and ethical hacking in their employees. Grants may be used for professional guidance, housing assistance, transportation and child care costs. The demand for talent in ethical hacking and cybersecurity is higher than ever, and organizations are compromising their activities if they do not attend this shortage of workforce, said Rep. Jacky Rosen of the Democratic Party (Nevada), who presented the bill in the American congress. She also said in a statement that this law will seek to ensure that companies and government institutions have the qualified people and critical tools necessary to improve the cybersecurity infrastructure of our country, help the industrys development and reinforce national security. Cybersecurity specialists recognized the efforts of Congressmen/Congresswomen Rosen, Donovan, Moulton and Stefanik for addressing such a critical issue. Experts in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that through a joint task of public and private institutions, under the direction of the US Department of Labor, the information technology industry will have an increased access to registered learning programs and will be able to better train cybersecurity professionals that any nation needs."

Last August 30th, DARPA awarded a $1.2M USD contract to the cybersecurity firm Packet Forensics to develop new ways of locating and identifying these hidden armies on the Internet. This stimulus is part of the Harnessing Autonomy for Countering Cyber-Adversary Systems (HACCS) program, designed for experts in ethical hacking and cybersecurity, DARPA spokespersons said. To create botnets, hackers infect Internet-connected devices with malware that allows them to run commands from a remote server. Because the virus remains dormant most of the time, owners of infected devices rarely know that their computer, smartphone, or any other device has been compromised. Through the HACCS program, DARPA aims to build a system that can automatically identify devices infected with botnet malware and disable them without their owners knowing. Issued in 2017, the program is investing mainly in three different types of technology: Systems that identify and fingerprint botnets over the Internet Tools that load software to infected devices through known security breaches Software that disables the botnet malware once it is loaded The future plan is that DARPA can integrate each of these technologies into a single system that can detect, attack, and neutralize botnet-infected devices without the need for human interaction. Because the tool would only attack the botnet malware, people could continue to use the devices on a regular basis, the agencys ethical hacking specialists mentioned. During projects first stage, the firm Packet Forensics will have to create a technology capable of scanning nearly 5% of the global IP addresses and detecting botnets with 80% accuracy. At final stages of the program, DARPA anticipates that the system will analyze the 80% of the Internet at global level and detect botnets with 95% effectiveness."

Thanks to a survey of nearly 500 small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the United States, researchers found that 66% of companies with fewer than 19 workers do not have any type of cybersecurity training for their employees. For companies with between 20 and 99 employees, the percentage is 29%, and for those with between 100 and 500 employees was 13%. The training programs that companies are not applying present a high rate of effectiveness. An additional report mentions that when employees are shown phishing simulations in combination with continuous training, their click rate on these phishing links decreased by more than half, from 26% to 12%. In general, phishing is considered the biggest threat against SMEs today, more than half of the surveyed ethical hacking specialists consider it this way. Yet another 24% of respondents said they did not consider it their greatest threat, according to the report. On the other hand, employees of companies with less than 19 workers were the least likely to know any kind of cyber threat. As for phishing emails, there are very clear trends about their characteristics, explained in the report. The email titles most commonly associated with phishing campaigns are: Quick review/review Bank of &lt;EXAMPLE&gt;; New notification Donation for you For your information: Required action: Pay your account balance Unauthorized login attempt Notice of payment to &lt;EMPLOYEES NAME&gt; Important: (1) New Message from &lt;BANKS NAME&gt; AMAZON: Your order No # 812-4623 could arrive Bank Transfer Attend urgently The main threat to companies with between 20 and 99 employees is the ingenuity of their workers, with phishing reaching 22% of satisfactory attempts, so specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security recommend that SMEs focus on training their employees to manage the email they receive safely. However, many SMEs do not have the resources to handle security at the expert level, the report found. About 41% of respondents said they had no budget for IT security, and only 12% said they had dedicated internal cybersecurity personnel. A smaller portion of respondents said they had appealed to third parties for periodic cybersecurity reviews."

This concern has caused many territories to speak out against the implementation of these electronic ballot boxes. The sentence was meaningful, an expert on electronic voting and ethical hacking mentioned. Last May 2017, a lawsuit was filed against the Georgias Secretary of State for the use of these direct registration electronic voting machines (DRE). There are now less than two months left for the November legislative elections in the United States, when many of the new members of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the US Congress will be elected. Judge Totenberg mentioned in the trial that the lawsuit had taken place in the last moment and that switching to a voting system on paper could now jeopardize the upcoming elections, the turnout of voters and the orderly administration of the election day. However, he also recognized the seriousness of the threat posed by hackers, and she asked state officials why they did not have acted before. The Tribunal is really concerned about the low efficiency that the State has shown to respond to the serious vulnerabilities of its voting system, of which specialists in ethical hacking had warned since 2016, while software arrangements, hardware and other deficiencies of the program were evident even from before. The judge concluded: The Georgia states position in this litigation, and part of the testimony and evidence presented in the trial, indicated that the accused and the states electoral officials ignored the warnings. The judge therefore requests that the security concerns of the electronic ballot boxes be addressed and resolved by the relevant government agencies. There are 14 US states that will use electronic voting machines this election. During the process the voting will not be registered on paper. Specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security believe that there is a risk that people using electronic voting machines will begin to distrust the democratic process if the views of researchers on cybersecurity are not they take it seriously."

This is the highest fine imposed by the United Kingdom Data Protection Act, which dates back to 1998, although it might seem a little significant figure for a company worth 16 billion. In July this year, the UK Data Protection Agency had already issued the maximum fine allowed by this law to Facebook, due to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, saying that the social media giant could not prevent its citizens data to fall into the wrong hands. The Equifax data breach As experts in ethical hacking reported at the time, Equifax suffered a massive data violation last year between mid-May and late July, exposing highly sensitive data of up to 145 million people from around the world. The stolen information included the names of the victims, birth dates, phone numbers, drivers license details, addresses and social security numbers, as well as payment card information. Data theft occurred because the company did not respond adequately to a critical vulnerability of Apache Struts 2 (CVE-2017-5638), whose revisions had already been published by ethical hacking and cybersecurity companies. The UK Information Commissioners Office (ICO), which launched a joint investigation into the incident with the Financial Conduct Authority, issued the largest monetary penalty that the countrys Data Protection Act allows, 500k, equivalent to about $660k USD. ICO said that although cyberattack compromised Equifax systems in the United States, the company did not take appropriate measures to protect the personal information of its 15 million customers in the UK. Likewise, ICOs research revealed multiple failures in the company, which resulted in: Information exposure of 19 993 UK customers (including names, dates of birth, phone numbers and drivers license numbers) Deletion of 27 000 email accounts linked to Equifax Stealing passwords, personal information, and payment card information from 15 000 Equifax customers in United Kingdom ICO said Equifax was aware of a critical vulnerability in Apache Struts 2 by a security announcement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in March 2017, but the company did not take the appropriate steps to solve the problem. It was also known that the company kept the event hidden until a month after it was discovered, giving three senior executives of Equifax enough time to sell their shares for a value of almost $2M USD, although the company denied such claims. Equifax has already received the official notice of the fine, and is able to appeal the ICOs decision."

Recently, the Department detected suspicious activity in its non-classified e-mail system, which affects less than 1% of employees inbox. Like any large organization with global presence, we know that the State Department is an attractive target for computer criminals, says a statement from the Department. We have not detected particularly disturbing activity in the compromised system; employees possibly affected by this situation have already been notified. As it has been found, the research is ongoing and the Department is working with partner agencies, as well as with ethical hacking service providers to conduct a full case assessment. After the agency discovered the suspicious activity in its email system, it notified the incident to employees whose personal information might have been compromised. The State Department did not disclose to what kind of data the attackers had accessed, it has only made the mention that it is unclassified information, possibly personal data.

The lawsuit was filed in the California court over the course of this week. In the lawsuit against CrowdStrike, Symantec, ESET and the Anti-Malware Testing Organization (AMTSO), NSS Labs claims there is a conspiracy forged by these organizations to cover the serious deficiencies in the security tools they develop. NSS Lab accuses these organizations of forging a pact to collectively boycott NSS, an independent testing lab, because if all manufacturers refuse to be analyzed, there is not much that independent labs can do. These companies know about the flaws in their codes and do not act on it, they also actively conspire to avoid that analysis of independent ethical hacking experts that could reveal the deficiencies of their products, says a NSS Labs statement. This is a very serious matter; the manufacturers designed a scheme to avoid testing on their products and thus not to invest in repairs, regardless of the consequences for the bad results. In addition, the AMTSO, which should promote the best practices of cybersecurity and ethical hacking, is colluding with these companies, continues the statement of the claimant company. This is not the first controversy between NSS Labs and CrowdStrike; Last year, CrowdStrike filed a request against NSS Labs to prevent the publication of the test results made to one of its developments. Litigation continues to this day. In a statement published later, CrowdStrike denied the allegations of NSS Labs, mentioning that the lawsuit is baseless: NSS seeks to profit at the expense of software analysis by obtaining developments by fraudulent means; the organization is desperate to maintain its business model. We believe this demand is baseless. ESET, for its part, stated for several media: We are aware of the accusations made by NSS Labs. However, as legal proceedings have just begun, we cannot say more besides the fact that we categorically deny the accusations. Our customers must be sure that ESET products have been rigorously tested by many independent reviewers around the world, have received numerous awards for their level of protection for end users for many years and are widely recommended by specialists in ethical hacking. In face of these statements, NSS Labs maintains its position and affirms that the legal process against the aforementioned companies will continue."

Employee errors, such as sending an email to the wrong person, also represent 17% of these incidents. This is a problem and leads organizations to ask themselves, how much risk does our human capital generate? The problem is that professionals of cybersecurity and ethical hacking dont know where to start. Organizations often lack vision and only identify momentary incidents (such as phishing emails) instead of considering the impact over a longer period of time. This may cause the actual risk not to be valued correctly; however, there is a disciplined way to evaluate the risk generated by the human factor through a two-step analysis. First of all, what is the likelihood that an employee will bite a cyber attacks hook or accidentally leak confidential information from the organization? Second, what is the probability that this action will materialize in a data theft or system outage, and what is the potential cost of such incidents? Together, there are the two elements needed for an analysis using the standard model of Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR). These elements are frequency and impact. Together, these can help to glimpse this kind of events with a probability and a dollar value. The FAIR standard offers a way to use critical thinking that allows to measure risk scenarios. It also puts the context around loss events and provides information on the probable occurrence frequency and magnitude of the impact. This allows a structured way to collect the correct data, which provides a way to quantify the results as a range of probable results. Using the FAIR model, lets look at the risk of data theft due to accidental leaking of sensitive information. Instead of just solving the immediate problem, you should consider the systemic problems behind this data gap through the optics of FAIR, as this allows the companys security teams to have an idea of the frequency and magnitude of possible similar infringements in the future: Frequency How often do the emails we send contain confidential information? How often does an employee send an email incorrectly? Is the email information encrypted? Magnitude of impact Primary cost to solve information leaks Secondary costs of the security incident (for example, providing free information monitoring to affected customers or paying fines and/or lawsuits) With some solid data, based on the experience of the organization or industry standards, simulations can be performed to test thousands of possible results and generate a graph showing a range of potential losses according to the established criteria. In conclusion, there is a way to evaluate the human factor. Focus on defining and calculating the costs of final events that can cause losses in your organization, not so much on the people involved in your processes. As the experts in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security mention, you cannot dispose of humans without flaws, but you will have a better opportunity to handle inconvenient situations if you can identify the potential risks for your organization."

Patrick Wardle showed that macOS security can be omitted to access confidential user data, such as information in the address book. Defective implementation of the new security mechanism Patrick Wardle mentions that he was able to access the confidential user address through a non-privileged application, which means that it was not executed with administrator permissions. The ethical hacking expert says that the zero-day vulnerability derives from the way Apple implemented the protections for various privacy-related data. I found a trivial flaw, although 100% reliable in its implementation, said Wardle, adding that this vulnerability allows a malicious or unreliable application to bypass the new security mechanism and access confidential details without authorization. Wardle says the found vulnerability does not work with all of the new Mojave privacy protection features, and hardware-based components such as the webcam are not affected by this flaw. The expert in ethical hacking decided to reserve the technical details of his research until his participation in a cybersecurity related event. In a later test, Wardle attempted to copy the contents of the address book and deny the operation when the operating system requests permission. It then runs a non-privileged application that allowed him to copy the address book data to the desktop and provide access to the few entries he added for demonstration purposes. Finally, he ran a non-privileged application that allowed him to copy the Address book data to the desktop User Data protection on MacOS Mojave As part of new user data protection measures in macOS Mojave, users must explicitly provide apps their consent to access their location, contacts, calendars, reminders, photos and other files and private information. This means that applications can no longer do this automatically by simulating human interaction with the device (also known as synthetic clicks) using the prescribed APIs. Any such access is now blocked in Apples latest operating system, and an authorization notice is triggered for direct user interaction. To reduce the hassle generated by authorization notices, Apple included a pre-authorization feature for the applications the user wants to use. As experts in ethical hacking report from the International Institute of Cyber Security, this configuration can be done in the system preferences, security and privacy panel."

The competition was attended by hundreds of cybersecurity specialists facing different hacking tests. Zheng checked into the Fragrance Hotel on August 27th. One day later, he began to wonder about possible vulnerabilities in the hotels WiFi server. He successfully searched the default User ID and password of the hotels WiFi system through Google. After connecting to the hotels WiFi gateway, Zheng executed scripts, decrypted files and broken passwords within the next three days before accessing the hotels WiFi server database. The hotel server had a vulnerability that Zheng exploded to gain access, also tried to access the WiFi server from the Fragrance branch in the neighborhood known as Little India, but failed. The engineer documented his finding on his personal blog. By disclosing this information, Zheng knew that the vulnerability in the hotels WiFi server was likely to be exploited by others for illicit purposes, which could cause losses for the organization, said the city attorney. Zheng had been posting on his blog about server vulnerabilities since 2014, the prosecution said, although this incident is the first time he discovers a vulnerability by himself. The CSA found its blog and alerted the hotel managers. Zheng eliminated the blog post after he was asked to do so. The companys IT vice president presented a police report for hacking against Fragrance Hotel. According to specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the defense alleged that Zheng appeared to have committed the offense because of curiosity and that no tangible damage had been caused. However, the authorities discovered that the publication was retaken by different forums. According to the prosecution, since other hotels use the same server model, Zhengs actions could have led other hotels to be victims of cyberattacks thanks to Zhengs posts. For the offense of revealing the hotel passwords without authorization, Zheng could have been imprisoned for up to three years and received a fine of up to $10k USD, although the defense expects him to pay only $5k USD, as he has already spent a few days in jail."

Specialists in ethical hacking foresee that the GDPR will influence the budgetary decisions of 65% of the organizations until the end of 2018. They also believe that the impact that this has generated has reached a global scale. New legislation in the United States For example, the United States is discussing new legislation by taking as an example GDPR. The California Consumer Privacy Act, drafted this year, provides Californians with rights similar to those established for residents of the European Community, such as the Data Access Subject Request (DASR). By the year 2020, organizations that control or process personal data from US citizens shall to provide any information requested by their clients or employees through a request. Like GDPR, California law will not necessarily require the presence of the data subject in the territory. The Colorado Congress, on the other hand, is discussing the passage of a law that would force organizations to implement and maintain reasonable data security procedures, in addition to protecting personal information of Colorado residents. The bill also seeks to broaden the definition of personal information, as well as proposing changes in the established periods to report data theft and other security breaches. At the national level, the Consumer Privacy Act establishes for organizations a 30-day period to report security breaches after they happen. For its part, GDPR gives organizations only 72 hours to report the incident. Data protection in the United Kingdom The United Kingdom Information Commissioner Office (ICO) has pointed out that data protection and consumer privacy are today one of the main topics of discussion among British citizens. According to specialists in ethical hacking and data protection, UK legislators have drafted a new data protection law to keep up with GDPR after Brexit. Data privacy in Australia The Australian Privacy Act, like GDPR, focuses on consistent privacy regulation throughout its territory. This law seeks to facilitate the free flow of information out of Australian territory and ensures compliance with the privacy of the individual. These targets fall from Australias privacy principles, the first of which forces organizations to manage personal data in a transparent manner, thereby demonstrating compliance with all Australian legislation. Federal data protection in Mexico The Federal Data Protection Law Held by Private Parties is almost identical to its counterpart in the European Union. Experts on the subject commented that Mexico, like the EU, lives a decisive moment in terms of data protection, accountability is the key to good governance, and organizations that work with personal data in Mexico share this ideal. Mexico now demands organizations proactive compliance with privacy laws, in addition to the adoption and implementation of data protection measures. Accountability, consent and reporting GDPR is changing the way we do business around the world. Its main goal is to provide a unified framework for protecting the privacy of data from EU residents, which has led other countries to adopt similar measures, so experts in ethical hacking of the International Institute of Cyber Security believe that replicating this legislation can be beneficial for data protection and privacy."
523,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Vulnerability discovered in WiFi routers,1,9ldpzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9ldpzf/vulnerability_discovered_in_wifi_routers/,2018-10-05 02:59:03,"An error has been discovered in all modern WiFi routers that cannot be solved Specialists in ethical hacking and cybersecurity at the University of California reported the discovery of a vulnerability that leverages the interaction of two universal Internet protocols: the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and WiFi. This exploit does not appear to be traditional security vulnerability. Instead, the security flaw lies in a fundamental decision of Wi-Fi design made over 20 years ago, making it extremely difficult to correct. TCP has existed since the advent of the Internet and virtually all websites use it. TCP divides information into manageable fragments that can be transmitted between computers over the Internet. Each fragment, known as package, receives a number within a single sequence for that particular communication, ensuring that it is delivered correctly. The first number of the initial sequence is chosen randomly, but the following numbers are added in a predictable pattern, so the receiving device can organize them properly if they arrive in disorder. When you click to enlarge an image on a website, your computer asks the remote computer to send the image data. The remote computer divides the image data into numbered packets and sends them through the fastest routes. Your computer responds to recognize each package and assembles them in the correct order to display the selected image. According to the ethical hacking experts reports, for an attacker to be able to intercept this communication, he must pretend to be the sender and correctly guess the next number in the sequence. Because there are about 4 billion of possible sequences, it is almost impossible to guess successfully before the communication is complete. But if the attacker finds out which number triggers a response from the recipient, he can figure out the approximate range of the next number and send a malicious load that simulates arriving from the original sender. When the computer reassembles the packets, the user will find the content sent by the attacker. How can someone find out this number? Wireless routers can only transmit data in one direction at a time because they communicate with devices on their network on a single channel. Like walkie-talkies, if both parties send information at the same time, there will be interference. This is known as half duplex transmission, a feature of all routers. This means that there is always a time interval between a request and a response. If an attacker sends a falsified TCP packet with a random sequence number, followed by a normal package and an immediate response, the attacker will know that he is mistaken because in a half-duplex system, the recipient should take longer to respond to the spoofed package. If the response takes longer, the attacker will know that has being able to guess the sequence and can hijack the communication. To be contacted by a remote attacker, the victim must visit a website controlled by the attacker. The website runs a JavaScript that creates a TCP connection to a bank or other website chosen by the attacker. The victim is not aware that the connection has been established. In their experiments, the investigators found that the victim needs to stay on the malicious website only one or two minutes for the attack to succeed. Specialists in ethical hacking from the International Institute of Cyber Security commented that there is no solution to this security failure in the short term. The only solution would be to build routers that operate at different frequencies to transmit and receive data. According to experts who discovered the vulnerability, it is still about five years before it can be solved."

Many users may not consider it relevant for hackers to know their birth date or hometown, but would anyone really want a malicious actor to know their information from Tinder, Airbnb, or some other private service? A lot of this information might be useful to perform blackmail attacks to lots of users."

For the event launch, 100 ethical hackers selected by this institution spent nine hours in a row conducting scrutiny on the websites and public services of the Marine Corps looking for vulnerabilities. These cybersecurity specialists, who worked with U.S. Marine Corps Cyberspace Command (MARFORCYBER), presented 75 vulnerability reports during the hacking session and received a total of $80K USD in rewards. Maj. Matthew Glavy, commander of MARFORCYBER, said he was satisfied with the creation of this vulnerability bounty program. In a press release, he mentioned that the Hack the Marine Corps program allows us to leverage the talent of a global community of ethical hackers to have an honest and realistic view of our current cybersecurity tasks. Our Marines need to operate against the biggest threats. What we learn from this program will help the Marine Corps to improve their war platform, called the Marine Corps Enterprise Network. Working with the ethical hacking community means a profitable investment to identify and mitigate current critical vulnerabilities, reduce attack surfaces, and minimize future vulnerabilities. Hack the Marine Corps is the latest vulnerability report bounty program announced under the digital security initiative known as Hack the Pentagon. Since the creation of this program, cyber security organization experts have reported more than 5K vulnerabilities discovered in government defense systems. They have done so as part of Hack the Pentagons subprograms, including Hack the Army and Hack the Defense Travel System. According to reports of cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the Department of Defense designed the Hack the Marine Corps initiative to be executed on the HackerOne platform and focus on strengthening the security of the Marine Corps Enterprise Network warfighting platform, which involves people, processes, logical and physical infrastructure, architecture and operations in cyberspace."

The network security company launched the patches as part of a cyber security organization event, where researchers will present details about new variants of IPsec IKE attacks that could threaten VPN large scale use, for example, industrial information exchanges and backhaul of wireless operators executed in the Cisco kit. The attack is possible due to the reuse of a key pair in the first and second version of the internet key exchange protocol, IKE, IKEV1 and IKEv2, and it could allow an attacker to impersonate a network or conduct a Man-in-the-Middle attack against two parties. We demonstrate that reusing a key pair in different IKE versions and modes can cause attackers to avoid the inter-protocol authentication process, allowing them to impersonate a victim host or network, the cyber security organization team explained. In addition, we describe an offline dictionary attack against Pre Shared Key-based IKE modes, thus covering all of IKEs available authentication mechanisms. As the experts point out, although IKEv2 replaced IKEv1, both can be deployed on all major operating systems and network devices, such as firewalls. They also found the same IKE flaws on devices from competing manufacturers, such as Huawei, Clavister and ZyXEL. This included the Huawei Secospace USG2000 series firewall. According to cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, along with the Cisco patch for the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-0131, that affects IOS and its software IOS XE based on Linux, Huawei, Clavister and ZyXEL have launched a new firmware for avoid exploiting the vulnerability in their respective developments. Cisco has rated the bug as a medium-severity problem. The problem only affects IOS, the most widely deployed software for CISCO switches and routers, and IOS XE software when the authentication rsa-encr option is enabled. Vulnerabilities in the implementation of RSA-encoded nonces in Cisco IOS software and Cisco IOS XE software could allow a hacker without authentication to remotely get the encrypted nonces of IKEV1 session, Cisco explained. The vulnerability exists because the affected software responds incorrectly to the decryption failures. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted ciphers to a device configured with IKEV1 that uses nonces encrypted in RSA. If the vulnerability is successfully exploited it could allow the attacker to obtain the encrypted nonces. The company comments that there is no record of the successful exploitation of this vulnerability for malicious purposes."

Originally proposed in April 2017, the law requires the director of NIST, within one year of the adoption of the law, to issue guidance and a set of resources to help small and medium-sized enterprises identify, evaluate and reduce their cyber security organization risks. The law also calls on NIST, a division of the Department of Commerce, to consider the needs of small businesses in developing these recommendations, which must be widely applicable and technology-neutral and include elements that promote the implementation of simple and basic controls, culture of cyber security organization in the workplace and relations with interested third parties. In a press release, Senator Brian Schatz said that as companies are increasingly reliant on the Internet to operate efficiently and reach more customers, they will continue to be vulnerable to cyber attacks. While big companies have the resources to protect themselves, small businesses dont, and thats exactly what makes them an easy target for hackers; this new law will grant small businesses the tools to reinforce their cyber security organization infrastructure and fight against hackers, the senator mentioned. Small businesses are not immune to threats and are often not equipped with resources or IT staff to protect their networks, a cyber security organization expert said. NISTs Small Business Cyber Security Act will provide small and medium-sized entrepreneurs with the minimum resources and a simplified cyber security framework so they can effectively protect their companies from threats. Cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that the Small Business Cyber Security Act is a major victory for the cyber security industry and for businesses struggling to operate in accordance with NIST standards."

No one said police work would be easy. Undermining the security of hundreds of millions of users to investigate a few cases is ridiculous, said Brad Smith, cyber security specialist. This statement refers to a lawsuit by the Department of Justice against Apple that sought to force the tech company to build a background version of their iOS mobile operating system, to help FBI research on San Bernardino shootings. Shortly thereafter, the FBI left the case, after an external contractor helped them unlock an iPhone 5c used by one of the deceased shooters. Since then, the legal battle and the questions related to the case have been unresolved. Anyways, new evidence suggests that the Justice Department has continued its attempts to force technology vendors to build backdoors on their products and services. The latest of these attempts, according to cyber security organization experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, comes from a case presented by the Department of Justice against Facebook in the Federal Court of California, which aims to force Facebook to create a specially crafted version of its Messenger app, so the FBI can listen to a suspects voice conversations. Although the documents relating to the case remain sealed, three sources have mentioned that Facebook would have come to court to block the governments request. On Tuesday, international media reported that the Government has requested that Facebook be accused of contempt for the FBI request. This seems to be related to a research on the Mara Salvatrucha group. This street gang with international presence has around 10K members in the US, where it remains an unresolved issue. Trumps administration regularly refers to this group in its quest to implement more severe immigration policies. This case is a sign that the Justice Department is still looking for ways to monitor end-to-end encrypted messaging services. If the US government were favored, this case could be used in future scenarios to force other companies to moderate the encryption of their messaging services. Meanwhile, the FBI continues to argue that it should be granted with access to any device, as long as it has a legal order. In January, for example, FBI cyber security organization teams argued that manufacturers should include backdoors in devices launched to sale. Cyber security organization expert William H. Murray accused the FBI of hiding its true motives. This is a source of evidence that didnt even exist 10 years ago, he said about smartphones. For the cybersecurity expert, while backdoors exclusively designed for government- use area good idea, just in theory. In practice, this means that any system would be weakened and vulnerable for attacks."

According to a security advisory from the US Department of Homeland Securitys Computer Emergency Readiness Team, the first vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2018-14787, affecting IntelliSpace Cardiovascular and Xcelera IntelliSpace Cardiovascular (ISCV), both Philips developments. The notice mentions that the vulnerability only requires basic hacking ability to be exploited, and is caused by improper management. In ISCV software version 2.x or earlier, and Xcelera version 4.1 or earlier, an attacker is able to access folders on the system that might have executables that provide the attacker with authentication to overwrite the system. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could grant an attacker with local access and user privileges to the ISCV server or Xcelera to execute arbitrary code. The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-14789, affects the ISCV system version 3.1 or earlier and Xcelera version 4.1 or earlier. Unquoted search paths allow attackers to increase their privilege levels and execute arbitrary codes. In a Philips security notice, it was mentioned that the servers for ISCV version 2.x and above and Xcelera from 3x to 4 x contain 20 Windows services whose executables are present in a folder where authenticated users are granted permissions to overwrite. Services run as a local administrator account or a local system account, and if a user replaces one of the executables with a different program, that program would also run with local administrator or local system permissions, the company mentioned. In ISCV version 3.x and above and Xcelera 3.x to 4.x, there are 16 vulnerable Windows services; these services are run with local administrator rights and can be started with a registry key, potentially offering an attacker a path to place an executable that grants local administrator rights. Vulnerabilities cannot be remotely exploited and no reports have been received indicating exploitation in the wild. The mitigations will be applied through a patch that will be released next October. Meanwhile, Philips suggests users should restrict the available permissions when possible. The United States takes very seriously even the slightest security flaw in medical devices. There is a background of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which once ordered the removal of 465 St. Jude pacemakers to correct several flaws, the vulnerabilities found in these systems can cause anxiety in patients and they even could stop working suddenly. Cyber security organization specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security consider that FDA recommendations should not go unnoticed for those involved in these cases."
531,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Google could be selling compromised security tool: Titan Security Key,2,9dkbq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/9dkbq0/google_could_be_selling_compromised_security_tool/,2018-09-07 02:32:48,"The company faces questions about the implementation of a new security tool Google has recently began selling a piece of hardware called Titan Security Key, which functions as an additional cybersecurity measure by adding two-factor authentication in different online environments; however, ethical hacking specialists question the way in which the company has implemented this tool. A post in the company blog mentions that the security key can be used in any environment where there is support for such tools, including Googles Advanced Protection Program, aimed to those who may be at higher risk of cyberattacks, like journalists, activists, and politicians. However, when someone logs into Advance Protection Program site, after clicking the Get started option the site redirects you to a page that mentions that you need two security keys, one as the main tool, and another as backup. The backup option offered by Google is the security key Yubico FIDO U2F, available at Amazon, which seems legitimate; the problem lies in the main key that Google asks users to acquire, the security key MultiPass FIDO from Feitian Technologies, a China-based security company. As ethical hacking experts have noted, it seems that the Titan security key is the same hardware as Feitian MultiPass FIDO, just marketed by a different brand. Feitian is a member of the Chinese TI-military alliance, comprising 12 companies. According to international observers, Feitian mentions that the head of the General Department of Armaments expressed a deep interest in its products and that the company would provide service to the military market under the great strategy of civil-military integration. Researchers specializing in the Asian country mention that there is no way in which a Chinese company can decline to integrate into government intelligence activities. For ethical hacking experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security, the problem is not that Feitian is responsible for cyber threats, surveillance or other related facts. The question is on Google and its apparent decision to establish deep links with a Chinese company that could potentially compromise its protection programs. In other words, Feitian could be forced by the Chinese government in the name of State intelligence activities, and would have no choice but to comply. The Google program is designed to protect the type of people that the Chinese government can have a serious interest in, such as political activists protesting against Chinas control and censorship measures. By directing those who are in their protection program with a hardware vendor that has not implemented Googles own brand firmware, there is the possibility that a different firmware could be used, both hardware-level and firmware backdoors could be exploited, and other forms of alteration in the manufacturing stage, all of which would be out of Googles control. Descriptions offered from Feitian security keys, whether purchased directly or through Amazon, do not mention the inclusion of Google firmware in any way. This leads several ethical hacking experts to wonder: why the variant of the key that is offered in Google Store offers the Google firmware, while the keys required for the protection program does not? If such a strict security standard is being implemented, why use the hardware manufactured by actors closely related to a government so interested in monitoring its opponents as the Chinese? The most optimistic view is to think that Google was unaware of the link between the China government and Feitian Technologies, although no one really believes that the company has acted with such ignorance of the Chinese company."

Based on a robust software infrastructure, Mirai still seems to be quite functional and lethal, as it requires minimal effort to update it and it does not need a very talented hacker. In other words, infecting lots of systems with a botnet today is very easy and the attack pattern seems clear and uncomplicated: Download the source code of Mirai and change the exploits, but this time the story did not have a happy ending for the hacker. Ethical hacking experts from the International Institute of Cyber Security Report that a 20-year-old man from Washington was indicted last week on federal hacking charges after rival actors pointed to him as the creator of a botnet that compromised routers from all over the world. Last December, ethical hacking specialists from a cybersecurity firm discovered the link between the botnet known as Satori and an amateur hacker identified as Nexus Zeta, who frequented a web forum for amateur hackers. Two months later, a Pastebin message that happened almost unnoticed intended to reveal the true identity of Nexus Zeta, identifying as Kenneth Schuchman, who turned out to be the same person recently indicted. Schuchman, who lives in Vancouver, Washington with his father, now faces this accusation, although the indict does not mention the malware, it is reported that all signs point to the botnet Satori, which emerged last fall and has infected at least 500k Internet routers around the world. The activity of botnet Satori has been closely observed by experts in ethical hacking since the end of last year, and they have identified the phases of its development: Researchers discovered a Zero-day vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2017-17215) on the Huawei HG532 home router, and hundreds of thousands of attempts to exploit it were also identified. The delivered payload was identified as OKIRU/Satori, an updated variant of Mirai software. The suspect behind the attack was identified by his nickname, Nexus Zeta For these cybercriminals wannabe, the emotional stability is a weak point, because it is reported that Schuchman boasted of being a black hat hacker even in his social media profiles, like Facebook, without worrying in any way to assume the responsibility for his actions."

The report, published by a Moscow-based cybersecurity firm, analyses the activity of a previously unreported cybercriminal group called Silence. According to this report, this group has spent the last three years deploying silent cyberattacks in different financial institutions in Russia and Eastern Europe. The group went unnoticed for years, mainly because of its willingness to use legitimate tools and applications included in the victims computers, a practice known as living of the earth. However, it is reported that Silence has also developed its own tools, for example: Silence: A framework for infrastructure attacks Atmosphere: A set of software tools for ATMs cash-out Farse: A tool to obtain passwords from a compromised device Cleaner: A tool for logon deleting These tools, jointly with the groups mode of operation, have helped them to go unnoticed for much longer than many of his counterparts. By analyzing this mode of operation, Russian experts in ethical hacking have been able to identify the attacks perpetrated by Silence. The first hack attributed to Silence took place in July 2016; it was a failed attempt to withdraw money through the Russian interbank transaction system known as the Automated Work Station Client (AWS). According to the report, hackers gained access to the system, but the attack was unsuccessful due to inadequate payment order preparation, so bank employees were able to cancel the transaction. However, the banks remediation efforts were not enough and Silence regained access to the same banks network a month later; although this time they adopted another approach. Hackers downloaded the software to take screenshots and proceeded to investigate the work of the operator using video transmission, although this attack was also stopped. However, Silence did not surrender and in October 2017 they finally managed to hack into a banking institution and steal some money. For doing so, the group stopped trying to transfer money using the AWS system and switched to the banks ATM control systems, which makes the ATMs emit cash at a given time, an attack known as jackpotting. Ethical hacking specialists from the International Institute of Cyber Security mention that, thanks to this tactic, Silence was able to steal more than 100k USD during its first successful cyberattack. Other attacks that repeated the same pattern were later discovered and were linked to the Silence group in the following months, such as the theft of more than 550k USD in February 2018 and another 150k USD in April 2018."

According to reports of experts in enterprise data protection services from the International Institute of Cyber Security, these incidents have increased by 32% between the first quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. The frequency of these attacks is thought to be directly related to the availability of ready-to-use malicious programs. Information security experts have analyzed about 25 dark web sites to determine the cost of the major cyber crime services, from the most simple to the most complex. With Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access tools sold on dark web for $10, computer users have seen how easily their computers can be compromised. However, these low-cost tools do not stop in RDP, and some complex services are at incredibly low prices: E-mail hack: $40 DoS Attack: $50 Website hacking: $150 Theft of payment card information: $270 Infection with mining trojan: $300 Infection with ransomware trojan: $750 ATM theft: $1500 Targeted attack: $4500 Starting with $40, hackers can infiltrate a companys email and steal confidential information. With such a low price for attacks, these criminal acts are no longer directed only at large companies. Specialists in enterprise data protection services say that about 71% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are not prepared to face cybersecurity risks, and with the cheapness of organizing an attack, they need to get the proper defense. Big companies are not safe either. Since the costs are so low, hackers could buy multiple attack services to target large companies from different angles. If hackers cant afford the biggest and most dangerous attacks, they can still do damage with several smaller attacks. As you can see, company security, no matter if its a small or large company, is under constant threat due to the large amount and accessibility of resources for malicious agents use, it is the responsibility of employers to establish contact with enterprise data protection services experts to know the best options to guarantee the security of their companys information."

Information security experts commented that the malware called VPNFilter was developed by the group of Russian hackers Sofacy, also known as Fancy Bear and APT28. The FBI confirmed the information, since last week it obtained an order to capture a domain used to control the infected routers. Cisco Talos Intelligence revealed in a report that 500,000 routers made by Linksys, MikroTik, Netgear and TP-Link had been infected with VPNFilter. This malware collects traffic sent through infected routers, such as website credentials. But the most worrisome ability is that the malware authorizes malicious actors to erase a part of the firmware of an infected device, rendering it unusable. According to information security professionals, hackers could selectively destroy a single device or all infected devices at the same time. In a report, last week Cisco, after observing an increase in infections in Ukraine, accused Russia of planning an attack to coincide with the final of the Champions League on Saturday in Kiev. The country similarly blamed Russia for last years NotPetya attacks that affected organizations in Ukraine and spread within multinational corporations with offices in Ukraine. Users with infected routers can eliminate the dangers of Stage 2 and Stage 3 of VPNFilter by rebooting the device, information security experts said. They also commented that Phase 1 of VPNFilter will persist after a reboot, allowing attackers to reinfect the compromised routers. On Wednesday the FBI seized the web address, ToKnowAll. Com, which could have been used to reinstall the Stage 2 and Stage 3 malware, now all traffic to this address is directed to a server under the control of the FBI. However, the FBI is recommending all router owners to restart the devices, even if they were not manufactured by the affected vendors. This will help neutralize the threat and identify infected devices. The FBI recommends that any router owner restart the devices to temporarily disrupt the malware and assist in the possible identification of infected devices, the FBI said in a public announcement. Owners are advised to consider deactivating remote management settings on devices and security with strong passwords and encryption when they are enabled. The network devices should be updated to the latest available firmware versions, the statement said. Information security experts said the server controlled by the FBI with which infected devices communicate will collect the IP addresses of the devices. The addresses are shared with a non-profit cybersecurity group, which disseminates the addresses to foreign CERTs and ISPs. It is not yet known how the attackers initially infected the routers, but Symantec noted in a report on VPNFilter that many of them have critical vulnerabilities. For the most part, the identified devices use predetermined credentials and / or have exploits, particularly for earlier versions. There is currently no indication that the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities is involved in the spread of the threat, the researchers wrote. Known infected devices include: Linksys E1200 Linksys E2500 Linksys WRVS4400N MikroTik RouterOS for Cloud Core routers: versions 1016, 1036 and 1072 Netgear DGN2200 Netgear R6400 Netgear R7000 Netgear R8000 Netgear WNR1000 Netgear WNR2000 QNAP TS251 QNAP TS439 Pro Other QNAP NAS devices running the QTS software TP-Link R600VPN"

Among the signatories of the new the Cybersecurity Tech Accord are Arm, Dell, Facebook, Cisco, HPE, Microsoft, and Trend Micro. The pact was signed at the RSA Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. The [information security](URL researchers said that the accord comprises four key principles. First, the companies promise to first protect all users, whether they be individuals, organizations or governments and irrespective of their technical acumen, culture, location or the motives of the attacker, whether criminal or geopolitical. The organizations will also oppose cyber-security attacks on innocent citizens and enterprises from anywhere, which includes a pledge to not help governments launch cyber-attacks. Third, the firms promise to empower users, customers and developers to strengthen cyber-security protection by providing more information and tools. The companies will also establish formal and informal partnerships with industry, civil society and information security researchers in order to improve technical collaboration, coordinated vulnerability disclosure and threat sharing, as well as to minimize the levels of malicious code being introduced into cyber-space. The signatories will also encourage global information sharing and civilian efforts to identify, prevent, detect, respond to and recover from cyber-attacks and ensure flexible responses to security of the wider global technology ecosystem. Kevin Simzer, chief operating officer at Trend Micro, said that the The real-world consequences of cyber-threats have been repeatedly proven. As an industry, we must band together to fight cyber-criminals and stop future attacks from causing even more damage. Carolyn Herzog, general counsel of Arm, said that the accord will help to protect the integrity of the one trillion connected devices we expect to see deployed within the next 20 years. In a post, Microsoft president Brad Smith said that the success of this alliance is not just about signing a pledge, its about execution. Thats why today is just an initial step and tomorrow we start the important work of growing our alliance and take effective action together, [information security expert](URL said. Protecting our online environment is in everyones interest. The companies that are part of the Cybersecurity Tech Accord promise to defend and advance technologys benefits for society. And we commit to act responsibly, to protect and empower our users and customers, and help create a safer and more secure online world. We believe our membership in the Microsoft Intelligent Security Association is a huge win for our mutual customers and prospects, said Chuck Leaver, CEO of Ziften. As security vendors, we all recognize the need to cooperate and collaborate to protect our customers and their employees. Kudos to Microsoft for leading this industry effort. The days of siloed endpoint security tools that provide only incomplete, point-in-time data exposing organizations to unacceptable risks and unnecessary costs is ending. Together, we help security teams to address todays visibility, security and control challenges at the endpoint and in the cloud. Guy Bunker, SVP of products at Clearswift, told that the cynical view would be that this is a marketing stunt. The reality is that while there is legislation appearing across the globe to protect citizens (for example, EU GDPR), these are all aimed at organizations who use technology, rather than something for those who create it, he said. The IT world has always created standards and consortiums for the greater good  and this is just that. By coming together, a new set of standards will be created which should result in better joined up security for those who use technology from the different vendors. For the wider industry, this is about making everybody safer when sharing information and increasing cooperation where applicable. The information security expert Amit Yoran, CEO, Tenable, told that the growing threat of cyber-attacks and offensive cyber- weapons endangers all of us, from consumers and private businesses to government agencies. As information security professionals, we have a social responsibility to protect everyone online and support foundational cyber-hygiene practices among private citizens and organizations of all sizes. Were focused on empowering organizations everywhere to understand and reduce their cyber-security risk. Thats always been our mission as an organization, and this Accord solidifies that commitment, he said."
537,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Several Pentesting Tools and Techniques Used by Information Security Experts,1,8drmm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8drmm9/several_pentesting_tools_and_techniques_used_by/,2018-04-21 08:35:32,"Technology is pulsing all around you, and in the short amount of time that you are hosted in this network that you must try to understand its inner workings. Fortunately or unfortunately, most network and system administrators are persons of habit. All you have to do is listen for long enough, and more often than not it will yield some of those juicy findings, [information security](URL experts say. Regardless of any discussion beforehand, a penetration test has a competitive feel from both sides. Consulting pentesters want their flag, and administrators want their clean bill of health to show that they are resilient to cyber-attack; something akin to a game of flag football. The difference here is that in flag football, both teams are familiar with the tools used to play the game. It goes without saying that a pentesters job is to simulate a legitimate threat to effectively determine your organizations risk, but how can remediation happen without at least some familiarity? Sun Tzu once said, If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle. In order to truly secure our networks, any administrator with cybersecurity duties will need to not only understand what they themselves have, but also step into the shoes of the opposite side. This articles intention is to focus on the why and not completely the how. There are countless videos and tutorials out there to explain how to use the tools, and much more information than can be laid out in one blog post. Additionally, I acknowledge that other testers out there may have an alternate opinion on these tools, and which are the most useful. This list is not conclusive. With that being said, lets get into the list. Responder This tool, in the information security expert opinion, makes the absolute top of the list. When an auditor comes in and talks about least functionality, this is what comes immediately to mind. If you are a pentester, Responder is likely the first tool you will start running as soon as you get your Linux distro-of-choice connected to the network and kick off the internal penetration test. The tool functions by listening for and poisoning responses from the following protocols: Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) There is more to Responder, but I will only focus on these three protocols for this article. NBT-NS is a remnant of the past; a protocol which has been left enabled by Microsoft for legacy/compatibility reasons to allow applications which relied on NetBIOS to operate over TCP/IP networks. LLMNR is a protocol designed similarly to DNS, and relies on multicast and peer-to-peer communications for name resolution. It came from the Vista era, and we all know nothing good came from that time-frame. You probably dont even use either of these. Attackers know this, and use it to their advantage. WPAD on the other hand serves a very real and noticeable purpose on the network. Most enterprise networks use a proxy auto-config (PAC) file to control how hosts get out to the Internet, and WPAD makes that relatively easy. The machines broadcast out into the network looking for a WPAD file, and receive the PAC which is given. This is where the poisoning happens. The information security professionals are aware that most protocols which rely on any form of broadcasting and multicasting are ripe for exploitation. PowerShell Empire Before, pentesters typically relied on Command and Control (C2) infrastructure where the agent first had to reside on-disk, which naturally would get uploaded to Virus Total upon public release and be included in the next mornings antivirus definitions. The time spent evading detection was a seemingly never-ending cat-and-mouse game. It was as if the collective unconscious of pentesters everywhere came to the realization that the most powerful tool at their disposal was already present on most modern workstations around the world. A framework had to be built, and the Empire team made it so. The focus on pentesting frameworks and attack tools has undoubtedly shifted towards PowerShell for exploitation and post-exploitation. It means that some of the security controls you have put in place may be easily bypassed. File-less agents (including malware) can be deployed by PowerShell and exist in memory without ever touching your hard disk or by connecting a USB. A write-up mentioned at the end of this post elaborates much further into this topic. Existing in memory makes antivirus whose core function is scanning disk significantly less effective. Fortunately, information security researchers say, that the best mitigation here is something you may already have access to , Microsofts Applocker. Granted, white listing can take some time to stand up properly and likely requires executive sign-off, but it is the direction endpoint security is heading. This is a good opportunity to get ahead of the curve. When it comes to mitigation; the execution policy restrictions in PowerShell are trivial to bypass. Hashcat with Wordlists This combo right here is an absolute staple. Cracking hashes and recovering passwords is pretty straightforward of a topic at a high level. Hashcat is a GPU-focused powerhouse of a hash cracker which supports a huge variety of formats, typically used in conjunction with hashes captured by Responder. In addition to Hashcat, a USB hard drive with several gigs of wordlists is a must. On every pentest that the information security analysts have been on, time had to be allocated appropriately to maximize results, and provide the most value to the client. Sysadmins, think about your baseline policies and configurations. Typically it is best practice to align with an industry standard, such as the infamous DISA STIG, as closely as possible. Baselines such as DISA STIG support numerous operating systems and software, and contain some key configurations to help you prevent against offline password cracking and replay attacks. This includes enforcing NIST recommended password policies, non-default authentication enhancements, and much more. DISA even does the courtesy of providing you with pre-built Group Policy templates that can be imported and custom-tailored to your organizations needs, which cuts out much of the work of importing the settings. Web Penetration Testing Tools It is important to note that a web penetration testing tool is not the same as a vulnerability scanner. Web-focused tools absolutely have scanning capabilities to them, and focus on the application layer of a website versus the service or protocol level. Granted, vulnerability scanners (Nessus, Nexpose, Retina, etc) do have web application scanning capabilities, though I have observed that it is best to keep the two separate. Many organizations nowadays build in-house web apps, intranet sites, and reporting systems in the form of web applications. Typically that since the site is internal it does not need to be run through the security code review process, and gets published out for all personnel to see and use. The surface area of most websites leaves a lot of room for play to find something especially compromising. Some of the major issues are: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). SQL Injection. Authentication bypass. Directory traversal abuse. Unrestricted file upload. If you administer an organization that builds or maintains any internal web applications, think about whether or not that code is being reviewed frequently. Code reuse becomes an issue where source code is imported from unknown origins, and any security flaws or potentially malicious functions come with it. Furthermore, the Always Be Shipping methodology which has overtaken software development as of late puts all of the emphasis on getting functional code despite the fact that flaws may exist. Acquaint yourself with OWASP, whose entire focus is on secure application development. Get familiar with the development teams Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and see if security testing is a part of it. OWASP has some tips to help you make recommendations. Understand the two methodologies for testing applications, including: Static Application Security Testing (SAST). The applications source code is available for analysis. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). Analyzes the application while in an operational state. Additionally you will want to take the time to consider your web applications as separate from typical vulnerability scans. Tools (open and closed source) exist out there, including Burp Suite Pro, OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP), Acunetix, or Trustwave, with scanning functionality that will crawl and simulate attacks against your web applications. Scan your web apps at least quarterly. Arpspoof and Wireshark Arpspoof is a tool that allows you to insert yourself between a target and its gateway, and Wireshark allows you to capture packets from an interface for analysis. You redirect the traffic from an arbitrary target, such as an employees workstation during a pentest, and snoop on it. Likely the first theoretical attack presented to those in cybersecurity, the infamous Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is still effective on modern networks, information security researchers said. Considering most of the world still leans on IPv4 for internal networking, and the way that the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) has been designed, a traditional MitM attack is still quite relevant. According to [information security](URL researcher, many falsely assume that because communications occur inside their own networks, they are safe from being snooped on by an adversary and therefore do not have to take the performance hit of encrypting all communications in their own subnets. Granted, your network is an enclave of sorts from the wild west of the Internet, and an attacker would first have to get into your network to stand between communications. Now, lets assume that a workstation is compromised by an attacker in another country using a RAT equipped with tools that allow a MitM to take place. Alternately, consider the insider threat. The information security experts said that the best tactics of defense are: encrypt your communications. Never assume communications inside your network are safe just because there is a gateway device separating you from the Internet. Keep your VLAN segments carefully tailored, and protect your network from unauthenticated devices. Implementing a Network Access Control (NAC) system is something you may want to add to your security roadmap in the near future or implementing 802.1X on your network may be a good idea. Shut down those unused ports, and think about sticky MACs if you are on a budget."

The three financial institutions maintain their operations under the contingency scheme, which could affect their service from Friday, April 27, reported the Bank of Mexico. The contingency schemes were activated in the presence of incidents that affected their electronic transfer service, said information security analysts. This attempt of cyber attack affected the process of connection with the SPEI, which caused several banks to operate under a contingency program, which generates a delay in electronic transfers. Professionals of [information security](URL and private solutions explained that these incidents could be cyber attacks aimed at the operating system of the local network of the affected banks. Until last Friday, there were no indications of impairment of client resources in any of the institutions participating in the system, the central bank said in a statement. These problems of cybersecurity have been recorded for a couple of weeks and reached a critical point. The researchers said that the closing of operations in the stock market was also affected, since some investor positions were not covered, risk that the involved banks will have to assume if it is confirmed that they did not reach to be processed. Due to this, the Indeval (it is a private institution that has authorization according to the Law, to operate as a Central Securities Depository), which operates in the financial system with the services of guardianship, custody, administration, compensation and liquidation of securities. , is also analyzing this affectation, which would be secondary and would not have any direct problem in the investors, since the banks would have to liquidate the positions that were not processed by this problem. These incidences generated economic losses in some institutions, but an impact on users was ruled out and it was also ruled out that it was a systemic risk, since the Bank of Mexico systems were not affected. [Information security](URL experts reviewed the websites of deep web, black market and communications between several groups of hackers, according to this analysis it may be that Banxico and Bancomext detected traces of a backdoor in their systems. This means that a malicious actor was monitoring the activities of Mexican financial institutions, to take advantage of the right moment For its part, the Bank of Mexico stated that the SPEI infrastructure was not affected and there were no signs of affecting the resources of the clients of any of the participating institutions in the aforementioned system. However, due to the connection with the SPEI under contingency schemes, customers may experience slowness, both in the remittances and in the receipt of resources, from other financial institutions, possibly a few hours, and delays in consulting electronic payment certificates. If an operation was not carried out due to the incident with the SPEI and it was destined to pay a credit, the bank will not be able to charge any surcharge or collection charge, said Mario Di Costanzo, president of the National Commission for the Protection and Defense of the Users of Financial Services (Condusef). Since October, in a report, Banxico asserted that the interconnection of the global financial system demands the reinforcement of mechanisms to share information, identify threats and resolve crises. And he cites as a threat the risks of cyber attacks against the institutions and organizations that constitute the infrastructure of the financial system. According to information security analysts, on January 10 of this year, Bancomext had suspended operations, assuming emergency protocols to contain a hacking attempt. Reported that, despite its robust security measures, on January 9 was the victim of an impairment in its international payment platform caused by a third party."
539,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Defiance in Securing Connected Hospitals,1,8b2szb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/8b2szb/defiance_in_securing_connected_hospitals/,2018-04-10 08:55:07,"In past researches, [information security training](URL experts examined internet-connected medical-related devices and systems such as databases, hospital admin consoles, and medical devices. The professionals also looked into the supply chain, which has been an attack vector that is often overlooked. Based on research into cyberthreats against hospitals, they have identified three broad areas of interest that are at high risk of being targeted by cybercriminals. Hospital operations: The cyberthreats against everyday critical systems such as staff scheduling databases, hospital paging systems, building controls, pneumatic tube transport systems, inventory systems, payroll, administration, etc. Data privacy: Cyberthreats against different types of data such as personally identifiable information (PII), for both patients and hospital employees, including patient diagnosis and treatment data; insurance and financial information; research and drug trial data; payroll; intellectual property (IP), etc. Patient health: These encompass cyberthreats against medical devices and systems that are used for the treatment, monitoring, and diagnosis of patients, as well as cyberthreats against the hospital information system (HIS). Healthcare institutions in the U.K. were found not up to cybersecurity standards when National Health Service (NHS) trusts were affected by the WannaCry ransomware in May 2017. According to the National Audit Office report on the incident, the attack managed to compromise a total of 37 trusts, indirectly disrupt 44 more trusts, and infect 603 primary care and other NHS organizations, throwing the entire healthcare system of the U.K. into disarray for a couple of days. Thus, it may be valuable to examine why hospitals would have poor cybersecurity. Some of the possible reasons put forward include the following: The purpose of a healthcare facility is patient care and that is where the bulk of resources are invested, leaving a little budget available for cybersecurity spending. Hospital computers and diagnostic equipment have many users, e.g., doctors, nurses, and technicians, who rotate regularly within the hospital. This makes incorporating strict cybersecurity policies and authentication procedures very difficult, especially if those policies impede daily operations. Diagnostic equipment is extremely expensive and hospitals cannot afford to have their medical devices offline for prolonged periods for maintenance. In some cases, modifying medical device settings or updating their embedded OS will void the devices certification, warranty, and insurance coverage, so medical devices remain untouched. Expensive diagnostic equipment is not replaced regularly as long as they are functioning correctly. These devices and systems may no longer have support or would be costly to replace. Diagnostic equipment manufacturers are responsible for ensuring their equipment meet the HITRUST CSF guidelines for medical devices. Given the CSF is regularly updated, older medical devices that are still being used in hospitals may not meet the requirements. Not all hospitals have a dedicated cybersecurity response team. In most hospitals, the IT staff does double duty: They investigate and mitigate cyberattack incidents, as well as provide general IT services to the hospital. This setup has the critical drawback of spreading resources thin for both functions. These observations are evident in the major findings. For the research, [information security training](URL professionals searched for exposed devices in hospitals and clinics using Shodan, a search engine for internet-connected devices. The analysts found Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) systems exposed to the internet, including those owned by 21 universities. These systems can expose images for procedures such as CT (computed tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), and PET (positron emission tomography) scans, ultrasound, X-ray, fluoroscopy, angiography, mammography, and endoscopy. Exposed medical systems potentially jeopardize critical data such as patients PII and medical records. The United States has the most exposed DICOM servers according to our findings in Shodan. While a device or system being exposed does not necessarily mean that it is vulnerable, it should not be viewable publicly. The researchers also found exposed electronic medical records (EMRs). But what was more fascinating is how common it was to find pharmacy management software interfaces. This specialized software is used by pharmacies for various integrated management functions such as drug inventory, drug ordering, OTC management, narcotics tracking, patient data, patient prescription history, point-of-sale (PoS) transactions, drug insurance claims, prescriptions and refills, and label printing. Besides, the information security training experts found a patient scheduling or appointment system that contained the patients diagnosis information. Another aspect of healthcare networks that the [information security training](URL consultants explored was threats to the hospital supply chain. Supply chain threats are potential risks associated with suppliers of goods and services to healthcare organizations where a perpetrator can exfiltrate confidential or sensitive information, introduce an unwanted function or design, disrupt daily operations, manipulate data, install malicious software, introduce counterfeit devices, and affect business continuity. Third-party vendors have credentials that include log-ins, passwords, and badge access which can be compromised. These vendors can also store physical records, medical devices, and office equipment. Hospitals need to be supplied by a robust supply chain to ensure uninterrupted service to patients, and thus protecting the hospital supply chain against cyberattacks becomes a critical necessity."
540,cybersecurity,u_webimprints09,Cybersecurity Framework o ISO 27001?,1,80hmr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_webimprints09/comments/80hmr4/cybersecurity_framework_o_iso_27001/,2018-02-27 10:31:01,"Hace unos meses, el Instituto Nacional de Estndares y Tecnologa (NIST por sus siglas en ingles) hizo una publicacin para mejorar la seguridad ciberntica de infraestructura crtica, conocido comnmente como Cybersecurity Framework. Esto trajo muchas dudas si ya se est familiarizado con ISO 27001. Cybersecurity Framework se dise inicialmente para las empresas de EE. UU. Que se consideran parte de la infraestructura crtica. No obstante, es adecuado para ser utilizado por cualquier organizacin que enfrenta riesgos de seguridad ciberntica. Por otro lado, ISO / IEC 27001 es una norma de seguridad ciberntica publicada en 2005 y revisada en 2013. Si bien no es obligatorio, se acepta en la mayora de los pases como un marco principal para la implementacin de la seguridad de datos. Describe el sistema de gestin de la seguridad de datos y sita la seguridad en el contexto de la gestin y los procesos generales de una empresa. Tanto Cybersecurity Framework como ISO 27001 le brindan la metodologa sobre cmo implementar la seguridad ciberntica en una organizacin. Podra implementar cualquiera de estos. Probablemente la mayor similitud es que ambos se basan en la gestin del riesgo: esto significa que ambos requieren que las salvaguardas se implementen solo si se detectan riesgos de seguridad ciberntica. Cybersecurity Framework Cybersecurity Framework claramente est mejor estructurado cuando se trata de planificacin e implementacin. Framework Core est dividido en funciones; Identificar, Proteger, Detectar, Responder y Recuperar, y luego en 22 Categoras relacionadas, por ejemplo, Gestin de Activos, Gestin de Riesgos, etc. similares a las secciones en ISO 27001. 98 subcategoras, y para cada subcategora se hacen varias referencias a otros marcos como ISO 27001, COBIT, NIST SP 800-53, ISA 62443 y CCS CSC. De esta manera, es muy fcil ver cules son los requisitos y dnde encontrar la manera de implementarlos. Niveles de Implementacin de Cybersecurity Framework; Parcial, informado de riesgo, repetible y adaptable. De esta manera, una empresa puede decidir fcilmente hasta dnde quiere llegar con su implementacin, teniendo en cuenta los requisitos. Entonces es el perfil del marco; Perfil actual, Perfil de destino y otros ayudan a las imgenes en las que se encuentra la organizacin en este momento, relacionadas con las categoras y subcategoras de Framework Core, y dnde quiere estar. Adems, Framework Profiles podra usarse para establecer los requisitos mnimos para otras organizaciones como proveedores o socios. Esto no existe en ISO 27001 En general, Cybersecurity Framework permite que tanto la alta direccin como los ingenieros y dems personal de TI comprendan fcilmente qu se debe implementar y dnde estn las vulnerabilidades. ISO 27001 Una de las mayores ventajas de ISO 27001 es que las empresas pueden certificarse por ella, esto significa que una empresa puede demostrar a sus clientes, socios, accionistas, agencias gubernamentales y otros que pueden mantener su informacin segura. Adems, ISO 27001 es un estndar aceptado y reconocido internacionalmente: si una empresa desea demostrar su capacidad a sus clientes, socios y gobiernos fuera de su pas, ISO 27001 ser mucho mejor. ISO 27001 se enfoca en proteger todo tipo de informacin, no solo la informacin procesada en los sistemas de TI. Es cierto que la informacin en papel tiene cada vez menos importancia, pero para algunas compaas tal informacin an puede presentar riesgos significativos. ISO 27001 define qu documentos y registros son necesarios, y cul es el mnimo que debe implementarse. Finalmente, mientras que Cybersecurity Framework se enfoca solo en cmo planificar e implementar la seguridad ciberntica, ISO 27001 adopta un enfoque mucho ms amplio, su metodologa se basa en el ciclo Planificar, Hacer, Verificar, Actuar (PDCA), lo que significa que construye el sistema de gestin que mantiene y mejora todo el sistema. Sin una medicin constante, revisin, auditora, acciones correctivas y mejoras, dicho sistema se deteriorar gradualmente y finalmente perder su propsito. Cual es mejor Esto no debe ser una cuestin de uno u otro, me parece que sera mejor combinarlos. En realidad, Cybersecurity Framework sugiere que puede complementarse fcilmente con otro programa o sistema, e ISO 27001 ha demostrado ser un muy buen marco general para diferentes metodologas de seguridad de datos. Por lo tanto, creo que se pueden lograr los mejores resultados si el diseo de la seguridad de datos completa se establece de acuerdo con ISO 27001 y utilizar Cybersecurity Framework en lo que respecta a la gestin de riesgos y la implementacin de las reas y salvaguardas de seguridad particulares."

This framework came with many doubts if you are already familiarized with ISO 27001. Cybersecurity Framework was initially intended for U.S. companies that are considered part of critical infrastructure. Nevertheless, it is suitable for use by any organization that faces cyber security risks. ISO/IEC 27001 is a cyber security standard published in 2005 and revised in 2013. Even if is not mandatory, it is accepted in most countries as a main framework for data security implementation. It describes the data security management system, and it places in the context of the overall management and processes in a company. Cybersecurity Framework and ISO 27001 gives you the methodology on how to implement cyber security in an organization. You could implement either of these. Possibly the biggest similarity is that both are based on risk management: this means that they both require the safeguards to be implemented only if cyber security risks were detected. Cybersecurity Framework Cybersecurity Framework clearly it is better structured when it comes to planning and implementation. Framework Core is divided into Functions; Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover, and then into 22 related Categories, for example, Asset Management, Risk Management, etc. similar to sections in ISO 27001. 98 Subcategories, and for each Subcategory several references are made to other frameworks like ISO 27001, COBIT, NIST SP 800-53, ISA 62443, and CCS CSC. This way, it is very easy to see what the requirements and where to find out how to implement them. Framework Implementation Tiers are; Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable and Adaptive. This way, a company can easily decide how far they want to go with their implementation, taking into account requirements. Then is the Framework Profile; Current Profile, Target Profile and others help to pictures where the organization is right now, related to the categories and subcategories from Framework Core, and where it wants to be. Further, Framework Profiles could be used for setting the minimum requirements for other organizations like suppliers or partners. This doesnt exist in ISO 27001. Overall, Cybersecurity Framework enables both the top management but also engineers and other IT staff to understand easily what is to be implemented, and where the vulnerabilities are. ISO 27001 One of the greatest advantages of ISO 27001 is that companies can become certified by it, this means that a company can prove to its clients, partners, shareholders, government agencies, and others that it can indeed keep their information safe. Further, ISO 27001 is an internationally recognized and accepted standard , if a company wants to prove its ability to its clients, partners, and governments outside of their country, ISO 27001 will be much better. ISO 27001 focuses on protecting all types of information, not just information processed in IT systems. It is true that paper-based information has less and less importance, but for some companies such information might still pose significant risks. ISO 27001 defines which documents and records are needed, and what is the minimum that must be implemented. Finally, whereas the Framework focuses only on how to plan and implement data security, ISO 27001 takes a much wider approach, its methodology is based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, which means it builds the management system that maintains and improves the whole system. Without constant measurement, review, audit, corrective actions, and improvements, such a system will gradually deteriorate and ultimately lose its purpose. Which one is better It is not have to be a question of one or other; it seems to me that it would be best to combine the two. Actually Cybersecurity Framework suggests it can easily complement with other program or system, and ISO 27001 has proved to be a very good umbrella framework for different data security methodologies. So, I think the best results can be achieved if the design of the whole data security would be set according to ISO 27001 and to use Cybersecurity Framework when it comes to risk management and implementation of the particular cyber security areas and safeguards."

Its rate alerts much to both companies and users. Hackers take advantage of the most popular sectors and where there are more users. One of these cases is Microsoft Office 365. Microsoft Office 365 offers us space in the cloud, and other services such as email, calendar, etc. Cyber security professionals recommend this for business solution, but also at the user level. Microsoft Office 365 differs from its normal version in that we pay for its use on a monthly basis. Paying through the official page, we avoid paying for the software completely. Now the ransomware affects users. One example is Cerber Ransomware, which pointed to Office 365 and flooded users inboxes with an Office document that invoked malware through macros. Also the WannaCry attack was designed to exploit a vulnerability of Microsoft. And now we have a new variety of ransomware, ShurL0ckr, designed to evade integrated malware protection in OneDrive and Google Drive. To protect data within Office 365, organizations must adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which offers guidance based on existing standards, guidelines and practices to better manage and reduce cyber security risk. Identity management, data loss prevention, and backup and recovery are three crucial areas to evaluate within the Cybersecurity framework of NIST, especially when transferring high priority data to a SaaS application such as Office 365. The ransomware encrypts all data and documents. It is what differentiates it from other types of malware. In return it asks for an economic rescue to release these files. Therefore, one of the data security professionals recommendations is to create backup copies frequently. With this we manage to save our important data and, in case of being affected by a ransomware, the loss will be less. Most of the ransomware comes through emails. Thats why experts also recommend configuring the Office 365 anti-spam protection policies. According to research by data security specialists, in most cases the users of a company are the gateway to the ransomware. You have to make sure that users have the necessary security software to be able to deal with these types of threats, know the social engineering techniques used, etc. Although this does not protect the ransomware by itself, it is a measure of data security to be taken into account. This allows us, in addition to entering the password, to enter credentials through a call, message or some notification. It is important to prevent them from accessing our accounts."

A previous investigation, in November, discovered that China is finding and disclosing information on software security holes faster than the United States, except when those vulnerabilities are high risk and might be used in targeted attacks. Now the information security firm Recorded Future has discovered that China National Vulnerability Database (CNNVD) altered the original publication dates for at least 267 vulnerabilities in its research published in November 2017. The [information security training](URL expert said it expects the changes were made to conceal evidence it revealed in its previous report. CNNVD is managed by Chinas Ministry of State Security (MSS). CNNVD takes longer to publish high threat vulnerabilities than low threat vulnerabilities, Priscilla Moriuchi, information security training researcher. Chinas National Vulnerability Database has a website but appears to be separate from the Chinas Ministry of State Security MSS, the firm said in previous research. MSS is akin to the US Central Intelligence Agency. Unlike the CIA, however, MSS is not just a foreign intelligence service, but it also has a large, and arguably more important domestic intelligence mandate. Recognizing the importance of the domestic mission is key to understanding why the MSS would manipulate data that is primarily consumed by Chinese or regional users. In other words, China is in no hurry to publish information about serious vulnerabilities because it wants to give MSS time to evaluate how the government might use them in offensive cyber operations. CNNVDs outright manipulation of these dates implicitly confirmed this assessment, the firm said. Now it seems China also is trying to cover its tracks and hide its intent. The dates changed in the CNNVD were for vulnerabilities that the U.S. NVD had reported in six days and the CNNVD took more than twice as long as its average of 13 days to report. Information security training analysts first noticed the discrepancies between publication dates in two Microsoft Office security holes identified as outliers in its November report. The initial CNNVD publication dates for the two vulnerabilities had been backdated to match NVD and erase the publication lag, the information security firm said in its report. Screenshots of the vulnerabilities records from November and February, respectively, are provided in the report, highlighting the date alteration. The information security firm found that 267 of the 268 CNNVD original publication dates had been altered since November 17. Moreover, each date was changed post-publication to approximate or beat publication date in the U.S. vulnerability database. What we found was that CNNVD had changed the publication date to hide the publication lag, information security training professional Moriuchi said.This would hide the evidence of (Ministry of State Security) influence and any other processes that would create the publication lag in the first place and it would limit the methods we were using and any other organizations would use to anticipate Chinese APT behavior. The firm identified 74 new outlier vulnerabilities, published between September 13 and November 16, 71 of which were backdated and the publication lags erased, researchers said. From a public service and transparency perspective, there could be larger liability issues for companies and institutions that rely solely on CNNVD data, researchers said. If a company is victimized by an exploit for a vulnerability during the altered period of time, unless they kept a historical record of all CNNVD initial report dates, they could face questions about why they did not remediate a vulnerability for which they did not know about, according to the firm report. Additionally, China recently instituted a Cybersecurity Law (CSL) mandating that companies operating in China adopt a tiered system of network security protections, [information security training](URL ) researchers said. The law allows the state to hold companies both legally and financially responsible for what officials deem a network security incident. In light of the activity uncovered by Recorded Future, for a foreign multinational company to comply with all the provisions of the CSL could mean that it may at the same time violate Western laws or regulations against cooperating with Chinese security and intelligence services. Moriuchi said that the more worrying issue is Chinas willingness to cloud or distort information to serve its ends. After all, vulnerabilities published on the US NVD or Chinas CNNVD have already been publicly disclosed. That means they are unlike so-called vulnerability equities: undisclosed software vulnerabilities that state intelligence agencies discover (or purchase) and may keep secret for use in offensive cyber operations."
