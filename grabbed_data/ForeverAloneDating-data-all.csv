Well, hello to the modern version of that.",1,hsho31,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/hsho31/26_m4f_anywhere_in_the_us_remember_the_days_we/,2020-07-17 06:27:02,"Hey. Hi! Hello! I hope this post finds you well during these crazy times. My name is Jesse and it's nice to meet you. This may be a long-winded post, but if you only briefly glance at this I just hope you know I appreciate you and even giving it a look. **\*Career/Life Goals\*** \- So, I'm a 26 year old First-Generation Taiwanese-American student going for his Master's in Social Work currently with aspirations to become a therapist/social worker. I figure ya know, if I'm gonna try and figure out my own issues might as well try to be an expert than pass it on ya know? \- I live in CO, USA and I consider it home, but I've also been back to Taiwan quite often. (Yes I do speak Mandarin, my mom says I don't do it well, but it gets me by) \- I don't really want kids of my own (at the moment). But adopting? Yo sign me up for that! \- I want to graduate from Grad. School and begin a new life when I finish, I would love to move somewhere I haven't been. Ugh, I know. Exploring the world. How typical. \- I currently work with at-risk adolescents and hope to do so in the future. I either want to be a therapist that tackles suicide/depression/anxiety or a first responding social worker that can make an impact towards the BLM movement. **\*Interests/Hobbies\*** \- I'm a big gamer and would love to meet any other fellow wholesome and positive gamers. I mostly play League, since I don't have much time for other time committing games due to school. I own a big Steam library so maybe we could play something together sometime? \- I am a BIG nerd! But, also a disgrace of a nerd. I haven't seen Star Wars or LOTR all the way through (oof I know. I can feel the downvotes already). I recently got into D&amp;D and have been obsessed though! Any Critical Role fans? No? Darn. I also have seen a bit of anime in my past, but haven't recently. Fate: Stay Night one of my favs. I LOVE comic book stuff, especially Spider-Man. Disney? Heck ya sign me up. Stitch is my spirit animal. I have him tattooed on my calf! :D \- I also love dancing. I self-taught myself using a lot of YouTube videos. Even had a brief dance crew in college was a lovely experience! Mostly did hip-hop. I want to make more time for it in the future. I am the type of person who will dance to songs regardless of who's around and sing loudly in the car. I love any and all music. Truly. just depends on the mood. \- I enjoy cooking, but I find motivation in cooking for others. \- Reading has had a profound effect on my life. It's taught me the concept of empathy and development of my understanding of reality and the world. From fantasy novels as a teenager to fictional non-fiction. I really hope to make more time in the future to read more outside of school textbooks. \- I do enjoy being outdoors, I just sweat easily and can get pretty self-conscious about it. But, I enjoy any typical Coloradoan activity. \- I love talking anything political, existential, or social because I think it's what helps us grow and understand each other and the world better. I am passionate about Black Lives Matter, Abolish ICE, #MeToo, Feminism, and mental health. **\*Me\*** \- I have struggled with a lot of confidence issues growing up due to my appearance and childhood experiences. So I'm a bit of a late bloomer in many capacities. I think I've done a lot of the work to accept myself, but bare with me as I am flawed and won't pretend I'm not (I've tried to, -5/10 do not recommend, just be genuine yo) OH! Here's my face. In it's unflattering glory. In Taiwan! [URL \- 5'6\~ 180 lbs at the moment (I blame pandemic weight, motivated to work out more though. Work out buddies ya?) \- Doctors told me when I was young I had a physical syndrome that made me look..... How to put it delicately.....? Abnormal! It's taken a while to accept, but hey what was that thing about Rome? I don't know... Never been there. \- I am not religious, but I have practiced Lutheranism and Buddhism in my experience. I accept all religions that do not harm others because I think faith and spirituality is important even if I don't practice it myself. **\*What I'm looking for\*** \- I have been trying dating apps and such, but I don't seem to find many people with similar interests given my location. I also find connecting on the internet to be pretty normal for me so I thought I'd put myself out here romantically too! \- I would love to have a connection first and get to know people see where it goes ya know? I don't want to have expectations or immediate aspirations because I think a relationship worth having is worth spending time and energy on. \- I ask that you be willing to communicate with me and embrace vulnerability. I love hearing of your story and would love to hear anything you have to teach me or tell me about yourself or your life! I want to value communication and understanding. \- Feel free to shoot me a DM or message on here with any questions or if maybe you just happened to check the box that says ""yes, I like you""!"

I am seeking a long term relationship with a woman that values trust, emotional vulnerability, financial stability and who wants to build a future cemented in a foundation of success. If we are able to connect online and things seem like they could work in person this is an opportunity for you to start over in a new country devoid of your past experiences - a fresh start. I am an extremely serious person and I am looking for the same thing in return. If you have always been left wanting more this is your chance to start a life with someone who values purpose and meaning. A note: I am the person I am today due to past experience.

Recently I started browsing this subreddit, I met some nice people, and so I thought, why not make a post myself? I'd normally write an entire novel of my life, to give an insight in who I am at a deeper level, to hopefully find a close and deep bond with someone. Stories of a fantastic sailing adventure, of wild nature adventures with friends, and of all the little and large things I may find on my path. But maybe that isn't the best approach for now. I have a good life. I am happy with myself, and with what I have done the past few years. I have a bunch of close friends, and all kinds of other friends and acquaintances, all over the world. I had plans for holidays with some of them, but alas, Corona. Fortunately, I have a nice job that I still enjoy doing, and that gives me a lot of freedom; I go on cycling trips these days to get out of the house, calling with friends for socialness as I cycle over dikes and through farmland. So, I'm doing good, I am happy, I am free. But (you had not expected this word at all~). I want to find what I wrote in the title of this message. I have it, mind, with some of my closer friends. But I want to get to know someone, hours flying by as we chat, learning of each other, exchanging views on all kinds of subjects, playing with words and language in silliness, sharing the tiniest irrelevant thoughts that disappear after a moment, and sharing the more intimate or private thoughts that are part of your personal lifestory. I want you to, eventually, know me better than I know myself. I want you to know the minute nuance of what different ways of greeting you a good morning implies about my own mood. I want you to know what and why and how I think on all kinds of topics. I want to know all of this of you, too. I want us to gain energy, from our chatting, looking forward to chatting together again and again. How will I find that? Good question. I leave that up to you, dear reader; you're the one who should send me a message! I don't know for sure if there are certain characteristics or qualities that you should have for us to click so nicely, but I can guess as to what might help. Depth, of course. Wanting to open up, the ability to feel comfortable, vulnerable. Not minding textual messages, as it is rare-ish that I can call. A positive outlook on life and on your self. Independence, self-confidence, mental strength. Stubbornness? An appreciation of the little things? Vitality, adventurousness, ignoring your own comfort zone? Creativity? A bit of silliness, poking fun at life? Playing around with references, witticisms, puns, words? These are some of my own characteristics, but you can certainly be very different on some of these points, they are no 'deal breakers'. Feel free to reply however you wish (in a PM) to this post. You could only drop your name, age, gender, and a means of direct communication - but how would we form a bond based on that? You could tell me a bit about yourself, your personality, your life, any fancy stories you have or important moments you had. That one amazing holiday, that great friend you lost and found again, your experiences with love. What you do on an average day, the subjects that interest you, the food that you love. As deep as you want to make it. Ideally with some path leading to direct communication - or we could call right now, I like such random things - but if you wish to exchange a few PMs first, by all means, of course!

To build a bound and connection that leads to years together and possibly starting a family. A love that can communicate freely without the fear of judgement and one thats patient/passionate when things arent going well. I want to look forward in achieving my goals and sharing them with you, with you also willing to do the same. I would love to hear about what hobbies make you geek out or the endless stories about your day. More than anything I want a genuine connection with someone who can be a friend and lover. Hopefully we can meet when we fully commit to the relationship (and COVID-19 DIES LOL). I maybe a hopeless romantic but Im realistic in the way I love. I believe people should be allowed to love with all their heart, its the only time you experience that vulnerability and truly makes you feel human. About me briefly: I was in a 7yr toxic relationship that took a huge toll on me. I spent years having my boundaries never respected, constantly being lied to,gaslighted, manipulated,mistreated by ex and the family and even cheated on. This person ghosted me and just disappeared basically. - I get youre probably like ew RED FLAG TALKING ABOUT HIS EX but there is a point to this lmao  - I went to therapy and stayed single for 3 years to heal and love myself . I learned so much about maintaining healthy relationships, taking time to have my own identity outside the relationship and communicating effectively with my partner. During this time I found love again for the piano(still need to play it more lmao and relearn a lot of what I forgot), got back into writing poetry and am now even working on a book!(releasing it in google play first lmao ) and decided to redo my degree in a bachelors of science- 3d animation. I love storytelling and my hopes are to make my stories come to life in animation. These animations I want to make are to help inspire people or contribute to any conversations going on in the world(society). After I finish I want to get my master in art and media designand teach English in Japan for 1-2years. Its a hard decision to decide exactly what to do whether I should jump into the industry instantly or travel to a foreign country live there for a bit while teaching English and still building my resume.  I play video games when I have the time and also watch anime or literally anything on Netflix(Hulu,amazon prime,crunchy roll) thats good. ((Or has romance lmfao )) I spend my time learning a lot though obviously through school(animation/line art) but on my own like Japanese, music theory, guitar(this one is going to be awhile), software for my midi controllers to produce music , Korean(read somewhere that apparently you can learn the alphabet extremely easy so I want this) and astronomy . I have an interest in my many things so well definitely have something in common LMAOO Again distance doesnt mean anything to me BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA I travel their a lot to visit my brothers girlfriend who is family to me! We all end up chilling at an Airbnb (me and my brother split lol) and she takes us sightseeing! LOTS OF FOOD  I am 25 physically fit Currently I am 145-150 which is like skinny lean (been boxing more recently NO POOL BECAUSE OF COVID-19:-( ) But I can also be 155-165 bulked up which is a great weight class for when I box lmao but having all that muscle would tire me out and maintenance was a bitch .  TLDR: Imagine by Ariana Grande Yuh."

Those lustful, lazy weekends with you, I will never take for granted.\ \ I love hearing you chuckle over your own silly, corny jokes. I love that those jokes actually make me giggle too. I pretend to hate it when you point that out, but we both know the truth. Yet you let me have that. You think my transparent denial is fetching, and I find it very sweet.\ \ I love that you are adventurous, and not just in video games. I love seeing your eyes widened with apparent excitement when you try something new. I love when your eyes twinkle with impish glee because you just got another inspiration. I love looking forward to seeing how that magificent, imaginative mind unfolds.\ \ Boy, do I love your insatiable appetite. I love seeing that stoic, respectful gentleman turning into a primal beast when the door is closed. I love that I bring that out in you. My beast. I love seeing that beast turning into an affectionate, servile creature once sated.

I love seeing that satisfied smile, and feeling your tummy after.\ \ Seeing you enjoying yourself and the company of your friends brings me joy as well. I love that you feel comfortable enough to include me when you do. I love that you are respectful when invited to hang with my circle of friends, and that you care to learn about them.

The moment of silence, only our breaths, and our heartbeats. Just being present together, and feeling connected. I hold those serene moments with you dear to my heart.\ \ You are grateful for the things in your life, and you don't take a single thing for granted. I'm grateful to have you in mine, and that we share the mutual gratitude together.\ \ You deeply care, and often it takes a toll on you, even with that stoic facade you set up for the world. I love massaging off your stress with my hands, and my presence.\ \ I love that you feel at ease with me. I love that you can get things off your chest, as I run my fingers through your hair with you resting, and leaning against my chest. I love caressing you, and seeing you become visibly relaxed.\ \ I love that you are there for me when I am feeling helpless or stressed. I love breathing in your scent when you hug me. I love it when you insist on petting my head, and showering me with affection with each stroke despite my pointless resistance.\ \ We cheer each other up. I love that we are comforted by the presence of each other. I love that we can share the moment of vulnerability together, and feel empowered doing so.\ \ I love that I can make you smile, and heart flutter. I love that you not only embrace all my weird quirks, and oddities, but also adore them. As I do yours.\ \ I just... haven't met you yet. *** Whoa. Where did that sappy love letter come from?

11,vulnerability,ForeverAloneDating,33 [M4F] Alberta / Online - A story from me to you.,1,h8skc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/h8skc1/33_m4f_alberta_online_a_story_from_me_to_you/,2020-06-14 21:59:24,"&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Hey there, my name is Jordan, 33/M/Alberta Canada, looking for a lovely lady (CIS / MtF: ). I am writing this again, and rewriting this, and will continue to evolve this post as I continue in search for you. Please be patient with me, I hope you enjoy reading, because it will be a novel by the time I am finished. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Not sure what the best way is to write this out, so, I'll just do what I can. Laying in bed restless when I try to sleep, I feel that I always know what I want to write out, but when I sit at the desk I go blank. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I...don't know it's better to tell you what I'm looking for, or if I try to provide you with what you may be finding here. I will tell you some more about me. You know my name, my age, and my general location but there is so much more. I suppose some type of indication is that I have been classified as an [INTJ](URL from the Meyers Briggs Type Indicator testing. That information may be helpful in the coming post if you decide to continue reading. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; I believe strongly that people are so much more complex emotionally and socially than we really take at surface level. So much communication is given without words; the way we look at each other, the way I can hear you smile in your laughter or your words, or the way I can be told a story by looking in your eyes. I can feel your excitement when I see you can't get enough, and I really feed off your anticipation when I know you are wondering about me. You know, I do those things about you, too. It is important, I think, to be able to communicate effectively with the right person, and I always do my best to communicate. In this respect, I actually really value good communication, good conversations, or just good time spent together. Hours on the phone (Discord?) at night in video calls talking about our pasts, our futures, our wants, each other, talking about whatever, and sometimes not even talking at all, just...being together. These are values of mine, and they are incredibly huge. This sort of thought process follows me through a lot of aspects of my life in the way I feel about things. Very few things in my life feel important to me, but the few things that do are so gravitational that they matter so much more -- enough to compensate for all the things that don't matter at all. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It's so cliche to tell people that ""I like to laugh, I'm a fun guy! I just wanna have fun and take it easy."" I think many of us are like that, and it's a bit redundant to tell. I think that as people we want to live our lives with enjoyment, not in misery.. Perhaps it is best, in the vein of **Open Communication** for me to talk to you about other parts of me that might be lesser known. I am..sad. Often. Not always. For an INTJ, I express a lot of emotional responses to irrational things and my soul is weighted with melancholy. I also feel it is a bit cliche to talk about depression: it's 2020 and we're all depressed and dealing with our own situations and we all deal with our problems individually -- nobody deals with the same situation exactly the same way. I just don't want it to be a secret. If you decide to talk with me, you'll notice that I like to make jokes a lot, and I will do everything in my power to help you feel better about whatever situation, I work hard to maintain positivity, just, sometimes it's not easy. I am an overthinker, and I postulate on many stupid things that are self destructive and cause a lot of stress in my life. Often, I am extremely sure of things and I am confident with that, but when I am unsure of things or feel in danger, I am anxious and sometimes a mess. I have a lot to give to the right person, and I wear my heart on my sleeve, and I hope that is perfect for you. So, let this be possibly the most honest R4R post ever written, haha. For real, I just like to laugh, and I'm a fun guy. I just wanna have fun and take it easy! &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking of sureness and confidence; I am a very confident person in my own rights. I know exactly who I am, I am self aware, and I know exactly what I want when I want it and I am not afraid to express it. I am strong willed, I am a leader, and I enjoy being in that position. Often, I think of myself like a Knight; I want to walk with you on your path and I will have my sword and shield ready to aid you in any battle you may come across. There have been a lot of situations that have crossed my path throughout the years, and I am strong and want to be your strength as well. Not that I want to do things for you, but I want to be there with you for those things, to help raise you up and bring you up, to lend you that strength -- in the times when I am weak and hurt, I will need your strength as well. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I work a lot. On average, I work 10-12 hours a day, but I am fortunate enough to work from home. I create YouTube videos and live stream 5 nights a week, and in my off nights I work around 3-4 hours a day as well. I am not wildly successful or popular, you haven't heard of me, but because of my work I have a lot of available time as well to give to you. I want your time, I want to occupy you &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Physically, [I am probably not the most flattering](URL (No, it's not modesty, it's just reality.) I am stocky, and I am working hard to lose weight. Starting in December 2019 I started going to the gym regularly and regulating my diet and adjusting macros so that I could shed some weight and gain some muscle mass. Since December (302 lbs) I weigh in at 259 lbs and continuing to work hard towards that goal. Since the existing Corona Virus, I haven't been able to attend the gym, but I will be going back once the gyms open up -- I have found myself missing the routine and attraction to results and the health I've felt since attending the gym. Feels good to look much better. The other large note about my physical appearance is that I have a beard (It's not giant or anything, but it's a full beard) and **I dye it routinely.** I bleach and dye the beard myself. Feel free to ask me more about it, but it is another part of my identity that I enjoy as a freedom of expression, a form of creativity, and something that sets me as me. I am not much of the type of person to care what others think about me, so I'm fine with some of the strange looks in public. One of the responses to my previous R4R was *""What is that beard I am looking at?!""* Is okay, it's not for everyone to go out on a date or show off their boyfriend who has a purple, pink, blue, or firey red beard. I won't judge you for it. Oh, yeah... I'm 5'11"". a **TALL** 5'11"", don't get me twisted. I'm basically 6'0""......... &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Speaking on Judgement. I am no judicator, and I won't judge you for your history, for your actions, for your decisions or who you are and what you enjoy or like. I mean, ironically I would jest to tease you, but in all seriousness I pride myself on being a safe space for all. There is a quote, I am paraphrasing, but it is something along the lines of, *""I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right say it.""* Your religion, your gender, your identity, your sexual preference, your race, we are all human and we are all valid. We are all unique, but we are all equal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A relationship, in my opinion, is made up in a sum of lesser pieces to create the greater two parts and I feel it breaks down to: Emotional Connection (Personality compatibility, communication, romance) and Physical Connection. Obviously two people have to like each other to maintain a healthy relationship, but I also feel the need to express that a physical component is equally important in a relationship. I wouldn't say I'm a big kinkster, but I am definitely really open sexually to kinks and adventurous sex lives. In this respect, I am the top in qualifying relationships. Without being ""Too Much Information"", I have had a painfully vanilla and extremely boring sex life and I really don't want to go in to that a second time. Physical connection is important because when we talk about this sort of thing, or plan to experience this sort of thing, I want to be attracted to you and the situation equally, I would feel horrible if I woke up in the morning next to someone and thought, ""I gotta wake up to this face for the next __ years..."" I would expect nothing less out of my partner, as well. We have to mesh on every level. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Also, on sex and attraction. Your face is the most beautiful think I will look at. Sexy photos and nudes are great and all, but if I don't see your face then... what? Honestly, a beautiful smile, eyes that tell that story, the way you do your hair and how you look. Those are things that I find incredibly sexy. Yes, I also think your body is sexy, haha, but, for real, I will fall for you for your face. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I have a history just like everyone else does. I just want to be up front about it, and honest. I have only had 3.5 relationships in my life. The longest being a 10 year relationship with my ex wife, and the .5 being most recently where I connected with a woman where things got pretty serious for a bit but never established a relationship type of status/connection. I have two children who I see every weekend. I own a house and provide support to a family member in it, as well as co-own it with another family member. To be honest, I am pretty tied to this geographical location, so, just want that to be out there and open. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I suppose if you've survived this wall of text, my mini novel, it's prudent to tell you what I'm looking for. Emotionally, I'm looking for someone who is similar to me, or at least someone who can take inspiration from me and the words I write, the ways I write them, and looking to have support. I feel that vulnerability is incredibly sexy and I am interested in your vulnerability; I am also interested in giving you mine. There is a special connection when trust is so established that care for one another is on that next level -- the words we exchange should be the ones we let affect us, not the words of a random who is out to cause anarchy. The woman I'm looking for us smart, a little shy, and probably so modest she'd never admit to just who amazing she really is. I will see it in you and I will definitely remind you of it. Physically, she is petite and fit, she has eyes that shine through the darkness and a smile that can lift the heaviest of spirits. Likely she is younger than me by a bit (-3 or more.) Part of my personality is to be a leader and I enjoy sharing experiences and providing that guiding light, and age may play a large part in that. She is equally adventurous in her sex life and willing to try new fun things together, or share existing fun interests with each other. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;In closing, I would like to say thank you for taking the time, if you read through all of this. You are really something else to survive this R4R post, and I'm glad you stuck it out. Hopefully something was interesting enough up there to keep your attention until the end. I have thought while re-writing this post if I should include a photo in the post or not, but I think I will include it above. If you are still reading; have a great day, I appreciate your time, you are incredible and valid, you are awesome and I hope to chat with you if you are that woman for me. I want to fall in love, and wherever you are, I've missed you for a very long time."

If so, we may just have everything for one another: - Think first, feel second, but find the latter equally as important as the former. - Deeply introspective, insightful, abstraction oriented, and wish to be so with someone who really gets it and responds in kind. - Intelligent in a creative, tantalizing way that's indicative of eccentricity. - It's not difficult to find plenty of people flocking to you, but don't care for the attention unless it meets your standards. - Know your worth and are therefore very patient and picky, for you will not allow less. - Find it difficult to relate to people who aren't at least somewhat arrogant. - A little too full of yourself, and will never apologize for being so, however all while maintaining self-awareness. - Have strong opinions but are willing and secure in yourself to discuss them in an open-minded manner. - Cynical about the world, but optimistic about your personal journey through it. - Since you're usually cold and calculated, you therefore wish to reserve all of your warmth and vulnerability for a special someone. - Value time spent with that special someone for the sake of it being with them, so finding things to do together is easy. - Enjoy wit, banter, and being goofy. - Find yourself often rambling for eternity and struggling to be concise, very much unlike how I'm trying to format this post. (it's getting there tho lol...) - Are somehow so great that you make me rethink my preferences. - And last but not least - were not intimidated by my post. Because boy do I get that one a lot lmao. I get why people would though - it's different, and that's my goal."

I want to start off by saying that Im looking to start off as friends first and see what happens. I dont want to force anything and I know from experience that making a connection online is really hard but I still have hope that Ill find my person one day. Im finally getting my life on track and Im in a decent place mentally, so I feel like now is a good time to put myself out there and see if I can get lucky! While I am a bit of a hopeless romantic Im also realistic with my expectations so if things dont work out thats alright with me. I just ask that you tell me if you arent feeling it and Ill do the same. My only requirements are that youre single and open to the idea of online dating and ideally you share similar values. Ive been told Im a pretty laid back person who likes to joke around a lot while also managing to be empathetic and understanding. I consider myself to be a sensitive person who isnt afraid to show vulnerability and encourages all kinds of expression. Besides that Im also very introverted and shy but Im a lot more confident around people I know and trust. My hobbies and interests arent too unique but Im very passionate about what I like. I enjoy games, anime, manga, comic books, horror, cats, nature, cartoons, history, geography, anthropology, astronomy, baseball, pro-wrestling, and recently Ive been trying to read more books and learn how to draw. Im not the best looking guy out there but I definitely dont think Im in anyway ugly and Id be happy to share pics. I dont like talking about politics or religion too much but Im an atheist with leftist political views. Im not much of a partier and at the moment Im not a huge fan of drinking or smoking weed. Im personally also not a fan of hookup culture/casual sex and I would only want to have sex with someone if I trust them and have a connection with them. Thats all for now if you read my post and are interested in talking please give a detailed introduction and dont just say hi. A little bit of effort does go a long way. Anyway hope to hear from some cool people soon."

15,vulnerability,ForeverAloneDating,29 [F4M] IL/US- I'm just looking for a companion!,1,hiqpfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/hiqpfi/29_f4m_ilus_im_just_looking_for_a_companion/,2020-07-01 02:30:53," The first thing you need to know about me is that I love words. I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person.

I'd normally write an entire novel of my life, to give an insight in who I am at a deeper level, to hopefully find a close and deep bond with someone. Stories of a fantastic sailing adventure, of wild nature adventures with friends - or, recently, nice cycle trips over dikes and through farmlands as I call with friends, because we're social distancing of course - and of all the little and large things I may find on my path. But maybe that isn't the best approach for now. I have a good life. I am happy with myself, and with what I have done the past few years. I have a bunch of close friends, and all kinds of other friends and acquaintances, all over the world. I have plans for holidays with some of them, even, and I would have been in Italy the last two weeks - but alas, Corona. Fortunately, I have a nice job that I still enjoy doing, and that gives me a lot of freedom; I go on cycling trips these days, after all, to get out of the house. So, I'm doing good, I am happy, I am free. But (you had not expected this word at all~). I want to find what I wrote in the title of this message. I have it, mind, with some of my closer friends. But I want to get to know someone, hours flying by as we chat, learning of each other, exchanging views on all kinds of subjects, playing with words and language in silliness, sharing the tiniest irrelevant thoughts that disappear after a moment, and sharing the more intimate or private thoughts that are part of your personal lifestory. I want you to, eventually, know me better than I know myself. I want you to know the minute nuance of what different ways of greeting you a good morning implies about my own mood. I want you to know what and why and how I think on all kinds of topics. I want to know all of this of you, too. I want us to gain energy, from our chatting, looking forward to chatting together again and again. How will I find that? Good question. I leave that up to you, dear reader; you're the one who should send me a message! I don't know for sure if there are certain characteristics or qualities that you should have for us to click so nicely, but I can guess as to what might help. Depth, of course. Wanting to open up, the ability to feel comfortable, vulnerable. Not minding textual messages, as it is rare-ish that I can call. A positive outlook on life and on your self. Independence, self-confidence, mental strength. Stubbornness? An appreciation of the little things? Vitality, adventurousness, ignoring your own comfort zone? Creativity? A bit of silliness, poking fun at life? Playing around with references, witticisms, puns, words? These are some of my own characteristics, but you can certainly be very different on some of these points, they are no 'deal breakers'. Feel free to reply however you wish (in a PM) to this post. You could only drop your name, age, gender, and a means of direct communication. You could tell me a bit about yourself, your personality, your life, any fancy stories you have or important moments you had. That one amazing holiday, that great friend you lost and found again, your experiences with love. What you do on an average day, the subjects that interest you, the food that you love. As deep as you want to make it. Ideally with some path leading to direct communication, but if you wish to exchange a few PMs first, sure!

I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him.

I havent had luck in dating due to a lack of confidence and due to my emotional vulnerability. Im pretty nerdy but Im willing to try my best to talk to anyone. Im also not the best with words so sorry if our conversations are awkward. I have no preferences about who contacts me I would just prefer that they arent more than 10 years older than me. Being near to me (I live in North Carolina in the US) is nice but not necessary. My preferred method of communication is Discord but we can use another method if that works better for you. If you want to know a bit about me: I am a huge nerd and into most things fantasy and sci fi. My main hobbies include playing video games, dungeons and dragons, and model painting. I am also a huge history buff and adore learning about and discussing history. As the title says I am 19 years old, just got done with my first year of college actually. If youd like to talk go ahead an DM me and we can exchange Discord IDs or find some other way to talk. :)"

I have had the opportunity to interact with a few people here. In some cases, we met with dealbreakers quite early. In some, I learnt that I need to pause my analytical self a bit. A few, we seem to clicked, but geographical barriers. :( I've been working on accepting people as they are, while caring for my own personal boundaries. I mean I won't judge you by calling you out. I'll judge you by not opening up, by not being vulnerable. Some of my deal-breakers include - \- Theism - or if you are okay with me not coming to places of worship, you not prioritizing rituals beyond everything else, you comfortable with not imbibing theism in your offspring. I identify as an agnostic, and it'd be best if you are an atheist or an agnostic. \- Let's get real. Relationships take effort to cultivate. I have things to do; I hope you do too! I can afford about 8 hours of weekly commitment in the initial stages - these can be chats, SFW/PG-13 movies, or you suggest. \- Drugs, smoking or drinking - change my view :/ Those things aside, on vulnerability - I have been working on it. Vulnerability not in the sense of getting physically intimate; being a demisexual, that's fine but not a first step. One thing I have fallen in love with is getting comfortable with each other, of trusting each other. The act of communicating and trusting each other enough to let one person tie up the other seems to be a significant aspect of vulnerabilty for me. I'm not into the S&amp;M side of things here, as much as it serving as a path to vulnerability, as much as it making us aware of vulnerability. So, if I seem like a no-dealbreaker to you, feel free to have a chat. Let's see where it goes! Have a good one!"

These are the methods by which a partner turns me on most. The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show me the submission in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to bathe you and help you put on lotion. You need me to brush your hair. You need me to pick what you wear. Be shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. If you want me to be dominant with you, you need to make your interest and inclination to submit to me clear. It does not need to be made explicit, once we begin this game I will be focused very intently on you, but you need to send out signal after signal, and trust that once you've sent out enough for me to judge you subservient I will move on you fiercely. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. The key is to behave in ways that show explicit or implicit giving of yourself to me. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

A strange but personal quest to fulfill my innate wish",0,g12txg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/g12txg/21_t4m_brisbane_australiaonline_looking_for/,2020-04-14 20:03:31,"**Important note:** This is just my romanticized preference, open to others working in not specified fields. This will sound weird but I'm looking for any LEOs and/or US military members serving (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard... damn right I included the coast guard) to spend time forming a strong bond of intimacy and flirtation. I really don't know why I'm looking for men in this particular field, but if anything that comes close to an answer, it's that I like the feeling of tending to the men when they get home from shift or a deployment that seems like years since you've left home. A strong, masculine man whom has a want in his heart for some refuge or brief respite of normalcy. No words needed to be said that indicated a bad or sordid day, all that matters, is coming home... safe. If there was, I want to be your outlet of vulnerability... when the hyper masculine environment of policing or military rarely encouraged comfort and price paid to be vulnerable. For men in the military... for those who'd been a platoon leader, or in charge of a garrison, the safety of your men in your unit matters. Even then, any flinch to vulnerability can matter in your men's confidence in you, their faith, respect. Losing that in your command can be everything. I won't tell you endless platitudes and recycled apathetic self-help advice to tell you to keep on trudging, or thanking you for your service like so many people. If anything I dislike, it's three things: bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes. However, I will say that I have my share too in desire to be comforted, though that comfort lies under security or protection which police or military is somewhat an epitome for. An idealistic view of it. To be rescued. Maybe a knight in shining armor syndrome has gotten into me, well, for any one out there thinking that in disapproval, you might as well sue me. My past is something I rarely look back, a life marred with misery, loneliness and the feeling of not being understood by few friends, many acquaintances. I have a very hard time forming friendships, and what's to say it is going to be better in relationships? Being a closeted Mtf trans girl doesn't help. It is important to choose the company you keep (sound familiar to you?) Although if anything, I'd rather choose a relationship than a friendship deep inside. The mutual feeling of silent understanding, a special deep love for each other for two people. Sometimes, the feeling of giving the middle finger to the rest of the world for them failing to understand you. Leaving them behind as background noise, to the person you rather spend your time with. The world might be in an apocalypse, and you want to block your mind away from that. Now, it doesn't matter any reasons that brought you in to the field, what does matter is the present and future... memories of tomorrow. The many things that swirl in your mind, somehow you just want some much needed clarity or perspective. Or comfort. To search for that someone. The adage of nurses-and-cops, or nurses-and-military, I believe stays true for a reason. More than the prospect of 8-12 hr shifts, dealing with problematic people etc. Perhaps a more introspective, personal nature to it. And being a student nurse, I'm very much drawn to the stereotype. It is fair that you may see me with skepticism when looking at my post history, seeming to pursue men for something more shallow. If anything, I am quietly reaching out in some sliver of intimacy that I want for the types of men that are interested, and for any to be receptive of that. What seems endless with a swath of people wanting fun through bored chats given everything, the pandemic does not waiver my chronic loneliness in lacking company even before. Hoping for my post in sex-laced subs to get noticed and have upvotes and be trending, I've wanted any men out there interested to secretly too want something to pursue long-term at the very least, to capture some emotional intimacy through sexting. I'm good at sexting, and LEOs/US military helps complement my passion and imagination in creating sensually steamy scenarios out of a 5-star story in the Literotica hall of fame romance section. On a note, I do read a fair lot of soldier's love type stories so that's where the foundation of my search stems from, at least a part of it. And through my past sexting escapades of men who fall under the two of being a LEO, or military (or both), one or two have expressed the sentiment of perpetual stress and constant vigilance during the playing of scenarios. The feeling of a million pumps of blood rushing through their veins. Perhaps there is some grain of truth to that. Maybe we can get to know each other. **About me:** 6'1'', 100 kg, Asian-Australian, brown-haired with glasses, never been drunk or high, ain't stealing your BAH/Tricare benefits (we've already got universal healthcare where I'm from ;) ), doing Nursing in my 2nd year, looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU, nursing at a VA hospital) **Interests:** * Love learning new cooking recipes (especially vegan though I am not one) * Listening to publicly broadcast police scanners (especially Chicago PD) * Watching yt videos on US fwy signage (FreewayJim, FreewayKyle) * Music: Outlaw country/country rock/classic rock/southern rock/Motown/Philadelphia sound/R&amp;B/Blue-eyed soul/a bit of Irish-Gaelic * TV shows: Battlestar Galactica, LOST, COPS (especially S1), 12 Monkeys, Person of Interest **You:** * **Not married/have an existing partner.** Must also not be an MP (just kidding... or am I? ;) ) * 18-53"

I'll be weirdly specific in that I'm looking for any US cops and/or military members serving (Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Coast Guard... damn right I included the coast guard) to spend time chatting with long-term and organically develop a relationship with, not just someone to dally with. I really don't know why I'm looking for men in this particular field, but if anything that comes close to an answer, it's that I like the feeling of tending to the men when they get home from shift or a deployment, whether it'd be a typical or sordid day. I want to be your outlet of vulnerability... when the hyper masculine environment of policing or military rarely encouraged comfort and price paid to be vulnerable. There is little room to openly express how you feel as men.... you know you're drinking buddies aren't exactly hard-pressed to get into conversations. From Rota to Bagram, and at home from Pendleton to Lejeune. Wherever he may be, a man whom has a want in his heart for some refuge or brief respite of normalcy. If lucky, he has that someone who understands his life. Vulnerability can be a heavy risk, especially for men in the military... for those who'd been a platoon leader, or in charge of a garrison, the safety of your men in your unit matters. Even then, any flinching to vulnerability can greatly matter in your men's confidence in you, their faith, respect. Losing that in your command can be everything. It is tempting to be in the mindset of being a razor... to casting aside fear, or hesitation when danger is near, forcing you have to change who you are as human. The choice does not have to be so. For professions that require professionalism and taught discipline... you rarely get to speak your thoughts off the record. Or it can just be feeling tired and restless at everything, whether to take off your police vest that smells like Nachos when you get home from a long shift or dreading the next Chinese field day in your barracks. ...or feeling near jilted in life from countless Jody/Becky's out there in search of a man's BAH/Tricare benefits that confers +1000 good looks in a man who's hell bent too on taking your affordable, modest E-4 pay (we have universal healthcare where I'm from btw ;) ) You're drinking buddies will probably never get how tense, stressed, depressed or lonely you are. Maybe I can help. Or I can lend an ear. I won't tell you endless platitudes and recycled apathetic self-help advice to tell you to keep on trudging, or thanking you for your service or walking the thin blue line like so many people. If anything I dislike, it's three things: bureaucracy, psychology and platitudes. An organic, deep-rooted intimate friendship turned relationship I'm hoping we can form, save for some light-hearted flirtation. The chronic loneliness for some company hasn't waivered pre-quarantine and again I'd very much like someone to frequently talk to long-term, maybe it can become more. Most people are either feeling starved during this time because of social isolation but there are some out there whom sentiment is no different even before COVID-19 hit. I am one of those people. Sometimes, I'd think about a hypothetical scenario in which if I go MIA and drop off the radar, I most likely wouldn't be noticed... until several weeks or months later. So, I'm taking my choice, and the shotgun approach to meet the people I wish to meet, of my own choosing and control... hoping to find some good company. If any guys out there don't like what I'm looking for, then sue me on behalf of others seeking the type of person they want. **About me:** 6'1'', 100 kg, Asian-Australian, black-haired with glasses, doing Nursing in my 2nd year (i.e. student nurse), looking to become a flight nurse (interest in ER, ICU, nursing at a VA hospital).

I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else. I am naturally drawn those that have a little bit edge to them but that are at heart protectors. I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want. I dont need someone to complete me, just someone that would find that idea romantic."

Ive never been in a relationship because vulnerability is hard and something inside of me seizes with anxiety every time I consider opening up that metaphorical door. Why? Probably a culmination of a few things but fuck that, were turning a new leaf! So here I am, tossing a small coin of faith into the fountain because dating apps make me want to embrace the cat lady life. Im looking for someone who can call me on my bullshit not to put me down, but to rise me up to be a better version of me. And allow me to do the same for them. Im kind of a late bloomer at life, so my timeline doesnt match whats typical, or expected for my age. Im learning to accept that so I hope my person will too. I work overnight at an emergency shelter for youth and Im going back to school to get my masters in the fall. I like playing video games (pumped for Animal Crossing!!), and watching youtube videos. Sometimes I watch shows and read books. I nerd out on learning about myself and others via personality tests (including *gasp* astrology). Im rambling, huh? I tend to do that. Anyway, slide into my DMs for some chatty chats. Tell me about you."

Thought Id do the basic introductions in a creative way (seriously, whats up with the vapid interests-lists nowadays?) and put a different spin on this whole hey we should, like, go out, or something business. Also, I (clearly) enjoy writing when the mood strikes so this has been a creative outlet in the midst of closures and quarantines. Come on, you can make it through the whole thing, I promise its at least entertaining. Not like you have anything better to do I suppose I should start with a disappointing disclaimer: Im not actually a huge nerd or would ever consider myself a gamer. Id probably most accurately be described as slightly above a filthy casual, have a wonderful, rich, busy, full life outside of any such hobbies, and am a little worried that Ill *prooobably* attract a bunch of 18 year league streamers who want to brag about their solo diamond rating, which is really not my cup of tea (no offense). Im just a (mostly) normal, (very) healthy, (hopefully) wholesome, (possibly) good-looking guy out here looking for his forever person. No big deal or anything. Video games have always held a special place in my heart. Im old enough to remember playing that 8-bit tank game on the Atari when I was a kid, growing up through the Nintendo consoles (until 64, ended on a high note), and finding both a sense of community and escape in the worlds they offered. It was one of the few times Id ever sit down with my dad or brother and just chill and have fun as a family, and I remember going over to friends houses after a long day at junior high specifically for the purpose of helping them get the invincibility cheat in Goldeneye. Theyve also always offered a needed escape from reality when childhood was less than great, and even now provide a calming getaway from the stresses of work and adult life. Their stories, characters, landscapes, and lore have always appealed to my itch for fantasy (and possibly my aversion to reading outside of an academic setting) and its been interesting to watch them transform from something only super antisocial nerdy kids do in their basement into an artform, and even a profession (which I will always find both highly confusing and brilliant). I think Ive always preferred the agency and control the player has in driving these stories forward to simply being a spectator at a movie or in a book, and find that even a little such investment makes me care infinitely more about what happens in a plot. I can still vividly remember reaching the finale of BioShock Infinite (no spoilers) and being *palpably shaken* by the ending, pacing around the house muttering dude what the *fuuuck* and wanting to dive right back in to experience the journey all over again. I love *starting* those adventures. You know those first steps you take into the grass outside of Pallet Town with your starter Pokmon (always Charmander, fight me) and embrace all the possibilities of what might await you? Or escaping from Helgen Keep, free to wander any which way and create any number of an infinity of lives for your character? That shit is my *jam*. Sometimes Ill save and quit just before delving into an unknown dungeon, or right after entering a new area ripe for exploration - just to give myself something to look forward to all day at work until getting home. I *love* studying various build frameworks, reading the *super nerdy* theorycrafting posts on how to squeeze every bit of damage out of your favorite class, and even conjuring up some level of backstory to make my in-game decisions carry a bit more weight. I also love stopping to smell the roses, exploring low-level content, enjoying beautiful vistas on the road from one quest to the next, and modding the ever living shit out of everything because *obviously* bears shouldnt be able to report crimes you commit in the wilderness to the guards, come on Im trying to have an immersive experience here. Im also baffled and amazed by the level of creativity and ingenuity the gaming community has come up with over the years. Ever watch a 12 year old German kid explain his inspiration for the *astonishingly beautiful* Minecraft castle he build block by block? Like bro, I could barely write my name at your age and youre like a visionary architect? Or ever spend hours scouring the internet (back in the day) for how to get past that one level or boss or puzzle (bonus: if [this](URL image means anything to you, I will actually buy you a pizza) only to find some unsung hero on page 41 of the comments with the solution? I think it has a way of bringing people together in a beautiful way, and hope to see that trend continue - especially in these otherwise isolating times. So yeah, theres my unsolicited dissertation on the deeper sociopsychological significance of video games. Arent you glad you clicked on this already?  Oh, but this is a personals post, not a philosophy discussion board. Right. Im supposed to be attracting a mate who might want to potentially keep me alive while fighting dragons and also see me naked a lot. In-game and in person, respectively, in case that warrants clarification My love life in 5 easy to digest bullet points: - I was a late bloomer. Super, *suuuper* awkward and lanky and slightly emo child, thought girls had cooties until like high school, and by then was accepted as the weird kid so obviously didnt do the whole so do your parents want to drive us to the movies after soccer? thing. - My first longterm relationship was in grad school, in my early 20s. We were best friends - and turned out to be better friends than more than friends over our 4 years together. I was highly relationship-immature and she was completely addicted to her work. Also, coincidentally, pretty addicted to dumb mobile games (so, like, please dont be), though I certainly was a far-from-perfect partner myself. Not at all compatible, but we left on really good terms and have sporadically kept in touch with nothing but wholesome well wishes. - I then dated a redditor years ago in my late 20s (yes, it happens!) which was interesting because she was literally my type down to a T and we were everything each other has ever wanted - and we were absolutely miserable together. Long history there that was beyond anything we could have done better, but a bit of a shocking wakeup call about attraction vs. compatibility. I also never felt like I really *knew* who she was, if that makes any sense, and learned I definitely cant be kept at an arms length for too long. - Since then, Ive had a few big moves and career jumps and have honestly not bothered outside of a small handful of disappointing first dates (and a few *actually crazy* people, so please dont be that either). Ive talked to quite a few people online in that time, and have immense hope in the knowledge that some of you are *incredibly beautiful, wonderful, amazing humans* and that one of you out there might just be mine. - Further thoughts because I promised 5 points and dont want to scroll up and change the original number: - I tend to be an all in kind of guy, but am trying to temper that with some of the wisdom and patience that are supposed to come along with my advanced age. Im very in touch with my emotions and know what I like/want/cant deal with, and Id likely rather jump in and smack my head on the concrete than risk losing out entirely by calculating on the sidelines. - I think attraction (in its many forms, not just the immediate physical) is important, but have learned that *organic, effortless, natural* compatibility is so much more important in the long term - which has sparked a slightly-more-than-passing interest in understanding personality types, astrology, tendencies, and other ways of empathizing with other people rather than trying to make them something theyre not. - I spend a lot of time around old people and like to think Ive learned some wisdom along the way, at least in terms of whats really important in the big picture. Im mostly drawn to character traits that last - kindness, compassion, commitment, communication, and a sense of humor are among such attractive qualities. Cool if you have nice boobs and all, but Id much rather you be able to make me laugh until my face hurts. - Like all the smart people say, communication is *the* most important thing in building a healthy relationship, and Im really hoping to foster vulnerability in communication from square one. Obviously I love longform writing (and reading - go on, push the character limit of the message box to the brink!) but am also highly partial to *actually talking* and the intimacy and attention that dropping everything else for a few hours and focusing totally on the other person can offer. I find video to be *completely distracting* in general in case thats a big must on your end. Also, not a huge fan of casual texting, as I feel it often assumes far too much comfort and indifference to nurture anything of substance. So how does this connect with the whole premise of my post? Right. Easily distracted. Making a point now. I dont know about you, but I cant think of a more romantic way to spend a Friday evening than downloading some trashy P2W MMO and leveling up together while mercilessly making fun of it. Or spending a few hours gearing up for raiding with some deep conversation over a mindless grinding session (in-game, get your mind out of the gutter ~~unless~~) Or introducing one another to our old favorite games and explaining how certain mechanics work. I actually think that can say *a lot* about a person and their ability to foster a healthy relationship with inclusive communication and patience vs. ugh just give me the controller youre doing it all wrong I think it can also reflect real-life personality in terms of conflict resolution (do you alt+F4 when things get tough or stick it out with your party?), stress management (do you audibly yell at your dude for missing an easy shot or laugh it off and move on?), and wholesomeness (do you go out of your way to help new players or promote positivity, or are you that toxic backseat raid leader who whines about every last detail that you could have done better?) There *are* real people on the other end of the orcs and elves, and its important to me to remember that and treat them as such. Unless someones being a douche, in which case Ill fully expect your unconditional support in camping their corpse or making their life a living hell until they log out. Ive always loved RPGs - from the OG Zelda games to Final Fantasy to Chrono Trigger to the Baldurs Gate series to those random fan-translated JRPGs you had to find on some seedy emulator site to Skyrim, anything story-driven with freedom to explore an open world is right up my alley. Ive never seen the appeal of shooters or MOBAs or linear platform games, though I can think of a few in each of those categories with a really rich journey and rewarding storyline. I can be both a bit of a completionist achievement hunter (because getting that one last secret item the devs hid is *important damnit* would you read an entire book only to stop before the final page?) and also a super zen enjoy-the-moment old man (i.e. ignoring the dragons and impending doom facing the entire world and setting up a quaint little farm outside of town and hunting game for food). I typically lean towards any hardcore/realism mods that really make you step back and think every decision instead of just rushing in with your invincible guy who cant possible die and bulldozing through everything in your path - I think theres something to be said for delayed gratification and having to really work for things to make them feel more rewarding. That epic piece of armor or rare item would be meaningless if just anyone could get it with relative ease, after all. And I *love* the feeling of taking my character from some weak level 1 scrub who can barely kill a chicken to a god-destroying hero, forged in the blood of his enemies, capable of wrestling with the big bad guy, vested with all the hopes and prayers of the innocent people hes encountered along the way (who are apparently content to still wander around their cabbage farms instead of grabbing some armor and fighting in the face of certain annihilation) Again, I want to stress that all of this is a hobby and a pastime, not a defining pillar of self-identity, and that this post is mostly a creative writing exercise in the hopes of finding someone of a similar inclination. If this is your lifeblood and you can only hold conversations about how great your last cosplay at gamercon was and frequently live off mountain dew and doritos, we may not get along. But maybe such a shared passion can offer some necessary compatibility and connection to build something truly beautiful and lasting. Oh, and I have no idea how I see this actually playing out, as the thought of whacking a giant kobold on our scantily clad anime warrior toons at 3am as they make high-pitched sex noises while we breathily whisper taunt up in 5, Ill pull this next group literally makes me shudder. Maybe you can help make this less awkward because I clearly have no idea what Im doing? I am definitely looking for something: - longterm (forever sounds cringey but thats definitely the endgame - with marriage and possibly a family [way] down the road) - monogamous (I dont share, *at all*, but I *guess* you can heal other players if they stand in fire) - comfortable (I find great value in being able to just be ourselves around each other, and feeling like weve always known each other somehow) - compatible (there are so many little nuances to character, especially as you get older, and its a wonder how any two people can stand being around each other - but its super important to me that we just *fit* and complement each other in *all the ways*) - intense (Im not one for bland flavors, and can be rather voracious in the right hands - the thought of going through the motions for the rest of my life is terrifying) Some unpopular, but important, opinions: - Im extremely anti-ghosting - I think this is one of the most disgusting, horrible things humans have come up with, and think its the most cowardly, immature way to close a connection. Please - if there is *literally any possibility at all for any reason* that you might ever just disappear without even a goodbye, kindly dont reach out at all, as I absolutely do not invite that energy into my life in any form. - I think sexuality is the most beautiful expression of love and trust and intimacy and hope to have *so much* of it *all the time* - with the right person. I dont see it as a commodity and dislike the gesture of needing a test drive before getting invested - I really dont think youll be disappointed with goods or services when that time comes, but its also important that we want to fuck each others brains out fairly constantly (and creatively). I see inexperience in that realm as a *plus* - as long as you have an insatiable imagination and are kinky but dont ever want to call me daddy. - I take *really* good care of myself - I nerd out on diet/nutrition stuff, work out several times a week, am more than ready for a day-long hike at the drop of a hat, and am of sound mental, spiritual, and emotional health - it is *extremely important* to me that you share these qualities, and not just a desire to work on it. While I sincerely wish the best to anyone dealing with fitness or identity or happiness struggles (and have certainly leveled up through my own) wed be wasting each others time if we werent on the same page here. I say this as a disclaimer in a post geared towards a gaming community, realizing the stereotype of the depressed, overweight neckbeard is a real thing - and assuring you that it wouldnt work out if were not on similar stages of our physical and mental health journeys. I *really* hope that doesnt come off as douchey, but just dont ever want to waste anyones time that simply wouldnt be compatible. - Im definitely attracted *far* more to intelligence, kindness, wholesomeness, and humor than anything physical - but being that we cant really help what we are drawn to and cant really logic our way out of liking certain things, I am *all* about the totally natural, girl-next-door, roll out of bed and throw on some jeans and a sweater and go type. I find makeup, piercings, tattoos, and anything else that we werent shipped with to be mostly off-putting (hey, this is not *at all* a judgement, whatsoever - just being up front with instinctual things I cant do much about so as not to waste anyones time. We are all beautiful in our own way, and never let some random guy on the internet make you feel any less for who you are and how you express your beauty!) - I crave exhaustive communication. Like stay up until 4 in the morning on the phone because fuck sleep theres this *awesome person* on the other end I want to know *everything* about. Long letters pouring our hearts and minds and souls to each other. Clear, effusive expression of feelings a la Hey, I know you were joking earlier about finding a random healer on trade chat, but its still lingering in a weird way and I think its important that we can talk about things like that, especially about uncomfortable topics that may not be fun to open up about. Also, Ill die a little inside if ever asked so how was your day? and dont understand small talk at all so might respond curiously if met with such vapidity. Also also, the ability to carry a conversation is apparently a lost art and I genuinely dont understand treating dialogue like a short answer on a school test just meant to provide minimal information. haha yeah I like that show too *crickets* - simply does not compute in my brain and I wont know what to do with that as I sit back and try to read into some deep thought process that likely isnt there. Its important that we both *want* and *choose* to be here, and that this is a *priority* in both of our lives. So, if youve made it this far and havent been scared off yet, by all means say hello! I promise to reply to anyone who writes or comments, even if its to politely say Hey, thanks for the message, but I dont think wed work out and dont want to waste your time. Take care! and, honestly, Im hoping this doesnt get super popular because my monogamist brain doesnt even like the prospect of *talking* to more than one person at a time. Lets keep it chill but be clear with intentions and feelings as we go? But please - look, this post has over 3,000 words and took me several days to put together: you can do better than hey wanna chat?. Im trying to treat this with the gravity of potentially talking to my potential *person* for the first time, and Id appreciate if you could do the same. Oh, and Im *very good* with shy/introverted/quiet/nerdy people, so just be yourself - Ill almost definitely find it adorable Ill just be here all day trying not to touch my face and freaking out at how much trying not to touch my face makes me want to touch my face. Stay safe, be good to one another, wash your hands, and best wishes on your journeys."

It sounds desperate to me, but I cant deny thats how I feel. The kicker is, I've never really actively sought a date/relationship. I'm generally a shy person, even more so when it comes to dating. And I tend to keep my feelings and opinions to myself. So, you can see my dilemma here. And its starting to feel a little weird now that most of my friends are engaged or married, and some having kids. Ive heard the professional bridesmaid trope, but what about professional groomsman? Obviously, Im here for the same reason as everyone else: seeking a relationship. I want to catch feelings. I want the teasing, the laughs, the intimacy, the vulnerability, the affection. Yeah, I know the hard part is getting there. I triedand quickly abandonedthe usual dating apps. It really wasn't my thing. Since that plan didn't work out, I decided to turn to Reddit. Here's a brief look into my extraordinarily normal life. I think it more accurately describes me than a witty blurb in a Tinder profile. - I'm college-educated and have a good 9-5 office job that I love to hate. Im an engineer by training, but thats not really my daily function anymore. Lately Ive been questioning if I want to sit at a desk for 30+ years. If you have any tips for getting out of the rat race, Im all ears. - Im a lifelong urbanite. Ive lived in the same neighborhood for nearly my entire life. - I read the news every day. A LOT. Its probably the only thing I regularly do that could be considered a hobby. Really more like a habit, now that I think about it. Im pretty well-informed. - Id like to travel more, but Ive been too busy adulting lately. Ive been to a few interesting places. A travel companion would be nice. - Ive been in a gym maybe four times in my life, total. Im not obese, but admittedly out of shape. Its definitely something Im beginning to work on. I dont want to be a hunchback in 10 years. - Im a very data/information-oriented person. I always research something first, whether its buying a new appliance, booking a flight, driving directions, or the weather. I guess its the engineer in me. - Im not a foodie like a lot of people seem to be. That doesnt mean I dont like good food; I have my preferences. Pizza and pasta are my primary food groups. Also, Im a vegetarian for no apparent reason. - I smoke cigars. Its something I got into a few years ago. I dont smoke anything else. - While were on the topic of vices, booze is cool too. Cold beers or cocktails are great. Drinking it outside in nice weather is even better. Margaritas are life. Im not a big wine drinker, but its something I want to get into. - Im indifferent to sports. But I wont turn down an invite to a tailgate if I have nothing better to do (see previous bullet point). - Religion/spirituality is not a part of my life. I was raised in a Catholic family, but I dont practice or subscribe to anything particular. - Speaking of family, Im an only child and I have a semi-estranged relationship with my parents. - I really wish I could speak another language fluently. Ive learned a bit of some languages, but forgot a lot of it from disuse. Im fascinated with languages in general. - My taste in music is all over the place, but mostly pop music lately. Music festivals definitely aint my thing. - Im usually watching something on Netflix/Amazon/etc. at night. Now watching: Westworld. I plan on checking out the Tiger King on Netflix soon. I heard its completely batshit. - Im not an animal person. I dont mind them (unless they jump all over me), I just dont want to be responsible for one. - I have the same opinion of children, and I highly doubt that will ever change. Send me a message if youre around my age, in the Philly area, and think we would get along. Working from home is getting boring, and I dont know how much longer this will last."

I love someone who is able to keep up with me mentally; I tend to fall in love first through my mind Ive discovered as of late. I suppose I always knew that deep down but it hit me like a ton of bricks earlier today. I enjoy someone that loves to flirt as I find myself particularly enjoying it and Im not bad at if I must say so myself. I find seduction and courting almost like a battle of wits. If you are particularly silver-tongued, I will probably turn into a puddle of ooze in your presence. I am soft despite all that I have suffered. I believe that hard though it may be tenderness of the heart and spirit are something to strive for. Vulnerability is sexy though lord knows I struggle with that just like anyone else.

I feel like Ive spent so long on my own with no one in my corner the idea of someone wanting to protect me and guide me is like my personal kryptonite. I am attracted to dominant personalities but you need not be forceful to have my attention. I simply gravitate toward those that help my softness and hesitancy and perhaps find it charming. What Im looking for is rather simple. Im looking for a genuinely kind, loving person. I want someone who isnt afraid to tell me that they care about me and that they love me if/when things progress to that. Im a very affectionate person and I genuinely enjoy being around someone that is perhaps a silly and is keen on letting people know how important they are to him. Alas, if I sound too good to be true I most certainly am not. Im a bigger girl and I find that most men dont find me to their taste in that manner. I also care for an ailing father and most dont have the patience for not being number one in my life. Still, my cursed bleeding heart compels me to not give up fighting for what I want. I dont need someone to complete me, just someone that would find that idea romantic."
32,vulnerability,ForeverAloneDating,25 [M4F] Looking to build a life with someone. Someone to bother me and I in return.,1,frlwyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/frlwyz/25_m4f_looking_to_build_a_life_with_someone/,2020-03-30 17:48:22,"I am trying to find the right words to start of this message, but this time instead of attempting to impress you I want to be honest for once. Take it or leave it. I am a twenty five year old fella from Texas and stubborn as they come. I've got my simple likes and dislikes as coffee, music, my poetry and a dog that never seems to get tired of me. It seems simple, but I've always believed that if your pour your heart and soul onto something a new sort meaning starts to speak for itself. I've had my share of challenges that have left more troubled, broken and that I am still healing from. My faith isn't as strong as one would like it to be and life isn't in an ideal place. And that's where I begin. My situation shouldn't stop me from getting back up and giving life a stubborn shot. The dream of the younger boy that I once was still comes in my life like a shooting star not failing to light that part of your heart and mind. A dream and a sentiment that I would end up finding the person who can put with me and I with her. That we'll end up driving each other crazy and for the right reasons. I thought then that by my age I would be married and with kids of my own trying to get on my nerves. When I dream to that life feels enough. For it to happen I am not willing to comprise on what it takes. The commitment, the vulnerability. The side of transparency and the side of trust. The side of morality and values. The core of not giving up on the other no matter how mad it all can get. Most of all love. If I am ever to make that dream come true I know that it's going to be with a Christian girl who takes her faith at heart. A faith and sentiment that we can cultivate and built from the heart. I've been stubborn and thinking to myself that if I wait then this person will come into my life. But I realize that I must also do my part and be open in some way. So this my message to the universe. A sort message in a bottle and a waver from my part that perhaps will be swayed onto the right hands. And if it does land in your hands, I can't wait to meet you."

The curse would be that people, most of the time, think I have a hidden agenda or its a mask I put on. And its hard to get to know people once they put up that wall.

Vulnerability: its a tough time where a lot of people are so bent on being savage and not caring. Mostly as defense mechanisms. But Ive come to realize that the rewards albeit being much more rare than risks, are worth it. As humans we spend so much time and effort trying to put walls to protect ourselves but end up losing pieces of ourselves in the process. That is not something that I want for myself anymore.

I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours.

I guess you might say I'm shy or reserved. Introverted. INFP. Pisces so I'm into all of that artistic stuff like music, theatre, dance, etc. I don't smoke/drink/or use drugs and I don't curse very much either. I believe in being kind and polite whenever you can. I've been told I see the world more gently than others. I love cute animals, hot tea, staying up late, enjoying rain. I like to find the pleasure in little things. I've fallen a bit in love with Korean culture and I'm teaching myself the language. I'm somewhere on the autism spectrum. Dealing with social anxiety, but it's much better than it used to be. I've got couple years of college left getting my BA in English and then I'm hoping to teach English abroad. About you-Between 25-35. Educated. No need to share my same interests but would be nice to have something in common that we can bond over. I find passion very attractive. Having something you love. Also vulnerability is attractive. I want to be with someone who is open with their emotions. I like men feminine in a masculine way (think Kpop boys) and I like women masculine in a feminine way (think Kristen Stewart). Androgynous. Nerdy. I've always said my ideal person is a contemporary dancer, but that's probably asking too much. At the end of the day I just want someone who will accept me and love me as I am, If this sounds like you, please PM me and hopefully we can talk."

I am broken down. I have depression, anxiety, social anxiety and c-ptsd. If that turns you off, I don't blame you. I am looking for someone who sees people as more than the sum of their parts. I like indie games and comic books, but more so because they uses fantastical elements to explore themes of human nature: * I appreciate that Darth Vader was saved by his son because Luke did the opposite of his father: He rejected Yoda's teachings and chose to unapologetically love his family over the Jedi Code. * I appreciate that Spider-man is about how anyone can be Spider-man, that anyone is capable of greatness. * I appreciate that the Guardians of the Galaxy movies are about broken individuals who make horrible choices who then created a family of broken individuals who learn to make decent choices together. Anyways, I'm 5'2"", chubby, employed, independent workaholic who also goes to school. I love giving affirmations and physical touch. I want to marinate you in compliments!!!

Advance warning and my apologies if youre a huge Jungian stan, because Im probably going to butcher my explanation of it. So, the Persona: in order to conform to imposed social expectations, we interact with others through different performative masks (personas) that hide our unacceptable true self. I feel like I live this concept to an unhealthy degree. I paradoxically cant be vulnerable with people without feeling highly uncomfortable, despite having a deeply unfulfilled need to basically bare my soul to someone. \-- Whew. That was likely way too pretentious and heavy to open with. Whatever. Vulnerability/authenticity, right? No? Okay cool, lets just pretend I didnt say that entire bit then. 26. Kind of wordy, rarely eloquent. Looking for my human, but my expectations are basically in the trash at this point. I love brains, both professionally and personally (so send me your brain scans, its my kink). I did yoga this morning, so I'll be pretty flexible until at least tomorrow morning. None of this is an invitation to be weird in my inbox, I'm just really hitting a blank here. Last three songs I listened to: [Frank Ocean - Pyramids](URL [Martin Jensen, Olivia Holt - 16 Steps](URL [Panic!

The primary factor here is docility. What arouses me most is weakness. A woman's behaviour ought to indicate some vulnerability to me: she should be unsure, needy, even a bit desperate. I'm turned on by depression, insecurity, and clinginess. When interacting with a woman, I want her to seem a little off-balance. When she blushes and looks away, when she has a wound in her heart, I'm attracted; when she defers to me, looks to me for guidance in a situation, I'm attracted; when she's completely lost and doesn't know what to do, I'm attracted; when she's close to me, afraid of something and finding me strong, I'm attracted. If you want to arouse the dominance in my behaviour, you need to show submission to me in yours. Make it clear that my opinion matters to you more than other people's -- ideally, that it's the only one that does. Make it clear you want to be in my presence. When you speak, don't speak of preferences or desires; speak of needs. You need me to order for you at a restaurant. You need me to pick out your oufit. Be a little shy and demure. If, when you look at me, I feel you're looking up at me, you are small and lovely in my eyes. I enjoy blatant favouritism in how you treat me versus how you treat others. If you stare at me and talk to me first when you walk into a room, I will notice that. If you're making bored small talk with other people but light up when I approach, I will notice that. If you step in closer to me and open yourself via body language, I will notice that. Respect me. More than that -- worship me. Listen raptly to me. Stay near me. Look up at me. Smile and glance away. If I talk to you look at no one but me. Show weakness. Defer to me. Adore me. Need me. Confide in me. Look to me for help and guidance. Be sad. Be afraid. Be helpless and lost. Make yourself small and tuck yourself against me. Things I look for: shy smiles, blushing, downcast eyes, lingering parted lips, facing me, self-touching, lingering proximity, eagerness to please, enthusiasm toward me specifically. There are more, but honestly, this specific example part is the weakest and least important. Body language, the way one speaks, these things vary person to person, and instead of any one individual piece it's clusters that generate significance. This is especially important when we're deeply conversing or interacting more intimately. I want your devotion, loyalty, and submission more clear -- I want to know you're damaged, or desperate, or needy. I want you to cling to me and look to me for approval.

Once I'm hooked, you know I'm not going anywhere, don't you? You can just stop making any effort whatsoever... Any crumb of validation you throw at me will be welcomed as if it was a romantic weekend at an all-inclusive Maldiva's 5 star resort. I could write a post that would look like a *curriculum* with all the skills I have developed and accomplished across the years to be the ""perfect partner you have always wanted"". You know that's pointless, right? You don't really care if I cook like a Michelin star chef, if I give massages like a 50-year-old Chinese woman at a parlor, or if I speak 5 goddamn languages. In the end, it's all rooted in my fear of never being good enough for anyone, not even for you. You must be thinking *""Hell no! Daddy issues chicks gotta be crazy. I don't want no girl setting my house on fire with me inside, or ripping my dick off to put in a blender!""*. No, fellow redditor, my boundaries are too weak for that. No matter how bad you screw up, I'll be always putting the blame on me and making excuses for your shitty behavior. So, dontcha worry, your ass is safe. Oh, and I was almost forgetting: I won't be clingy either. I'll be so afraid to annoy you, and so busy creating paranoia in my head that you secretly despise me that you'll barely hear from me when you don't want to nut. My fear of vulnerability will prevent me from sharing any negative emotions with you, so I'll always have a big joyful warm smile waiting for you. Sounds like a perfect win, doesn't it gentlemen? *clap clap clap* I don't care where in the world you are. In fact, I even prefer if you are far away, so I won't have to tame my fear of intimacy. Yeah, I know. I was supposed to be promiscuous, but I can't even do Daddy issues right. Come on. Send me a message. You know you are bored and are just procrastinating at work anyway. Time to go to the toilet and take that low quality dick pic that will make me roll my eyes so hard I'll see my brain, but will pretend it turns me on. :*"

Im a hopeless romantic, not even close to 7 foot tall but most likely taller than you so dont worry, otherwise pretty normal guy who cant believe hes 19 already and who rarely lets his facial hair go past a few days stubble. I like wandering through the park, befriending strangers dogs, I reply quickly and I will take a quiet night in vs. a loud night out any day of the week, I take excellent care of myself, can talk your ear off about diet and fitness and will probably ask you to come to the gym with me at some point, and think I look ok in a suit as well as out of one. Im also a dom, even though I dont like labels and am still not entirely sure what it means and have yet to explore much of what that even is as Ive been saving it for the right person who I have most likely yet to meet. I mention all of this because its important, much more important than a tedious list of kinks and limits, because Im a person with a life Im passionate about, complete with flaws and imperfections and surprises and depths you should want to learn and love before we discuss our favorite spanking implements (my hands). D/s is not just a sexual dynamic to me; the intense and awesome depth of sexuality it can offer is, instead, an expression and reflection of the intense and awesome vulnerability and love that exist between a dom and his sub. The possession, hunger, electricity, utter filth, blissful peace, and terrifying beauty inherent in an ideal dynamic stem from the mind and the heart, over time and trust, not from hormones in a moment of physical weakness. I need cuddles, patience, warmth, unconditional praise of my cooking, unabashed nerdiness, unwavering loyalty, unlimited kindness, and an embarrassing amount of kissing. But I also need to be able to stop you mid-sentence with a look, pull you to your knees by your hair, earn and exercise complete control over your orgasms, and call you a good girl knowing full well what that does to you. Im a dom, and Im looking for a sub. Not a little/sub, but rather my little/sub. Like a one and only forever sort of deal that starts in friendship and blossoms into a love that would make the rest of the world jealous if they could ever understand. I want to date like normal people, only knowing that the endgame includes and involves much more than 5 minutes of missionary once a week. Im not looking for my equal; Im looking for my complement. We will likely be very different in many ways, and I hope we can both learn so much from each other as we build a loving relationship alongside a beautiful d/s dynamic. Maybe weve shared the same dream our whole lives and, in some sense, already know each other better than anyone else. I hope this was enough to ignite the spark we need to connect. we will never know if you dont reach out. Im not going anywhere, I wont bite (yet), and am clearly a fan of epically long letters, creativity, and originality. But, Just be you. Thats all I can ever ask of you, even without knowing you yet. Im ready. Are you?"
51,vulnerability,ForeverAloneDating,32 [M4F] Absurdist looking to share meaning. (Long Distance or Close Proximity)(Ohio),2,d9wdq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/d9wdq8/32_m4f_absurdist_looking_to_share_meaning_long/,2019-09-27 16:24:12,"I wake up every day, contemplating that residual existence, whereby coffee is made, a mad dash for the door from a long sleep, out into the cool morning air and into a temperature controlled environment. Pushing a rock up a hill, is the metaphor of choice for my existence. I managed to shed religion, fight more diligently in the politics, and find myself wondering if an adventurous type would take up the challenge of the thinker? Alas here we are, the edge of nowhere, waiting to create something meaningful, with one another? Before we dive in any deeper, allow me to list some of those things humans value. * Diligent worker (Two full time jobs) * Currently No Kids / Divorces or STD's (Yay!! Right!? Anyone!?!) * College graduate (Bachelors Political Science / Journalism minor) * Philosopher Type (INFJ-T) (Turbulent or Tubular you decide) * Politically active (Works as a public / private type) * Critical Thinker (What...you want me to write something here...for the sake of the trend?) * Is currently loosing weight (328-280lbs and shrinking) * Large catalogue of interests (Anime, Vidja Games, Board Games, D&amp;D, Hiking, Camping, Astronomy...Extensive...) * Reads...and Oh,...reads some more,...wine, and books? * Bad Bukowski style poet (I'll write you poems, most are terrible. Like a kid giving macaroni pictures to you, except those are solid gold compared to my poems.) * Writer (Cosmic Horror? Unreliable Narrator? Are we talking about last weekend?) * Terrible Artist (Just ask to paint you and watch me make a terrifying abstract.unintentionally.) * Pessimist (Schopenhauer type, but wielding an optimism ray gun to satisfy your palate) * Introverted Extrovert (Good alone, but friendly with kids and other pets. Batteries included.) * Comedy (My response to the absurdity) Well would you look at that, you read that list and are still hungry for at least content or perhaps intrigued? Well if you haven't already gathered I talk, write and think too much. I like phone calls from living creatures, preferably late in the evening, so you can tell me the substance of your day, and we can create our strategy of rebellion against an uncaring universe. I'll travel outside my comfort zone with the correct person, I'm already outside of it here. I'm an outcast, a rebel, a strange one, motivated and in a state of change. I like adventures, I enjoy boring nights, amplified by a large fire and speaking of dreams, memories and hopes. Well, one more list, the one with disqualifying material is appropriate I suppose. **Disqualifying Dots :D** * Rebellion is not in your blood. * Dishonesty * No Vulnerability (We should take risks together, rewards together, reciprocation is important.) * Zombies (Please only the living, I don't want to be Dead by Dawn \*Hard Wink\*) So, you came through the marsh of discontent (\*You insert quarters to that satisfying clunking sound and the continue screen\*) and managed to empty your savings of quarters to finish the quest, either out of entertainment or perhaps to get on the high score screen? Well let me say a few more things before we exit the swamp. I want to fill a role and have one filled, so without speaking too cryptically, I'm a monogamous type. I am open to new experiences, I am open to challenging convention, but I want someone who will not abandon me, and shall help me give battle to the universe until I am one with the absurdity, as I shall repay the request. I would eventually like I family, if it's too late I suppose ill find out. I'm negotiable to many things and understanding. Transparency will be evident in my workings. Alright, that's it you made it to the end. Your trousers are soaked with mud, still not certain what any of this means? Its an interpretive piece, you will have to confer the meaning with yourself, since that is the only way it is made. If you want to build meaning with me, I'm interested in chatting. I'm not quick in responding, I like to think about a response, but if you are out there, the pace shall increase as we identify one another. I leave all other oddities, inferences and peculiarities to the brave adventurers who may enter this wrinkle in the fabric. I'm sure there are only a few of you, but it is by design and hopefully we shall have found one another."

I am looking for a meaningful psychological connection with someone who shares the same drive to have an intellectual conversation instead of breeding rapidly. I am more emotional (in a nice way) than I make it out to seem in my texting in public, so forgive me :'). I am interested in someone who is utterly loyal and mature. I've had my fair share of bad relationships and I'm simply looking for someone who is wholly sound to spend my life with. My hobbies include sailing, gaming (Xbox One ESO primarily), writing, reading, digital and traditional art, watching movies, and psychoanalysis. There are plenty of other things as well but it would take up too much room. I'm majoring in behavioral sciences and hoping to apply it to reality because I feel as if mental health is a huge crisis in our society and I'd like to contribute positively. Here are some fun facts: - I am very robotic at times of first introduction but I have a rather light silly personality, with the capability of seriousness. - If I could live off of two foods for eternity they would be spring rolls and pierogi. - I live in San Diego however long distance relationships are fine as long as we plan to close the gap eventually. - I am overweight (not morbidly) but I would like to change that with the right support. - Naturally low blood pressure and cholesterol so if you test me I won't die of a heart attack. - I am demisexual (sexual intimacy over time) bordering asexuality (preferring no sexual intimacy but still romantic intimacy.) I don't prioritize sex in a relationship. - I do not drink, smoke, attend parties, etc. For the sake of my well-being. - I am extremely monogamous. - I am not religious. But I can respect religion as long as it isn't forced upon me. Half of my family are conservative, Italian Roman Catholics and the other are liberal, relaxed English atheists. I lean more towards the latter for obvious reasons. - I absolutely love philosophy. Here are some of my favorite things when looking for someone: - Deeper voices are my weakness. All other physical criteria be damned. - 29 is perhaps my limit. Well, not mine, but my family's. I don't want to be disowned. - Maturity is a must. The ability to be serious. - Emotional availability is a good thing. Not a vulnerability. And last but not least. Communication. Communication is an important factor of why my relationships fail. If you're not willing to communicate with your partner or open up to them there is literally no point in dating. I'm not referring to telling them your every move, but it would be nice not to vanish for great lengths of time under mysterious circumstances. It generates a lot of anxiety in me as it would any other human. I look forward to meeting my future companion."

I dont say this out of conceit. Im not superior to or better than anyone else. But I am unique...unapologetically so. I tell off-color jokes and laugh with my friends, but theres a part of me they dont see. Almost nobody sees it. Beneath the humor and repartee, theres someone else underneath. Someone I dont let out often, unless its behind a screen. The existential, magical stardust reality of me. Its a person who desires a deeper, meaningful connection. Total honesty. Vulnerability. Intensity. Passion. A man who believes the greatest pursuit in life is to know himself, know others, and be fully known by someone. A couple of avenues for this kind of connection have opened up recently. One turned out not to be a good fit. Another is still out there floating in the ether. Will that songbird fly back? Who the fuck knows? But its the best try Ive made in a long time and I can live with that. With that in mind, I guess Ive decided to just fling the doors open wide and see who walks in. I could give you details. Theres my age, which you already know. The fact that Im divorced and that I have two children. Or that Im pretty overweight but trying to get healthier. But thats all just surface chatter. I am so much more than the sum of a few factual statements. In the immortal words of Jaime Lannister, There are no men like me. Only me. And so it is. The truth speaks, and the truth liberates. You might be reading this and thinking to yourself, This guy is weird as fuck. Good. Youre right. My level of weird is, by and large, not universally compatible. Im not casting a wide net, here. I know I wont get very many replies to this post. Thats by design. If youre looking for casual chit-chat, Im not your guy. I want to know what music youre listening to and why it moves you. Tell me the dream you had last night and what it made you feel when you woke up. Give me honesty. Give me depth. Give me intensity. I expect there are probably only one or two of you out there who are 1) intrigued by this post and 2) capable of engaging on this level. Again, thats okay. People are different and they each have their own needs and desires. These are mine... and they happen to be very particular. Ive fooled myself by making ads here in the past that more closely conform to the norm but I am not the norm. So I decided to make this one instead. Its more closely aligned with the truth of who I am. Complicated. Messy. Deep. Intense. Imperfect. Wondrous. And now lets see what happens."

I especially like sex with whomever I'm dating at the time, but guess what? It's not you. Not right now, and not for some time. Don't put me in a situation where I just write you off as one of those guys. With that said, I can talk about sex, there's just a line. You know damn well what it is. YOU'LL KNOW WHEN I'M DTF. *Things I'm looking for** I love to talk on the phone so as soon as both parties are comfortable let's do that . For me to feel comfortable with you, I have to feel like a certain level of vulnerability has been reached. So yeah, let's talk about the light hearted and easy topics, but I wanna get to the good stuff. The intimate stuff. If that's not something you're willing to do, then we might not get doing long-term. I'm saying all this assuming you've read or will read my previous posts.

This is much more stressful than I imagined. Be kind to me please, Reddit. I am located near San Francisco and would love to meet someone near by if possible. However, if you're from Ireland that is also more than acceptable as I am planning to be traveling there soon. I love the greenery and the accents. I am finishing up a degree in psychology and currently work as a therapist. I love helping other people. I also love being nosey and trying to figure out what's going on in people's heads. It's an unsolvable mystery! Other things I love: DOGS, Netflix (Russian Doll changed me), making and listening to music of all kinds (Hamilton), letting my room get really cold then piling on a ton of fuzzy blankets, babies (no shame), the beach, games and sports (not football), making people laugh, margaritas, and marijuana. There's more, but let's leave it at that. I am in a weird place in my life in which I am examining how I can find happiness. It's kind of existential crisis-y. I do know that finding a strong, romantic connection has become very important to me. From reading this, you can probably gather that I'm verbose and passionate. I tried for a long time to neutralize that part of me, but it would not be quieted. So hopefully you will see it as a gift rather than a curse. I can be a little unpredictable, and I am still compassionate and thoughtful. I am hoping to find someone who doesn't take himself too seriously and who strives to be genuine, kind, open-minded, and thoughtful. Thanks for reading if you got all the way down here! I'm wishing all of you gorgeous people lots of luck on your romantic endeavors!"

It probably isnt a good idea for me to be looking for a relationship right now, but who knows, maybe something awesome can happen. I know this post is going to sound terrible, but thats totally fine because itll filter out a lot of incompatible people. Im not looking for someone to fix me - Im quite aware that my problems are my responsibility. I also know that I still have value as a person despite all my shortcomings. Im not going to be taken advantage of, so if youre reading this and my vulnerability seems concerning, dont worry. :) Im honestly a mess of a person. I really want to improve myself and I have made great progress, but its rough going and things have been up and down. Im NEET and am currently incapable of being independent. Mental health is my biggest struggle. Social interactions are very difficult for me most of the time, but I do have a few friends. Ive never been in a romantic relationship but I have come very close. I know what love feels like and I know what it feels like to really fit with someone. I think I need to become good friends with someone before I can consider anything intimate. I spend most of my time on my computer playing games or watching twitch. Id love to spend more time outside of my home, but Ive been feeling too bad to do so. I dont really know why Im even writing this post. I dont know what to say. I probably cant handle a relationship anyway. Please PM me for further info, Id be more comfortable giving specifics that way. What Im looking for: A guy between the ages of 22-28 that is kind, intelligent, and open minded. Realistically you might have to have a long history with video games for us to have stuff in common. Also itd be good if you were from the east coast. I develop attraction based off of personality and emotional connection but I do have preferences when it comes to physical attributes. I dont think Ive ever been attracted to someone that wasnt white or Asian, so thats probably important. Sorry if this post seems like poop. Not expecting much of anything really, but figured Id try. P.S. While youre here I might as well try to provide something worthwhile, so Ill share one of my favorite videos: URL"

I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.  Marilyn Monroe Firstly, I have no tack in playing this dating game of high value market; like, while I really should be giving you this lovely PowerPoint presentation on bullet point highlights of wholesome-me and why I am perfect dating/mating material instead, I will tell you upfront that I am sorta a mess of a person and what a woman like me have to offer as potential date. Romance to me means trust, respect, empathy, compassion, vulnerability, support, and...you sharing with me that your cock is hard thinking of me. Monogamy isnt for everyone, unfortunately. I am non-monogamous. Which means that I am in no way strictly just monogamous even though I lean more towards monogamy, I want the sexual openness that we can both can agree/consent on our terms. It doesnt necessarily mean that I want to sleep around, I just have mild kinks I want to experience with other people outside my partner, mostly for short-term. I am currently a side chick, tangled in web of secret desires spun by own selfishness...ever so quickly I am learning it is a tragedy disguised as a fantasy... You can choose to either take it or leave it from what I have disclosure. I only wanted to be honest in my situation and not corner you in any way, no matter how uncomfortable the truth may be of me. With all that being said, I have never been in a real relationship/no real sexual experiences. Not only I am looking for a primary lover; I want you to be my best friend, my partner in crime, and my companion in life. I want a bond that is emotionally intense and meaningful to us. There will be no rush as it will come with time and effort on both sides. I want us to communicate comfortably with each other, without the fear of judgement and abandonment. Allow to be our authentic-self; no masks, no walls. Yin; Im highly sensitive. Im very emotional. Im stubborn. Im too honest. Im too idealistic. Im impractical. Im a people-pleaser. Im hot and cold. Im melancholy. I'm indecisive. I'm flaky. Im insecure. I have a learning disability. I ramble. Im very difficult to deal with at times. I have mediocre cooking skills. I worry too often, about anything and everything. Im a loner, I need a lot of alone time. I live under a rock. Yang; Im confidently unconfident. Im compassionate. Im empathetic, possibly an empath. Im silly. Im a lifelong learner. I have lots of love and affectionate to give. I see the good in bad. I seek to understand and not judge harshly. Im getting okay with accepting the grey areas in life. I crave for your vulnerability, your empathy, your compassion, your affection, your support, your devotion, your gentle kisses, the thrusts of your hard cock inside me, and the warmth of your arms that encompass my every being. You would inspire and encourage me to become a better version of myself. So, where am I in life right now? Right off the bat, I can tell you that I do not have my shit together. I recently had a fallout with a career pathway, and currently seeking a new direction (dont know where itll take me but I like to think I am moving forward). I still live with my parents. But I am trying my best to get there. I have personal aspirations, dreams, career goals, and relationship goals I want to achieve and if I fail, I know I will be okay and its not the end of the world now. Im super into psychology. Appearance matters, I wont lie. But to what extent? Well, my biological inner workings seems to call the shot in this for the most part..my inner slut seems to be wet for a man who is confident, assertive, tall, witty/intelligent, charming/good sense of humor, ambitious, and gentlemanly. I do like a man with a somewhat of a wild side; a devil- may-care attitude adorned with scruffiness is a nice causal attire on men. Of course, these are simply guidelines. I want you to just be yourself... it is very much cringe to see a fish trying to fly like a bird. Trust me, I have tried myself. FYI, I am just your average girl-next-door type. Sorry to disappoint if you were hoping a bombshell. Please handle my heart with care. It is not easy for me to open up. I am learning to be okay with tearing down these seemingly infinite walls, maybe I can finally reach you. I think I am ready to take that chance and fall in love... I want to go slow and enjoy the journey, its not a race silly rabbit. Ironically, you got a goddam essay from me rather than a PowerPoint... PM me if interested, with a bit on what you are all about and a face pic of you is highly encouraged (out of curiosity for the most part..p.s. leave out your dick pic for now, gotta save some mystery if we play you know), I never reply to comments because I can.

So this time I wanted to write it in our language so we both could understand it. Ive talked to some incredible people, people that I liked, people that I didnt like so much, people that I thought were you. I dont know what you look like yet, but I bet your smile is a wonderful sight, I just want to make you smile. To be honest sometimes I lose hope that youre not really out their, it seems like no one matches my intensity or really hears me. Are you leaving clues for me that Im picking up on? Is the timing not right? Are you in my life right now but Im refusing to believe its you? So many questions and very few answers. I want you to know that Im willing to accept you in what ever form you come. I know I still have plenty of time to find you, but I dont think we should wait. I know sometimes I can be a mess, but Im sure you could handle that. Ive been getting better though, Im getting help and Im getting better. I really broken out of my shell. Maybe youre still hiding in yours? I cant wait for the days we get to stay up and talk, just talk. I have many ideas and I know you do to. I cant wait to laugh with you. The holidays are coming up I know it can be rough for most, but we can help each other through that. All I need is your smile. I dont know what I should say to get you to reach out to me, Ive been pretty open about a lot of things, but maybe youre waiting for a secret phase to know Im the person youre actually looking for. I like to believe you already have an idea of me so theres no reason to post a picture because theres plenty on my profile. Maybe youre upset with the type of photos I take and Im sorry for that, if Im honest I feel like I need to do that to at least get some type of attention because even though we both like to believe that looks dont matter, they do and people understand visuals more than words. You must be somewhat disappointed in me though because you know that I know looks dont matter to you. Im sorry. If were on the subject of disappointment, I know youre even more upset with me because of the way I let others use me this year. I know it wasnt the best decision but I just wasnt happy so I became a tool of pleasure to make others feel better, dont blame the others who hurt me because I allowed them to hurt because I didnt care about my body after my friends betrayed at that party and I guess my mind just broke down. I care about myself now. I regret going those 3 months of not talking to anyone and not going out, I became a stranger to my friends, the real ones, and even my family. If anything I disappointed myself more than anyone. Ive been expressing my emotions through creative means now. I should let you know that I got into acting, Ive been pretty good at it. I now Im starting to write, Im working on a personal project and I would love your input. By the way Im sorry for being so nit-picky with movies, knowing how the films are made really changes your experience, but I still love me a good cash-grab blockbuster! Sorry if this is a little too long, but you how my mind works, it just keeps going and going. I should stop assuming that you know me, because if you did we would already be together by now. I dont even know how to end this, Im not the best at finishing things... I guess I should tell a little secret. I really want to be a pop star but I have no singing abilities. I would want to be like a mixture of Katy Perry and Lady Gaga, But I wouldnt sing pop exactly, more like early 2000s alternative rock/punk rock/grunge. Thats pretty dumb, but someone would be into it. Anyways I hope you see this! - xoxo The one whos been searching for you. "

Im looking for something quite niche, so excuse me while I ramble on for a bit to make myself absolutely clear. I have no romantic experience whatsoever. Nada! Im shy, and Ive never met anyone I clicked with enough to help me push through that shyness. Its a little embarrassing to be so inexperienced (avoiding the V word because it makes me feel like I should be sacrificed on an altar) at the grand old age of 25... Plus Im lonely, and have heaps of affection in me but no one to give it to! Socially I do just fine - I have friends I love, I travel whenever I can, I hold down an interesting job in which I work closely with all sorts of people. But romantic relationships require this extra vulnerability that Ive just never been able to face. After a few failed experiments with online dating, Ive decided I need to approach it more slowly. I think talking to someone online would be a good, gentle start. Like a romantic pen friend? Of course if we really click Id hope to work up to meeting, but that might take me a while, so youd need to enjoy writing back and forth for its own sake. I say writing - I would like our conversation to be text based, as voice chat brings the shyness back in full force! And there is something very liberating about the written word. Thats what Im hoping that find - now a little more about me. I love stories; books, poetry, TV and film, comedy, theatre, that stuff is my daily bread. Music brings me great joy too, and walking in nature (Im a country girl, surrounded by fields, woods, water), and hanging out with my pets. I cook and write, both cheerfully badly. Im a night owl, Im awkward and tomboyish, and Im always laughing. If you cant see the absurdity in life, whats the point? You can be anywhere and anything, as long as you think we might get on! Im bi - all genders are welcome. And personality attracts me long before looks. Be kind and have a sense of humour, and well probably get on. What I want probably sounds slow and limited and boring as hell to 99% of people - but I only need it to make sense to one! Please send a message - Id love to hear from you :) "

Im very 420 friendly and recently got my first tattoo. I was raised extremely different than most, so dont be afraid of your crazy life, we can share stories haha.

So I'm 28, male, a single father to a 5 year old boy, I work from home as a freelance writer. It's probably less interesting than you're thinking. I live in the UK, South Scotland specifically, but originally from England. I like movies, binge worthy TV shows, gaming (recently got back in to WoW, rip my life) and reading. I love history and writing, and bury myself in the past or some fantasy world to escape the problems of our present. For the past few years I've developed extreme social anxiety, which probably manifested from long term depression and self loathing. I don't have any friends, I live in a town overrun with sheep and the elderly. They race the sheep here annually, that is what passes for community fun. Great, right? I struggle with abandonment and attachment, if that makes sense. I can form a bond super quick but the vulnerability if it sometimes makes me terrified. Honestly, I'm just tired of being alone, having no one to share my interests and thoughts with. I'm weird, obviously, but Im not judgemental either. Ideally it'd be great if we shared some interests, makes conversation flow a bit better. Either way I'm cool for a chat, and I'd love to hear if you have similar issues to mine, makes me feel less of an outcast, less isolated. Again, no judgement here. Looking forward to any responses.

It was a first-time occurrence, and caught me by total surprise, but thankfully I came to my senses relatively swiftly. Anyway, aside from indoctrinating me into the bizarre psychological repercussions of a strange, modern-day phenomenon, there was a silver-lining to the whole thing: it made me realize how profoundly I miss and need emotional connection. I'm somewhat inured to loneliness. I've grappled with pretty debilitating anxiety and depression for the entirety of my adult life. I was an academically gifted student and have shown flashes of tremendous promise, yet a lot of life's taken-for-granted milestones have been lost in that whole maelstrom. Still, I'm grateful for what there has been -- I've experienced life in three different countries on two different continents; I managed to stake out a small career as a freelance writer and was published internationally before 21; I am close with my brothers, and co-habit with two dogs who I am crazy for. Unfortunately, I spend a lot of time feeling like I'm living at a fraction of my potential, which perpetuates feelings of being unworthy of others' company/love. I have a handful of close friends here, but there isn't the closeness and vulnerability I want. I'm not looking for someone to sink all my hopes into; I'm relatively independent and have found ways to effectively capitalize on the energy I have. But I think it's hard to persist alone, in a kind of vacuum, on a day-to-day basis, without any sense that might change. I know that what I'm looking for isn't futile because I've experienced it: friends/relationships with compassionate, sober, intelligent girls, yet with the humility and vulnerability that comes from having been through something. I know that shared pain isn't an automatic bypass to friendship. And I know that this is a little bit overwrought, but it's 3am and r4r brings out my confessional side. It would probably help if we had some shared interests: I'm mostly into art-stuff, music, some TV, psychology/neuroscience (for self-help purposes, mostly), Howard Stern is a guilty pleasure, and I spent a lot of my time pursuing an interest in photography; I also like occasional, recreational drinking/drug use. It would also help if you had a skewed sense-of-humor, were over 25, socially anxious (but not debilitatingly so), and were mostly left-of-center. I'm not crazy about the idea of strictly-online relationships, though would open this up to anyone outside of Melbourne if you thought there was some chance we would click. But at the same time, if you are in Melbourne, I don't feel any tremendous urgency to meet and would be happy to spend time exchanging emails first, or maybe even Skyping .. I think that covers it, for now .."

Unfortunately, I didn't end up finding someone that filled that void in my life so I figured I'd try again. If I'm being honest, I feel a little bad considering I was the most upvoted post last month on here and still didn't find anyone, so I'm going to change my profile up a bit with some new pictures to see if I can give you a better understanding of what I'm looking for. Cheers! ABOUT ME: First things first, I know people care about physical stuff. I'm 6'1"", have black hair and brown eyes, and I have a pretty fair complexion. I'm honestly the biggest dork ever and once I get to know you I get real crackhead energy but if I don't know you I'm pretty shy. You can see me [here](URL As far as hobbies go, I love playing video games on PC, but I don't have much of a game I stick to. I'm all over the place but right now I've been playing a lot of league, csgo, ark, rust, siege, gta, rocket league, and a few others. It's definitely a plus if you play video games, but not a deal breaker at all. I know most females don't play video games and there's plenty of other stuff we could connect on. I'm a pretty big history buff and I love collecting antique firearms and war memorabilia. Politics, history, space and science are some of my favorite subjects. Be careful or I'll talk your ear off about any of them. I also enjoy any outdoor activity, watching movies, and watching youtube. Oh and memes. Lots of memes. As far as what I'm doing right now, I'm in college trying to get a bachelors in cybersecurity. A little side note, I struggle with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, so it would help if you understood that type of thing, but if not it's no big deal. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR: I guess I'm a bit more picky than I expected? The biggest deal-breaker for me is personality. I'd really like a fun girl who isn't all too serious but I also want someone who can have one of those deep intellectual conversations late at night that blow our minds before we go to bed. Another thing I look for is someone who's caring. I'm a very caring guy and I would like my significant other to be just as caring because I think having a caring person is important in a relationship. As far as looks go, I dont really have a ""type"". That being said, I'm not going to say looks don't matter. I would really appreciate it if you would send a pic in your message. If you get to see me I'd love to see you! One last thing, I tend to click well with nerdier people. However, even if you don't hit every checkmark here I really do encourage you to please message me if you're interested. If you want to know more about me just let me know! I'm an open book."

Im shy and not really sure what to write so Ill just say a bit about myself. Feel free to message me if you think we could be a good fit. I graduated from college in December with an electrical engineering degree and a minor in cybersecurity. I really liked the cyber courses so that is what Im going to pursue a career in. Soccer is my favorite sport I have played it all my life. Im looking for a keeper. Also, I started skateboarding recently. Hopefully that doesnt intimate you because obviously that increases my coolness quite a bit . Ive never gone skiing or snowboarding but I really want to so someone who is willing to teach me the ropes and shred the slopes would be awesome! (Or we can learn together and laugh at each other when we fall.) Movies have an edge over shows for me because you can get through the whole story in one sitting. Mysteries and thrillers are my favorite genres. Trying to piece together and guess the outcome is fun and satisfying. A favorite movie is too hard to choose but the best movie Ive seen recently was Primal Fear. I just watched the tv show Dark on Netflix and I would highly recommend. Regarding music alternative rock tunes take up most of my Spotify. Big TSwift fan. Expanding my arsenal is always exciting. I like the idea of sending each other a song each day and reporting back on what we thought of it. Heroes and powers usually gets comical. Spider-Man and The Flash are my favorites. Obviously I play video games this is Reddit. League of legends is my main game. HUGE bonus if you know my friend dis ray. She wears glasses. Let me know if you do.

I've given my shot on this a few times and had no luck but maybe this time will be different? ABOUT ME: First things first, I know people care about physical stuff. I'm 6'1"", have black hair and brown eyes, and I have a pretty fair complexion. I'm honestly the biggest dork ever and once I get to know you I get real crackhead energy but if I don't know you I'm pretty shy. You can see me [here](URL Oh and yeah I just dyed my hair so I have brown highlights. As far as hobbies go, I love playing video games on PC, but I don't have much of a game I stick to. I'm all over the place but right now I've been playing a lot of league, csgo, ark, rust, siege, gta, rocket league, and a few others. It's definitely a plus if you play video games, but not a deal breaker at all. I know most females don't play video games and there's plenty of other stuff we could connect on. I'm a pretty big history buff and I love collecting antique firearms and war memorabilia. Politics, history, space and science are some of my favorite subjects. Be careful or I'll talk your ear off about any of them. I also enjoy any outdoor activity, watching movies, and watching youtube. Oh and memes. Lots of memes. As far as what I'm doing right now, I'm in college trying to get a bachelors in cybersecurity. A little side note, I struggle with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, so it would help if you understood that type of thing, but if not it's no big deal. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR: I guess I'm a bit more picky than I expected? The biggest deal-breaker for me is personality. I'd really like a fun girl who isn't all too serious but I also want someone who can have one of those deep intellectual conversations late at night that blow our minds before we go to bed. Another thing I look for is someone who's caring. I'm a very caring guy and I would like my significant other to be just as caring because I think having a caring person is important in a relationship. As far as looks go, I dont really have a ""type"". That being said, I'm not going to say looks don't matter. I would really appreciate it if you would send a pic in your message. If you get to see me I'd love to see you! One last thing, I tend to click well with nerdier people.

I am a 19-year-old high school graduate who is attending college in the fall, sadly its all online, which is a major bummer. A little about me: I wrestled in high school for three years, until I did something stupid. I am very interested in robotics and computers. Basically technology in general. I will be studying network administration on a pathway to cybersecurity. I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and a stupid smile to go with it. With all this COVID stuff, my life hasn't really stopped, but I am missing the social aspect of my life, which keeps me from thinking dark shit or doing something stupid, not like I'm gonna do anything anyways. I'm seeking a potential relationship, one where we both are honest with each other and admit when we are annoyed, feeling angry, and or need to talk about stuff. I don't exactly have a preference in a person. A Decent person is good enough for me. Thanks!"

Lemme list a couple of things about myself real quick Ive been playing guitar since I was about 5 and piano since I was about 8 and as of right now I know about 5 instruments I have a super strong desire to travel around the world especially in Europe and Eastern Asia, and I love meeting and talking with people from foreign countries I recently got into Western Philosophy and Ive been reading a lot of Jordan Peterson, Alan Watts, and I really want to read some Nietzsche. Im going into my sophomore year of college and majoring in CyberSecurity but Im also a kickboxer and really want to go pro... so I can protect your computer from getting hacked and kick that hacker in the face I also play some games on my pc. Mostly LoL, valorant, Dead By Daylight, and some EU4 when Im super bored. I also watch some anime but Im not gonna constantly talk about it(unless you are too). My favorites are One Piece, Cowboy Bebop, and Mob Psycho 100. I come from Chicago,IL so I listen to a lot of Chief Keef and G Herbo but Im white so I also listen to a lot of Frank Ocean and Tyler. As far as my music taste goes, I really enjoy hip hop, some edm (San Holo), I really like that Lofi Jazz but also early 60s smokehouse jazz like Julie London, and whatever Rage against the machines genre is. Also MF DOOM is slept on. Idk if this matters too much but Im between 61 and 60. I got dirty blond hair now, and Im in pretty good shape from kickboxing and other workouts. Oh and Im a Gemini, idk what that means tho. Now let me brag about how cool I am rq. Someone painted me once because I had that face. I dated a girl whos now in the marines. I once submitted a poem to a state wide poem contest in high school and won 5th. And I can do a backflip(on a trampoline but hey still a backflip). Right before I end it I wanna get real. Im 19 and really happy right now but I went through some really dark shit. When I was in high school I had a lot of problems with depression and anxiety which eventually led into drug abuse. All of this led up to an OD off some fake xans that were laced with fentanyl. After that day I woke up in the hospital I changed for the better ever since. Ive been sober from xans and opioids since that day, and I stopped smoking weed(not knocking weed btw a lot of my friends are stoners but its not for me) about 6 months ago. What Im trying to say here is that if your going through anything right now feel free to hmu. Theres always light at the end of the tunnel whether you see it or not. So yeah if your tryna play some games add me on discord @ RaeJuh#0018 and if your tryna talk more I use Snapchat a lot. If you want that tho DM me."

I am 24yo from Maryland. I am here to look for someone I could build a friendship with that could turn into something more. I believe that the best partner is the one who is your friend first. So heres a few things about me. - I am currently in college completing my degree in Cybersecurity. - I work as a nanny to two sweet toddlers. I love what I do and enables me to keep my little apartment and do what I love. - I want to travel the world and enjoy my youth before settling down. - I do believe in marriage and I want to have a big family. - I believe that trust, communication and accountability is important in a relationship. - My sense of humor is pretty great, albeit it can be dark most of the time. - I have my own struggles but I am working through them. I dont need anybody to fix me, just hold my hand and be there for me. - I love country music but I do enjoy all kinds of music. - I love horror movies but can never watch them alone. - I love to game on my PS4, mostly shooter games. - Im learning how to play the guitar. - My political leanings are pretty moderate, leaning left. - I can cook and bake. I love to bake more than cook but Im pretty good at both, if I do say so myself. - Im a hopeless romantic. I love sweet surprises and random love notes/letters. I love forehead kisses and being hugged from behind. Im very simple in this area. What Im looking for? Im looking for someone who has the same goals and values as me. I want more in life than what I can imagine. I guess you could say Im a dreamer but I also work very hard to achieve my dreams. I dont believe in settling when there are greater things out there. I also do think physical attraction is important but not everything. I am not in a rush for anything. I just want to take it as slow as possible and really get to know each other. Im tired of being ghosted and being abandoned. Im tired of the cycle of getting my hopes up only for someone to just crush it. Its already a tough world out there, no need to make it tougher. Anyways if youre interested, DM me a bit about you (where youre from, your age, an interesting bit, etc.) and a pic. Id prefer for you to be older than me and maybe the same time zone. Physically Im more into men with a little meat in their bones and a lot taller than me (Im 54 for note). Hope to hear from you soon and be safe! Heres me: URL"

I'm currently in Latin America, waiting for borders to reopen. I'm looking for someone adventurous who likes traveling and trying new things. Generally, I get along best with people working in either cybersecurity or finance since we tend to have more in common. If you're not working in those industries, it's no big deal. As for myself, I work in corporate finance at an established startup. I'm the type of person who'll try just about anything once (like scorpion). I've traveled all my life and have recently started accelerating the process. At minimum, I want to visit every continent in the world before I turn 30. If I have time, I'd like to visit every UN member nation/dependency but since I plan on attending grad school and settling down in the next few years, that goal might be a bit of a stretch. One thing that I enjoy doing that doesn't seem very common is attending large subcultural events. I'm talking about things like Def Con, Burning Man, Mardi Gras, etc. Of those events I've only attended Def Con (twice), but the rest will follow in the very near future. The next major event coming up is Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro next February. I'm pretty open to a lot of things (like psychedelics), but I rarely drink and almost never smoke. Other details about me: * 5' 10, Asian * B.S. in Math/Econ * Likes Starcraft * Reads, Snowboards, and Works for Fun (my work changes daily, so I never know what I'll get) * Speaks some French/Chinese; Learning Spanish/Portuguese * Thinking about an MBA * Studying for the CFA/FRM exams"

Unfortunately, I didn't end up finding someone that filled that void in my life so I figured I'd try again. If I'm being honest, I feel a little bad considering I was the most upvoted post last month on here and still didn't find anyone, so I'm going to change my profile up a bit with some new pictures to see if I can give you a better understanding of what I'm looking for. Cheers! ABOUT ME: First things first, I know people care about physical stuff. I'm 6'1"", have black hair and brown eyes, and I have a pretty fair complexion. I'm honestly the biggest dork ever and once I get to know you I get real crackhead energy but if I don't know you I'm pretty shy. You can see me [here](URL As far as hobbies go, I love playing video games on PC, but I don't have much of a game I stick to. I'm all over the place but right now I've been playing a lot of league, csgo, ark, rust, siege, gta, rocket league, and a few others. It's definitely a plus if you play video games, but not a deal breaker at all. I know most females don't play video games and there's plenty of other stuff we could connect on. I'm a pretty big history buff and I love collecting antique firearms and war memorabilia. Politics, history, space and science are some of my favorite subjects. Be careful or I'll talk your ear off about any of them. I also enjoy any outdoor activity, watching movies, and watching youtube. Oh and memes. Lots of memes. As far as what I'm doing right now, I'm in college trying to get a bachelors in cybersecurity. A little side note, I struggle with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, so it would help if you understood that type of thing, but if not it's no big deal. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR: I guess I'm a bit more picky than I expected? The biggest deal-breaker for me is personality. I'd really like a fun girl who isn't all too serious but I also want someone who can have one of those deep intellectual conversations late at night that blow our minds before we go to bed. Another thing I look for is someone who's caring. I'm a very caring guy and I would like my significant other to be just as caring because I think having a caring person is important in a relationship. As far as looks go, I dont really have a ""type"". That being said, I'm not going to say looks don't matter. I would really appreciate it if you would send a pic in your message.

Behind that heavy door, you feel no worry and allow yourself to forget the world, just for a moment. Your status, your appearance, even your name. Here, you are but a reflection of your true self. &amp;nbsp; Opposite you sits a young adult of five and twenty years. Smaller than your average guy. Thin. He appears Asian, with short black hair. To stave off the sweltering tropical heat of his home in Singapore, he offers you a drink. Something with a hint of gin. &amp;nbsp; A cat prowls the table, long furred and luxurious. Much cuter than her owner. &amp;nbsp; ""...I can be lonely with you~"" He finishes the rest of the lyrics. ""Sorry, I can't sing. Let's put on some music. Indie, lo-fi, rock, witch house. Particularly a fan of Death Cab for Cutie. Well, someday you will be loved, eh?"" &amp;nbsp; He says his name is Alloy. Currently looking for a girlfriend, no matter where in the world. What does he like? &amp;nbsp; ""You,"" he replies coyly with a soft smile. ""I'm just another lonely soul in the world. I like gaming. It helps pass the time. What sort? Well, I've played anything from MOBAs to board games. Roguelikes, roguelites, pretty much been there done that. You name a genre, I've probably played something in it or modded it to hell and back. But no matter what, reckon it's all about finding the right person to play with."" &amp;nbsp; A gamer. A dime a dozen. Surely that wasn't all? ""Hey, don't get me wrong. I'm not just another gamer. Well, I'm your average nerd, really."" He laughs. ""I like writing. You're here right now, aren't you? Reading. Watching movies, anime, series, whatever. Lotsa stuff left on the plate to finish, but the last I did watch was Jojo's part five and My Hero Academia. I collect sourcebooks from tabletop games. I like good food. I love good drink, just make it fruity with an umbrella. And of course, I'm looking for more to share with you."" &amp;nbsp; A pause. ""Hey, don't get me wrong. I do enjoy listening too. Conversations ain't a one-way street. What do I do for a living? I work in Cybersecurity. It sounds cooler than it is, really. Always been good with computers."" &amp;nbsp; What kind of person is he? ""Logical. Witty. Funny. Some test told me I was an INTP or something like that. What, is that like a horoscope?"" &amp;nbsp; ""What am I looking for?"" He ponders for a moment. ""Someone who isn't afraid to open that door, like you. Willing to take a chance and meet someone new. We'll see how it goes from there, yeah? Don't need a voice, don't need a face, just a living soul willing to chat. Someone to fill the void, y'know."" --- Well. All this would have happened if you did open that door. So why not?

I'm a bit of an oddball so the traditional dating scene isn't a good fit. For example, I rarely drink, relocate frequently, and don't care much for pop culture. Instead, I spend my time gaming, chatting with eccentrics, or researching whatever's caught my interest (usually something related to cybersecurity, finance, insurance, psychology, or tech) That being said, I'm extroverted and would really like to meet new people. I'm location flexible since if I like you enough, I'll visit. Currently, I'm hanging out in Latin America, but I'll soon make my way to Europe or back to the states -- it depends more on Covid than myself. For the gamers, I've recently been playing a lot of League of Legends, DotA, and Starcraft II. I'd like to get into Rust."

I'd have to day my day to day common hobbies revolve around computers, as I am majoring in computer science and cybersecurity. I like to game, I have Xbox, ps4 and PC, but haven't played all to often up until now. I have also picked up streaming. I have a lot of other interests and hobbies but those can be revealed later. I'm a pretty comedic guy, you know they guy that makes everyone laugh while he is dead inside, like that. But I also have a softer kind side that I don't really get to show because of a lack of having a significant other. At points I can be abrasive or have rough edges but I think that's due to the way I grew up or how things have planned out in my life. I'm sure those can be solved by some affection. Anyways. There is more to know about me, and there's definitely more to know about you considering we haven't met yet so let's change that! Thanks for reading through!"

I'm Syrian living in Syria (The Assad side) currently (Yeah war and stuff, yeah), yet I still try to find a mate here. Tried Facebook groups but that didn't work since the partners I'm looking for are slightly different than your average Syrian girl, so I figured why not try the most trusted place on the internet, Reddit! (Hurray smart me!) And judging by how this sub down votes males, I'm not placing much hope on that; still I'm a cynic, and I love irony. So, let's get down to the jest of it: As stated I'm in Syria, and I'm looking for a unique partner. Myself: I'm 25yo male, who works online (so I get paid in dollars, not S.P.), I have a Caucasian fair skin and a tall body, I'm an aspiring programmer, I'm into tech, cybersecurity &amp; open-source, science, and Cyberpunk &amp; near future sci-fi works (which are actually based on *real* science... looking at you Star Trek), including sci-fi anime. I'm called by everyone around me to be nice, open, warm, understanding, lively, and funny. I have graduated collage, I speak several languages. I believe in equality of all humans, regardless of their gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, culture, etc. I'm non religious myself, but I have no issue dating anyone from any different religion as long as they meet my conditions. I'm cynic, and I love darkly laughing at my pain, and enjoy dark humor. OK What I'm looking for: A girl around my age (23-27), preferably also into the same stuff as I am, especially technology, cybersecurity, anime, languages, and science. Hopefully, she's OK also dating a non-religious person, and though I'm no hook-up person, I kinda expect at some stage we are gonna have sex (not having sex till marriage, unless you absolutely provide immense materialistic proof that you're gonna get married, is just a crazy demand!). I hope to find a partner that is loyal, understanding, open, warm, loving, pretty (love tall girls with fair skin), knowledgeable, quicky, and enjoys some irony and dark humor. I know nothing is gonna come out of this post, but I'm enjoying writing this watching how it will sink to the bottom. Man, life is good for a cynic.Still, if by a miracle a Syrian girl in Syria sees this and is interested, send me a message."

Im a 23 year old whitewashed Pakistani - American male located in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area whose stuck indoors thanks to this quarantine. Ive been focusing heavily on my studies in the past few years, and I figured its about time I meet someone who will eventually be my partner. I've had few female friends in the past but it was nothing outside of school, I've always been a social guy, high school really turned me into a loner, and then college bumped me back up into this social introvert, naturally an introvert but with the right people and setting, I can be real hype and goofy. About me: * I am currently pursuing my bachelors degree in Cybersecurity, I will plan on going to grad school or I'll go to law school part time. * Outside of that I love to experiment with ramen noodles. I am into the occult, meditation, spirituality, religion, philosophy, psychology * I haven't really been gaming much as I used to but I play the following: Pokemon, Super Smash, PUBG, CoD Mobile, Clash Royale. * I enjoy anime, thrillers, horror movies, tv shows, ask me what I'm currently watching or my favorite movie? * I have a versatile music taste, ranging from dark music like $uicideboy$ to uplifting Illenium. * I would eventually love to go to raves and music festivals (with moderation of course) * Into photography, film and music production * I will give affection, cuddles, moral support, send good morning texts, at the end of the day or week, I'll check up on you. [here's a pic of me](URL What Im Looking For: * A female within the age range of 18 - 26. I am open to talking to diverse ethnic groups and learning about your faith, etc. * Someone who is receptive, understanding, will eventually want a family in the future. * I value having shared interests and free flowing conversations. If you share similarities or even if you're random and want to share something, feel free. * Preferably looking for someone in the east coast, preferably the D.C./Maryland/Virginia tri-state but will be open to anywhere if we end up being compatible. * Someone who is fit, and healthy so we can workout together. I am open to chat, messages, and snapchat .. if we click, then we can move to whatsapp or facetime, hangouts, etc."

I've posted here before, many times, but this time, I'm dismissing with the fluff and poof. If you want to know more about me, please contact me and ask me anything, nothing is off limits and I'll answer any question, save for questions that might endanger my security. Pics are available upon request. I suppose I'm just taking a new approach and I'm just tired of fake pleasantries. I want to make a real connection with someone and share my vulnerable self. I would strongly prefer that you be local so we can see one another in person. \-I'm 5'11"" and 251 lbs and I come with a beard. I'm dieting for my health and to feel more attractive. I hit the gym for strength training and run in my neighborhood, but I sometimes have trouble keeping that going consistently. \-I am Agnostic and liberal in my politics. I tend to approach issues with logic and reason but I am more emotional in my personal life and tend to make my plans around what my mood is and what my desires are. I always try to be compassionate and understanding with people. \-I work as a PC Tech and I am currently in school for Cybersecurity. My career is very important to me and I am committed to succeeding. I have my shit together career wise and financially. \-I have hang-ups. It's been a while for me since my last relationship so I come with some hang-ups. I'm not really interested in being a father or a father figure, likely ever. \-I am bisexual. That doesn't mean I need a man and a woman to feel satisfied, it doesn't mean I'm a sex maniac that will cheat at the drop of a hat. At the moment I'm only really interested in dating women, my interest in men is limited, I just wanted to put it out there that I'm bi. \-Despite how this profile might make me sound I love to laugh and have a great time with my friends. I'm just tired of being single and my lack of success has left my expectations low. Standards are high, just not expectations. I enjoy being a cut-up with people I'm familiar and comfortable with. I try to be genteel and thoughtful with everyone I meet. \-I enjoy Metal and Techno music. I love playing board games and think that it is a fascinating way to get to know people. I play a lot of PC games. I enjoy trying new restaurants and staying after the meal to just sit and talk to someone. I love horror movies, especially at night. I love watching Steven Universe. I watch a lot of YouTube. I'm not above bad sex jokes. I have an interest in pursuing Cooking, Fencing, and Archery. Drama too, but I get stagefright easily. \-I love strong women (physically, mentally, strong will, decisive) and sometimes I want to lead and take care of someone, but other times I want to be led around and patted on the head. I love to snuggled and being physically close, but more than anything I am looking for emotional closeness and warmth."

If you want to know more about me just let me know! I'm an open book."

I haven't had the greatest of luck on these sorts of things. So if I do not have anyone interested, then I won't get butt hurt about it :))* If you have gotten this far, then that probably means that you want to know more about me! My favorite thing in the whole world is Star Wars. I've always been a geek towards the series. I've been binging Clone Wars recently! Some of my hobbies that I like to do is play video games, hang out with my friends and working out. I do like to cook and clean when things get messy. It makes me happy to see something messy to be clean! My favorite video games that I've been playing are Minecraft, Stardew Valley, Fallout 4 and Terraria. There are some other games that I have enjoyed like Bioshock, Sly Cooper, and Kingdom Hearts. I also like to collect Funko Pops and Pokemon cards! I do not have a huge collection of both, but they are something I like to buy towards my collection now and then. *A point in all of that, I'm a hugeee nerd.. hahaaa.* I currently am a Game Advisor at a GameStop! I was just put on from seasonal to a part-timer so I'm excited where this job leads. I am currently looking for another job because hours at GameStop are not enough for some bills :( I am about to go back to school to finish my BA in Cybersecurity! I'm not sure what I want to do with it, to be honest. If you're here at this point, then you're probably wondering *Well, what are you comfortable with talking?* I'm perfectly okay with giving out my discord and Snapchat and whatever. I'm not expecting anything to blossom into a relationship. We will just see where it takes us! Thanks for reading this far! If you're interested, don't be afraid to let me know!

If anything sparks after that it's cool but my priority is just to find people to talk to. I am the kind of person who doesn't do much. I play video games, ukulele eat, sleep, work, school, and if I can, hang out with friends. I'm always open to do more stuff if anyone asks me because I'll do anything that isn't part of my daily ritual. I am currently studying to go into cybersecurity at some point and I still have quite a few years to go. As of making the post I'm still doing prerequisites so that I can apply for the program. **Video Games** I enjoy a lot of different games. I am mainly a pc player who likes whatever catches my eye. Some games that I play include: Osu Stardew Valley Apex Legends Code Vein Clicker heroes 2 Team Fortress 2 Borderlands 3 World War Z These are just a few of the games I play so feel free to ask if I play any other games. **Personality** Most of the time I'm pretty quiet and relaxed. Small talk isn't really my strong suit so finding something to talk about is a struggle. I am pretty introverted so when in public I'll try to go near the places where not many people are. At home or with people in comfortable with I start talking a whole lot more and become way more open about things. **What I'm looking for ** To put it simply I'm just looking for someone who wouldn't mind talking to someone who struggles with finding topics to talk about. It doesn't matter to me how you are as long as you act yourself and you don't mind talking with someone like me. **Contact** Mostly on discord. PM me if the post is interesting and would like to talk. I also use Snapchat on and off and I almost never use Instagram so discord is the most reliable source to talk to me."

I currently live in Tampa, Fl where I am finishing university. I am excited to graduate in May! About me: Physically; I am 511, ~180lbs (a little chubby so think dad bod), white, usually have a beard. I shaved for New Years so I am growing my beard back again. If I had to rate myself I would say 5-6/10 would be fair, I am not afraid to send you a picture of myself. I enjoy longboarding, video games (Pokemon, League of Legends, Minecraft, etc.), TV shows, movies, photography, hammocking, and more. I am a fan of both dogs and cats. My favorite breed of dog is pug and cat is Scottish fold. Also, I am studying Cybersecurity and MIS. Personality wise I am kind of a sarcastic asshole but I promise not in a mean way if that makes sense. I am thoughtful though, too, and I have a good sense of humor. I also think Im a hopeless romantic so thats probably an interesting mix. I have never been in a relationship before and when I tell people that they are usually surprised or dont believe me. Looking for: Relationship. I have tried to use tinder &amp; bumble before but I do not think the majority people on those apps are looking for a serious relationship. I am pretty lonely, I generally have a good amount of free time and I do a lot of stuff by myself that I wish I didnt. I want someone I can hold hands with, lay in bed watching TV/YouTube/Netflix and cuddle, talk to each other about our days, play video games together. I would even get excited about going to the grocery store together. Lets get food at 2am or go skating in the park, I have an extra longboard and could teach you if you dont know how to yet. I am more introverted than extroverted so I am not very great at approaching new people in person. Im fine with my friends or in group setting but I feel weird approaching people alone if that makes sense. More about me: I have an apartment with two roommates, we all have our own rooms. I have a car. No job right now, I quit in December so I could fly home to spend winter break with my family. I will be getting a job shortly dont worry, Im not a bum. I like working- it gives me money and fills some of my free time. This is my last semester in college and I only have class three days a week now. About you: I am honestly not very picky. I do have preferences, however. Not to be shallow, but attraction does play a part and that goes both ways I know. Basically just want someone in my age range with similar interests as me (relationship wise). At least have one or two things in common with me to make things easier when we start talking but I genuinely enjoy listening to people talk about what their passionate in so Im all ears if we are different. Physically I would prefer you to be at least moderately in shape (I dont care if youre kinda chubby, I am too!), just show you actually care about your body. I actually want to go to the gym myself to cut down on the dad bod but I dont want to go alone so a gym partner would be great. This came out to be pretty long so I hope I sparked at least someones interest. Leave comments down below or message me if you have any questions!"

You're in for a long one, so there's your warning, but hey, maybe it'll be worth the five minutes to read if it ends up leading you to me. I'm Gary, a 19 year old guy from southern Michigan that's never had much success with relationships in the past (but hopefully you can change that). What am I looking for? Well, it's pretty simple at face value, but you'll understand more and more as you read through this post. To start, I'm looking for a serious relationship with an amazing woman like yourself with the end goal of actually being with each other. I'd cap out the age range at 21, but if you really think we'd click and you're a tiny bit older, still send a message. Long distance is fine as long as our schedules line up (GMT -5 and I only really work or go to class at night, so my days are relatively free besides homework). As the previous sentence hinted at, yes, I do have a job, albeit in a crappy retail position, and I do go to college, specifically for Cybersecurity. Ideally, you and I have shared interests, goals in life, relationship values, and more, but that'll come later on in the post. One thing I want to put here is something I have to say and sucks to say, but I'm not really attracted to African American women. I'm sorry if I've wasted your time, but thank you for reading this far. Let's start with my interests and hobbies: **Musicals**: Watching and listening to them, not being in them (even though I was in choir for all of middle and high school). My favorites are Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: Like Dungeons and Dragons and several other systems. It's my main hobby I do with friends. **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but I've always enjoyed video games in some capacity or another. Some of my favorites are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout. **Giving non-stop love and affection to my significant other when I have one**: It could be you :) Alright, moving onto physical characteristics. Being completely honest, I do believe physical attraction is important in a relationship. Because of this, I'm willing to send a picture of myself as soon as you ask, and would hope you'd do the same. Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. Have been losing weight since the start of summer and am down about 35 lbs. Eyes: Blue Hair: Brown and short Appearance: Definitely not the prettiest, and I have acne. Without the acne, I'd say average, so with it, below average. Next, the most important section of this post, my relationship values. You should share most of these, and if you do share most of them, even if you don't share any hobbies or interests, you should message me. **Affection**: I love giving, and receiving, all sorts of affection to my partner. Telling her how much she means to me, telling her how beautiful she is, telling her why she makes me smile. It's important I can give her the affection she deserves, and also important she's willing to give me back at least some of that affection. **Supportive**: Supporting each other's hobbies, interests, goals, and everything else is a must. It means so much to me when my partner takes an interest in whatever dumb thing I'm doing, when I can truly feel safe and at home talking to her about something. It's the best feeling in the world. I want my partner to be excited to rant to me at the end of an amazing day she spent doing something she loves, because seeing her eyes light up, hearing the excited tone in her voice, and seeing her smile are the three things that truly brighten up my day no matter what. **Communication**: Communication is key, simple as that. My partner and I need to be able to communicate our feelings to one another without feeling shy or scared to do so. This isn't something I expect to be available right off the bat, but I'll need you to work with me on making sure this can become a reality. **Messaging**: I'm one to answer messages as soon as I can, and in a long distance relationship (the only kind of relationship experience I have), this is a must. I can't be with someone that never answers their phone. I'm not going to non-stop message you about stupid things and expect a reply within 5 minutes, but just making sure messages can be answered within a reasonable amount of time is important to me. **Calling**: Once again, a long distance specific one, but I want to be able to call my partner every single day, ideally more than once a day. Obviously things come up and maybe there's a day where we can't call, but both me and my partner need to make time for the other. On the topic of calling, I also really enjoy falling asleep on the phone together, so if that's something you like too, then that'd be nice to do. **Being There For Each Other**: This one is incredibly important, yet incredibly simple. We need to be able to be there for each other. If I'm at work, in class, or doing whatever else, and I get a text saying you need me or a random call from you out of the blue, I will make sure I am there for you. I'll have someone cover me at work, I'll step out of class, or I'll do whatever else. If you need me, I'm there. I'd to be able to feel the same way about you, but I understand there are situations where you can't be there and that's okay. I just need you to do your best. **End Goal**: The end goal of any relationship I'm in is to be together. Move in, get married, the whole thing. I can suffer the long distance for awhile, most likely until we're both out of college or whatever, but the end goal has to be being together. This is something we'll talk about once we're together, guaranteed. Alright, you've made it this far. You're almost to the end, and an...interesting end it is. The last part before the conclusion is where I'm going to list some of my personality aspects that have to do with relationships. Some are good, some are bad, some are neutral. Just make sure you take these into account when deciding if you want to message me. **Drugs, Alcohol, and Partying**: I don't do drugs, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke or vape, and I don't party. Ideally, you're the same, but a little bit of alcohol, Marijuana, vaping, or the occasional party doesn't bother me. As long as none of it is excessive. The one thing I will say is that I can't be with someone that smokes because I have asthma, so unless you're willing to quit, that's a deal breaker. **Introversion**: I am incredibly introverted. I will always prefer to stay in rather than go out. This doesn't meant I'll never go out and do something, especially if it's with a significant other, it's just my baseline personality. **Needy and Jealous**: My worst relationship traits are probably that I'm kind of needy and can get jealous at times. It's just who I am, and I promise it's not to a ludicrous extent, but I'd like to make it known now. **Promises**: I don't break promises and I expect you to keep your promises. Breaking a promise is a red flag for me, so don't promise me something if you know you can't keep it. **Ghosting**: I don't ghost and I hope you won't either. I will tell you if I feel like we didn't connect and I hope you'd do the same. That's it. That's the post. Thank you so much for reading to the end. If what you've read interests you, shoot me a message, PM or chat, either is fine, or I also have my discord in my profile description, that's fine too. I hope to hear from you, and regardless if you decide to message me or not, I hope you find what you're looking for. Have a great day. P.S. If you're shy or nervous and don't know what to say in your opening message, just tell me your name, age, where you're from, and why you decided to message me :)"

Some of my favorites are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Giving non-stop love and affection to my significant other when I have one\*\*: It could be you :) &amp;#x200B; Alright, moving onto physical characteristics. Being completely honest, I do believe physical attraction is important in a relationship. Because of this, I'm willing to send a picture of myself as soon as you ask, and would hope you'd do the same. &amp;#x200B; Height: 5""11 &amp;#x200B; Build: Overweight, but not huge. Have been losing weight since the start of summer and am down about 35 lbs. &amp;#x200B; Eyes: Blue &amp;#x200B; Hair: Brown and short &amp;#x200B; Appearance: Definitely not the prettiest, and I have acne. Without the acne, I'd say average, so with it, below average. &amp;#x200B; Next, the most important section of this post, my relationship values. You should share most of these, and if you do share most of them, even if you don't share any hobbies or interests, you should message me. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Affection\*\*: I love giving, and receiving, all sorts of affection to my partner. Telling her how much she means to me, telling her how beautiful she is, telling her why she makes me smile. It's important I can give her the affection she deserves, and also important she's willing to give me back at least some of that affection. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Supportive\*\*: Supporting each other's hobbies, interests, goals, and everything else is a must. It means so much to me when my partner takes an interest in whatever dumb thing I'm doing, when I can truly feel safe and at home talking to her about something. It's the best feeling in the world. I want my partner to be excited to rant to me at the end of an amazing day she spent doing something she loves, because seeing her eyes light up, hearing the excited tone in her voice, and seeing her smile are the three things that truly brighten up my day no matter what. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Communication\*\*: Communication is key, simple as that. My partner and I need to be able to communicate our feelings to one another without feeling shy or scared to do so. This isn't something I expect to be available right off the bat, but I'll need you to work with me on making sure this can become a reality. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Messaging\*\*: I'm one to answer messages as soon as I can, and in a long distance relationship (the only kind of relationship experience I have), this is a must. I can't be with someone that never answers their phone. I'm not going to non-stop message you about stupid things and expect a reply within 5 minutes, but just making sure messages can be answered within a reasonable amount of time is important to me. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Calling\*\*: Once again, a long distance specific one, but I want to be able to call my partner every single day, ideally more than once a day. Obviously things come up and maybe there's a day where we can't call, but both me and my partner need to make time for the other. On the topic of calling, I also really enjoy falling asleep on the phone together, so if that's something you like too, then that'd be nice to do. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Being There For Each Other\*\*: This one is incredibly important, yet incredibly simple. We need to be able to be there for each other. If I'm at work, in class, or doing whatever else, and I get a text saying you need me or a random call from you out of the blue, I will make sure I am there for you. I'll have someone cover me at work, I'll step out of class, or I'll do whatever else. If you need me, I'm there. I'd to be able to feel the same way about you, but I understand there are situations where you can't be there and that's okay. I just need you to do your best. &amp;#x200B; \*\*End Goal\*\*: The end goal of any relationship I'm in is to be together. Move in, get married, the whole thing. I can suffer the long distance for awhile, most likely until we're both out of college or whatever, but the end goal has to be being together. This is something we'll talk about once we're together, guaranteed. &amp;#x200B; Alright, you've made it this far. You're almost to the end, and an...interesting end it is. The last part before the conclusion is where I'm going to list some of my personality aspects that have to do with relationships. Some are good, some are bad, some are neutral. Just make sure you take these into account when deciding if you want to message me. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Drugs, Alcohol, and Partying\*\*: I don't do drugs, I don't drink alcohol, I don't smoke or vape, and I don't party. Ideally, you're the same, but a little bit of alcohol, Marijuana, vaping, or the occasional party doesn't bother me. As long as none of it is excessive. The one thing I will say is that I can't be with someone that smokes because I have asthma, so unless you're willing to quit, that's a deal breaker. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Introversion\*\*: I am incredibly introverted. I will always prefer to stay in rather than go out. This doesn't meant I'll never go out and do something, especially if it's with a significant other, it's just my baseline personality. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Needy and Jealous\*\*: My worst relationship traits are probably that I'm kind of needy and can get jealous at times. It's just who I am, and I promise it's not to a ludicrous extent, but I'd like to make it known now. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Promises\*\*: I don't break promises and I expect you to keep your promises. Breaking a promise is a red flag for me, so don't promise me something if you know you can't keep it. &amp;#x200B; \*\*Ghosting\*\*: I don't ghost and I hope you won't either. I will tell you if I feel like we didn't connect and I hope you'd do the same. &amp;#x200B; That's it. That's the post. Thank you so much for reading to the end. If what you've read interests you, shoot me a message, PM or chat, either is fine, or I also have my discord in my profile description, that's fine too. I hope to hear from you, and regardless if you decide to message me or not, I hope you find what you're looking for. Have a great day. &amp;#x200B; P.S. If you're shy or nervous and don't know what to say in your opening message, just tell me your name, age, where you're from, and why you decided to message me :)"

You're in for a long one, so there's your warning, but hey, maybe it'll be worth the five minutes to read if it ends up leading you to me. I'm Gary, a 19 year old guy from southern Michigan that's never had much success with relationships in the past (but hopefully you can change that). What am I looking for? Well, it's pretty simple at face value, but you'll understand more and more as you read through this post. To start, I'm looking for a serious relationship with an amazing woman like yourself with the end goal of actually being with each other. I'd cap out the age range at 21, but if you really think we'd click and you're a tiny bit older, still send a message. Long distance is fine as long as our schedules line up (GMT -5 and I only really work or go to class at night, so my days are relatively free besides homework). As the previous sentence hinted at, yes, I do have a job, albeit in a crappy retail position, and I do go to college, specifically for Cybersecurity. Ideally, you and I have shared interests, goals in life, relationship values, and more, but that'll come later on in the post. One thing I want to put here is something I have to say and sucks to say, but I'm not really attracted to African American women. I'm sorry if I've wasted your time, but thank you for reading this far. Let's start with my interests and hobbies: **Musicals**: Watching and listening to them, not being in them (even though I was in choir for all of middle and high school). My favorites are Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: Like Dungeons and Dragons and several other systems. It's my main hobby I do with friends. **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but I've always enjoyed video games in some capacity or another. Some of my favorites are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout. **Giving non-stop love and affection to my significant other when I have one**: It could be you :) Alright, moving onto physical characteristics.

I'm a 19 year old guy from southern Michigan that works a part time job in retail and goes to college full time for Cybersecurity. My normal posts are pretty long, but I'm gonna keep this one a bit shorter. Basically, I'm just looking for a girl around my age to talk to and see where things go. I've had some shit happen to me recently involving relationships and haven't really had anyone to talk to about it, so you listen to me, I listen to you, and maybe we make something out of it. Yes, of course long distance is fine, and no, you don't have to have something for me to listen to if you don't want to be the one doing the talking. Sometimes you can solve your own problems by helping someone else. I have a much more detailed post on my main account that I can send you if you ask, but for now, I'm just gonna leave this here.

I've tried this a couple of times but nothing ever came from it so I guess I'll try again. I've never really dated anyone or have been in a relationship. So I'm trying hard to change that, as lately I've been a bit lonely. A little about me. I am currently going to college for my masters and bachelor degree in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. I'm a bit of a nerd, but have other qualities. I love working on and in computers, with programming, graphic arts, and much more. I also enjoy the out doors. I love to hike, camp, snowboard, and just taking in the outdoors. I don't play games a ton, but I do play here and there. I also enjoy playing dungeons and dragons whenever I can. I grew up in California, but am currently studying in Wyoming. Although California is great and all, I really enjoy it up here in the void. Plenty of snow and things to see. I am an introvert, and am typically shy at first, but open up immensely as I trust people. I can be pretty funny and humorous, while that is one of my main coping mechanism (a blessing and a curse). I would consider myself more caring than others and willing to listen and also have input. There is plenty more to learn about me, so if you think it's worth a shot, shoot me a pm!

I love to make others laugh and feel good. For birthday gifts, I usually give adult toys as a joke and to embarrass friends and family. My most recent gifts were a riding crop and butt plug. I have a knack for finding weird stuff like videos and pictures. We can trade memes for days. YouTube is my spirit animal. My favorite genres of music: hard rock, classic rock, country, retro Synthwave, jazz, and blues. I don't really watch television. I am an avid reader. I usually reach personal development books and IT books (because of school). Uh, apart from that, I like dark comedy. I love to cook and bake.

It usually ends up getting someone hurt in the end, which really sucks, but at the same time it's kind of exhilarating to feel the infatuation for someone so quickly. Hi, I'm Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy from southern Michigan that is looking for a long-term and serious relationship, but am always seeming to mess it up in one way or another because of that whole catching feelings thing. I'm currently in college for Cybersecurity and working a part time job, but really want someone in my life that I can care about and will care about me. Here's your warning; you're in for a long post. Hopefully it'll be worth it in the end and you'll decide, ""This guy sounds pretty sweet and interesting, so I think I'll message him"". Of course, that's implying I'm lucky enough to get you (yes you, unless you're a guy, then not you) to message me. To start, like I previously said, I'm looking for a long-term and serious relationship. Distance doesn't matter too much (as long as we would eventually plan to meet), only really mattering for timezones, but the closer the better of course. I'd also prefer you're no older than 20 unless you really really think we'd get along well and could be happy together, then a couple years older is okay. I'll also add here because it's came up in the past, and I'm sorry if you've read this far and this makes you stop, but I'm not particularly attracted to African-American women. I don't know why, but I don't want to waste your time, so I'm putting this closer to the beginning of the post. Thank you for reading this far though. Let's give a rundown of my biggest interests and hobbies: **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: Like Dungeons and Dragons (though others as well). It's where most of my friends come from and is what I spend a lot of my time doing. **Musicals**: Not being in them (tried it and didn't enjoy it), but watching/listening to them. Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton are a couple of my favorites. **Video Games**: I don't play them as much as I used to, but I really enjoy various series like Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Titanfall, and the Witcher. There's others, but those are the big ones. Also, I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. **YouTube**: Gaming channels, historical channels, live action, etc. I spend far too much time on Youtube, but will gladly replace a lot of that time by spending it with you! Next up, I'll try and give a quick rundown of my appearance because for myself, I believe physical attraction does matter for a relationship. I'll gladly send a picture of myself sooner rather than later and hope you'd do the same. Height: 5""11 Race: Caucasian Build: Overweight, but not huge, and have been losing weight since the start of summer. Eyes: Blue Hair: Brown and short (but I need a haircut) Face: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average, so I'd say overall a bit below average because of the acne. One more section before the conclusion of this incredibly long post, but read carefully because this is the most important part. These are my ideals for a relationship, and it's important that above all else, we share these. **Care and Support**: I want my partner to be able to both receive and give care, love, and support on a regular basis. It's important that we can share our feelings with one another without being scared or nervous with each other. **Quality Time**: Even in the dating phase, I'm going to want to spend a lot of time with you, getting to know you, and enjoying my time spent with you. Once we start talking, there's a pretty good chance I won't want to stop for very long at all. Also, you do not need to be worried about wanting to spend *too much* time with me or bothering me with texts or whatever. If we click, I'll never not want to get a message from you, whether it's just one or 10 in a row that I can't answer because I'm at work. I'll also add here that I love falling asleep together over the phone. It's not a requirement, just a thing I enjoy. **Lifestyle**: I'm pretty straight edge and introverted, meaning I don't do drugs, drink alcohol, smoke, vape, go to parties, or really enjoy socializing in general with people I'm not close with. I won't say I wouldn't date someone that is some of these things, but keep that in mind when deciding to message or not. Okay, there you go. You did it. You read to the end of my post, and I thank you so much for doing so. From past experiences here, I might get anywhere from 0 to 4 responses, so don't be afraid to message just because you think I've already found someone because chances are I haven't. I hope I hear from you, but whether I do no or not, I hope you have a good day and find what you're looking for :) P.S. If you're interested in messaging me, but not sure what to say, just open with your name, age, location, and why you decided to message me.

I'm a bit of a nerd, but have other qualities. I love working on and in computers, with programming, graphic arts, and much more. I also enjoy the out doors. I love to hike, camp, snowboard, and just taking in the outdoors. I don't play games a ton, but I do play here and there. I also enjoy playing dungeons and dragons whenever I can. I grew up in California, but am currently studying in Wyoming. Although California is great and all, I really enjoy it up here in the void. Plenty of snow and things to see. I am an introvert, and am typically shy at first, but open up immensely as I trust people. I can be pretty funny and humorous, while that is one of my main coping mechanism (a blessing and a curse). I would consider myself more caring than others and willing to listen and also have input. There is plenty more to learn about me, so if you think it's worth a shot, shoot me a pm!

Hi, I'm Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy from southern Michigan that's looking for a long-term, serious relationship. This post isn't going to be short, but if you stick it through to the end, maybe it'll end up being worth it. To start, I'm only looking for people around my age with, say, a soft cap of 20 years old. Not to say if you're a bit older don't message if you think we'd click, but the closer to my age, the better. Second, location doesn't *entirely* matter, long distance is fine, but of course the closer to Michigan, the better. Ideally the relationship wouldn't be long distance forever. The last thing would be time. Long distance is hard, but what makes it harder is if our schedules don't match up enough for us to be able to talk and do things together on a regular basis. I'm EST (GMT -5), work weekend nights (usually any time between 4 pm and 10:30 pm), and have college classes during the week. The college classes are easier to work around, as they are usually only 2 hours more or less, but they do exist so I thought I'd mention them. Alright, now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about some of my hobbies and interests. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is my main hobby and where a majority of my friends come from. If you aren't really sure what this is, that's fine (Dungeons and Dragons may ring a bell, but it's still okay if not). I don't have the space to explain it all here, but if you're interested in learning how to play or already do play, I'd be happy to do so. **Video Games**: I don't play them as much as I used to, but video games have always been a large part of my life. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. I enjoy Halo, Fallout, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, Titanfall, and a few more games. I've also recently started playing a bit of minecraft again after a four year hiatus with the game dying down. Whether we play together, watch each other play (I very much enjoy watching my significant other play games), or whatever else, it's something we can do together or talk about. **Music**: I'm a bit of a weirdo about music. To start, I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved all of it. It was basically the only part of school that was bearable for me and I feel is a huge part of how I grew up. Because of being a choir geek for that much of my life, I've learned to enjoy musicals (Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton are my favorites) and varying different types of choral music. There's other types of music I enjoy, but those are the main two. **YouTube**: Whenever I'm alone and not at work or school, I'm probably watching youtube. I enjoy gaming channels, history channels (history is another interest of mine, but I'll just throw it in here instead of making it its own section), and various live action stuff. My favorite channel(s) are Rooster Teeth and their related channels. If you share similar tastes, I'd love to sit down and watch some with you :) Alright, that's all my major interests/hobbies. If you share some or all of them, awesome. If you don't share any, then maybe we aren't the best fit. It's not a requirement to like all or even any of them, but it's certainly an upside if you do. Next up, where am I in life right now? Well I'll tell you! I graduated high school this year and am currently a college student at Baker college here in Michigan. My major is for Cybersecurity, and though it isn't particularly a passion of mine, I'm at least interested in it and know it'll be easy to get a job in the field. I work part time and have been working at the same place for the last year and a half. It's a shitty retail job, but it could be worse I guess. I've been in two previous relationships, both of which stemmed from reddit and both of which never ended up meeting in person due to distance. Hopefully that can be different this time. Physically, I have the following traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've been working on losing weight since the start of summer and have been succeeding, and I'll hopefully be able to keep going. Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a haircut right now) Appearance: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average. So I'd say below average due to the acne. I hate saying it, but physical attraction does matter to me. I'll gladly send a photo of myself as soon as you ask and would hope you'd return the favor. I'd also rather we do it sooner rather than later. Alright, one more (albeit large) section before the conclusion of this post. Here's where I'm going to talk about what I enjoy in a relationship/about a partner. This is the most important part of this post, so if you don't share any of these, we mostly likely won't fit well. To begin, I really enjoy silly romantic coupley stuff. I just do. I even took a love languages test and have the scores still, and will tell you them if you want to know. Cutesy voices, pet names, all that jazz. It makes me happy. Second, I will want to spend a ton of time with you if we click. Hours every day preferably. I'll also never not want to get a message from you, so double text, triple text, quadruple text, whatever. If I like you, I'll love all of it. We don't have to be doing something necessarily together, just being there on the phone with each other or whatever while we do our own things is comforting. Third, I will always always always give you compliments, care, support, and make sure you know you're loved. I will also want all of that back. If we're gonna be each others' person, then my person deserves to know that she's beautiful, supported, cared for, and loved every day. It might get repetitive, but I'm going to keep saying it and showing it, and hope you'd do the same for me. Words of affirmation are amazing, and I love both giving and receiving them. Fourth (only one more section after this one, I promise), I am very much an advocate for being able to communicate with each other. If something's up, you have me to talk to, no matter the subject. I, like before, hope that I have the support to be able to communicate with you about anything I may need to as well. A couple that can't communicate is bound to fail, so this is a must. If you don't know if you're good at communicating or not, I'll gladly do my best to try and teach you how. All I need is for you to be with me, not against me on it. Lastly, I do not smoke, drink, do drugs, party, or do anything of the sort. I'm rather introverted overall. I won't draw any static lines saying I'll never date someone that does X, but keep these in mind when deciding if you want to message or not. Alright, there you go. You've reached the end of this long-ass post. Maybe you're interested, maybe you're not. Whether you decide to message me or not, I hope you have a good day and do find what you're looking for!"

Be forewarned that this post is going to be rather long, as most of my posts here have been, but if you read it and find what you're looking for, it's probably worth the five minutes or so spent reading.

I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan, works a retail job, and goes to college for Cybersecurity.

Other than general compatibility with interests, hobbies, and relationship goals, there's only a few ""requirements"" per se. **Age**: I'm looking for someone around my age. I'd put a soft cap at 20 years old, but if you think we'd really click, but you're a bit older, then still send me a message and we'll see where it leads! **Location**: Long distance is fine as long we can eventually meet up. Obviously the closer the better (and less expensive to visit each other). I'll also add here that I work nights and many of my classes are at night, so think about how that works with your schedule (EST (GMT -5) time with work being around 4 PM to 10:30 PM on the weekends and class being around 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the weekdays) **Lifestyle**: I'm pretty introverted and, for lack of a better term, a goody two shoes. I don't smoke, vape, drink, do drugs, go to parties, or do anything of the sort. I'm not saying I'd never want to date someone that is into any of that, but keep this in mind when deciding if you want to message me. I'll also add here because it's came up in the past, and I'm sorry if you've read this far and this makes you stop, but I'm not particularly attracted to African-American women. I don't know why, but I don't want to waste your time, so I'm putting this closer to the beginning of the post. Thank you for reading this far though. Congratulations! You're about 1/3 done with this post. Yes, about 1/3 done. You've put in the work to read this far, so I know you can make it to the end. Next up are my hobbies and interests. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is my main hobby and also where a majority of my friends come from. If you don't really know what a tabletop roleplaying game is, that's okay. The name dungeons and dragons may ring a bell, but if not, that's also okay. If you want to learn more about them or already do play them, that's certainly a talking point we can have in the future! **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but video games have always been a large part of my life. I mainly enjoy specific titles like Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Titanfall, the Witcher, and a few others. I've also recently started playing minecraft again after a few years due to the recent resurgence in popularity. Whether you play (and if you do, I do enjoy just watching my significant other play while we talk) similar games or different games, this can be something we do together :) **Music**: I'm a bit of a weirdo about music. To start, I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved all of it. It was basically the only part of school that was bearable for me and I feel is a huge part of how I grew up.

My favorite channel(s) are Rooster Teeth and their related channels. If you share similar tastes, I'd love to sit down and watch some with you :) Alright, that's another 1/3 down. That means you're a grand total of 2/3 done with this post. I saved the most important parts for last. Up next are my physical traits and relationship expectations. After that it's just a short conclusion, then you're done reading this essay of a post. Physical Traits: Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've been losing weight since the start of summer and am still going. Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a haircut right now) Appearance: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average. So I'd overall say below average because of the acne. I will gladly send a picture as soon as you ask and hope you'd return the favor. For me, physical attraction is important. It's certainly nowhere near the most important, but it still is important. I'd also hope we can exchange pictures sooner rather than later. Next up is the most important section of this post, which is why I saved it for last. Here's where I'll talk about the expectations of a relationship I have. Before I start, I will mention I've only ever been in two relationships, both of which stemmed from here and we never ended up meeting in real life either time. Overall I'd say I'm pretty inexperienced in dating, and that brings me to my first point. **Grow Together**: This is probably the weirdest part of this section, but it's also pretty important to me. This is also the main reason I want to meet someone around my age. I want to be in the same part of life my significant other is. Whether it's going through college, just starting out being an adult, and also experiencing a relationship like this for the first time. I want someone in the same spot in life that I'm in that's had similar experiences (and lack of experiences) that we can bond over. **Silly Couple Stuff**: I absolutely love that gooey, silly, romantic couple stuff. Pet names, cutesy voices, and overall just being in a blissful state of love where the sun is shining and the two of us are oblivious to the world's problems because we know we have each other. I even filled out one of those love languages tests and will gladly share the results if you ask :) **Care and Support**: I will always *always* show my significant other that she is cared for and supported in every possible way, and I want someone that will do the same for me. Being able to have an emotional crutch for all the bad in life is important, and because of that, this part is very important to me. This also ties in to words of affirmation to one another. I will always give compliments, words of encouragement, and let my significant other know that she is loved, cared for, and supported. Simply saying ""I love you"" isn't the end of it. I will go above and beyond to make sure she knows how much I love her. **Quality Time**: If we really click, I'm going to want to spend all of my time with you. Hours every day would be preferable, but sometimes life gets in the way of course. Whether it be messaging, calling, or video chatting, I will want to spend time with you. I will never not want to hear from you, meaning you can double message, triple message, quadruple message, whatever! We don't necessarily have to be doing something together either. Just having each other to talk to while we do our own things is comforting. I'll also add here that I love love love falling asleep together. It's one of my favorite things to do :) Alright, you did it. Congratulations. You've made it to the end of this ridiculously long post. I hope I've convinced you to message me and see where things go, but if not, then that's okay. I hope that you find what you're looking for. To everyone that's taken their time to read this post, thank you, and have an amazing day. &lt;3"

To start, I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved all of it. It was basically the only part of school that was bearable for me and I feel is a huge part of how I grew up. Because of being a choir geek for that much of my life, I've learned to enjoy musicals (Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton are my favorites) and varying different types of choral music. There's other types of music I enjoy, but those are the main two. **YouTube**: Whenever I'm alone and not at work or school, I'm probably watching youtube. I enjoy gaming channels, history channels (history is another interest of mine, but I'll just throw it in here instead of making it its own section), and various live action stuff. My favorite channel(s) are Rooster Teeth and their related channels. If you share similar tastes, I'd love to sit down and watch some with you :) Alright, that's another 1/3 down. That means you're a grand total of 2/3 done with this post. I saved the most important parts for last. Up next are my physical traits and relationship expectations. After that it's just a short conclusion, then you're done reading this essay of a post. Physical Traits: Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've been losing weight since the start of summer and am still going. Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a haircut right now) Appearance: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average. So I'd overall say below average because of the acne. I will gladly send a picture as soon as you ask and hope you'd return the favor. For me, physical attraction is important. It's certainly nowhere near the most important, but it still is important. I'd also hope we can exchange pictures sooner rather than later. Next up is the most important section of this post, which is why I saved it for last. Here's where I'll talk about the expectations of a relationship I have. Before I start, I will mention I've only ever been in two relationships, both of which stemmed from here and we never ended up meeting in real life either time. Overall I'd say I'm pretty inexperienced in dating, and that brings me to my first point. **Grow Together**: This is probably the weirdest part of this section, but it's also pretty important to me. This is also the main reason I want to meet someone around my age. I want to be in the same part of life my significant other is. Whether it's going through college, just starting out being an adult, and also experiencing a relationship like this for the first time. I want someone in the same spot in life that I'm in that's had similar experiences (and lack of experiences) that we can bond over. **Silly Couple Stuff**: I absolutely love that gooey, silly, romantic couple stuff. Pet names, cutesy voices, and overall just being in a blissful state of love where the sun is shining and the two of us are oblivious to the world's problems because we know we have each other. I even filled out one of those love languages tests and will gladly share the results if you ask :) **Care and Support**: I will always *always* show my significant other that she is cared for and supported in every possible way, and I want someone that will do the same for me. Being able to have an emotional crutch for all the bad in life is important, and because of that, this part is very important to me. This also ties in to words of affirmation to one another. I will always give compliments, words of encouragement, and let my significant other know that she is loved, cared for, and supported. Simply saying ""I love you"" isn't the end of it. I will go above and beyond to make sure she knows how much I love her. **Quality Time**: If we really click, I'm going to want to spend all of my time with you. Hours every day would be preferable, but sometimes life gets in the way of course. Whether it be messaging, calling, or video chatting, I will want to spend time with you. I will never not want to hear from you, meaning you can double message, triple message, quadruple message, whatever! We don't necessarily have to be doing something together either. Just having each other to talk to while we do our own things is comforting. I'll also add here that I love love love falling asleep together. It's one of my favorite things to do :) Alright, you did it. Congratulations. You've made it to the end of this ridiculously long post. I hope I've convinced you to message me and see where things go, but if not, then that's okay. I hope that you find what you're looking for. To everyone that's taken their time to read this post, thank you, and have an amazing day. &lt;3"

Hi there, I'm Gary. Be forewarned that this post is going to be rather long, as most of my posts here have been, but if you read it and find what you're looking for, it's probably worth the five minutes or so spent reading. Let's start with the basics. As you already know (assuming you didn't skip the first paragraph), my name is Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan, works a retail job, and goes to college for Cybersecurity. I'm looking for a serious, long-term relationship with an amazing woman (and yes, you are amazing, so that doesn't mean it's time for you to check out). Other than general compatibility with interests, hobbies, and relationship goals, there's only a few ""requirements"" per se. **Age**: I'm looking for someone around my age. I'd put a soft cap at 20 years old, but if you think we'd really click, but you're a bit older, then still send me a message and we'll see where it leads! **Location**: Long distance is fine as long we can eventually meet up. Obviously the closer the better (and less expensive to visit each other). I'll also add here that I work nights and many of my classes are at night, so think about how that works with your schedule (EST (GMT -5) time with work being around 4 PM to 10:30 PM on the weekends and class being around 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the weekdays) **Lifestyle**: I'm pretty introverted and, for lack of a better term, a goody two shoes. I don't smoke, vape, drink, do drugs, go to parties, or do anything of the sort. I'm not saying I'd never want to date someone that is into any of that, but keep this in mind when deciding if you want to message me. I'll also add here because it's came up in the past, and I'm sorry if you've read this far and this makes you stop, but I'm not particularly attracted to African-American women. I don't know why, but I don't want to waste your time, so I'm putting this closer to the beginning of the post. Thank you for reading this far though. Congratulations! You're about 1/3 done with this post. Yes, about 1/3 done. You've put in the work to read this far, so I know you can make it to the end. Next up are my hobbies and interests. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is my main hobby and also where a majority of my friends come from. If you don't really know what a tabletop roleplaying game is, that's okay. The name dungeons and dragons may ring a bell, but if not, that's also okay. If you want to learn more about them or already do play them, that's certainly a talking point we can have in the future! **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but video games have always been a large part of my life. I mainly enjoy specific titles like Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Titanfall, the Witcher, and a few others.

I'm an 18 year old guy from southern Michigan that's looking for a long-term, serious relationship. This post isn't going to be short, but if you stick it through to the end, maybe it'll end up being worth it. I'm also going to note right here at the beginning that I have not and will never ghost, and if I don't believe we're going to fit well, I will say something. I'd hope you do the same. Also, in my experience, guys will get anywhere from 0-4 responses on average. Don't be afraid to message because you think it's too late :). Chances are I haven't received message yet. To start, I'm only looking for people around my age with, say, a soft cap of 20 years old. Not to say if you're a bit older don't message if you think we'd click, but the closer to my age, the better. Second, location doesn't *entirely* matter, long distance is fine, but of course the closer to Michigan, the better. Ideally the relationship wouldn't be long distance forever. I'll also add here because it's came up in the past, and I'm sorry if you've read this far and this makes you stop, but I'm not particularly attracted to African-American women. I don't know why, but I don't want to waste your time, so I'm putting this closer to the beginning of the post. Thank you for reading this far though. Alright, now that we've got that out of the way, let's talk about some of my hobbies and interests. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is my main hobby and where a majority of my friends come from. If you aren't really sure what this is, that's fine (Dungeons and Dragons may ring a bell, but it's still okay if not). I don't have the space to explain it all here, but if you're interested in learning how to play or already do play, I'd be happy to do so. **Video Games**: I don't play them as much as I used to, but video games have always been a large part of my life. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. I enjoy Halo, Fallout, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, Titanfall, and a few more games. I've also recently started playing a bit of minecraft again after a four year hiatus with the game dying down. Whether we play together, watch each other play (I very much enjoy watching my significant other play games), or whatever else, it's something we can do together or talk about. **Music**: I'm a bit of a weirdo about music. To start, I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved all of it. It was basically the only part of school that was bearable for me and I feel is a huge part of how I grew up. Because of being a choir geek for that much of my life, I've learned to enjoy musicals (Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton are my favorites) and varying different types of choral music. There's other types of music I enjoy, but those are the main two. **YouTube**: Whenever I'm alone and not at work or school, I'm probably watching youtube. I enjoy gaming channels, history channels (history is another interest of mine, but I'll just throw it in here instead of making it its own section), and various live action stuff. My favorite channel(s) are Rooster Teeth and their related channels. If you share similar tastes, I'd love to sit down and watch some with you :) Alright, that's all my major interests/hobbies. If you share some or all of them, awesome. If you don't share any, then maybe we aren't the best fit. It's not a requirement to like all or even any of them, but it's certainly an upside if you do. Next up, where am I in life right now? Well I'll tell you! I graduated high school this year and am currently a college student at Baker college here in Michigan. My major is for Cybersecurity, and though it isn't particularly a passion of mine, I'm at least interested in it and know it'll be easy to get a job in the field. I work part time and have been working at the same place for the last year and a half. It's a shitty retail job, but it could be worse I guess. I've been in two previous relationships, both of which stemmed from reddit and both of which never ended up meeting in person due to distance. Hopefully that can be different this time. Physically, I have the following traits: Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've been working on losing weight since the start of summer and have been succeeding, and I'll hopefully be able to keep going. Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a haircut right now) Appearance: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average. So I'd say below average due to the acne. I hate saying it, but physical attraction does matter to me. I'll gladly send a photo of myself as soon as you ask and would hope you'd return the favor. I'd also rather we do it sooner rather than later. Alright, one more (albeit large) section before the conclusion of this post. Here's where I'm going to talk about what I enjoy in a relationship/about a partner. This is the most important part of this post, so if you don't share any of these, we mostly likely won't fit well. To begin, I really enjoy silly romantic coupley stuff. I just do. I even took a love languages test and have the scores still, and will tell you them if you want to know. Cutesy voices, pet names, all that jazz. It makes me happy. Second, I will want to spend a ton of time with you if we click. Hours every day preferably. I'll also never not want to get a message from you, so double text, triple text, quadruple text, whatever. If I like you, I'll love all of it. We don't have to be doing something necessarily together, just being there on the phone with each other or whatever while we do our own things is comforting. Third, I will always always always give you compliments, care, support, and make sure you know you're loved. I will also want all of that back. If we're gonna be each others' person, then my person deserves to know that she's beautiful, supported, cared for, and loved every day. It might get repetitive, but I'm going to keep saying it and showing it, and hope you'd do the same for me. Words of affirmation are amazing, and I love both giving and receiving them. Fourth (only one more section after this one, I promise), I am very much an advocate for being able to communicate with each other. If something's up, you have me to talk to, no matter the subject. I, like before, hope that I have the support to be able to communicate with you about anything I may need to as well. A couple that can't communicate is bound to fail, so this is a must. If you don't know if you're good at communicating or not, I'll gladly do my best to try and teach you how. All I need is for you to be with me, not against me on it. Lastly, I do not smoke, drink, do drugs, party, or do anything of the sort. I'm rather introverted overall. I won't draw any static lines saying I'll never date someone that does X, but keep these in mind when deciding if you want to message or not. Alright, there you go. You've reached the end of this long-ass post. Maybe you're interested, maybe you're not. Whether you decide to message me or not, I hope you have a good day and do find what you're looking for! &lt;3"

Hi there, I'm Gary. Be forewarned that this post is going to be rather long, as most of my posts here have been, but if you read it and find what you're looking for, it's probably worth the five minutes or so spent reading. Let's start with the basics. As you already know (assuming you didn't skip the first paragraph), my name is Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan, works a retail job, and goes to college for Cybersecurity. I'm looking for a serious, long-term relationship with an amazing woman (and yes, you are amazing, so that doesn't mean it's time for you to check out). Other than general compatibility with interests, hobbies, and relationship goals, there's only a few ""requirements"" per se. **Age**: I'm looking for someone around my age. I'd put a soft cap at 20 years old, but if you think we'd really click, but you're a bit older, then still send me a message and we'll see where it leads! **Location**: Long distance is fine as long we can eventually meet up. Obviously the closer the better (and less expensive to visit each other). I'll also add here that I work nights and many of my classes are at night, so think about how that works with your schedule (EST (GMT -5) time with work being around 4 PM to 10:30 PM on the weekends and class being around 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the weekdays) **Lifestyle**: I'm pretty introverted and, for lack of a better term, a goody two shoes. I don't smoke, vape, drink, do drugs, go to parties, or do anything of the sort. I'm not saying I'd never want to date someone that is into any of that, but keep this in mind when deciding if you want to message me. I'll also add here because it's came up in the past, and I'm sorry if you've read this far and this makes you stop, but I'm not particularly attracted to African-American women. I don't know why, but I don't want to waste your time, so I'm putting this closer to the beginning of the post. Thank you for reading this far though. Congratulations! You're about 1/3 done with this post. Yes, about 1/3 done. You've put in the work to read this far, so I know you can make it to the end. Next up are my hobbies and interests. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is my main hobby and also where a majority of my friends come from. If you don't really know what a tabletop roleplaying game is, that's okay. The name dungeons and dragons may ring a bell, but if not, that's also okay. If you want to learn more about them or already do play them, that's certainly a talking point we can have in the future! **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but video games have always been a large part of my life. I mainly enjoy specific titles like Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Titanfall, the Witcher, and a few others. I've also recently started playing minecraft again after a few years due to the recent resurgence in popularity. Whether you play (and if you do, I do enjoy just watching my significant other play while we talk) similar games or different games, this can be something we do together :) **Music**: I'm a bit of a weirdo about music. To start, I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved all of it. It was basically the only part of school that was bearable for me and I feel is a huge part of how I grew up. Because of being a choir geek for that much of my life, I've learned to enjoy musicals (Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton are my favorites) and varying different types of choral music. There's other types of music I enjoy, but those are the main two. **YouTube**: Whenever I'm alone and not at work or school, I'm probably watching youtube. I enjoy gaming channels, history channels (history is another interest of mine, but I'll just throw it in here instead of making it its own section), and various live action stuff. My favorite channel(s) are Rooster Teeth and their related channels. If you share similar tastes, I'd love to sit down and watch some with you :) Alright, that's another 1/3 down. That means you're a grand total of 2/3 done with this post. I saved the most important parts for last. Up next are my physical traits and relationship expectations. After that it's just a short conclusion, then you're done reading this essay of a post. Physical Traits: Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've been losing weight since the start of summer and am still going. Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a haircut right now) Appearance: I have acne, but am otherwise pretty average. So I'd overall say below average because of the acne. I will gladly send a picture as soon as you ask and hope you'd return the favor. For me, physical attraction is important. It's certainly nowhere near the most important, but it still is important. I'd also hope we can exchange pictures sooner rather than later. Next up is the most important section of this post, which is why I saved it for last. Here's where I'll talk about the expectations of a relationship I have. Before I start, I will mention I've only ever been in two relationships, both of which stemmed from here and we never ended up meeting in real life either time. Overall I'd say I'm pretty inexperienced in dating, and that brings me to my first point. **Grow Together**: This is probably the weirdest part of this section, but it's also pretty important to me. This is also the main reason I want to meet someone around my age. I want to be in the same part of life my significant other is. Whether it's going through college, just starting out being an adult, and also experiencing a relationship like this for the first time. I want someone in the same spot in life that I'm in that's had similar experiences (and lack of experiences) that we can bond over. **Silly Couple Stuff**: I absolutely love that gooey, silly, romantic couple stuff. Pet names, cutesy voices, and overall just being in a blissful state of love where the sun is shining and the two of us are oblivious to the world's problems because we know we have each other. I even filled out one of those love languages tests and will gladly share the results if you ask :) **Care and Support**: I will always *always* show my significant other that she is cared for and supported in every possible way, and I want someone that will do the same for me. Being able to have an emotional crutch for all the bad in life is important, and because of that, this part is very important to me. This also ties in to words of affirmation to one another. I will always give compliments, words of encouragement, and let my significant other know that she is loved, cared for, and supported. Simply saying ""I love you"" isn't the end of it. I will go above and beyond to make sure she knows how much I love her. **Quality Time**: If we really click, I'm going to want to spend all of my time with you. Hours every day would be preferable, but sometimes life gets in the way of course. Whether it be messaging, calling, or video chatting, I will want to spend time with you. I will never not want to hear from you, meaning you can double message, triple message, quadruple message, whatever! We don't necessarily have to be doing something together either. Just having each other to talk to while we do our own things is comforting. I'll also add here that I love love love falling asleep together. It's one of my favorite things to do :) Alright, you did it. Congratulations. You've made it to the end of this ridiculously long post. I hope I've convinced you to message me and see where things go, but if not, then that's okay. I hope that you find what you're looking for. To everyone that's taken their time to read this post, thank you, and have an amazing day. P.S. If you are thinking about messaging me, just open with your name, age, location, and why you decided to message me :) Hopefully, we'll hit it off from there, but if not, that's okay. I promise I won't ghost if I don't think we're going to fit well and hope you'll do the same! &lt;3"

I posted a few days ago so I figure I'll give it one more shot. I'm on here looking for a nice girl to talk to and have a good time with, and then who knows maybe it could turn into something else. ABOUT ME: First things first, I know people care about physical stuff. I'm 6'1"", have long black hair and brown eyes, and I have a pretty fair complexion. You can see me [here](URL As far as hobbies go, I love playing video games on PC, but I don't have much of a game I stick to. I feel like gaming is kinda in a tough spot right now since there isn't that one game that is really good, at least for me. As a result, I don't have a defined genre I stick to. It is definitely a plus if you play video games, maybe we could play together? I also enjoy any outdoor activity, watching movies, and watching youtube. Oh and memes. Lots of memes. As far as what I'm doing right now, I'm in college trying to get a bachelors in cybersecurity. Fair warning I have some dark humor and little filter. Of course, it's a plus if you like dark humor too. I just don't want to crack a joke that offends you. That would be no bueno. A little side note, I struggle with some pretty bad anxiety and depression, so it would help if you understood that type of thing, but if not it's no big deal. If you want to know more about me just let me know! I'm an open book."

Hi, I'm Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy from southern Michigan that's currently in college for Cybersecurity and working a part time job. I've been pretty lonely lately and have spent a lot of time and energy trying to find someone that I really connect with. So far, my attempts haven't yielded anything, but I know the woman I'm looking for is out there, and maybe she's even reading this right now. It's a long post, but hopefully it'll be worth reading to the end. To make things clear, I'm looking for a long-term and serious relationship with someone around my age (soft cap of 20, but if you're a bit older and think we'd get along well, don't be scared to message), but that doesn't mean that if you're a little unsure of what you want right now, you shouldn't still message. No harm will come from it, so why not take the chance, right? Long distance is fine, just know that vastly different timezones can be an issue, so that may be a problem (but that doesn't mean we can't try!). Also, if it is long distance, I'd like if we could have the intention to eventually meet. I'll also add here because it's came up in the past, and I'm sorry if you've read this far and this makes you stop, but I'm not particularly attracted to African-American women. I don't know why, but I don't want to waste your time, so I'm putting this closer to the beginning of the post. Thank you for reading this far though. I have a fair few interests and hobbies. I'll try to keep myself from rambling on about them here though, so I'll just give a list and brief explanation. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: First off, you may not know what these are, and that's okay (Dungeons and Dragons may ring a bell though). This is my favorite hobby and where most of my friends come from. **Musicals**: I enjoy various musicals like Dear Evan Hansen and Hamilton, as well as a few others. It's also really the only music I listen to (I know, I'm weird). **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but I really enjoy the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Halo, Titanfall, the Witcher, Minecraft, and a few more titles. Mainly play on PC. **YouTube**: If I'm not working, in class, or playing something with friends, I'm probably on YouTube watching various gaming channels, history channels, and some live action stuff. Rooster Teeth and their other channels are my favorite content creators. Moving on from hobbies and interests, I'll give a brief description of my physical traits. I'm more than happy to send a picture of myself shortly after we start talking as long as you're willing to do the same. I do believe physical attraction is important (at least for me), so if we aren't at least attracted to each other a bit, it could be difficult. Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've also been losing weight since the start of summer and it's been going pretty well. I don't plan on stopping any time soon. Race: Caucasian Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown (but I need a hair cut right now) Appearance: Below average probably because I have acne, but not repulsive (or at least I don't think so). Few more parts to this post, this time a bit more detailed. This part's about what I want/like in a relationship/partner. This is the most important part of the post, so hopefully we have the same ideals here. **Grow Together**: This is probably the weirdest part of this section, but it's also pretty important to me. This is also the main reason I want to meet someone around my age. I want to be in the same part of life my significant other is. Whether it's going through college, just starting out being an adult, and also experiencing a relationship like this for the first time. I want someone in the same spot in life that I'm in that's had similar experiences (and lack of experiences) that we can bond over. **Silly Couple Stuff**: I absolutely love that gooey, silly, romantic couple stuff. Pet names, cutesy voices, and overall just being in a blissful state of love where the sun is shining and the two of us are oblivious to the world's problems because we know we have each other. I even filled out one of those love languages tests and will gladly share the results if you ask :) **Care and Support**: I will always *always* show my significant other that she is cared for and supported in every possible way, and I want someone that will do the same for me. Being able to have an emotional crutch for all the bad in life is important, and because of that, this part is very important to me. This also ties in to words of affirmation to one another. I will always give compliments, words of encouragement, and let my significant other know that she is loved, cared for, and supported. Simply saying ""I love you"" isn't the end of it.

Just having each other to talk to while we do our own things is comforting. I'll also add here that I love love love falling asleep together. It's one of my favorite things to do :) Last thing I'll say is that I'm a pretty introverted and reserved kind of guy. I don't drink, smoke, do drugs, party, etc. If you do, that doesn't mean we can't still work, just keep those things in mind. Thank you so much for reading this far, whether you've decided you're going to message me or not. I hope you have an amazing day, and I hope I can get at least one response, because that's you really need right? &lt;3"

I've posted here before, many times, but this time, I'm dismissing with the fluff and poof. If you want to know more about me, please contact me and ask me anything, nothing is off limits and I'll answer any question, save for questions that might endanger my security. Pics are available upon request. I suppose I'm just taking a new approach and I'm just tired of fake pleasantries. I want to make a real connection with someone and share my vulnerable self. I would strongly prefer that you be local so we can see one another in person. \-I'm 5'11"" and 243 lbs and I come with a beard. I'm dieting for my health and to feel more attractive, but being a hairline away from diabetes will light a fire under you real fast. I hit the gym for strength training and run in my neighborhood, but I sometimes have trouble keeping that going consistently. \-I am Agnostic and liberal in my politics. I tend to approach issues with logic and reason. \-I work as a PC Tech and I am currently in school for Cybersecurity. My career is very important to me and I am committed to succeeding. I have my shit together. \-I have hang-ups. It's been a while for me since my last relationship so I have hang-ups. I'm not really interested in being a father or a father figure, likely ever. \-I am bisexual. That doesn't mean I need a man and a woman to feel satisfied, it doesn't mean I'm a sex maniac that will cheat at the drop of a hat. At the moment I'm only really interested in dating women, my interest in men is limited. \-Despite how this profile might make me sound I love to laugh and have a great time with my friends. I'm just tired of being single and my lack of success has left my expectations low. Standards are high, just not expectations. I enjoy being a cut-up with people I'm familiar and comfortable with. I try to be genteel and thoughtful with everyone I meet. \-I enjoy Metal and Techno music. I love playing board games and think that it is a fascinating way to get to know people. I play a lot of PC games. I enjoy trying new restaurants and staying after the meal to just sit and talk to someone. I love horror movies, especially at night. I love watching Steven Universe. I watch a lot of YouTube.

187,cybersecurity,ForeverAloneDating,18 [M4F] Michigan / Anywhere. Anyone looking for something serious and long lasting?,2,cp6t9j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/cp6t9j/18_m4f_michigan_anywhere_anyone_looking_for/,2019-08-12 13:28:20,"Hi there, I'm Gary. From the title, you can see what this post is about, but I've got a lot more to say, so strap in. Hopefully it ends up being worth it for you. I'm looking for a serious long term relationship. I'm not looking for something short and fun, but instead a close personal connection filled with love and care for one another. It can be long distance, as long as the end goal is to finally be together once we decide that we're ready. Now, here's a little about me. If you share any of these interests, then we have something to talk about. If you don't share any at all, maybe I'm not the guy for you. **Music**: My interest in music is kind of unconventional, but I consider it a large part of my personality. I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation, loved singing (and hope I can find a way to keep singing), and loved the environment of the choir family even more. It shaped me as a person and was the only really good thing about high school for me. It introduced me to musicals, which is where most of my music interest lies. Some musicals I've seen and enjoyed (definitely legally and certainly not bootlegged) were Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, and Book of Mormon. I don't really listen to any other kind of music because I'm a bit weird I guess. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: You may have not heard of these before, but Dungeons and Dragons might ring a bell. Whether you know what they are or not, these are my main hobby. I play with friends multiple times a week and it's where most of my friends come from. If you play, have played, or want to learn to play, that's a big positive, but that's not to say that not really being interested is a negative. **Video Games**: I don't play them as much as I used to, but I enjoy many sci-fi, fantasy rpg, and other game genres. Some of my favorite specific games are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the the Witcher. I'm also going to college for Cybersecurity. It isn't exactly a huge interest, more so a career I wouldn't mind going into that I know will be easy to get a good job in and pays a decent bit of money. If money were no object, my dream job would be a writer for some of those video game genres that interest me. I'm also currently working as a retail worker, and plan to throughout college until something better comes along. I almost always work nights, and with that comes me being a bit of a night owl. I'm usually up until at least 2 am EST and sleep until around noon EST. Physically, I have the following features: Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer and am still dropping. Appearance: I'd say I'm about average before you take into account acne, so below average. Hopefully I can get it cleared up sometime soon. I'll send a picture if you ask, though will ask for one in return. Physical attraction is important, and I don't want us to get a week in before seeing each other and then not be attracted to one another. If we click, which I hope we do, I will love being able to care for and about you, and will especially love when and if that care is reciprocated. I want to hear about your day, what's happening in your life, and give you the support you need. We all have bad days, but if we're there for each other, maybe they don't have to be so bad. I'm going to be honest, if I like you, I won't want to take things slow. I want us to get to the point in the relationship where we can both love, care about, and support each other as soon as possible, because that's the best feeling in the world. I usually know if I like someone within a couple hours of talking to them. If you're not the same way, that's perfectly okay, we can take our time. If you do feel the same way, then that's wonderful. Things I enjoy and will want to do if we end up in a committed relationship: **Be Present**: Yes, as simple as that, be present. Okay, maybe not as simple as that. I will want to talk to you for hours every day. Whether it be messaging, voice chat, or video chat, being there with you is what I'll want. I also very very very much enjoy falling asleep on the phone together. Sometimes life gets in the way, but ideally we'll be able to spend time together despite it. **Corny Relationship Talk**: I don't care what other people say or think. I'm gonna want to give you a cute nickname, constantly tell you how much I love you, and just be silly with you. **Be Involved**: I'm going to want to know what's happening in your life. Know how you're doing. If you're feeling down, I'll want to bring you up or at least comfort you. I'll want us to both be happy, because what else is a relationship for, right? All right, I'm almost done, I swear. Just want to mention a few things about a few things that are deal breakers. **Drugs, alcohol, and tobacco**: First off, if you do any illegal drugs, this is not going to work. Marijuana is borderline. I'm not against it being legalized or anything, I'm just not interested. If you smoke, the same goes. I can't be with a smoker. I'm a bit more lenient on alcohol, but if you drink a lot, whether you're of age or not, this probably won't work. **Partying**: I'm an introvert. I don't go out to parties or other social functions. If you do, it isn't exactly a deal breaker, but it might be hard for us to be together because I do not enjoy things like that. Overall I'm pretty traditional and, for lack of a better term, a goody-two-shoes. I thank you for your time spent reading this. If I'm lucky, I'll find someone I can hold onto. Whether you want to message me or not, have a nice day, and I hope you find what you are looking for. P.S. If we end up not liking each other for any reason, please don't ghost. I can promise you I won't ghost you, but getting ghosted feels terrible, and I'd rather whichever one of us isn't liking the other say it directly."
188,cybersecurity,ForeverAloneDating,18 [M4F] Michigan / Anywhere: Are you lonely and looking for something serious?,4,cpji9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/cpji9u/18_m4f_michigan_anywhere_are_you_lonely_and/,2019-08-13 08:11:38,"Because if you are, maybe we have something to talk about. Hi, I'm Gary. I don't have any laser shows or excitement to share, but I do have a lot of love to give. Truth be told, I'm recently out of what was a good relationship, and I want what I had back. I want someone to care about, love, and support, and someone that will care about, love, and support me. Feeling completely and utterly alone, even when you have friends, is a terrible feeling, so maybe we can fix that for each other. I'm an 18 year old guy that is starting his first semester of college here in a couple weeks. I'm headed into Cybersecurity and hoping to get a job in the field as soon as possible. As of now (and most likely until I finish college), I'm working as a retail worker, which isn't exactly the most exciting of jobs. I want a serious, long term, monagamous relationship with someone that I will want to spend countless hours talking to every day and want to not only share my life with, but have her share her life with me. Long distance is fine as long as we plan on eventually being together, though being close enough to visit regularly until then would be ideal. Here are a few of my interests. If we share any, I'd love to talk about them. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: These are getting more popular as time goes on, which I think is very cool. If you don't know what they are, it'll take too much time and space to explain here, but the name Dungeons and Dragons may sound familiar for what it's worth. This is my primary hobby. It's where a majority of my friends come from, It's where I spend a lot of my free time (besides on youtube), and is one of my favorite things. If you do play or want to learn to play, then we have something to talk about. If not, don't worry, there's more to have in common coming. **Music**: My taste in music is odd, but my background in music might explain it a bit. I was in choir from 6th grade all the way until graduation and loved every second of it. It was my home in high school, which didn't offer me much happiness in and of itself. Being connected with people through choir was what made both middle and high school hospitable for me, so I attribute a large part of my personality to that. It also introduced me to musicals, which is where most of my music interest lies. Musicals I've enjoyed are Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Book of Mormon, and Be More Chill, and those musicals' tracks are what a majority of the music I listen to is. **Video Games**: I've fallen off playing them in recent times, but I still enjoy playing them occasionally. Some games I enjoy are Halo, Titanfall, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Witcher. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One, so if you enjoy any of these games (or any other games), that's something fun we can do together. If you enjoy a particular game, I'd love to just sit and watch you play. **Writing and History**: These are more minor interests, but writing can be a lot of fun at times. I mainly do it for my tabletop rpg games, but I'd like to expand out into other forms as well. As for history, I just very much enjoy medieval history, American revolution history, and sometimes ancient Roman history. **YouTube**: Ah yes, youtube. Where I spend a majority of my time while I'm alone. There isn't much to say about this other than mentioning Rooster Teeth. If you know who they are, then that's absolutely wonderful and I'd love to just relax and watch some of their content with you. There's plenty more I watch, so maybe we'll have someone in common. That's about all my hobbies. There's a couple smaller things here and there, but you'll learn about those over time if you message me and we grow close. Now onto my physical features then what I enjoy in a relationship. Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer, which has been great. Appearance: I do have acne, so there's that to consider. Before the acne, I'd say about average, so afterwards, below average. I will absolutely send a picture of myself if you ask, and hope you would return the favor. Physical appearance is important, and I'd always prefer to get it out of the way sooner rather than later. I previously mentioned I just got out of a good relationship, which was also my first relationship (and was long distance and from reddit as well), so what I'm about to say is only governed by that one relationship, as well as just my general thoughts. If I like you, which I usually know after the first couple hours of talking to someone, then this is what I'll want: **Talking for Hours**: I will want to talk to you for hours on end every day. Whether it be messaging, voice chat, or video chat, I will want to be spending a large majority of my time with you if possible. Of course life can get in the way, but we'd hopefully be able to enjoy each other's company a lot. **Love and Care**: The best part of a relationship has to be being loved and cared for. Knowing that this one other person really does truly care about you and wants to be with you. Expressing these emotions is a must. I personally prefer to do it through constant reminders of how much I love and care about you, but that's just me. **Communication**: Being able to communicate what we want and are feeling well is important. I promise to not hold anything back if you promise not to hold anything back, okay? **Plans for the Future**: This is the part where I might scare some of you off. I've said I wanted a serious long term relationship. That means that I will want to eventually talk about our plans for the future. Moving in together, getting married, out stances on children, all of that. Obviously it doesn't have to be for awhile, but I am looking for my future wife with this post. Alright, as we're getting to the end of this post, I first off want to thank anyone that's made it this far. I so hope I get some messages, but regardless if that message is from you, I do hope you find what you're looking for. The last thing I want to talk about is my lifestyle. I'm, for lack of a better term, a goody-two-shoes. I don't do drugs, smoke, or drink alcohol. I'm introverted and don't go out to parties and other social events, I'm not religious (though this one is okay as long as you don't try to force your religion on me; I will absolutely respect your religion), and I'm more liberal than conservative. I won't draw a static line saying what I am and am not okay with, but just take this information and question if you think we'd fit well together. If you still think we would, shoot me a message. I'd love to hear from you. Thank you, and have a nice a day."

190,cybersecurity,ForeverAloneDating,18 [M4F] Michigan / Online: Relationship with Cuddles and Lots of Love?,1,crec2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/crec2n/18_m4f_michigan_online_relationship_with_cuddles/,2019-08-17 09:32:33,"Hi, I'm Gary, a relatively average 18 year old guy from Michigan that wants a relationship. I want a serious long term relationship with someone around my age filled with love, care, and affection for one another. If you're looking for the same, then I'd love to meet you. Long distance is fine (as long as we intend to meet up eventually), and similar time zones are preferred, but it's okay if they don't quite match up. I'm sure you'd like to hear a bit more about me before you go and decide whether to message me or not, so let's start with some of my interests and hobbies. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This here is my primary hobby. It's where I spend most of my social time with friends, as well as where I've met most of my friends. If you don't know what it is, that's perfectly fine (Dungeons and Dragons might sound more familiar), and if you do know what it is, then I'd love to talk about it with you! **Choir**: I was in my school's choir for the entirety of my middle and high school career. It's where I felt most at home while at school, and was really the only good thing about school for me. I attribute my time in choir to a large part of my personality, and if you were the same way in school, maybe we have some stories to share :) **Music**: I'm actually pretty weird when it comes to my music tastes. I primarily enjoy music from musicals like Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, and Book of Mormon, as well as a lot of choir music. Getting a little less weird, I also enjoy a lot of music from the 1930s-1960s (for a reason you might understand later on in this post). **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but sitting down and enjoying a video game is a lot of fun. I prefer story driven games, and a few specific ones I like are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout (which if you know anything about Fallout, is where my taste for that mid-20th century music comes from). I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. If you play any games at all, even ones I don't enjoy playing myself, I find watching someone else play that I like to spend time with can be a very fun experience. **YouTube**: This is where I spend a majority of my non-social time, watching my favorite youtubers. I enjoy too many to list here, but my favorite is probably Rooster Teeth. I've enjoyed their content for a long time, and watching them has brought me some happiness in times when I wasn't so happy. If you enjoy Rooster Teeth too, or one of the dozens of other channels I watch, maybe we could just lie down and enjoy some of it together. Those are my main interests and hobbies, not all, but most. I'm also headed to college in a couple weeks for Cybersecurity, and currently working a retail job, so those are a few things we can talk about (and if it's about the retail job, I hope it's about how much retail jobs suck). Physically, I have the following traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer and am still dropping! Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I don't really find myself attractive, and I have acne. I'd say I'm average before you take into account the acne, so below average with the acne. I am more than willing to send a picture if you want, and would hope you feel the same way. I think physical attraction is important in a relationship, and I'd even prefer if we see each other sooner rather than later in case one of us doesn't find the other attractive. I don't want us to build a relationship then have it cause problems when we see each other. What I'm looking for in a relationship is important to me. More important than having shared interests or hobbies. I'm looking for someone that is caring, affectionate, and emotionally available (or at least will try to be). I really like all the lovey dovey part of being in a relationship. Constant compliments, supporting each other, telling each other how much we care about the other. It's my favorite thing to do, so if you aren't that kind of person, maybe I'm not the right kind of person for you. I'll also add that I've only ever been in one other relationship before, so there may be other things I find I enjoy that I just never did before. Also, a word of warning. If we do hit it off and really enjoy talking with each other and just spending time with each other, I will probably want to move faster than we should. If you are the same way, then wonderful, let's move as fast as we want, but if not, feel free to just tell me that you want to slow down a bit. I won't get offended. Alright, one more section then you're off the hook, I swear. This part is mainly about my lifestyle and how compatible you might be with it. Basically, I'm a goody-two-shoes introvert. I've never drank more than a tiny sip of alcohol (and only while accompanied by adults), never smoked, never did drugs of any sort. I don't go out to parties or other social events. I never skipped school or snuck out of the house. None of it, it's just the person I am. I won't draw any static lines saying I won't date anybody that does X, but take this into consideration if you do decide to message me. Thank you to everyone that took their time to read this. I hope to get at least one reply, because that's all you really need, right? Whether you decide to message me or not, have a nice day, and I hope you find what you're looking for."

192,cybersecurity,ForeverAloneDating,18 [M4F] Michigan / Anywhere: Let's Make Each Other Happy,1,cuj1my,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/cuj1my/18_m4f_michigan_anywhere_lets_make_each_other/,2019-08-24 05:59:03,"Hi there! I'm Gary, an 18 year old guy currently working a retail job at Dollar General and headed to college in a mere four days for Cybersecurity. Putting it all out there, I'm looking for a long term, serious relationship with a girl around my age that I can hopefully make happy and who will hopefully make me happy. Long distance is perfectly okay, as long as there's a plan to eventually meet up assuming everything goes well between us. Warning: long post ahead (but hopefully it's worth it!) Here are a few of my interests and hobbies. If you share any, I'd love to talk about it! **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: This is where most of my social life is spent. If you don't know what these are, maybe the name Dungeons and Dragons rings a bell, but if not, that's okay too! I met a majority of my friends through TTRPGS and still regularly play with those friends. If you play or are interested in learning, that's a big positive, but if not, don't worry! There's plenty more for us to have in common! **Music**: I'm pretty weird about the music I listen to. It's all primarily music from musicals like Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, and the Book of Mormon, as well as a bit of choir music and mid-20th century music. I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved every second of it, which may explain my music tastes a bit as it's where I was introduced to musicals and, of course, choir music. **Video Games**: I don't play them as often as I used to, but I grew up playing video games and still do on occasion nowadays. I enjoy Roleplaying Games like the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout, as well as the Halo series and a good amount of other random games here and there. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. Whether we play games together or one of us watches the other play, this is certainly something we could have fun doing together! **YouTube**: When I'm not with my friends, working, or (when school starts) studying or at school, I'm probably on youtube. I watch dozens of amazing channels ranging from gaming, historical, live action, and more. My favorite group is probably Rooster Teeth, so if you enjoy them too, that's certainly something we can do together. There's plenty more I watch though, so I'm sure we can find a channel in common! If you share any of those interests, I'd love to hear from you! Having a significant other that shares your interests and hobbies is important, especially in a long distance relationship. Next, I'll move on to my physical traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of the summer, and am continuing to lose more! Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I'm say about about average before you take into account my acne, so below average, at least until I can get it cleared up. I'm more than willing to send a picture as soon as you ask, and hope you'd be willing to do the same. I find physical attraction important in a relationship, so I'd prefer to get it out of the way sooner rather than later. Next, I want to talk a bit about my lifestyle and how I'd want a partner with a similar lifestyle as myself. I am introverted, don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs, don't go out to parties (or really any social event), and am not religious. I won't draw any static lines saying I won't date someone that does X, but keep these in mind when deciding if you want to message me or not. I will note that I physically can't be with a smoker because I have asthma. If it's a habit you're looking to break, I'm more than willing to help and support you along that path, but if you have no plans on at least trying to stop, it just won't work between us. One last section, this time about what I enjoy and expect in a relationship. It's important my partner share similar ideals on this front, in fact it's probably the most important part of this entire post: **Affectionate**: I always like to show affection in obvious ways. Compliments, straight up saying how much I care about you, using cutesy couple talk, asking for cuddles (even if we're hundreds or thousands of miles away), etc. I want a partner that will be affectionate to me in this way as well. **There For Each Other**: I absolutely love being able to be there for my partner. Listening to them when they need to vent, offering a (usually metaphorical due to distance) shoulder to cry on, and keeping them company whenever they need it. It makes me happy to know I'm helping my significant other in this way, and hope you would do the same for me if I ever needed it. I'll also add here that I reeaaallly enjoy falling asleep on the phone with my significant other. It really helps me have a nice, restful sleep, and I love when she's the last thing I hear at night. **Lots of Talking!**: If we really click, I'm going to want to talk to you nonstop. Messaging, voice calls, and once we get comfortable enough, video calls, any kind of talking. I also will never not want to hear from you. I don't care if you wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep. I'll want you to keep calling me until I wake up. Double message me, triple message me, quadruple message me, whatever. I will always want to be talking to you whenever I possibly can. Well that about wraps up the post. I do hope I get at least one message, because that's all you really need, right?. Thank you so much for taking the time out of your day to read all this. Overall, I just want to find my person, and if you feel the same way, shoot me a message. Whether you decide to message me or not, have a great day, and I hope you find what you're looking for. &lt;3"
193,cybersecurity,ForeverAloneDating,18 [M4F] Michigan / Anywhere: Third Time's a Charm...Right? Looking for a Serious and Long Term Relationship.,1,cv33b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/cv33b2/18_m4f_michigan_anywhere_third_times_a_charmright/,2019-08-25 12:47:35,"Hey there, it's me, Gary. I say third time's a charm, but I only really mean third time this week. The last two posts didn't get any replies, so I'm gonna change up my strategy a bit here. Usually, I'd post a big long page talking about all my interests, wants, and goals for a relationships, but this time I'm just going to give a bit of a shorter, bite-sized post, and if you want to know more, you'll just have to message me to find out :) Starting with **interests**, I spend most of my time with friends playing tabletop roleplaying games like Dungeons and Dragons, which is probably my favorite hobby. In descending order of largest to smallest hobby, youtube is oddly enough the second on my list. It's where I spend most of my time when I'm not with friends, working, at school, etc. Next up is video games. I don't play them all that often anymore, but used to play a lot. I still really enjoy Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout. Lastly (at least of those prominent enough to make the list) are my music tastes, which are pretty odd. I mainly only listen to music from musicals like Dear Evan Hansen, Be More Chill, Hamilton, and the Book of Mormon. (I'll also just kind of slide it in here that I'm headed to college for Cybersecurity in a mere three days and currently working as a retail worker.) **Physically**, I'm 5""11, blue eyes, short and brown hair, a bit overweight (though not huge, and am currently losing weight), and probably below average appearance wise, mainly because of my acne (at least I hope so). I'll send a picture as soon as you ask, and hope you'll return the gesture. As the title states, I'm looking for a serious, long term **relationship**. Said relationship can be long distance as long as we can plan to eventually meet up. What I find important in a relationship is being affectionate with one another, being able to support one another, and being able to spend a lot of time together. If you agree with all those, then I think we'd make a great fit. Last bit of this ""short"" post (I swear it's still only like a third of the length of my usual ones) is that I'm a pretty **introverted and traditional** guy. I don't drink, smoke, do drugs, go to parties, etc. That's not to say it wouldn't work if you're more extroverted or less traditional, but just keep that information in mind And that's the end! Thank you for taking your time to read to this whether you decide to message me or not. If so, that's awesome, if not, that's okay too. I hope you find what you're looking for."

A few months back I saw a ""Looking for my Future Husband"", which caught my eye, so maybe this will catch yours? Well hi, I'm Gary. Fourth post this week and I'm gonna continue changing things up a bit, give some new information, and hopefully it gets me at least one reply! What I'm looking for is a serious, long term, monogamous relationship that will hopefully lead to a life filled with love and happiness. As of now, I'm very lonely, and want to find my person so we can share each other's lives with one another. Long distance is perfectly fine as long as we can make a plan to eventually meet once we're both ready. The type of girl I'm looking for is one that is around my age and thinks the same things are important in relationships that I do. I'm very affectionate, and like to show that affection through compliments, cutesy talk, support, and just generally talking about how much I care about and love you. This is the most important part of a relationship in my opinion. I also want to be able to emotionally support and connect through listening to each other, being able to vent to each other, and just being there for each other when we need it. The last main thing about what I want in a relationship is being able (and wanting to) spend lots of time together. Whether it's long distance or not, I'm going to want to talk for hours every day, just getting to know you better and enjoying each other's company. I also reeaaallly enjoy falling asleep on the phone together (hell, we could do it the tonight if you message me now!). I always love getting messages from someone I'm talking in this way, so you don't have to shy away from messaging me tons if you actually like me. Physically, I have the following traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost weight since the start of summer and am still losing it! Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I have acne, which I'd say puts me below average, but hopefully I can get it cleared up soon, which (at least I like to believe so) would bring me up to average. I am more than willing to send a picture of myself if you ask, and I hope you would return the gesture. I find physical attraction important, so I'd prefer for us to see each other sooner rather than later. A few of my interests are as follows: - **Tabletop Roleplaying Games** (like Dungeons and Dragons) - **Video Games** (Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, Fallout, etc; play on PC and Xbox One) - **YouTube** (gaming, historical, live action, etc; favorite group is Rooster Teeth) - **Musicals** (really the only kind of music I listen to besides a few other specifics because I'm a weirdo) - **TV Shows** (Avatar the Last Airbender, How I Met Your Mother, Breaking Bad are a few of my favorites) - **Cybersecurity** (not so much a hobby or interest, but what I'm headed to college for) - **Singing** (I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation. I've been told I'm good, but I hate my own voice) Lastly, I'll note that I'm a pretty introverted guy that doesn't really do anything some might consider ""bad"" like drinking, smoking, drugs, etc. I don't go to parties or other big social events. That's not to say extroverts that do any of that stuff won't meld well with me, it's just something to keep in mind. Thank you for reading this post. I very much hope I at least get one response this time, but if not, I guess I'll try again later. Whether you decide to message me or not, have a nice a day, and I hope you find what you're looking for!"

My name's Gary, and I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan and is currently going to college for Cybersecurity and working a retail job. I'm looking for a serious, Long-term, and monogamous relationship with a girl around my age that shares at least one interest with me. Long distance is perfectly fine (as long as we can eventually plan to meet up), though I'll note that I'm a bit of a night owl, so think of that plus my EST time zone if you are pretty far away :) What are these interests I'd like if we shared you ask? Well, here's my answer: **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**: Yeah I'm a bit of a geek. This is what my social life consists of and is where I've met most of my friends. If you enjoy the hobby, I'd love to play with you. If you're interested in trying it out, I'd love to teach you! **Video Games**: Not exactly a huge part of my life anymore, but I still enjoy them occasionally. A few of my favorites are Halo, the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Witcher. There's others, but those are definitely where most of my gaming interests lie. I mainly play on PC, but have an Xbox One as well. **Music**: Here's where I mention I'm pretty weird. My music tastes are...unconventional to say the least. I mainly only listen to music from musicals ( like Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, Book of Mormon), some choral music (I was in choir from 6th grade until graduation and loved every second of it), and the occasional tune from the 80s. **YouTube**: I spend faaaar too much time on youtube. It's basically what I'm doing when I'm not with friends, at work, or at school. I watch a few different genres, namely gaming, historical, and some live action. My favorite group is Rooster Teeth, so if you know who they are, that's awesome! Those are all of my main hobbies and interests, but you might find out more if we get to talking! Physically, I have the following traits: Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer and am still dropping. I even have a progress pic if you want to see :) Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I'd have to say below average due to my acne. Not accounting for acne, I'd say relatively average. Hopefully I can get it cleared up soon! I'm more than willing to send a picture, and I hope you'll do the same. I find physical attraction is important, so I don't want us building a connection before seeing each other. Alright, now we get down into the nitty-gritty (I don't think ever used that expression in my life, so don't expect word usage like that if we start talking). I am looking for a woman I can have a loving, caring, and supporting relationship with. It's important to me that she enjoys receiving and giving affection, because I will constantly compliment her, tell her how much I love her, and constantly want snuggles (even if we're hundreds of miles away). It's just the kind of person I am. I'll also want to talk to you nonstop if I can. Messages, calling, video chatting, all of it. If we click, I'll want to be with you whenever possible. On the flip side, I will never not want to hear from you. Double message, triple message, whatever. I don't care if we're not doing anything related, I'll still want to call just to keep each other company. I'd also really enjoy calling for the first time sooner rather than later, as I can usually decide if I click with someone after a few hours of calling in a way I can't over messages. Last part before the end, I promise. Personality wise, I'm introverted and kind of a goody-two-shoes. I never skipped school, don't drink alcohol, smoke, do drugs, etc. My personality type is INTJ if you're into that kind of thing. I won't draw any static lines, just keep this all in mind when deciding whether you want to message me or not. Thank you to all of you that read through this. I very much hope I get at least one message because that's you really need, right? Whether you decide to message or not, have a nice day, and I hope you find what you're looking for."

It can be long distance as long as we can meet up eventually if everything goes well. The only requirements I have are that you're around my age and agree with some of the parts found later in this post. My name's Gary, and I'm an 18 year old guy living in southern Michigan that is currently in college for Cybersecurity and working a retail job part time. Some of my interests include, but are not limited to: **Tabletop Roleplaying**: This is my main hobby (and as you keep reading, it doesn't get any less geeky, so if geeks aren't your thing, here's your warning). It's where I made most of my friends and where I spend most of my social time. If you're interested in learning (or already play), I'd love to sit down and teach you! **Video Games**: I don't play them as much anymore due to time constraints, but I very much enjoy game series like Halo, the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout. I mainly play on PC, but also have an Xbox One. **Music**: My music tastes are, uh, weird to say the least. I only really listen to music from musicals like Dear Evan Hansen, Hamilton, Be More Chill, and the Book of Mormon. I also listen to some choral music (I was in choir from 6th grade to graduation and loved every second), and the occasional 80s song. **YouTube**: If I'm not working, at school, doing homework, or with friends, this is what I'm doing. I watch lots of gaming, historical, and live action channels, with my favorite channel/group being Rooster Teeth. If you enjoy similar channels, I'm sure we can find something to watch together! Those are the main hobbies and interests of mine. If you share any, mention it when you message me! Next up, I'll talk about my physical characteristics. Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. I've lost over 30 lbs since the start of summer, and am still dropping! I even have progress pics if you want to see :) Eyes: Blue Hair: Short and brown Appearance: I have acne, which I'd say puts me below average. If I could get it cleared up, and I really hope I can soon, I'd say it'd bump me up to average looking. I'm more than willing to send a picture of myself as soon as you ask, and would hope you'd return the gesture. I find physical appearance important, so I'd rather get it out of the way sooner rather than later. Next, I want to talk about what I expect and enjoy in a relationship. To put it simply (and don't worry, I'll extrapolate more, you're not finished reading this post just yet), I want a loving, caring, and supportive relationship. I find communication incredibly important, and being able to commicate our feelings to each other can only bring good. I'm also a very affectionate person to my significant other, so if you aren't the kind of person thay enjoys receiving or giving affection, we probably won't work. I'll constantly compliment you, tell you how much I care about you, and want to be there for you when you need me, and I hope I can expect those things from you. Lastly on relationship talk, I will never not want to talk to you. Whether it's messaging, calling, or video chatting, I will want to be with you and talk to you constantly. On the flip side, I will never be annoyed or bothered by getting messages from you. Double message, triple message, hell, call me while I'm at work just to leave me a cute voice mail. If we click, I will want to spend my time with you. Before I end this post, I'll talk about one more thing; my general personality. In short, I'm pretty introverted and not interested in alcohol, smoking, drugs, etc. I won't draw any static lines saying I won't be with someone that does X, but just keep that information in mind if you decide to message me. Thank you to all that have read this. I hope to hear from you, yes you (unless you're a guy, then uhh disregard that statement). Whether you decide to message or not, I hope you have a good day, and do find what you're looking for. P.S. If you're thinking about messaging me, but don't know what to say, tell me your name, state/country if not in the US, and what in my post made you want to message me. From there, I'm sure we can get talking! &lt;3"

Passions are traveling, board- and video games, cybersecurity, Virtual Reality, Ingress, Geocaching.

Every 2 days, the van would be at a different city, people (locals and no-so-locals) would meet up around the van, drink beer and talk about their adventures. Every meet-up was awesome, and I met a bunch of new people. Other solo-vacations I've done usually last a long weekend (2 weekdays and 2 weekend days). Anyways, the point of this post is to find someone who would be crazy enough to join me on some of my journeys. My self-confidence when it comes to anything but dating girls is pretty high, but I don't know... I just don't have the confidence at the moment. I'd like to date people with similar interests, but at this point I believe I'm pretty much looking for a unicorn. If you would like to have a drink, do a night geocache, have a tour through the city with the Ingress app, or have a cool idea for an original or crazy date, send me a PM and we'll work it out. Other details about me: * I'm not looking for long-distance relationships. I'll consider anything out of the Netherlands as long-distance. * I'm around 2 meters tall, and have a normal weight. * I run off and on, but when I start my job, I want to implement a consistent exercise schedule. * Do not ask me to PM you. If I do not reply, I most likely lost access to this account. Please e-mail me at [dateadutchtraveler@protonmail.com](mailto:dateadutchtraveler@protonmail.com) . * I don't use social media. When there's any conversation going, we can continue via WhatsApp, or preferably Telegram. I will share pictures and more personal information then. * If you have feedback about me, this post, or life in general, feel free to contact me. I'm always looking for ways to improve myself. * If you don't know what to talk about, send me a PM anyways, but send me your interests or link me to a post you've made on this or a similar subreddit."

I hope your answer is that you're doing well, but if not, maybe I can cheer you up. My name's Gary. I'm an 18 year old guy that lives in southern Michigan, works a part time job, and is headed to college in the fall. As of recent, say a couple months or so, I've started going to bed feeling lonely every night. The problem isn't lack of friends or people to do things with, I've got plenty of stuff to do. The problem is lack of a person to love, care for, give attention to, and receive all of that back from. I want someone like this, and maybe that someone is you. In a perfect world we would have tons of stuff in common, find each other attractive, and connect immediately so these lonely nights can stop being so lonely. Let's start with interests I have. **Singing**. I've always sang for as long as I can remember. Starting my 6th grade year, I joined choir and have loved all of it, all the way up until I graduated high school about a month back. I hope I keep singing in some way, but for now I'm not entirely sure what way that'll be. **Video Games**. I don't play them as much as I used to, but I love RPGs like the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, and the Witcher. I also enjoy the Halo and Titanfall games, as well as other random games. I mainly play on PC, but do have an Xbox One. **Tabletop Roleplaying Games**. You may not even know what these are, but they are a rather large part of my life. Dungeons and Dragons may ring a few bells, but that's just one of the many different TTRPG games I enjoy. If you like medieval fantasy stuff, but have never really stumbled onto TTRPGs, I'd love to show you some time. **Writing**. I like to do a bit of writing here and there, primarily as world building. Medieval fantasy is my favorite, but I've also done a few fandom things as well with some of the above games I mentioned playing. **Watching YouTube**. Lots and lots of youtube. Too many different channels to name, but my favorite(s) would have to be Rooster Teeth and their other channels. If you've heard of them, that'd be a great starting off point to talk about. **History**. I love learning about history. Medieval, ancient Roman, American revolution, and more. It's just really interesting to me. **Music**. Well everyone likes music, right? I'm kinda weird about what I like though. I enjoy choral music because of my years in choir, as well as music from musicals. My favorite musical is Dear Evan Hansen, and it holds a large space in my heart. I also enjoy the occasional 80s song, especially Queen. **Networking and Cybersecurity**. This is what I'm headed to college for. I've already taken two years of classes in high school that have made me at least semi-prepared (or so I hope). Isn't a super interesting talking point, but just a little about my plans for the future. If you share any or all of these interests, send me a message. I'd love to talk to you. Ideally, you're around my age (the closer the better, but I'm not picky), share an interest or two, and want a committed relationship. It may be long distance and that's totally fine. I want to talk to you every day, lift your spirits, lull each other to sleep over a call or video chat, and more. I want to love you. I've never been in a relationship before, so I'm not sure how everything will go, but I want it all to go well. If you're in the same boat, we can work through it together. Here are my physical traits. I'll also send you picture as soon as you ask. It can be your first message if you want. Physical attraction is important, so I'd completely understand. Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. Am currently doing intermittent fasting to lose some weight, and so far it's working, so wish me luck! Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present Coming to a close, I do hope to whoever reading this that you find the person you're looking for. If that's me, then I'd be overjoyed, but if it isn't, that's okay too. Send me a message talking about anything. We'll talk a bit and hopefully find out we like each other. I mainly use discord, but also have snapchat and am willing to download any free app you prefer to talk on. Can't wait to talk to you. Have a great day. P.S. I'm a pretty reserved guy. I don't do drugs, smoke, vape, drink alcohol, or go to parties. I'm also pretty introverted. You don't have to be introverted, but if you regularly underage drink, do illegal drugs, or smoke heavily, this probably won't work out all that well. P.P.S. If we end up not hitting it off too well, please don't ghost. Being straight and honest isn't always the best choice depending on the person, but it is with me. I won't ghost you and you won't ghost me, deal?"

I hope you are having a lovely night. My name is Joshua. I am not very great at writing about myself, so please forgive me. Presently, I work as an IT analyst in medical related technologies. I have worked in this field for almost 13 years. I have grown tired of it and am now in school for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. Which is basically hacking and hacking defense in a nutshell. Music is a big part of my life. Even though I do not play instruments, I love music very much. I grew up listening to hard rock and metal. As a teenager, I was introduced to jazz, blues, funk and soul music. In my 20s, I started getting into techno, trance, then edm, dubstep and chill step. My family is originally from the mountains so I was exposed to country and bluegrass as 8 grew up. I listen to everything. Sharing music is something I really enjoy. I recently picked up a new hobby, gardening. Slowly, I am transforming my backyard into an orchard. I am looking for some ideas on what to plant next. I am an animal lover. I have a Dalmatian Beagle mix at the moment. In the past, I have had cats, lizards, birds, various turtles, hamsters, ect. Although, I'll probably stick with dogs and cats going forward. I really enjoy cooking/baking various dishes including desserts. Trying different dishes from various cultures is one of the things that brings me alot of joy. I am really adventurous in food. As for TV and video games, I don't really watch alot of it or play much these days because of work and school. When I get time, I like to binge on TV shows. Drama, scifi, and horror are my favorite genres. As for games, I play Apex Legends, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft. Here is what I am seeking from this post. I am looking for someone who is patient and does not mind taking things slow. Maybe we can see if click and progress from there? I am looking for an equal partner. Someone who would share their life with me. Ethnicity is not important to me. Weight is also not a big factor for me. I don't mind if you have children or are divorced. We can chat on Discord or Kik if you prefer. I don't use Reddit chat because I use an unofficial app. I hope to hear from you soon."

I am looking for a long term romantic partner. One that I can care about and will care about me, I can show affection to and will show affection to me, and who shares my interests so we have things to do together if we're long distance, which we most likely will be for at least awhile.

I've never been in a real relationship and very much want to be in one. If we hit it off, maybe that can be with you. Here are some of my interests and hobbies. I'll mark the biggest ones with brackets. Bonus points if we share an interest that's in brackets! **Singing**. I've always sang for as long as I can remember. Starting my 6th grade year, I joined choir and have loved all of it, all the way up until I graduated high school about a month back.

Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present I'm not super attractive. I'd put myself as average before taking into account the acne, so below average with the acne. Hopefully I can get that cleared up sometime in the near future though! Next are a few things I find I enjoy in a girl: **Expressing Emotions**. Just in the way that she can express her emotions instead of hiding them away and also doesn't mind me expressing my emotions. I want us to be able to talk to each other with open ears about how we feel. **Caring and Affection**. My world would light up from getting a short message that says something like ""Hope work's going okay, big hugs!"". Just little signs of affection and stuff like that makes me so happy. **Wanting to Talk**. If we really like each other, I'm going to want to talk nonstop about anything and everything. As I exist now, I will literally never not want to be messaged. Double message me, triple message me, quadruple message me, whatever. I want to be messaged even if you know I can't really reply. Also following asleep while on a voice or video call with someone that I've been talking to is a dream of mine. Last thing I want to say about myself is that I'm a pretty reserved guy. I'm introverted, never went out to parties, never drink, smoke, do drugs, vape, etc. You don't have to be introverted, but if you drink a lot/drink underage, do drugs, heavily smoke, party hard, etc, we probably won't work out. Also, if we end up not really clicking, I want you (and myself) to be able to be honest about it. No ghosting or anything, just straight up saying that it's not working out and why you (or I) think that it's not working out. Hope to get a reply and I hope to everyone that's read this far, even if you don't plan on messaging, that you find what you're looking for."

It has been awhile since I dated. I was not sure I ever wanted to date again after my last relationship. I had an epiphany. In my soul, I am an explorer. I love weird things in music, movies and books. As such, I want to share my adventures with someone. Holding hands, hugs, kisses in public, and sharing my deepest thoughts are seething I miss in my life. I am breaking out of my jaded shell to become vulnerable again. Race is not important to me. I think all women are beautiful. Size is not a big deal for me. I have to be able to connect with someone on a deep level. Age wise, I usually meet people aged 25 and up but I do not mind someone who is younger. A good heart is the most important ro me. If you read this far, I appreciate it. Please feel free to reach out to me. I hope you have a great night!"
210,cybersecurity,ForeverAloneDating,18 [M4F] MI / Online - Wait! Don't scroll past me!,2,bt3v1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/bt3v1r/18_m4f_mi_online_wait_dont_scroll_past_me/,2019-05-26 14:26:44,"[Me](URL Hi there, my name's Gary. Before I start, thanks for stopping and reading one of the dozens of other posts. Even if you don't send a message, it's good to know I got at least a few of you past my 3/10 face. Why Should You Send Me a Message Over Someone Else?: Truth be told, there isn't any good reason. Everyone here deserves to find someone they can have a truly good relationship with, so good luck to everyone here. If you finish reading and find enough things you like about me to send a message, I'd love to talk, especially if you're in introvert like myself. Hobbies: - **Singing.** Having just graduated high school, my singing's sadly going to be put on the back burner, but all throughout middle and high school I was a huge choir nerd. I've been told I'm good, but regardless can't stand the sound of my own voice. I hope I can find a way to keep singing past high school. - **Video Games.** I don't play as much as I used to, but I still sit down and enjoy a good video game now and then. I'm a fan of RPGs like the Elder Scrolls, the Witcher, and Fallout, as well as some sci-fi games like Halo and Titanfall. There's others, but those are primarily what I play today. - **Tabletop RPGs.** If you don't know what that is, maybe the name Dungeon and Dragons catches the ear? If not, It's too hard to explain in this post, but I'm a huge fan of TTRPGs and play them on a regular basis. - **Watching way too much YouTube.** Pretty self explanatory. - **Writing.** This primarily goes hand in hand with TTRPGs, but I have branched out a little bit in writing other stuff. I love writing medieval fantasy stories for my TTRPG games and would love to branch out even more with an actual book or other form of media. - **Networking and Cybersecurity.** Not so much a hobby, but what I'm going into college for. Already took some courses in high school and hope I'm smart enough to continue through college. Pros: - **Very friendly.** I can and have made friends with anyone I spend time with. - Lots of free time. At least for the rest of summer, I'll only be working a part time job. Leaves a lot of time to talk. - **Trustworthy.** I like to consider myself a good and trustworthy person, but that shouldn't really be something someone has to point out about themselves if it's true, so that's all I'll say about it. - **Good at keeping conversations going.** Whether through natural progression of conversation or just completely segweying into new topics, I can keep a conversation flowing if the other person wants it. Cons: - **Well...you've seen my picture.** If that doesn't deter you though, then awesome. - **I'll probably message you way too often** because I have nothing better to do. - **I've never been in a relationship before,** so I'm sure I'm going to find out things about myself that add to both the pros and cons. If you made it this far, you are awesome. Wrapping things up, I'm looking for someone to have a relationship with because as of late, I've been feeling rather lonely. If any woman reading this feels the same, I'd love to make it go away. I'd like to talk to someone around my age, but I won't set a hard limit. I'm not attractive enough to be picky like that. This is my main account and I frequent many different subreddits. If you're wondering what to talk about when (and if) you message me, feel free to stroll through my posts, comments, whatever and see where my interests lie. Oh, and P.S If you're feeling nervous about sending me, or anyone for that matter, a private message, don't be. I was in the same boat for awhile and finally decided that if I'm going to get anywhere, I need to stop being so nervous. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hope to hear from at least one person. Thanks for reading."

This is a long one so buckle in. These are always weird to start, to let's start with what I'm looking for. - **Someone that wants a serious relationship**. I know I'm young, but I want someone I can wake up with a text from each morning and talk throughout the day as much as we can. Someone who wants to talk about stuff and things with me until the sun goes down, then keep talking until we're both too tired to continue. - **Someone with at least one or two shared interests as me**. You'll see them below. Even one is enough to make a connection with, so if you like even just one of my hobbies, I'd love to talk to you. - **Someone I can be honest with and who will be honest with me**. If we get to a point where maybe we think things aren't clicking as well as they should be, I want to talk about why that is and send each other off on good terms. - **Someone who is okay with long distance**. I don't care if we're halfway across the world from each other or neighbors that just have awkwardly never talked to each other until now. If we can make each other happy, that's all that matters right? And who knows. If it ends up working out really well, maybe we won't be long distance forever. - **Someone around my age**. The closer you are to my age, the better. I'm not unwilling to talk if you're in your mid twenties, but older than that and I think it starts getting a little weird. If you fit any and or all of the above, I think we'd get along nicely. Let's move on to physical traits. Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. Am currently trying intermittent fasting to lose some weight, so wish me luck! Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present If you message me and the first thing you ask is for a picture, I won't get offended. Physical attraction is important and I'm certainly not the most attractive guy. Hobbies: - **Singing**. I was in choir all throughout middle school and high school and would love to continue singing some way. I don't know if I will, but it'll always have a place in my heart for something that's shaped me as a person. I've been told I'm pretty good, but I hate the sound of my own voice so I don't really know. - **Writing**. I like writing stories. I mainly do this for tabletop role playing games, which I explain next, but sometimes just do some writing for whatever. Most often it's medieval fantasy stuff. - **Tabletop Role Playing Games**. If you have no idea what this is, don't worry. Maybe Dungeons and Dragons will ring a bell? If not, It's that thing that nerds do and that's about all I can say about it here without going on for too long, because this post is already getting lengthy. - **History**. Easily some of my favorite content to watch on youtube, my favorite subject in school, and overall piques my interest greatly. I love medieval history, ancient Roman history, and a few other time periods. - **Video Games**. I haven't played them as much as I used to, but I still enjoy a game every now and then. Games I like include the Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Halo, Titanfall, Witcher, and other games that kind of fit those genres. I play mostly on PC, but do have an Xbox One as well. - **Watching Way Too Much Youtube**. This is pretty self explanatory, but I watch gaming channels, live action stuff, historical channels, and plenty more. - **Networking and Cybersecurity**. This doesn't really fit anywhere else and isn't really a hobby, but rather what I'm going into college for. Already took two years of courses through a program at high school, so I think I'm prepared (or I hope or I am). Last list, I swear. Pros and Cons: Pros - **I'm very friendly**. I have a decent amount of friends both on and offline. I've never really had a problem making friends and think I could make friends with anyone if I spent enough time with them. It's just my personality. - **I'm caring**. I'll never miss a moment to ask about your day or listen to ""what that bitch Patrice"" did at work today (if you get the reference, I already love you). I'll be here for you and hope that you'll be there for me when I need it. - **I can hold a conversation**. Something nice about myself is I can keep a conversation moving if the other person wants me to. Whether it be finding small things to talk about from an already existing conversation or just segweying into something completely different, I can keep us talking for as long as we need. Cons - **I've never been in a relationship before**. Closest I've ever come is talking to people on here for a couple days. If you want to hear more about why, I'll tell you. This means I don't really know everything that will happen in a relationship with me. More pros and cons might be added to this list in the future. - **I've already said it once**...but I'm not that attractive. Looks are important, especially for starting a relationship. If you see my picture and then say to me directly, without ghosting me, that it's a deal breaker, I won't be annoyed or mad. Knowing that, you may as well take a try right? Bringing this post to a close, I'd like to say that I hope at least one person will find me as someone they're looking for. These days have been pretty lonely and having someone I can care about and who cares about me would brighten my world. Even if you don't plan on messaging me, I'd like to say have a good day and I hope you find what you're looking for."

You've had a long day at work/school/whatever else. You're home now. You lie down on your bed, exhausted, defeated, just wanting to curl up in a ball. Maybe you feel like crying, maybe you don't. You get a message on your phone that says, ""I hope you had a good day! Or if you didn't, I hope it's better tomorrow. If you want to talk, about anything, I'm here. Would love to hear the sound of your voice."" It's from me, that guy you met on reddit a few days ago and started talking to. You decide to reply about how your day wasn't so good after all. We talk, maybe just message, maybe voice chat, maybe video chat. We just talk and your worries, stress, and (maybe) crying goes away. We both go to sleep happy. Hi there, my name's Gary. What you just read is what I want, regardless of which side I'm on. I've had days like that, times I've just curled up and cried. I didn't have anyone to talk to to make it better, but you can have me. The relationship I want is one with mutual support of one another. Giving each other attention, love, and a means to get rid of the rain clouds we have. But what makes me, well, me? What about when both our days or weeks have been great.

Even if it's just one thing (and yes, that includes watching way too much YouTube), that means we have something happy in common. Something to bond over, talk about, and do together. How about my physical traits? Race: Caucasian Height: 5""11 Build: Overweight, but not huge. Am currently trying intermittent fasting to lose some weight, so wish me luck! Hair: Short and brown Eyes: Blue Acne: Present I'm also below average looking in general (damn, I'm good at hyping myself up), so if you ask for a picture sooner rather than later, I won't get offended. Physical attraction is important, and I'd rather it not get in the way once we're already formed a connection. How about some pros and cons of talking with (and hopefully forming a relationship with) me: Pros: - **I'm very friendly**. I have a decent amount of friends both on and offline. I've never really had a problem making friends and think I could make friends with anyone if I spent enough time with them. It's just my personality. - **I'm caring**. I want to hear about you. You're going to be important to me, and I want to show you just how important you are to me. Whether it be just short little messages throughout the day, listening for three hours about how your day was, or trying new things you're interested in, I want to be there for you. - **I can hold a conversation**.

I want to know more about who you are. What brought you to trying to find someone here on reddit? On an ideal day, what do you do when you get home from work or school? How do you like spending your weekends, assuming they're free? Answers to any and all of these questions would be a great start to our conversation. Last section, I promise. This is the **bad zone**. Also known as the very few absolute deal breakers (and I do mean very few. I'm not in a position to be super picky) are listed and explained. **Drugs, Smoking, and Alcohol**. If you drink heavily or do illegal drugs, it is a deal breaker. Smoking isn't a deal breaker on its own, but it is a big downside. **Ghosting**. If you're used to talking to people on here or other sites for awhile then ghosting out of nowhere, save me the heart break. I understand if it's just kind of happened once or twice, but if you do it regularly, it's a deal breaker. **Age**. Pretty simple here. The closer to my age, the better. Mid-twenties is about the oldest I'll go. Any older and it just seems a little weird. If you connect with everything I've said and really already feel a connection and are in your late twenties, shoot me a message anyway. I'll talk to anyone and everyone, even if you are a bit older. And that's it! You've made it to the end. Now you decide if you want to message me or not. If you've had a good read, go for it. If a majority of what I said didn't pique your interest, then you can move on to find what you're looking for. Good luck to everyone."

I am from San Antonio, Texas and I am definitely attracted to women who are strong, willful, and ambitious. A strong woman could definitely make me weak in the knees and I could see myself being cuddled and being the small spoon (he he, jetpack!) When sick, down, or feeling vulnerable, I long for someone to treat me tenderly and affectionately with comforting strength. I have ambition and fire of my own. I'm looking for a warrior woman to share my thoughts, my time, and my life with, someone to be my equal, who when the times get tough, will fight by my side rather than stand in the shade of my protection. Rescuing princesses is fine...but nothing lights my fire like a woman that can stand on her own. About Me \-I'm 5'11"" and 250 lbs just to be upfront. I am making progress on shaping myself to a more ideal physique. \-I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. My career is very important to me. \-I am an agnostic unsure about the existence of a deity, and I am progressive and liberal in my politics. \-I am in school online at WGU studying for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about. I'm also studying Statistics in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire. \-I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, Blues Rock and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting, creepy, and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. \-I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Payday 2. If you'd like to play, I'd love that!

I'm looking for a warrior woman to share my thoughts, my time, and my life with, someone to be my equal, who when the times get tough, will fight by my side rather than stand in the shade of my protection.

So as my title says I'm quite a nerd, since my young age I've always been one. I like messing around with computers and program a lot of stuff. I'm looking forward to go university next year for cybersecurity, it's always been a dream of mine to work in that field and I use intend to get there. I'm self-taught in everything I've learned in those fields so I'm sure hell gonna spend some time learning in your company sometimes. I'm also a nerd when it comes to movies (Star Trek, Star Wars, terminator and much more!) I'm into quite a lot of sports. Mainly biking, swimming and working out. I've participated in a few local tournaments in swimming, unfortunately I don't have enough time to pursue more of those, I just end up swimming casually now. I've been biking more and more as I like discovering new places to... Shoot pictures as it became my primary hobby alongside the others I've mentioned. When it comes to my personality, I'm quite outgoing when I get along with someone and I love spontaneity in general, planning is fine but not too much it ruins some of the fun, let's be honest. I'm kind in general and get very attached if I get along well if someone for a decent amount of time. I'm very curious and always want to learn and discover new stuff. I get out a lot of silly jokes so be prepared, it's fine if you don't laugh I'll find another way to do so, always curious as I said ;). A few cons, when I start talking about one of my passion, I end up talking for wayyyyy too long so don't hesitate to stop me here and there. I'm very confident on what I know and also what I don't know but I might end up being a bit too confident so that's a thing. Picture: [URL"

I am from San Antonio, Texas and a long time ago I discovered that I'm not into wispy princesses like some guys are. I am definitely attracted to women who are strong, willful, and ambitious. I'm not a sub, but I don't want to be in power or in charge all the time. A strong woman could definitely make me weak in the knees and bowing for head pats. I could see myself being cuddled and being the small spoon (he he, jetpack!) When sick, down, or feeling vulnerable, I long for someone to treat me tenderly and affectionately with comforting strength. I'm not going to be someone's house husband or bottom boy. I'm not looking for someone who'll overlook my strengths. I have ambition and fire of my own. I'm looking for a warrior woman to share my thoughts, my time, and my life with, someone to be my equal, who when the times get tough, will fight by my side rather than stand in the shade of my protection. Rescuing princesses is fine...but nothing lights my fire like a woman that can stand on her own. About Me -I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. -I am agnostic and progressive and liberal in my politics. -I am in school online at WGU studying for my Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about, if you have any IT knowledge, I'd love to have a conversation about it. I'm also studying Statistics, SQL, and Python in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire and career. I am also currently learning Swedish. Any one that can tutor me in Swedish, Data Analysis, or Cybersecurity would be more than welcome. -I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, Blues Rock and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting, creepy, and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. -I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, Steel Division, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, Payday 2, Magic the Gathering Arena, and RimWorld. If you'd like to play, I'd love that! -Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and aquaria. I love to play board games with my friends, if you enjoy board games or are willing to try, we already have a lot to connect on! -I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and owning a decent castle-house on a two-acre plot in a semi-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. -I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. -I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth.

I enjoy tinkering with computers and technology. I am currently in school for Cybersecurity. I really enjoy cooking and exploring different foods. This week, I tried Dinuguan. It is a Filipino dish that is made with pork and blood. It tasted like blood sausage. It was quite delicious. As for dessert, I recently made a chocolate trifle. It is a dish that has a layer of brownies, chocolate pudding, whipped cream, and chocolate sprinkles. It was heaven. Music is another passion of mine. I do not play any instruments. I was raised on various styles of music. My uncle introduced me to blues and jazz as a young guy. I grew up listening to Muddy Waters and Johnny Winter. My mother introduced me to R&amp;B, Disco and Soul. I also enjoyed metal and hard rock. If I did not pick IT for a career, I would have picked music. I love people to introduce me to new bands and genres. I do watch a variety of different TV shows. I watch Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, all comic book shows, Power, Lethal Weapon, Designated Survivor, Station 19, Salvation, Supernatural, and a bunch of other shows. I enjoy cuddling and binge watching shows. Personality wise, I would consider myself to be an introvert and a bit shy. I tend to be a wallflower until I feel out the room. Once you get to know me, I am a deep and loving person. I enjoy writing and learning new things. If you are wondering why I am here, it is because became very jaded at one time in my life. I decided to give love another chance. If you read all this and you find me remotely interesting, send me a message. Have a good night!"

Towards the end of this post, I will describe myself and include what I am looking for. I do not really play video games much because I am focusing on school. I used to play all of the Blizzard games, Ark Survival Evolved, and few other RPGs. However, I still play Pokemon Go. One of my favorite things to do is cook. I am a very adventurous food explorer. I enjoy trying foods from around the world. Today, I had some wonderful Indian food. It was Chicken Makhani, Samosas, rice and Naan. It was heavenly. Also, I like to make desserts. One of my specialties is chocolate trifle. Music is a big part of my life. It is therapeutic for me. I had a really rough childhood. Music helped me in some of those spots. I enjoy rock, metal, jazz, blues and several other styles. I love to share music with people and have them share their music with me. As for television, there are alot of shows I watch in my off time. Here are a few: Supernatural, Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, all the marvel shows, Power, Ozark, ect. Feel free to recommend me some shows. My name is Joshua. I grew up in Virginia and plan to move as soon as I graduate. Currently, I am in school for Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. I have worked in IT for fourteen years but I needed a change in direction. Most people would describe me as a nice guy. I treat people with respect and fairly. There is a jaded side to me also. It has been awhile since I dated. I was not sure I ever wanted to date again after my last relationship. I had an epiphany. In my soul, I am an explorer. I love weird things in music, movies and books. As such, I want to share my adventures with someone. Holding hands, hugs, kisses in public, and sharing my deepest thoughts are seething I miss in my life. I am breaking out of my jaded shell to become vulnerable to you tonight. Race is not important to me. I think all women are beautiful. Size is not a big deal for me. I have to be able to connect with someone on a deep level. Age wise, I usually meet people aged 25 and up but I do not mind someone who is younger. A good heart is the most important ro me. If you read this far, I appreciate it. Please feel free to reach out to me. I hope you have a great night!"

I am beginning to love how I look in the mirror for the first time in my life. Strength training while losing fat also makes it hard to get an accurate assessment of how good I'm doing by weight, but I'm intent on continuing and I've noticed physical changes. Attaining fitness is very important to me right now, so I may talk a lot about dieting or working out. \-I am agnostic and progressive and liberal in my politics. \-I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. \-I am planning on going back to school for cybersecurity this Fall. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about, if you have any IT knowledge, I'd love to have a conversation about it. I'm also studying statistics and Python in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire and career. I am also currently learning Swedish. \-I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. \-I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, Steel Division, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Payday 2. If you'd like to play, I'd love that! \-Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and I am planning an aquarium based on the San Antonio River. I am also interested in someday pursuing charcuterie. \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and owning a decent castle-house on a five-acre plot in a semi-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. \-I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. I am a pretty emotional person, especially after being at the gym, the endorphins make me very cuddly and emotional. I love being close and in physical contact. \-I am jovial and love to joke and laugh and entertain people. I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. It's tough to joke when I'm just getting to know someone, so until we meet in person and I know where the boundaries are, it might not show as much. \-I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me. I'm comfortable with my sexuality and talking about that as well. \-I love the time of the year from Halloween to Christmas, and I love Winter in general, I love the holidays and the closeness to loved ones. \-I love Steven Universe. It's true, the show is fantastic. \-Open to poly, just haven't tried it. \-I'm open and free with my emotions. Honesty is a maxim I live by, I believe there's too much deceit in the world and even if it doesn't seem like a good idea, honesty is usually best. I have passion for the things I enjoy and I can talk about anything comfortably. I don't hide things and if I'm feeling something, I'm completely open to sharing it. I feel openness breeds closeness. ## What I'm Seeking \-First and foremost, a partner, an equal. \-Please be local, close to San Antonio. I'm looking to take someone out on a date, get to know them personally, someone physically close. \-Honesty is paramount. If you can't be honest, I doubt it will work. \-I am deeply attracted to strength, intelligence, will, and ambition. I'm not looking for a princess to rescue. When times get tough I want someone who'll fight by my side rather than sit in the shade of my protection. \-Someone who aspires to something in life and is taking real and practical steps towards that. As I study more for my career, I find myself wanting to be around people with a very careerist mindset, people that strive to more than just working at Subway (not that I don't like their food), people who have dreams and goals and take real and practical steps towards them instead of just saying ""someday."" \-Curiosity and genuine interest are important, I've gotten so many half-interested messages and been ghosted more times than I can count. If Reddit PMs are drying up or just not a good medium, I can text, call, I'll meet in person, I know communication is different when you're not in person. Tell me about yourself, I want to get to know you as well. \-If you're offbeat, irreverent, not traditionally feminine, very tall, a tomboy, dress like a guy, have short hair, androgynous, or are just not in the social norm in some way, I'd love to get the chance to talk to you. I love military women as well! I'm not discouraging anyone from messaging me if you're interested in getting to know me, my eye for beauty just happens to be different than most others. Everyone is a gem of a certain cut of color, you just have to find the jeweler with an eye for your shine. Beauty comes in many forms and levels. \-I'm not really looking to be a father-figure at this point in my life. [Pictures of myself.](URL"

I am also interested in someday pursuing charcuterie. \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and owning a decent castle-house on a five-acre plot in a semi-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. \-I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. I am a pretty emotional person, especially after being at the gym, the endorphins make me very cuddly and emotional. I love being close and in physical contact. \-I am jovial and love to joke and laugh and entertain people. I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. It's tough to joke when I'm just getting to know someone, so until we meet in person and I know where the boundaries are, it might not show as much. \-I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me.

I feel openness breeds closeness. ## What I'm Seeking \-First and foremost, a partner, an equal. \-Please be local, close to San Antonio. I'm looking to take someone out on a date, get to know them personally, someone physically close. \-Honesty is paramount. If you can't be honest, I doubt it will work. \-I am deeply attracted to strength, intelligence, will, and ambition. I'm not looking for a princess to rescue. When times get tough I want someone who'll fight by my side rather than sit in the shade of my protection. \-Someone who aspires to something in life and is taking real and practical steps towards that. As I study more for my career, I find myself wanting to be around people with a very careerist mindset, people that strive to more than just working at Subway (not that I don't like their food), people who have dreams and goals and take real and practical steps towards them instead of just saying ""someday."" \-Curiosity and genuine interest are important, I've gotten so many half-interested messages and been ghosted more times than I can count. If Reddit PMs are drying up or just not a good medium, I can text, call, I'll meet in person, I know communication is different when you're not in person. Tell me about yourself, I want to get to know you as well. \-If you're offbeat, irreverent, not traditionally feminine, very tall, a tomboy, dress like a guy, have short hair, androgynous, or are just not in the social norm in some way, I'd love to get the chance to talk to you.

Attaining fitness is very important to me right now, so I may talk a lot about dieting or working out. \-I am agnostic and progressive and liberal in my politics. \-I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. \-I am planning on going back to school for cybersecurity this Fall. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about, if you have any IT knowledge, I'd love to have a conversation about it. I'm also studying statistics in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire and career. \-I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. \-I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, Steel Division, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Payday 2. If you'd like to play, I'd love that! \-Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and I am planning an aquarium based on the San Antonio River. I am also interested in someday pursuing charcuterie. \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt\-free, and owning a decent castle\-house on a five\-acre plot in a semi\-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. \-I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. I am a pretty emotional person, especially after being at the gym, the endorphins make me very cuddly and emotional. I love being close and in physical contact. \-I am jovial and love to joke and laugh and entertain people. I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low\-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. It's tough to joke when I'm just getting to know someone, so until we meet in person and I know where the boundaries are, it might not show as much. \-I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me. I'm comfortable with my sexuality and talking about that as well. \-I love the time of the year from Halloween to Christmas, and I love Winter in general, I love the holidays and the closeness to loved ones. \-I love Steven Universe. It's true, the show is fantastic. \-Open to poly, just haven't tried it. \-I'm open and free with my emotions.

I have passion for the things I enjoy and I can talk about anything comfortably. I don't hide things and if I'm feeling something, I'm completely open to sharing it. I feel openness breeds closeness. ## What I'm Seeking \-First and foremost, a partner, an equal. \-Please be local, close to San Antonio. I'm looking to take someone out on a date, get to know them personally, someone physically close. \-Honesty is paramount. If you can't be honest, I doubt it will work. \-I am deeply attracted to strength, intelligence, will, and ambition. I'm not looking for a princess to rescue. When times get tough I want someone who'll fight by my side rather than sit in the shade of my protection. \-Someone who aspires to something in life and is taking real and practical steps towards that. As I study more for my career, I find myself wanting to be around people with a very careerist mindset, people that strive to more than just working at Subway \(not that I don't like their food\), people who have dreams and goals and take real and practical steps towards them instead of just saying ""someday."" \-Curiosity and genuine interest are important, I've gotten so many half\-interested messages and been ghosted more times than I can count.

I am beginning to love how I look in the mirror for the first time in my life. Strength training while losing fat also makes it hard to get an accurate assessment of how good I'm doing by weight, but I'm intent on continuing and I've noticed physical changes. Attaining fitness is very important to me right now, so I may talk a lot about dieting or working out. \-I am agnostic and progressive and liberal in my politics. \-I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. \-I am planning on going back to school for cybersecurity this Fall. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about, if you have any IT knowledge, I'd love to have a conversation about it. I'm also studying statistics in the hopes of adding data analysis to my repertoire and career. \-I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting and educational ones, I love watching people react to scary things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. \-I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. I play video games as well and on Steam, I enjoy Killing Floor 2, Steel Division, CS:GO, Rainbow Six: Siege, and Payday 2. If you'd like to play, I'd love that! \-Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and I am planning an aquarium based on the San Antonio River. I am also interested in someday pursuing charcuterie. \-I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt\-free, and owning a decent castle\-house on a five\-acre plot in a semi\-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. \-I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. I am a pretty emotional person, especially after being at the gym, the endorphins make me very cuddly and emotional. I love being close and in physical contact. \-I am jovial and love to joke and laugh and entertain people. I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low\-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. It's tough to joke when I'm just getting to know someone, so until we meet in person and I know where the boundaries are, it might not show as much. \-I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me. I'm comfortable with my sexuality and talking about that as well. \-I love the time of the year from Halloween to Christmas, and I love Winter in general, I love the holidays and the closeness to loved ones. \-I love Steven Universe. It's true, the show is fantastic. \-Open to poly, just haven't tried it. \-Strengths: I'm open and free with my emotions. Honesty is a maxim I live by, I believe there's too much deceit in the world and even if it doesn't seem like a good idea, honesty is usually best. I have passion for the things I enjoy and I can talk about anything comfortably. I don't hide things and if I'm feeling something, I'm completely open to sharing it. I feel openness breeds closeness. \-Weaknesses: I'll admit, I'm shallow when it comes to looking for love. It's not something I like about myself, but it is true. I can be dense too, subtlety can fly over my head so be honest and open with me. ## What I'm Seeking \-First and foremost, a partner, an equal. \-Please be local, close to San Antonio. I'm looking to take someone out on a date, get to know them personally, someone physically close. \-Honesty is paramount. If you can't be honest, I doubt it will work. \-I am deeply attracted to strength, intelligence, will, and ambition. I'm not looking for a princess to rescue. When times get tough I want someone who'll fight by my side rather than sit in the shade of my protection. \-Someone who aspires to something in life and is taking real and practical steps towards that. As I study more for my career, I find myself wanting to be around people with a very careerist mindset, people that strive to more than just working at Subway \(not that I don't like their food\), people who have dreams and goals and take real and practical steps towards them instead of just saying ""someday."" \-Curiosity and genuine interest are important, I've gotten so many half\-interested messages and been ghosted more times than I can count.

About Me --- -I am 5'11"" at 266 lbs at 29% body fat, not going to shy away from that, but I have been to the gym for six months and the fat is shrinking while the muscle is growing. Strength training while losing fat also makes it hard to get an accurate assessment of how good I'm doing by weight, but I'm intent on continuing and I've noticed physical changes. Attaining fitness is very important to me right now, so I may talk a lot about dieting or working out. -I am Agnostic and progressive and liberal in my politics. -I work at a San Antonio university as IT Support and I love it. -I am planning on going back to school for Cybersecurity this Fall. This is a topic I am keen on learning a lot about, if you have any IT knowledge, I'd love to have a conversation about it. -I enjoy scary movies, Techno and Dubstep, Power Metal, and going to the movie theaters on weekends. I enjoy the actual theater experience. I like Youtube videos, especially interesting and educational ones, I am getting into Stranger Things, and I enjoy reading and listening to ghost stories from the 1800's. I occasionally pick up an anime to watch, usually a romantic comedy. -I love board games and I will kill an entire evening carousing and playing board games with friends. I also enjoy role playing game groups. -Some of my hobbies include archery, raising carnivorous plants, and I am planning an aquarium based on the San Antonio River. I am also interested in someday pursuing charcuterie. -I aspire to take cruises in various parts of the word, seeing Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Germany. I also aspire to being a Cybersecurity professional, being debt-free, and owning a decent house on a ten-acre plot in a semi-rural area, not far from the city. Yea, that one is specific. -I love to cuddle, kiss, and discuss what I'm feeling at a given moment. Not kidding, I am a pretty emotional person. I love being close and in physical contact. -I am jovial and love to joke and laugh and entertain people. I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor and I'm not above low-brow humor, as long as the people around me are being entertained and enjoying themselves. -I'm an open book and I'll talk about anything, especially topics like current events, politics, science, philosophy, and so forth. Feel free to ask anything you like, ask me about my personal life, opinions, fears, desires, nothing is taboo for me. I'm comfortable with my sexuality and talking about that as well. -I love the time of the year from Halloween to Christmas, and I love Winter in general, I love the holidays and the closeness to loved ones. -I love Steven Universe. It's true. The show is fantastic. -Open to poly, just haven't tried it. -Strengths: I'm open and free with my emotions. Honesty is a maxim I live by, I believe there's too much deceit in the world and even if it doesn't seem like a good idea, honesty is usually best. I have passion for the things I enjoy and I can talk about anything comfortably. I don't hide things and if I'm feeling something, I'm completely open to sharing it. I feel openness breeds closeness. -Weaknesses: I'll admit, I'm shallow when it comes to looking for love. It's not something I like about myself, but it is true. I can be dense too, so subtlety can fly over my head, so be honest and open with me. What I'm Seeking --- -First and foremost, a partner, an equal. -Please be local, close to San Antonio. I'm looking to take someone out on a date, get to know them personally, someone physically close. -Honesty is paramount. If you can't be honest, I doubt it will work. -I am deeply attracted to strength, intelligence, will, and ambition. I'm not looking for a princess to rescue. When times get tough I want someone who'll fight by my side rather than sit in the shade of my protection. -Someone who aspires to be something and is taking real and practical steps towards that. As I study more for my career, I find myself wanting to be around people with a very careerist mindset, people that strive to more than just working at Subway (not that I don't like their food), people who have dreams and goals and take real and practical steps towards them instead of just saying ""someday."" -Curiosity and genuine interest are important, I've gotten so many half-interested messages and been ghosted more times than I can count. If Reddit PMs are drying up or just not a good medium, I can text, call, I'll meet in person, I know communication is different when you're not in person. Tell me about yourself, I want to get to know you as well. -If you're offbeat, irreverent, not traditionally feminine, very tall, a tomboy, a boi, dress like a guy, have short hair, androgynous, or are just not in the social norm in some way, odds are I'll be very interested in you. I'm not discouraging anyone from messaging me if you're interested in getting to know me, my eye for beauty just happens to be different than most others. Everyone is a gem of a certain cut of color, you just have to find the jeweler with an eye for your shine.

I have a new job as an IT support tech at the University of Texas Health Science Center San Antonio. I am hopefully going to be returning to school soon to pursue a Master's degree in Cybersecurity. I have a lot of interests including board games, metal and techno music, poetry, writing and reading short horror stories, board games, and archery.

I am currently working to get into the Master's Cybersecurity program at UTSA, where I also work as a supervisor in the library. The last barrier I have to cross to get in is to take the GMAT, which I will be taking this fall, as well as the Network+ and Security+ exams after I finish this semester. I currently have a Bachelor's of Arts in English Literature and another in History. I have big dreams and I want a lot out of life. I'm working hard to ensure that I'll have a great job and the means to do the things I want, sure as world travel, long cruises, and a nice piece of land. If I sound materialistic, I'm not, I've just been burdened by financial difficulties and limited by money for a lot of my life and I simply don't want that to be an issue in the future. I'm also pursuing a subject I'm fascinated with and that I am enjoying. I am quite a geek, I enjoy board games and role-playing games (the kind you play with other people at a table), archery, hiking, going to the movies, and every year I make an effort to go to the Texas Renaissance Festival. I enjoy dressing nice, I just rarely have the opportunity to do so. I have a passion and zeal for what I want to do and I want to share that. I adore the mystery of winter-time and my favorite holidays are Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. For the sake of honesty I am 5'11"" and 229 lbs (down from 261 last year and still falling.) I'm always looking for an exercise partner, a fellow gamer, geek, intellectual conversationalist, and someone that hasn't lost their sense of wonder and amazement. And of course has plenty of fire in her! Anything else you want to know about me, you are free to ask, I am a totally open book, willing to share, with no limits on subject matter or conversation topic. I really want to know about you! What do you want to do with your life? Do you have any pets? What are your hobbies and interests? What are you studying? What are you passionate about? Bring your fire with you and share it! Things that really attract my interest in a woman are strength, will, ambition, passion, and assertiveness. I want someone to fight by my side rather than stand in the shade of my protection. I'm a fighter looking for an amazon, not a princess to protect. I like being the big spoon but sometimes I want to be the little spoon. I like to comfort and help, but sometimes I need to be comforted and helped. Hope to hear from you. This week I just saw two concerts, Hammerfall and Delain at one, and Sabaton, Leaves Eyes, and Battle Beast at the other, it was a fantastic time! [Here](URL is a pic of myself for reference."

I love women that are strong, forward, willful, not afraid to speak their mind, not afraid to throw down on a video game or a game of 7 Wonders or Dominion. Someone that can be aggressive and playful and dominant, but is comfortable when I am those things as well. I am not looking for a princess to rescue or to be someone's prince in distress, I'm looking for an equal. Mostly I find myself desiring women that are strong, willful, and act firmly and forcefully. As I've grown and found more confidence in myself and who I am, my understanding of what I'm attracted to and what I want in a relationship has changed a lot. In my twenties, I found myself lovelorn, with little confidence in myself, and pining for a broken girl to fix or a princess for me to rescue. When I grew out of that and started to find direction and focus in my life, my interests in women changed a lot and now I'd find myself far more attracted to a lady knight than a princess waiting to be rescued. I don't want someone to need me, I want someone who wants to be with me, who chooses me. I'm not a sub and I won't always want to be the passive one in a relationship, but I am deeply attracted to women what have strength, ambition, and will take what they want, and sometimes that means a slap on the butt or taking a kiss or spooning me, and has some room for give and take. A saying to summarize it I have found is that when the times are tough, I'd much rather have someone that will stand by my side, spear and shield in hand, then someone that will hide in the shade of my protection. Some things I look for in a partner are strength (mostly of mind, but I love strength of body), ambition, willfulness, someone seeking the next goal, intelligent, playful, someone not afraid to express themselves or share their emotions, someone who is comfortable with their sexuality, someone that can cuddle, hug, and can be understanding. I'm also deeply attracted to tomboys, androgynous women, bois, tall women, gals in masculine clothing, but this is by no means exclusive! About myself, I currently work at a university library as a shift supervisor. I have a Bachelor's Degree in History and another in English Literature and I am currently going to school for a Master's in Cybersecurity to make a career in that field. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well. Financial achievement isn't my sole goal or definition of success, but it is a part of what I want and I'm not shy about it. I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. I listen to a variety of music, but mostly Metal (largely Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Classic Rock) and Techno (Electronic Music, Dubstep, ect.). Sabaton is my favorite band and I also love Nightwish, Delain, Hammerfall, Manowar, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Mord Fustang, and others to big for this list. I would like to add, I'm open to trying a polyamorous relationship. Some conversation ideas to get things going: -The Trolley Problem -Is what we experience through sensation (our combine senses) the ""real"" world? Is reality completely different and we're just doing the best with the information we have? -Does morality have a role with humans? Do our laws make us better or worse as a whole? -Is Capitalism the best (read that as fairest) economic system we have? -Is truth objective, subjective, or both? -Does bureaucracy help or hinder the legislative process? (i.e. bureaucracy is a slow and cumbersome process, does it help in preventing bad laws conceived on emotion or autocratic laws, or does it merely hinder the passing of progressive and good laws.) -The Trump presidency in thoughtful and rational conversation. -How do we handle the increase in automation of most jobs? -Why do conservatives think and vote the way they do? -Anything else you want to debate on.

I'm going to say exactly what's on my mind and what I'm looking for. The first thing I'm looking for is absolute honesty. Not a complete lack of tact, or intentionally trying to wound someone, just being honest enough to say something when beating around the bush doesn't drive the point home. Don't want to talk anymore? Not interested in meeting up? Then just say so, it's quicker in the long run and it saves a lot of pain and heartache when someone is wondering if they'll ever hear from you again. I'm looking for someone ambitious, driven, and who is willing to, if not already, take steps towards success. Someone who dreams big and won't just sit around waiting. I'm at the foot of a very tall mountain, but I'm starting and I'm committed. Right now I have a Bachelor's in English Literature and a Bachelor's in History and I work at a university library. It's a well enough job and I like the people that I work with, but there's not a lot of opportunity that I'm content with. I'm pushing to get into cybersecurity and to that end I'm going back to school to pursue a Master's degree, and next year I'm considering joining the Air Force Reserve.

I would like to add, I'm open to trying a polyamorous relationship. Some bonuses, but don't feel these are hard requirements, they're not: -If you're adorkable, geeky, or nerdy -If the terms androgynous, tomboy, or boi apply to you -Really tall and/or really strong (I'm not put off by these things like some guys are, I adore them!) -Dominant personality, strong willed, ect. -You can run with a joke and don't mind dirty jokes either (I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor) -You're looking for a workout partner -You're not afraid to open up (I can be pretty open with my emotions) Some conversation ideas to get things going: -The Trolley Problem -Is what we experience through sensation (our combine senses) the ""real"" world?

I love women that are strong, forward, willful, not afraid to speak their mind, not afraid to throw down on a video game or a game of 7 Wonders or Dominion. Someone that can be aggressive and playful and dominant, but is comfortable when I am those things as well. I am not looking for a princess to rescue or to be someone's prince in distress, I'm looking for an equal. Mostly I find myself desiring women that are strong, willful, and act firmly and forcefully. As I've grown and found more confidence in myself and who I am, my understanding of what I'm attracted to and what I want in a relationship has changed a lot. In my twenties, I found myself lovelorn, with little confidence in myself, and pining for a broken girl to fix or a princess for me to rescue. When I grew out of that and started to find direction and focus in my life, my interests in women changed a lot and now I'd find myself far more attracted to a lady knight than a princess waiting to be rescued. I don't want someone to need me, I want someone who wants to be with me, who chooses me. I'm not a sub and I won't always want to be the passive one in a relationship, but I am deeply attracted to women what have strength, ambition, and will take what they want, and sometimes that means a slap on the butt or taking a kiss or spooning me, and has some room for give and take. A saying to summarize it I have found is that when the times are tough, I'd much rather have someone that will stand by my side, spear and shield in hand, then someone that will hide in the shade of my protection. Some things I look for in a partner are strength (mostly of mind, but I love strength of body), ambition, willfulness, someone seeking the next goal, intelligent, playful, someone not afraid to express themselves or share their emotions, someone who is comfortable with their sexuality, someone that can cuddle, hug, and can be understanding. I'm also deeply attracted to tomboys, androgynous women, bois, tall women, gals in masculine clothing, but this is by no means exclusive! About myself, I currently work at a university library as a shift supervisor. I have a Bachelor's Degree in History and another in English Literature and I am currently going to school for a Master's in Cybersecurity to make a career in that field. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well. Financial achievement isn't my sole goal or definition of success, but it is a part of what I want and I'm not shy about it. I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. I listen to a variety of music, but mostly Metal (largely Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Classic Rock) and Techno (Electronic Music, Dubstep, ect.). Sabaton is my favorite band and I also love Nightwish, Delain, Hammerfall, Manowar, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Mord Fustang, and others to big for this list.

I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. I listen to a variety of music, but mostly Metal (largely Power Metal, Symphonic Metal, and Classic Rock) and Techno (Electronic Music, Dubstep, ect.). Sabaton is my favorite band and I also love Nightwish, Delain, Hammerfall, Manowar, Skrillex, Deadmau5, Mord Fustang, and others to big for this list.

Not interested in meeting up? Then just say so, it's quicker in the long run and it saves a lot of pain and heartache when someone is wondering if they'll ever hear from you again. I'm looking for someone ambitious, driven, and who is willing to, if not already, take steps towards success. Someone who dreams big and won't just sit around waiting. I'm at the foot of a very tall mountain, but I'm starting and I'm committed. Right now I have a Bachelor's in English Literature and a Bachelor's in History and I work at a university library. It's a well enough job and I like the people that I work with, but there's not a lot of opportunity that I'm content with. I'm pushing to get into cybersecurity and to that end I'm going back to school to pursue a Master's degree, and next year I'm considering joining the Air Force Reserve. I want to be a professional and I'm starting now. Well, technically two weeks ago, but you understand. I want to reach the point where I can freely travel the world, engage my hobbies and interests, have a healthy retirement, live in a nice house, and dress well. Financial achievement isn't my sole goal or definition of success, but it is a part of what I want and I'm not shy about it. I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. For the sake of forthrightness, I'm 248 (as of yesterday morning) and 5' 11"", just a hair under six even. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. Some bonuses, but don't feel these are hard requirements, they're not: -If you're adorkable, geeky, or nerdy -If the terms androgynous, tomboy, or boi apply to you -Really tall and/or really strong (I'm not put off by these things like some guys are, I adore them!) -Dominant personality, strong willed, ect. -You can run with a joke and don't mind dirty jokes either (I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor) -You're looking for a workout partner -You're not afraid to open up (I can be pretty open with my emotions)"

I stay abreast of world issues, I frequent Reddit (obviously), I'm ambitious in what I want in life with the patience to wait for opportunity, but the drive to start now, I think I'm funny, I'm in touch and comfortable with my sexuality, I love good, long, smart conversations, and I'm seeking the same things in someone else. For the sake of forthrightness, I'm 248 (as of Sunday morning) and 5' 11"", just a hair under six even. I'm working on body-weight strength training and running to get my weight down so that the Air Force is a viable option next year. I'm interested in hiking, archery, and I love the experience of going to the movie theaters instead of watching them at home. I am a geek through and through and I have a Steam account if you want to play. I'm bisexual, but only really interested in dating women. If you just want to talk and make friends, that's absolutely fine, I love having good friends and I wouldn't be where I am without a support network. I would love someone I can have good conversations with, whether it's about science, religion, philosophy, world events, politics, economics, video games, anime, what's on Cartoon Network, Dark Matter, whether or not climate change will doom humanity, poetry, the meaning of books, the futility of effort, and everything in between. Some bonuses, but don't feel these are hard requirements, they're not: -If you're adorkable, geeky, or nerdy -If the terms androgynous, tomboy, or boi apply to you -Really tall and/or really strong (I'm not put off by these things like some guys are, I adore them!) -Dominant personality, strong willed, ect. -You can run with a joke and don't mind dirty jokes either (I have a sarcastic and dramatic sense of humor) -You're looking for a workout partner -You're not afraid to open up (I can be pretty open with my emotions)"
