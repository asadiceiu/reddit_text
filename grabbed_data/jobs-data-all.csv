Thought my days of struggle were finally over annnnd the virus storm happened. Lockdown was initiated country-wide (that too on my last day). While the first couple of months was fun to spend with family, the fear and anxiety started. This is not going well for me. I interviewed at a couple of places- came really close in one but got rejected due to visa issues again. I don't want to publish my situation in linkedin and let the whole world know. I started upgrading myself in vulnerability management and kept learning some new topics in Unix (I'm a L2 - AIX Guy). If anyone of you know any job openings with the words (vulnerability management and AIX), please let me know. Please ping me if you would like my resume. P.S : not sure if this forum allows posts like this. Please don't remove it for sometime."
1,vulnerability,jobs,Application tips I have learnt from Experience,1,fhjre4,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fhjre4/application_tips_i_have_learnt_from_experience/,2020-03-13 04:12:25,"**1) ALWAYS attach a cover letter.** I used to not do cover letters, believing it to be a waste of time and boy was I wrong. I started doing cover letters a year or so ago and noticed the amount of interview offers have increased dramatically. A little fact, most employers do not read cover letters. Employers receive an avg of 150-200 applications (No joke, I just got a new job and have been told I am 1/173 candidates), how long does it take to read a single cover letter? Well, multiply your answer by 200. Employers do not have time for that, however, they will notice that person has put in the extra effort. Some even use it as a way to chip away at that 200 candidate mountain. Do not give them the excuse to bin your CV. As mentioned, most employers do not read cover letters, as disheartening as that is, their laziness is your advantage. Their vulnerability, your precision strike. Dramaticness aside, this means you can half-bake your cover letter. You do not have to put in as much effort as originally believed. Simply write up a template and replace bits of wording relating to the job in question. The document does not have to be high quality, it will only be read during shortlisting, which means you have the potential to be 5/200 candidates. **2) Develop a mentality** Never get to attached to a job applied for. Although they may have a cool kitchen, brilliant pay etc, finding out you have been rejected can knock you back. In addition, you may develop a habit of stopping your search waiting in anticipation. Move on to the next job. Do not compare yourself to others. EVER! Are you comparing yourself to your friends careers on FaceBook? STOP IT! Comparing yourself to others has been proven to make you feel worthless and unemployable. With that mentality, you start asking whats the point, then your job search starts getting sloppy. Had an interview? Well Done! Not offered the job? Never-mind, business as usual, back to it. This is one of the hardest habits to break. When ever I had an interview that did not go my way, I stopped search for about a week every-time. In that time, I could of missed a job I was really suited for. Its easy to get knocked back on this one. The fact you were offered an interview is a Victory. In fact 1/200 chance of getting an interview. You deserve a pat on the back! No seriously, you do! When failed an interview, you need to have a British stiff upper lip, business as usual. (If you do not have a British stiff upper lip, i'll lend you mine or you can develop your own). Pick yourself up, say to yourself...""Well, business as usual."" and apply for the next job. A quote worth mentioning to keep in mind when something does not go your way... ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts."" -Winston Churchill Keep in mind, the ""failure is not fatal"" bit. Get up and do it again. **3) Daily search** Search ALL jobsites everyday. The reasoning behind this is because searching a weeks worth of jobs is boring and you could lose motivation. In addition, if the job was posted 3 days ago, you could be candidate number 129. Some employers have a cut off point on the amount of candidates. This one could be 100, well you lost that job. **4) Speed** If you receive a question or an assessment, DO IT NOW! If you dont do it, someone else could be doing it and end up ahead of the line. **5) Consider transport** Some pour souls do not have personal transport, so they will only be targeting areas that can easily be accessed by public transport. Therefore those areas are VERY competitive. The more rural areas would be less competitive as they can only be accessed by those with personal transport. **6) Copy the job description** Something I have been experimenting with. I have started copying and rewording the job description on my CV to match a job I did previous to establish a connection. **Do not** copy it word for word, the employer will find out and it just makes you look bad."
2,vulnerability,jobs,"I worked for the devil incarnate. After my last job, I lost a piece of me that I'll never get back.",1,fpplth,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fpplth/i_worked_for_the_devil_incarnate_after_my_last/,2020-03-27 14:13:27," I'm not sure I'm in the right subreddit for this, but I want as many people to see this as possible. I want everyone to be aware of the fraudulent and abusive activity that occurs within the windowless walls of an NYC-based financial recruiting company called GoBuyside. I'm warning you guys, though -- it's kind of a long story, but I want everyone to hear the details so that I can at least try to prevent people from working there and making the same mistake I did. I lost three months of my life; I'm lucky it wasn't more. So to start, a little bit about the company -- the company is run by a man who's real name I will not mention for fear of legal repercussions, and even posting this story on here is a risk. However, if you google the company, you'll be able to find out his name. For this story, we will call him John. And I *will* say this: the company was founded in 2012 and has anywhere between 4 to 10 employees. The number changes a lot because it has such a high turnover rate. He expected us to work from 9 to 7 with very low pay. John hired me to work there in July 2019. At first I was excited because it was a new job. I had a weird feeling about John based on my interaction with him over email, phone, and during the in-person interview, but I ignored my intuition because I have a bad habit of doing that. In his initial email to me, he mainly talked about the universities his current employees attended; they were all top-tier universities. I would later find out that he had a very weird and toxic fixation on university pedigree. So when I start there, he has 10 employees. They were all around my age (recent college grads, all of whom were probably no older than 25). So it's my second day on the job and some of my coworkers invited me out to lunch with them. As we're eating, they start trash talking John. They were basically like, ""Yeah, he's been pretty pleasant with you so far, but give it 2 weeks and that'll change."" So I thought, ""Sure, whatever."" I kinda blew it off because I didn't really want to think about that on my second day on the job; I had just left another bad job and didn't want to confront the fact that I had gone from one bad job to another. Honestly, the baby monitor that he watched us through in the office should've been a major red flag. On top of that, we had very old iPhones and my coworkers' phone broke. She didn't break it; it was just super old. He said that it would come out of her paycheck. That should've been red flag #2. Over the next month or so, employees leave/quit. We went from ten people to three people (and an intern) in the span of 6 weeks. About a month into the job, John calls me into his office and tells me I'm doing terrible at my job because I hadn't ""made any placements"" (Recruiting jargon for placing people in job roles). I was absolutely dumbfounded because it wasn't my job to make placements; I was the Recruiting Coordinator, and it was my job to handle all of the emailing, scheduling, logistical stuff, etc. My job was not to make placements. I felt frustrated because he was expecting me to do things above my pay-grade and one month in, I had barely received any training. See, John was almost never in the office. We never knew where he went during the day, but he usually came into the office any time between 2pm and 5pm. He was not interested in training me and basically asked his other employees to train me. His other employees weren't exactly the nicest of people, turns out. They couldn't really be bothered to train me in full, either. I had no financial background so I began to felt like maybe I was in over my head. But the fact that nobody really wanted to sit down with me and explain anything to me exacerbated the situation. I had to teach myself a lot. Anyways, when John calls me into his office to scold me and express his disappointment in me, I began to cry because I'm a generally very sensitive and anxious person (with a history of Depression, Anxiety, and C-PTSD) and so I think he affected me a lot more than he affected other people. Granted, that doesn't make his actions any less objectionably sickening. He begins to tell me that ""even the intern is doing better than you. Why can't you be more like the intern?"" In hindsight, I shouldn't have cried in front of him because I think he prayed even harder on that vulnerability. As I'm crying, John was visibly annoyed and uncomfortable. Over the next month, I just try to SURVIVE the job. Going to work was emotionally difficult. I just tried to do what was asked of me, even though I hated my boss and didn't care for my coworkers. Then comes September. John calls me into his office again and it also happened to be my birthday (but I don't think he knew that; it just sucked that it happened on my birthday). He puts a brand new contract in front of me. He wants to move me from a W2 employee (full-time, perm) to a 10-99 employee (contracted). He said he wanted me to sign this new contracted because I wasn't ""bringing in enough money for the company"" and in fact, I apparently ""cost the company money"", which is just factually untrue. I was extremely upset because the contract would've drastically reduced my pay (I'd have to pay more in taxes -- self-employment payroll taxes, thus reducing my already tiny income), even though he claimed it wouldn't. By signing this new contract, it would make my original (W2) one null and void. I ask him if I can read it over before signing. He gives me one day. At this point I'm freaking out because I don't know if I should just sign or quit my job. That night, I go home and research and during my research, I actually end up finding out that John has been sued by a number of former employees for a number of different reasons, mainly because he either randomly cut people's paychecks when he felt like it (a lot of court documents are available online). I decide to contact the attorney who represented these (15 or so) people. He advises that I don't sign the contract, stating that it's better just to quit. John had a habit of making people's lives more miserable and difficult and that quitting would just put an end to all of this. The attorney goes on to tell me that John actually name-dropped said attorney's kids in an email because he was pissed off that this attorney was helping people sue him. Apparently, John said in an email that he ""masturbated to the thought of his (the attorney's) kids going to second-tier universities"". Again, his super weird obsession with school pedigree. I also learned that two defense attorneys quit on John because they thought he was too ""mentally unstable"" to represent. You know that if not even one, BUT TWO defense attorneys quit on you, you're probably very screwy in the head. Ultimately, I end up signing the contract (against the Attorney's advice) the next day because John gave me three options: sign the contract, willingly resign, or get fired. I signed because I decided that a small income was better than zero income; I was desperate and in a financial bind. I was also scared of John at this point. He hadn't done anything to physically hurt me, but he had berated me in front of other employees in the past (over our Slack and email) and there was just something very creepy and sinister about him. He was unpredictable and I honestly wouldn't have put it past him to physically hurt me. Despite the fact that I signed it, I started job hunting on the side. I knew I needed to get out of there ASAP. One Friday afternoon, I had a call with a recruiter for a potential job opportunity. So I take the call during my lunch break out in our lobby. About five minutes into our convo, my old boss appears from around the corner, more furious than ever before. Later on, I found out according to our lobby receptionist, who I had befriended, that he was actually eavesdropping on my call from around the corner. So he comes around the corner, stands there, and tells me to hang up the call. I don't really have a choice at that point so I politely tell the recruiter that something came up and I have to go. When I hang up, he points to the ground in front of him and says ""if you don't come here in the count of 3, you're fired."" In my head I'm like, ""What are you? My father?"" But I was also horribly frightened so I complied. I walk over to him and he tells me to follow him to the elevator. I was terrified. As soon as the elevators close, he just starts screaming at me. He starts yelling about how I'm ""the worst employee ever"" and that he hates me and that everyone in the office hates me too and how they all want me gone. He then tells me that my past employers probably hated me and that my future employers will hate me and that I'll fail at life. I'm shaking and crying at this point because I just don't cope well with situations like this. He leads me outside the building and just continues to hurl insults at me. He berates me for taking a personal call/job call on company time. I point out that it was my LUNCH time -- I wasn't on the clock. I wasn't even in his office. I was in the lobby. He didn't even have a rebuttal. He was like ""Well, I just don't like it!"" At this point, I can't take it anymore. I snap. I start to hurl insults back at him. I retort with how all the employees hate HIM, not ME (which is absolutely true; they complained about him everyday and practically thought he was the devil incarnate). I called him out about the high turnover rate and this MF had the gaul to respond with ""well, that's their prerogative!"" At this point, I'm so livid that I yell, ""THEY QUIT BECAUSE OF YOU! THEY QUIT BECAUSE YOU'RE AN AWFUL BOSS AND A BULLY!"" At this point, we're just two people loudly yelling at each other in public as strangers begin to stare. After we exchange a few more insults, he fires me. But it wasn't over yet. I had to give my key back to the receptionist, but he said that I wasn't allowed back in the building (even though it wasn't even his building, nor was the office really his office -- he was renting it and according to the receptionist, he was behind on his rent and they wanted to evict him soon) and that if I ever came back, he would ""call the cops and have you arrested"". At that point, I didn't give a hoot. I went back into the building with the intention of going upstairs to return my key to the receptionist. As I head towards the elevator bank, he tries to physically block me by putting his body in front of me. I quickly ran around him (luckily he didn't try very hard to physically stop me) and made it into the elevator. A few days later, I receive an email from him threatening to sue me if I don't take his company off my LinkedIn profile. I go on my LinkedIn with the intention of taking it off when I see everything on my LinkedIn erased -- my profile pic, connections, job history, bio section, etc. All that's left is a ;( in the ""about me"" section. I knew immediately it was John who erased it. He had access to my LinkedIn because I was still logged in on my work computer. He just went in and erased it all. Luckily, I've put everything back now, but I still haven't recovered my connections. He didn't even want me to keep my connections from the company. He was so paranoid about bad word getting out about his company and wanted to erase all traces of former employees for that reason. He even had bad reviews on Glassdoor deleted. Anyways, that's my story. Please read, spread, whatever you can do. I want everyone on the New York area to know about it. I am being the whistle blower on this company. I can't afford to sue right now, but I want this information to spread. He cannot keep getting away with this. I'm lucky I'm in a much better place now, but there's a piece of me I will NEVER get back after that. If you read this far, thank you so so much for your time."

Which, by the way, is super easy humor. I bought a bicycle. Sorry, was it your 12th birthday?? I like your glasses Thanks they were pretty cheap. (Meaning i got a good deal, they look nice but I found a thrifty solution) Wow way to upsell them! Like, life isnt a tv show, stop quipping and riffing. And the equation of coworker brings up X And X? Thats dumb! Is so repetitive and unfunny and frankly degrading. Almost everyone, including me, is a kind of low key nerd, and these two loud 35 year old ex frat guys dominate the conversation and everyone thinks theyre cool and tries to participate in their jokes by making fun of everyone. Its a great job at a great company but this work environment absolutely sucks. Im over it."
4,vulnerability,jobs,Under-qualified Co-worker,0,d8wvqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d8wvqt/underqualified_coworker/,2019-09-25 12:05:22,"Lurker here, first time posting. This has probably been debated since the dawn of time, but I'm really starting to lose my patience. I work in a non-production IT environment at a major employer. As with most large scale employers, job titles are given 'levels', which increase in responsibility and technical aptitude. I was hired on from a contractor position into the job 'Operating Systems Engineer 3' (shortened from here as OSE3) . At the time of my hiring, I had two people on my team, both of which were OSE4. About six months after that, one of them was promoted to OSE5 (which is considered a team lead position), which was fine, given the amount of time they worked for the company. My concern was the other OSE4, whom I will refer to as 'Terry'. Terry started tangentially from the team as a server hardware engineer employed by HP, whom we had a contract with to do hardware service in our data center. This happened before my current manager took over the team (We'll call the manager 'Carl'). Carl is a nice guy, though he is a little too non-confrontational for my tastes. This is important. As my job title indicates, my role on the team was to address compliance and customer-based operating system administration across just about every OS on the market. As mentioned, being in a non-production environment, a large portion of our responsibility is supporting large virtual machine farms that we lease out to other lines of business to test code, patching, automation, and other stuff. It's an interesting position and an amazing learning opportunity, as you can imagine, though we are bound to the same compliance as servers in production environments, which is less fun (as my IT nerds out there can imagine). My role on the team quickly became automating vulnerability remediation and assisting end users with their leased servers. However, having worked there for more than two years now, I can confidently say that Terry lacks even the basic operating system admin qualifications needed for the job. You might quickly suggest that I, an OSE of new hire, might be projecting here, but I mean it. I routinely have to demonstrate to Terry how to log into servers. As you can imagine, it's tough to support an operating system if you cannot log into an operating system. It gets worse from there. In the last week alone, I've had to explain what a 'patch' is, what '2FA' means, and why Active Directory is not used in Unix environments. If you're not in IT, I should explain these concepts are the basic building blocks of operating systems admin work, ones that I have learned over 10+ years in the field. Thankfully, I'm a patient person and love to teach. I've even created about 30 or so process documents to help my team with common situations, but Terry still cannot seem to grasp even the most basic concepts needed to complete most tickets we receive. Terry comes from a hardware background, which I understand, but I even routinely have to cover for that as well. Just last week, a customer complained to me directly about a server Terry replaced PCIe cards on. In this one instance, Terry did not seat the card firmly, installed the wrong connections, but they also failed to plug the server into power after servicing it. All of these were issues I had to fix in about an hour, issues that Terry left un-addressed for over three weeks. Because of Terry's tenure, they get two work at home days a week (despite the fact they can only work hardware issues) and is paid, by my research, about $30k more a year than I am. Carl (my manager) says he is working on bumping me up to OSE4 thanks to my proven record, but is running against budget issues with upper management. All of this has been going on for more than a year and I'm starting to lose my patience. Even worse, our team has taken on more OS work since I started, and I'm missing SLAs because I cannot reliably hand off work to my team. How do I explain any of this without coming off as a money hungry monster to my manager? Carl has access to metrics that I do not, so surely he understands this, but never seems willing to bring it up. And before you cast me off as entitled, I have way more damning receipts than the above. Should I just rip the Band-Aid off in my next one-on-one? Should I go above my manager? Should I find a more appropriate job? &amp;#x200B; tl'dr my co-worker (an operating systems engineer) does not know what an operating system is and is getting paid more than I am. Help."

I hated every minute of college and that reflected on my grades. I managed like mid 2.0s. While in school I got my first job doing research with professors in different departments, but eventually dropped out because I just couldn't take it anymore. I didn't want to waste time so couple of months later I started a program at a community college for information system security. After second year I started remote work with a local cyber security company doing pen-testing, vulnerability assessments, IAM architecture review, a lot of technical work. Fast forward 6 months I was nearing the end of my third year into my program. After completing my third year into my program I landed a full time job with another cyber security company. This time not in a technical role, but in sales. I'm now a SDR selling SaaS software and security related services to enterprise businesses. As days go by I'm losing interest in my job and in my field. I never really had a passion for cyber security. Everyday it gets harder to pick up my phone and start dialing. I thought maybe it's because of the stress that comes with sales, but I don't even want to go back to a technical role like my previous job. Every day I get on the subway in the same cart with the same people at the same time and got me thinking, is this it? Is my life going to be like this going forward for the next 30-40 years? I've always had an interest in high finance and wanted to work as a trader one day, but I don't even know how to get there. I could go back to school, but I don't know if I want to do that when I just finished paying off my student loans of 40k. Any advice would be appreciated."

HOWEVER - I am a white lady from the Midwest. I in no way appear diverse or multicultural.

The phone interview was a breeze, I had high energy and immediately stood out to the Co-CEO interviewing me. The next day was my first panel interview, with both CEOs and also a veteran management level employee. I was visibly nervous in the beginning, and I know for a fact that observed it because as my energy levels increased as the nervousness wore down, their energy increased too. By the end of it, they invited me back for the next round (which they labeled as the final), which was today. Here's where I think I screwed up. &amp;#x200B; Today's panel consisted of the CEOs (again), and who would be my direct supervisor. The entire hour, things were great, except for one piece. I felt like we all really connected, and so the dreaded question I was hoping I would not hear came up: ""What is a weakness you identify that you think might show up in the work place?"" &amp;#x200B; I don't want to give too much information away, but essentially the role is an Operations Manager role where I would be in charge of simplifying, inventing, and changing processes, developing team members, migrating confidential data, streamlining the organization, improving communication channels, etc. The answer I gave was to the effect of: ""Sometimes I struggle with confidence issues. More along the lines of nervousness. When starting something I tend to feel a little nervous approaching it, but relaxation has become a very important part of my day and also I have discovered that listening to music not only significantly improves my relaxation but also restores energy for me. Through self-reflection I have been able to identify spending more time relaxing and listening to music, I have been able to moderate my confidence because they maintain my nervousness and my energy is better allocated on what is ahead of me."" &amp;#x200B; They told me they really appreciate me showing this vulnerability, as well as asking what I do to help with my confidence issues, which I used as an opportunity to hone in on in this role they would really only apply in the beginning as I would be unfamiliar at first. They said amongst themselves and management in the office, they show vulnerability with each other in this specific team. Did I shoot myself in the foot? &amp;#x200B; To be more specific, they went on to ask questions that tested my ability to be responsive to change management and being in a position with high levels of visibility with senior management, to which I told them bring it on. I would love to be surrounded by people, no matter their position. I told them I would respectfully want to engage in a discussion of why the change was important, and have a thought out dialogue before committing to changing course. This would only result in deepening the bond between the two. &amp;#x200B; They told me at the end that they have a few other candidates they are interviewing and would likely get back to me on Friday. They told me that they understand it's a long process but they might want to do one more ""interview"" where I work and they let me see working hands on to see how quickly I think on my feet, collaborate with their team, etc. &amp;#x200B; I felt good after the interview but a buddy told me indirectly that he thinks my confidence response was going to be a deal breaker for me, but hasn't really listened to the detail I've provided here. Does Reddit have any input for me? &amp;#x200B; Thank you so much guys!"

I am considering several steps I can take to prevent or hedge against wage theft at future jobs. One issue is that at each employer I may have taken actions that gave them the wrong impression that I am an easy target of wage theft. I want to take steps to address the easy target issue by actively writing about wage theft in social media such as Reddit. But which is more likely to be true: &amp;#x200B; 1. Writing about wage theft on social media will send employers the right impression of me in the future: that I expect to be paid for my work. 2. By identifying myself as a past victim, I am marking myself for future exploitation through wage theft. Companies who look to scam others often look for signs of past victimization because it shows high vulnerability. ? Give me your informed opinions or what you think based on your experience."

12,vulnerability,jobs,Being unprofessional or is it just my personality?,1,a1lxdy,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a1lxdy/being_unprofessional_or_is_it_just_my_personality/,2018-11-30 09:00:35,"Context: I work at a high school as a leader. This is my first year as a leader and I am the youngest leader in the network (27). I manage a few employees and mentor them. Scenario I was recently given feedback about my performance. I got a lot of praise for knowing my content and material and asking good questions, as well as being approachable.My critical feedback focused on being more assertive and being too friendly and unprofessional. I've asked my manager for direct feedback prior to receiving this, and was told everything was fine. Questions about my credibility have come up and have always been present--mainly due to my age. I am also very open and not afraid of vulnerability, which is something we as an org strive to be, in order to ensure trust. I was very vulnerable with staff my.first few days and shared about myself. Apparently, this keeps resurfacing as ""unprofessional"" and ""personal baggage that erodes trust"". No specific examples were given and as of yet, I never felt I was being overly unprofessional. I don't curse or say inappropriate things, or do anything egregious. In addition, this sharing happened over 7 months ago. I do agree about overfriendliness, as I have brought this up myself to my manager, wanting more support in being more firm. I was also critiqued by peers for not engaging with everyone on my leadership team: There's one individual who just refuses to acknowledge my presence so that has likely been showing. They acknowledge everyone else but me. I've expressed my concern about this to a fellow colleague, but I know I should be the bigger person and just approach them or move on. It also doesn't help me that I do not have a peer working in my department either. I am My own resource. I don't have a ""clique"" of my own either. This individual has a larger base of colleagues to work with due to their content, but I do not. I try to engage with everyone and don't try to isolate myself from people I don't directly manage or in my department, but don't know what to do. Tl;dr: I have a relatively outgoing and friendly personality and do not try to judge. I question if it is a matter of.being unprofessional or is it just my personality. I feel like I have to fit myself in a box that isn't me. I also don't have friends at work I hang out with outside. I try to develop my own life outside due to my lack of colleagues to work with. Has anyone else dealt with this? "

Like every other job I've had, it paid close to minimum wage, didn't drug test, and like most jobs I've had, finally had to let me go due to terrible punctuality practices. I should have lost the delivery job years ago instead of months ago, but my manager had incentive to keep me around until he just couldn't any longer. I guess I should reach out to him, say sorry, and ask if he could be a reference for me concerning the good I did in that position? I worked at a retail store for the first half year of the warehousing job, and I actually managed not to get fired from there. Should I have a specific supervisor from that retail job to point a prospective employer towards whenever I'm filling out an application somewhere? In 2014, I was doing some drugs and drinking too regularly, and I went to my job while short on sleep and full on booze, and I kinda snapped and caused my client some emotional trauma. I caught an Elderly Abuse conviction due to the vulnerability of my victim and have done my two years probation without making it super well known. It's not a felony, but fuck I'd almost rather have certain felonies because of the name and nature of my offense. I'm barred from working in the mental health field in my state until I successfully file for some kind of reinstatement into a hireable status. I do still drink and drug, and I can't convince myself, when I'm sober, that life can be satisfying for me without that chemical elevation. But I'm not staving away physical withdrawals anymore, which is nice. I have my little car, but it needs some work before I can really push it down a highway on a regular basis. I've got some college, and I was certified as a Master Tutor after two years thanks to a teacher offering me a job that I made him fire me from because I was busy flushing my reality away at the same time as assaulting an intellectually disabled man. So, I'm super unemployed and don't think I can feel ready to waste people's time looking into me as an applicant, but I found this subreddit on /r/all today and thought I'd write this out to see what happens. If any of y'all have some kind of advice from any kind of experience or anecdote, maybe some kind of something to read about feeling/being unhireable and how to get through that, I sure would appreciate it. My ex broke up with me in November, but here I am still in her place, dragging my feet to move back in with the grandparents because the roaches and more roaches make me feel like a depository for Anyways, I guess I should start with just basics about filling out applications since I've had like no instruction on it in about ten years. I'm sure I could pick up something I need. My goals include Making the decision I'm not totally screwed, even if I am still screwed up in the head Understanding how to position myself so I can market myself as an asset and not a charity case Getting some insight into the nuts and bolts of an employment application with my name on it, particularly previous jobs and references portions Thank you for your time, and good luck in your endeavors.

I program well; JAVA, C, C++, SQL, base SAS and know most SAP tools (with hands on in school).

I do not know this supervisor before and I guess she liked me from the interview. I also highly suspect I got the role because I was available immediately so the person I'm taking over can train me for 1 week. The notice once confirmed here is 1 month, that should have been a red flag. The job role is sales executive but during meetings, I'm frequently referred to as the 'account manager' possibly because i was replacing an assistant manager, which should have been a red flag. The working hours are 9am to 6.45pm but I have to frequently work till 7.30pm/8pm because there are deadlines/submissions to meet and my supervisor will make me go through drafts and drafts before finalising on the correct quotation. What I like: - meeting clients in various different fields - time past by so fast every single day - I'm almost always very busy with that low level adrenaline What I dislike: - the long working hours and expected unpaid OT - commute is 1hr 20 mins each way - having to manage projects from start to end and worry about them with colleagues that have too much to handle as well - as the project manager, I'm expected to be constantly updated on the status...but I'm just an executive! Spending nights waking up at 4am because I'm so worried with an unexpected delay in the projects/project status that my colleagues only informed me in the last minute - no commissions for sales so essentially I'm just hustling to bring in more work for myself and the team - it's a job, not a career for me. The sales team is a team of two, I'm directly under the supervisor that hired me and she has worked there for the past 20 years and the first employee the boss ever hired. There is almost zero possibility of growth because this company has very little capacity compared to it's competitors because almost everything is contracted out. It is surviving because of their 20 years brand name and the expertise of my supervisor. The boss is in like semi-retirement mode, all the projects are handled by my supervisor, the boss/owner advises the creative aspect. - this is a dead-end industry in my country, very little production is done here so what I learn directly is not really applicable. My office is seriously powered by foreign talent who got their experience from their overseas factories. - I seriously want to move into IT work as it's far more exciting, future prospects/pay is better but my bachelor in Philosophy is completely unrelated and this place hired me 2 weeks after I sent in my application. So i grabbed it since it was so fast and I was looking for far longer than I expected. So I've been sending in my resumes at the usual places since end October but I expected things to move at a glacial pace since I don't have an AA/diploma/degree in IT anything and I was going to do a part time diploma or second degree next year anyway (submission of applications are in Nov/Dec 2017, admission in either April for the diploma or Aug for the degree). This job would be a pain for night study due to the constant unexpected OT which was why I was already thinking about working somewhere else. But honestly, I needed something to aspire to or the dread of the job would just overwhelm me. I was also studying CompTia A+ just so that I would some paper foundation in IT but I booked the exam in December 2017 since I wanted time to revise and practice before taking the exam. So yesterday I got a call to go for an interview on Thursday for an opening I applied for on Mon. It is for helpdesk operator at an MSP with less than 50 staff. There are no reviews but it seems interesting because they offer a variety of services even vulnerability testing which is sometime I'm interested in since IT sec is so hot right now. They are offering shift work on weekday early mornings and weekends plus it seems like it will be a part time job but the higher side of the payscale projected seems quite similar to what I am currently earning. On the downside, I teach math tuition all day at a tuition centre on Sundays that brings in a extra $700-$1k per month which I might have to stop due to the shift work. Now I'm facing the prospect that if I get the job and accept, I might need to hand in one month's notice at this job that I've been in a little over 3 months! I was confirmed slightly after the 2 month mark, a possible reason is that thus far, I have brought in around $80k in sales so I have at least brought some value to the company/covered my own hiring. I do feel guilty because my supervisor is passing to me large corporate client accounts while she focuses on the large government projects and now she would need to train someone new again. Plus she was the one who gave me a chance and I really appreciate the pay and experience but it's getting almost too much. Like there is a constant squeezing of my heart from the stress since the second-third month because I've been getting more responsibility and projects. I'm not sure if it's because I'm internalizing the stress too much. The job that I'm going to the interview for is another small local company so I'm kinda scared to try again but only small companies would give someone with little/no experience and no certs a try I guess! I know that it's too early to feel guilty when I haven't even gotten the job yet, I guess it's just that no matter what, I'm looking at leaving under 6 months...unless it takes longer than that to secure a job!"

Ask, ""Is it ok if I take notes"" before the interview starts. - Why this is important is: It shows you're paying attention. Also it allows you to write down keywords during your conversations. These are great to have in writing, because at a glance you can bring up previous comments that are said by your interviewer. 2) Not only bring extra copies of your resume, make sure they are nice and in color. - Seems simple, but going extra distance on this makes a big difference. | Go the extra mile and contact a designer who does layout, and have him re-design your resume to be visually appealing. This will cost you maybe $100 (depending on the designer) and it will give you a custom looking resume that doesn't use standard fonts, yet sticks out in a good way. 3) Do not be afraid to say ""I'm sorry, I'm a bit nervous, this interview is very important to me"" when you lose your train of thought. - I think this adds a sense of vulnerability and realism to your personality. Which I feel makes it come across like you're not just loaded full of canned answers. Other (from me) ""Your biggest weakness"" - I've only been asked this twice, and I've rolled my eyes. I usually respond with. ""This answer!"" in a jokenly manner. I then state something along the following. ""I'll tell you what I am working on right now.... and then I tell them about how I've been working on trying to retain as much knowledge as I can, learning other languages to show more of an interest in other cultures...."" so on. This is more of something you see in politics. Don't answer the question that was asked, Answer the question you wish was asked (I'm paraphrasing on that one). It does work though. _stuff thats usually at the top, but I moved to the bottom for you- I am aware that you can find 1,000's of interview tips/tricks via an internet search. But! I wanted to share a few that I picked up from a former instructor of mine. Maybe these will help you guys out.

I got asked to come in to an interview for a company and area of interest I am very into (social media). They asked me if I was available the next day at 11AM. Unfortunately I live on the opposite of the country. I responded honestly about my situation and offered a video call. They responded: Sorry I didn't realize you were out of state. We need a local applicant as we are looking to fill the position asap. Thanks for getting back to me. I responded something along the lines of ""Sorry to hear that. I love the company. Feel free to keep my application on file for the future"" Looking back, it all happened kind of quick. It wasnt a dream job but it was a foot in the door to a potentially great experience. At the time, I was having doubts and picturing it actually going through and not sure if I really wanted to leave my home to Cali, got feelings of homesickness and fear of being independent on my own in a new scary place (may be stupid vulnerability) and I guess it made me respond in the manner I did (was considering pretending I lived near and just somehow getting there). Having said that, I now realize I could have negotiated for another time/date a little later on and been on the next flight out. It would have cost a TON of money but may have been worth it. What do you guys think? Ive never really done anything like that or gone and booked a hotel by myself or been on my own like that so it would have been kind of overboard.. The job would not have been something I would have tap danced to work doing but it would have sure been a step in the right direction for me. Is there any recovery from this? I sent my last response right before I posted this email Also, Im currently working part-time and that would require a 2 week notification before leaving to be polite"

Lots of people in this area work remotely, as all the jobs here are such low pay.

For reference, $55,000 would be a little tight but enough to get by where I'm currently living. I don't have a teaching credential (not required for higher ed), and that along with the current health crisis means that K-12 is out of the question. -What are some fairly expedient programs/certificates (under 6 months) that would qualify me for a job that pays well?

Emphasis on expediency because my living situation is pretty dire. -I know this has been asked to death, but what are some job sites that I should be checking out?

Do I add a line to my resume explaining my situation? Do I change my location on LinkedIn to show I am in the UK?

Processing the experience because it's so painful for me. When I joined a high-growth cybersecurity company in Silicon Valley, I was one of the only women on our sales team. However, all of my coworkers seemed really nice at first. Besides one in particular who seemed interested in bringing me down. I started doing really well, and rumors started that I was a fraud/taking from others (beginning with that one person I had been suspicious of before. Then they started beating me down for being a ""loser."" My manager was in on it too at one point. My mental health started to deteriorate and I started to lose sleep and sweat a lot. Then people started to say I smelled bad. It was beyond humiliating. I got mostly bullied behind my back but a few instances were to my face, calling me an ""outsider"" and saying I wouldn't be promoted due to negative perception (that I was a ""lone wolf."") Things got better as the company grew, as more, nicer people started to join. But then I was nervous about spending too much time with them as I thought my reputation would catch up to me. I was always jumpy and always sitting by myself, just doing my work as best I could. Things improved even more so when I was promoted, and I ended up absolutely crushing it in the higher position (doing better than almost anyone ever had). I got rewards/recognitions. Six figure salary and bonuses. My new manager was also awesome. Meanwhile, the company's stock price kept (and keeps) rising due to COVID19. I was even offered a path to manager. But I quit my job last week for a much lower-paying job at Google. Sometimes I feel kind of strange about it. Weak, like I in the end couldn't win over my mental health. It was so negative for so long though and I can never forget the things said/done to me. Or how it felt to always be fearful, and then be mocked for being fearful. I hate that my bullies will continue to benefit from the company's continued growth. People who hurt me so badly. Tried to get me fired in some cases, albeit long ago. But I can't be around them anymore. Any advice on how to deal with something like this would be much appreciated."

The problem is that I need to complete an understandably invasive background/security check that I'm not comfortable with.

I've been looking at switching to a career in Information Technology, starting in help desk or system administration. I have 3 certs already. My dilemma is I'm debating whether to do IT in the army/air force, or just apply for whatever jobs I can find in different cities. I've found a few in the town I live, but they the pay around 14 an hour, I'm still thinking of taking it though what do you all think? That was one of the main reasons I was wanting to join the military was because of the lack of jobs/opportunity especially because I live in a smaller town. Even when I was looking at bigger cities the salaries didn't equal the cost of living. It was hard to find a job before and it got even harder with the coronavirus. A few people where telling me the military would give me the experience, you have better benefits/housing, and you're guaranteed a job and don't have to worry about getting fired. However, is it worth having less control over your life, and it does seem like the tech the military uses would be vastly different from the private sector. The military also seems like it could be like the fire department in same ways like waiting a long time for promotions, a lot of office politics, and bureaucracy that isn't as open to change as the private sector etc. t seems like the private sector is more focus on software development, vlans, servicenow, and salesforce; whereas, the military is focus on cybersecurity and a lot of dubious certifications that require years of experience just to know the info much less pass the test like Certified Ethical Hacker, GIAC, SANS, CISSP etc. What do you all think between these 3 options what is best considering my situation.

But, recently I finally figured out my true life passion, psychopharmacology, and I would like to at least try my hand at earning a PhD. The plan is to advance in my current field just enough to pay for my PhD program, and then finally persue my passion. It's been very difficult to decide due to pressure from parents, financial limits, and not having many options at community college, couldn't afford a state college. But, now I probably can, and I refuse to live my life doing something that isn't my thing anymore. I kind of grew bored with computer stuff over the years, it was one of my most prominent ""phases"" ever, and fooled me into thinking it was my true passion, but as an adult my focus has shifted to a field where I posess so much more aptitude, and actually feel pretty gifted in, it's so much fun for me to research that kind of stuff. Not sure what to do, all counts on me being promoted and paid more at my current company so I can afford it."

I am relatively new to the job force (26 years old), and was recruited to my current position right out of college, so I apologize in advance if this is a stupid question! I've never had to navigate this situation, and would really appreciate any advice you can offer :). \---- Two competing Digital Forensics / Incident Response firms offered me very similar positions at the same time. The recruiters I was working with at each were aware that I was interviewing at the other firm, and that things were heading toward offers being made. The base compensation is exactly the same, with the only difference being that Company A offered me a 5k signing bonus and Company B offered a 10k. In terms of benefits, Company A has better benefits (including 100% employer-paid health insurance), but is a bit of a dumpster fire by the looks of it (more info below). Company B has good benefits, but is much more professional / polished, and is lead by some incredibly smart folks in the cybersecurity industry. During my interview with Company A, I had the opportunity to meet with the team I would be managing. I was told some concerning things, such as: ""Hope you weren't promised bonuses, because those don't get paid out."" (I was told I could count on ""aggressive bonuses"" around 20 - 30% of my salary (140k)), ""Our clients have no money."", ""We can't hit our utilization."", etc.. These were extremely concerning, and made every red flag in my head go off. Additionally, I felt as though I wasn't asked enough technical questions to make a fair assessment about if I could actually deliver on the job I was applying for... And this is not an entry-level position. It would be at the Manager / Associate Director level, reporting to the Director. For these reasons, I am planning on turning down the opportunity with Company A, and accepting Company B. However.. here is the twist: I was incredibly confident that I wanted to accept Company A **until I met the team**. I told the recruiter I was working with that I was almost 100% sure I would be accepting if an offer was made... fast forward to now, and I no longer want the position. I don't know how to kindly, but firmly, say ""No Thank You"" without burning a bridge / having to go into detail about why I don't want the position. I don't want the folks at Company A to get in trouble for saying these things to me, but I also don't want to light myself on fire by hopping into the dumpster with them. Once again, I would really appreciate any advice you have about how to most professionally / kindly handle telling Company A that I will be passing on the offer. Thank you!"

After graduating in spring with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems, I've been grinding nonstop to find a job until I'm able to go to graduate school. The thing is that I was recently interviewed an unpaid internship which was designed to lead me into a paid apprenticeship. This might be a fine alternative to graduate school, but I've been made aware the resulting apprenticeship would last longer than graduate school and I wouldn't be able to choose my working field in that apprenticeship. I can live with that, but I was also told the most I could expect at the end of the apprenticeship is contract work. If I go be an internship, apprentice, and then potentially a contractor, I'm worried I'd miss out on the potentially better career opportunities, benefits, and job security I'd receive from a graduate degree in CyberSecurity Engineering. I'm aware I could eventually go to graduate school later on but something seems off about the idea of an internship, leading to an apprenticeship, then leading to contractual work. The idea seems wobbly, vague, and sort of an insecure career path. The interviewer was an internship seemingly interviewing me to be his replacement, with him going to an apprenticeship in Amazon Web Services, which I've heard is just warehouse work. I got a call to set up an interview within hours of applying. I wasn't even aware it was only an internship until the interview occured, as the job was listed as a Jr. Programmer position. The interview occured only a couple hours ago, but I can't help but be suspicious. In the meantime I'll continue applying for jobs, but this is the first interview I've gotten after awhile of constantly applying to jobs and so I can't help but wonder if I should consider this an opportunity to kickstart my career. What do you think, am I just being paranoid? Should I avoid it at all costs? Should I give the internship a chance, or hold off in case I find a better alternative?"

Even more so now than I did before the interview. I just got finished the 3 hour interview yesterday and met with 2 VPs and the head of HR. 1. Head of HR wanted a competent body who could work with the VP sales guys. He was a little concerned about my hands-on (IT) background and lack of sales but I told him I'm willing to learn the product from the ground up and he was the one who quickly brought me in for an interview. He also told me at the end that after talking with me, he doesn't think that he'll find a guy with my background + the sales exp and was contemplating if he should even interview anybody else :) 2. VP sales is the guy I'd be working directly with. He's looking for more of an assistant. Someone who can work on leads and sort through all potential client requirements to install/demo the product. He's also looking for someone to dig into the product and learn it all within a couple of months. He works remotely half the time, but I would mostly be in the office for the first six months before I start getting accounts on my own. He told me based on my background that he could see me getting promoted pretty quickly within the company. Some years they do some travel around the country which I was really interested in and they work with a lot of big banks and name brand companies. 3. VP of company. I really connected with him as we are both from the area. I grew up a mile away from the office. He wanted a fresh face. A younger sales support guy who would not be afraid to speak up and learn the processes and maybe implement some changes to their sales process. I told him about my history working with small business mom and pop shops and non-profit and that I was ready and willing to work with the big brands and the big players. We also connected more on a personal level. Talking about reading, TV, and just general industry related stuff. They do cybersecurity so I mentioned one of the big hacks they analyzed in Baltimore. We both feel that the product is a great solution and that the industry is too slow to change and adapt to cyber security problems. 4. I told the VP why I was interested in this company, that even before I applied I had researched them as a possible solution to my current employer's problems and that the product could help us out. He also asked about my long term goals of being a sales engineer/IT Auditor and down the line a solutions architect. Overall, I was more prepared for this interview, b/c I thought there would be a lot of technical questions and gotcha questions about their product. I watched a lot of their youtube videos and read their whitepapers and manuals. So I think if they have a timetable of 30/60/90 days learning the product, I'm already at a months worth of study time. It doesn't seem like they are getting applications as passionate as I am, so I think these are all positive signs."

Near the end I tried to pull it back by asking them questions and getting them to open up more about the position (key qualities, challenges) and the culture (what do they like about working here). But I don't know if it was enough. When I left I had a sinking feeling and I haven't been able to shake it off. So I think that's it. Any one out there been in a similar situation?

I have since then realized that there simply isnt a lot of money in the food industry , unless you want to work to death. So I have been searching around for other jobs . From networking with people at the drive thru to applying places online I dont really know where else to go. I have always liked computers, and I also realized that A starting job in the IT industry can pay between $40,000-$60,000. So I was interested in it. but I have always never liked school so college being long and expensive wasnt always the best choice. But I found a cybersecurity boot camp program through my local college ( University of Minnessota). I like it because its only $10000 for 7 months . 3 nights a week . Which works good with my job and paying bills. So I was wondering if anyone out there had any tips on what courses to take to get started and secure a job in cyber security ? ."

During my 4 years in the degree, I haven't been taught anything about electronics (I'm from a spanish university, so the level is not very high). \- Cybersecurity: I'm tempted on this one because I think it offers more laboral opportunities (at least in my country). Nonetheless, during the degree I have had only one subject of cybersecurity, so I don't feel very confident either. But in this case, there are some companies that pay you courses on cybersecurity to give you some preparation. I would like to know your opinion on these two options that I have presented and which one has more laboral opportunities.

76,cybersecurity,jobs,"(IT, University Senior) Which internship should I take for the summer?",1,bho2yd,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bho2yd/it_university_senior_which_internship_should_i/,2019-04-27 02:09:59,"Tl;Dr at the bottom, apologies if this is a bit long. A little background about me: I'm a Computer Networking Major with minors in Computer Science and Cybersecurity. It's my senior year in Wisconsin right outside the Cities, and my goal is to move near the cities after I graduate this next December to be closer to my SO. I currently am employed at an internship with company A I've held since last summer, which was extended after good performance; essentially, I have a part time position as a full stack development intern. It is approximately an hour and a half away from my apartment, but half an hour away from my parents house whom I could move back in with this summer (but really don't desire to). They have offered me to stick around and stay for another summer with a pay raise to 23 an hour. I love the work I do, but I am not enthralled with the company or it's policies and don't plan to stay unless I have no other job prospects, but they have continually suggested they will be offering me a full time position. I work with C# mostly developing APIs, but lately have been working on automated patching with servers and Azure stuff. The work is constantly fresh and new, and the company is the best-in-class for their market, so I deal with apps that impact millions of users. Unfortunately, the downsides to this internship are that remote work is non-existent (making work while I'm in school very hard; 4 hours of unpaid commute every work day, gas is expensive and wear on my vehicle) and I have no peers that are within my age group, so it can be sort of lonely. They also have one location for IT work and it is here, and I do not want to stay here past graduation whatsoever, as it is very far from both my SO and my family. As well, even if I work here this summer and live with my parents, I would still need to pay for my college apartment while getting no use out of it. I was, however, recently offered a new internship at a company B that is 25 minutes from my apartment. I am enthralled by the work this new company does, and working there after I graduate is something I deeply desire. They have an office in the cities which they say I could move to once I graduate, and have a reputation for giving interns who work there full time jobs that pay well above market average. However, the internship is in product support, and only pays 12 an hour. I'm confident in my people skills and motivation to move up in company B, but I fear this experience for the internship will be less useful as a resum builder than the work I do with company A. As well, the lower pay would be difficult to deal with, but not impossible. However, I would desire a job with company B after I graduate infinitely more than with company A. Seeing as I am reaching the end of my studies, I am motivated to work for the company B that I would rather work for after I graduate, but although both companies can nearly guarantee me a job, only one of them is in development/project work, and that is the company A I would rather not stay on with. Development jobs are plenty at company B, but I would probably need to knock it out of the park impressions wise and study outside of work to land one. I also greatly enjoy the area around my college apartment and have many friends there, and not many anymore back home near my parents. I am a part of many clubs and activities that require equipment that I can't move to my parents house, and thus would be giving up these hobbies for the summer when I have time and weather to enjoy them if I stay with company A. Tl;dr: two companies offering me summer work with promise of full time after. Not sure which is best for my career, but don't want to work full time for company A after school. Company A: company I currently work for 23 dollars an hour fruitful full stack development work in dotNET, Windows Server, Azure, Web dev have been working here for a year, extensive portfolio and good reputation middle of nowhere and would need to live with my parents which is inconvenient, unable to practice hobbies no peers in my age group, separated from friends geographically I do not want to work for Company A when I graduate due to distance, culture, and policy, they don't offer any remote work either commute during semester is 4 hours round trip, expensive gas and car wear Company B: new company near me awesome company culture, enthralled with them after visiting very short commute, can see friends and participate in hobbies not paying for useless apartment offers remote work during semester for interns IT shop that is very reputable and fast growing interesting benefits that appeal to me full time positions pay much better than Company A on average according to glassdoor and other similar sources ~ java/apple shop, not familiar with this but want to learn ~ if all else fails, they are a major employer of networking, which is what my degree is actually in 12 dollars an hour, not even competitive with convenience stores near me support position which is not the most interesting, need to put in work to get a development position Apologies for the wall of text and possible mobile formatting"

The past 6 months, our new manager with a backbone has successfully off-boarded this delegated task back to the Network team but most recently, the dispute is that they still want us to man their phones lines and field their incoming &amp; outgoing Network calls. My thoughts, is that it's a clear violation of separation of duty and conflict of interests (we need to attend to CyberSecurity's SLA's before the Network team's SLAs) even though we have the with the same company goals. Also, inaccurate time charging using CyberSecurity charges to our customers when we're doing delegated Network duties. &amp;#x200B; Tomorrow morning, our teams have a conference call to resolve this matter.

GRC implementation, etc. I went back to my current employer and leveraged my offer for a 50k raise which brings me to 130k/yr (in Tampa, FL).

So I'm currently in college studying computer science and hoping to eventually get a job in cybersecurity. I keep on hearing people on campus talk about how important your social media presence is for job employers in tech fields, but I've just really never liked using social media other than YouTube and Reddit. I deactivated my Facebook account a while back and I just deleted my Twitter account recently because when I tried using both of those for a while, I never really liked using them. They feel too superficial, and it has always felt more like a chore to me to keep on posting things. I also have a decent LinkedIn profile that shows off all of my skills, but I never really use it much other than that. I don't consider myself to be an overly shy person and I don't have anything against people who enjoy using social media, but I know that for whatever reason, people think I'm antisocial for not liking social media. Would this severely hurt my chances of getting a job in the future given the fact that I'm pursuing a tech field, or does this matter less than I think it does?"

The job would basically be drawing a circle on a screen (all day, I think), with the caveat being that it pays slightly better, and I'll be in direct contact with project managers for other things (some possibly in the defense industry) who could have other opportunities elsewhere.

Another thing I was looking at going for maybe a computer science degree-either Cybersecurity, Information security, or information technology. Though when I look at this path, the massive debt that i would have to incur scare me. I live on the minimum amount that my state allows for those with mental disabilities, it would take me decades to pay it off with very little job outcome.

I even looked at the pension that many envy, and I'm not impressed - my company 6% matching 401k would likely provide me a bigger cushion considering I could reinvest the difference in pay and not be limited to staying in one career/company for 30 years just to get 30% of my highest 3 years pay. What am I missing here &amp; how do these agencies expect to hire and retain talent? As an example: Do cutting edge cybersecurity analysts really work for the FBI making 60-80k/year when they could easily get 140k+ elsewhere?

I actually started feeling that my job wasn't so bad, the work itself is quite interesting since I get to handle a lot of big clients, but the tight project deliveries, intense stress, bad organisation, low morale, long hours and lack of anycareer progression started to get to me. Still, it was my first proper 'office' job and I definitely learnt a lot on the job. In fact, I remembered to hand in today my application for my first leave application since starting in end july starting in end july this year, which I had shelved aside thinking I would be submitting my resignation on this monday. Instead, I might be handing it in this thursday. I just got a call earlier saying that the project is starting 1 December but they are willing to wait for me with my 1 month notice and for me to come down to sign their LOA. I thanked them and asked for them to email for me to take a look first, which they probably will tomorrow (Wed). And now I'm suddenly so full of hesitation to tell my boss of my resignation. I'm at the point that I'm settled in and have been given large projects to handle as the project manager (but I get a lowly executive pay). I like to think I've been relatively competent at my job since I was confirmed one month early and has brought almost $100k of sales in new accounts in my 4 months while dealing with exisiting accounts. In the meantime, my boss has schedule me with her and a few other team members for meetings with some of the biggest companies in my country to bid/tender for projects next week. And then, I'm leaving. There is a consideration that I had to sign a non-compete agreement that stated I would be in the company for 6 months but non-competes are very shaky and I'm quite sure it doesn't matter since it wasn't in the actual employment letter and no penalty is directly listed for breaking it. My country doesn't have at will employment but any employee can quit anytime but must serve their notice/bond or pay back the balance time, sadly my notice period is one month which is going to be so awkward and my current company has a habit of not getting in new hires till the last minute... This new job opportunity is a bit too good to pass on, based on the info from my interview, it's shift work but part time so I will have time to study. Pay will be more than my current full time job once I work on weekends! Plus it's a MSP opening a helpdesk for the first time, I have no idea why they selected me since I currently have zero degree/cert/experience in IT, possibly because I sold them on my plans and goals for an IT/cybersecurity career and they bought into my plans for career progression  so there is definitely room for me to grow to other roles beyond the helpdesk role that I'm being offered. It is really quite a position besides the shift work and having to work on weekends. The kicker is that their working hours start later and ends earlier than my current job so I have to go during lunch break if I sign my letter. I'm quite conflict avoidant which could be why I'm getting all this stress from my current job and i already get so stressed thinking of how to break bad news/project delays to my clients, now I need to think of how to quit to my boss! Another point is that one of my colleagues is planning to quit on Monday and another wants to leave by Jan 2018, so it will be crazy if I jump the gun on them and quit before they all do! And another colleague handed in her notice letter at the end of Oct. This office will be terribly shorthanded and I'm looking at what those who have to stay would have to deal with. I have been falling ill monthly with flu/fever ever since i started but i still drag myself to work because there is hardly ever a day where there isnt a deadline/project submision/meeting to attend to. Do I just suck it up and accept that the last month is going to be terrible for me? I have realised that often times clients are actually quite ok dealing with bad news/delays but I doubt that would apply to this job. "

So Bachelors of Math, with Computer Science Minor, 3.5 GPA. Data Analysis job has had me using Tableau, Python, SQL, and Salesforce extensively. Also have to regularly talk with, interact with, explain and teach clients, as well as be able to relay high level data based conclusions to non-technical POC's very frequently. It has also involved a great deal of investigative work, and learning extensively about how the internet operates, protocols, cybersecurity, but nothing overly hands on technical. I don't know exactly how a firewall works or how to code one. I've been told by my boss that my communication, verbal, and interpersonal skills are significantly ahead of my other more senior colleagues, and on par with the sales team. Otherwise lots of Excel, Word, Powerpoint and presentations, not to mention a lot of problem solving and optimization of Salesforce Systems and Visual Presentation of Data. Right now all I'm looking at is Data Analyst - Chicago, but I feel like I could be looking for other job titles too to expand my search. Oh I also have passed the first 2 Actuary Exams, and expecting to get a passing grade back on the 3rd in a month, but I would like to move to Chicago ASAP (Shitty home living situation) and then can more leisurely explore Actuarial Opportunities from my new job, or study for and retake the 3rd exam if I don't pass."

I'll be leaving the military with a BS in astronautical engineering and an MBA with an emphasis in Finance. I'll have 3.5 years or program management experience in the astro field and 2.5 years of cybersecurity. I'm not super concerned about finding a job if I were to look as soon as I transitioned but am considering an alternative. I recently started working on a ski patrol in a volunteer aspect and am really enjoying. I currently patrol at a very small hill but have made a few contacts and one thinks that they could get me a job at one of the premier resorts in the country when I get out. Unfortunately ski patrol doesn't pay very well so I can't really make a career of it but I'm considering doing it for a season when I get out. Would that really hurt my employability? Skiing has been a passion of mine for a long time and this would give me the chance to be around if not ride with some of the best skiers in the world but I won't do it if it is going to have a huge impact on my future career.
119,cybersecurity,jobs,Old Job wants me back after 3 Months,5,5ejdu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5ejdu9/old_job_wants_me_back_after_3_months/,2016-11-24 06:59:56,"Whatsup /jobs I was wondering if you could give me some advice. I'm a 25 year old IT guy who just received a very interesting job offer from a previous employer. I left my previous position 3 months ago for a few reasons. It was my first IT job (helpdesk) and my first real job out of college. I really enjoyed the people I worked for the most part (with the exception of one person, which I'll get to in a moment) but I wasn't making nearly enough money to make ends meet or to achieve any of my life goals like getting my own apartment or paying off my student loans. There were a few pretty glaring issues in the Dept when I left, such as 1. Lack of communication between the InfoSec team and the rest of the IT guys. I worked very closely with the Security Analyst since getting into Information Security is a career goal of mine, and there was a big disconnect between the old guard and the new cybersecurity initiative. 2. There was a certain coworker that, despite very admirable personal qualities and decades of experience and knowledge was MISERABLE where he worked and made it very difficult for me to do my job, as we worked very closely on many projects. Things would get swept under the table or disregarded for weeks at a time, until so much work piled up it was impossible to catch up. He HATED being there and it was a big blow to morale, as he was very vocal about this. 3. Last, and most importantly, I was becoming very bored. I want to become a Sysadmin and then eventually find a role in cyber security, but I was stuck doing the Helpdesk gig for two years with no sign of advancement, even though my bosses and MGMT seemed to like me very much. As I was very pessimistic that any of this would change, even after speaking to MGMT about it a few times, I floated my resume online and immediately got contacted directly by an IT manager at a different company, and was offered the job after a single technical interview. After negotiating salary, they offered me 35% more than my current gig and a title bump. So I've been here three months and I'm bored to tears! I went from a 9 person department for a 320+ person company that had dedicated staff for server maintenance, desktop support, cyber security, etc to a barely four person department for a 500+ person company. The rest of the department (and it's barely a department, we report to the CFO!) is spread all over, so I hardly get to interact with anyone. Most of the dept is awol at any given time, so there is zero communication. This has disrupted the few projects I've already tried to start to the point of no return. Also, while the staff and executives here are truly wonderful professionals, I have no interest in the industry (automotive) and find it to be fairly boring. The job is also pretty autonomous, but it consists of remarkably simple break fixes and is generally just very tedious. Today I got a call from my previous employer. Turns out they COMPLETELY revamped the entire department based off of suggestions I had made in my exit interview. The above mentioned unhappy employee has left for a different company, and they want me to come in with an even better title, salary, and benefits, and I'd be reporting directly to a recently promoted mentor of mine to learn more about networking and cyber security. The CIO, Director, Department Manager, asked to get me back specifically. There are a few caveats. My current employer is in the middle of a big digital infrastructure transition right now, and I'd kind of be leaving them high and dry if I left. Also, I've only been here for a few months, is it bad for the resume? Is it a good idea to go back, now that the company knows I'm ready to leave if I don't get what I want? Tl;DR Better job offer from previous employer, but I've only been at new job for 3 months. What do? "

I was told before being brought onboard I would getting my hands on all types of stuff, but the majority of my time is spent sitting at a desk or doing task that are not challenging at all. Know the kicker is, even though its not that much work Im a FTE with the company and make a 50k+ salary and have benefits. Now, I work in IT and have a passion to get into the InfoSec/Cybersecurity side of things and was able to land two interviews this week which Ive been trying for ages to get into. One of the jobs that I want the most a recruiter had submitted me and the company I was submitted to wants to proceed with an interview, which was organized through the recruiter. Now on the companys website that Im interviewing for has the position posted which I applied to as well. Would asking the company Im interviewing for about being brought on full time be, I dont know illegal since the recruiter organized the interview? The recruiter already sent me documents for me to sign saying if I were to get picked to sign them ASAP so it can make the onboarding process faster. How can I go about this in securing an FTE position? Should I just ask? I would hate to leave my current position for a contract position, but being 26 and still kind of new in the filed I think this is better for me career wise. "
