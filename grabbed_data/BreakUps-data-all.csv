I've been in a relationship for a bit over 4 years now, and I found out she cheated on me. I made it mutual to stay calm and mature during the moment. We agreed to be friends, but now, I just feel the emotions catching up, anger and frustration. I feel like I am better than the dude she is with. But that's not for me to decide. What really messes me up is that the day before we broke up, she and I got together. And now I just feel like I am not myself, and I feel used. Why do this, when you had feelings for someone else? I couldn't shower, but I forced myself on the 4th day, and I was just shaking and crying. I tried going to Tinder and Bumble to just try to talk because I think I'm going to be rusty. I confessed my feelings to my best friend, out of vulnerability. And I don't think she feels the same way. I've changed my bed sheets and mattress, and I have to sleep on a call with the friend I confessed my feelings to, so I can focus on her static and breathing. So here I am, just feeling on and off points where I'm trying to pretend I'm fine. And at night, it gets worse as I know my ex is with the new dude. I have a lot of stuff that just relates to her, and its hard to take down."

Now the roles have switched now that I need him the most he takes advantage of my vulnerability and fucks me over like its nothing. My career is ruined because of him my life sucks because of him I hate myself and my body because of him. He knows I cant leave and he treats me like shit i hate him and theres no where I can go, nothing I can do, no one to talk to. Im so tired of being treated this way, why did he lie why did he change why didnt I get out sooner......"
2,vulnerability,BreakUps,"We fell in love, then she broke up with me over text to work on herself",1,i2pmot,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i2pmot/we_fell_in_love_then_she_broke_up_with_me_over/,2020-08-03 13:16:16,"Ive known this girl for a long time. We recently 4 months ago started talking as we were both in quarantine ever since March. We saw that we were both single and began to talk. She told me that shes always liked me and missed me since we hadnt seen each other in a couple months. I found out that she got out of her long and serious relationship 2 weeks before talking to me. We continued to talk and even played PS4 for hours just talking, in the end we probably logged + 200 hours of just talking. We later went on dates and after a month or so of talking and seeing one another in person we stated that we really liked each other. We texted and FaceTimed everyday and eventually we had been on multiple dates and had very strong feelings that we both emphasized to each other. She was always the first to tell me how she felt about me and I followed telling her I felt the same as I did. Feelings were very mutual between us. She would tell me how she was scared about her feelings for me because they were so strong. She also would state how when she was with me she was super happy and it made her feel better but when she was alone she was irritable and in a bad mood. She had stated that she had body image problems and that she was very sad before we started talking and being with each other. Fast forward and I asked to date me, she said yes and we were both so happy to be dating one another. She would say things like I cant believe your my boyfriend and she felt like  she didnt deserve me and that she was so happy to be with me. I always assured her that she was beautiful and she was an amazing person. She told me soon after we started dating that she loved me. I told her I loved her too as I did but I didnt want to be the one to say it first. I felt like it was fast but with her it felt right. We continued to go on dates and confess our love for each other. We would openly say I love you she would say I love you more. She met my friends and family and they said that we were perfect together and that we seem so happy with each other. We went on vacations recently, a couple days camping with her friends and to a shore with my friends for a week. She went on a separate vacation recently in between our vacations with her family. While She was away I noticed she didnt text me as much and she even apologized about not being good at texting while she was away. I didnt think anything of it as she was on vacation. She came back and we didnt see each other for a full week because we were both working and the next week we were going on vacation anyway (We live far from one another). Finally We went on vacation for 5 days. Everything was great, nothing out of the ordinary. No fights, no problems, everything was great. The last time I saw her in person and said goodbye and that we loved each other and I would see her soon. The day after we got back from the shore she didnt really text me. The night before we drank a bunch and she smoked and had to go to bed early because she wasnt feeling to great as she drank too much. We spent 5 days with each other so I was like oh shes prob burnt out from vacation. The next day I wake up and text her she doesnt really answer me and then tells me we need to talk I asked if I should call and she hit me with a long paragraph saying its all her fault and she needs to tell me something shes been thinking about recently She goes on to say that she ended her last relationship because she needed to be independent and find happiness in her own life. She was only able to experience that after she was alone for a couple of weeks until she started talking to me. She tells me that she needs to find herself and what makes her happy in her own life. She explains that she wanted to fall in love again and that she did. She goes on to state that she rushed things because of her being sad and her vulnerability and that she never got to fully heal from her previous relationship. She told me at the time she wanted to be with me and that she has deep feelings for me but that right now she needs to be on her own. She states that she needs to find herself and what makes her happy before she can try a relationship again. She tells me that she will always have feelings for me and that she hopes I find happiness in myself and someone else one day. (I dont want anyone else. I thought she was the one. I want her to be the one. I thought what we had was special and different. She sent me a text message telling me all this.) Background: She would talk about how she was excited for our future and would tell me about how she was going to move closer to me because of school and that we would be able to hang out all the time. She told me that she was in it for the long haul with me. She never stated that we were broken up even after I texted her asking. She said we would talk in a couple days after we have time to think and process things. She wouldnt even talk to me on the phone after I called a number of times. I havent heard from her since that its been 2 days but this whole thing is unlike her. I am heartbroken. Will she come back? Or will I never see her again?"
3,vulnerability,BreakUps,So your Breakup just happened...,1,i2u5oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i2u5oi/so_your_breakup_just_happened/,2020-08-03 19:43:36,"This post is for everyone who just got broken up with foremost, but I hope everyone can benefit from it. Im sorry you are going through this right now. I dont know your situation, but please know that all of us on here can relate to how you are feeling. Probably unlike most of your friends and family (if they are currently not going through this painful experience themselves). So hopefully this place can help you not feel so alone in all of this and give you an outlet to express your feelings and most inner thoughts, even if it may not feel like it, many on here experience very similar feelings and thoughts, probably exactly in this moment youre writing it. But the main reason I wanted to make this, is to give you a little resource of what to put into your mind in this anxious and shocked state youre currently in. Because this will have a big impact on your healing, as well as on your chances of reconciliation with your ex (if thats what you want). So I put together a list of sources of comfort in those times. Of good advice thats created to help you, made by people who want to help you. Because it is very easy for not so kind people to use your anxious state to make money with you, oftentimes by giving bullshit advice that is only hurting you (if you ever heard of the 30 day No Contact rule you know what I mean). I hope this list gives you a good place to start learning more about yourself, your ex and the breakup, as well as pointing you in the direction of healing in a healthy way. And if others have more great resources that help them in their breakup please share it with us :) [Best Advice to Get an Ex Back by Dating Guy](URL [The Mindset of No Contact by Dating Guy](URL [How No Contact Works (to get Your EX back) by Dating Guy](URL [Risk Management: Why No Contact is the Best Decision by Dating Guy](URL [Why the 30 Day No Contact Rule is a Lie by Dating Guy](URL [The Dumper Experience (from Breaking Up through No Contact) by Dating Guy](URL [Seeking Validation from Your Ex by Dating Guy](URL [How to Stop Overvaluing Your Ex by Dating Guy](URL [How to Stop Obsessing About Your Ex by Dating Guy](URL [Can You Get Your Ex Back after Begging and Pleading? by Dating Guy](URL [Dont Wait!

5,vulnerability,BreakUps,"My (22F) boyfriend (22M) broke things off with me, and I feel like a wreck.",1,i6mpxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i6mpxt/my_22f_boyfriend_22m_broke_things_off_with_me_and/,2020-08-10 02:59:53,"I was redirected here, so I'm reposting this. This happened Thursday, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around this, trying to understand what exactly went wrong. He'd been a bit distant as of late, something clearly bothering him, but he never gave me the impression he wanted to end things. I had a feeling though, that he was hiding something from me. Turns out, I was right. We made plans for Thurday night to hang out (don't live together), and everything seemed fine until he texted the morning of and asked if he could come over right then. I called and said he could, but asked if he was okay. He said he wanted to talk. I said my usual ""I love you"" as I said goodbye, but he didn't say it back. I knew what that talk would be about. He came over with the things I left at his place, and it really clicked that he was going to end things. I started to panick, asking myself, ""Why is he doing this? He never said we were having problems, gave no indication, what's going on?"" He sat down and he said we had to talk about us. When I knew what he was going to say, I said something along the lines of, ""Before you say anything, I want you to look me in the eyes as you break my heart."" He told me he loved me, but wasn't sure if it was romantic anymore. That he loved me as a friend. He started crying, which he has never done in front of me before, and asked himself what was wrong with him. He said I was amazing, so good to him. That we had so much in common, we got along well, he liked my personality, and he loves it when I touch him. But he doesn't understand why he can't love me. He said he hates himself, that he can't love me the way I deserve. He thought that if he just kept saying it, that he loved me, then the feeling would come back. It broke me to see him like this. I wound up holding and comforting him, I couldn't even think about my feelings in the moment. I kept saying, ""Nothing is wrong with you, you can't force feelings, it's okay, cry it out, you need to cry and not hold back."" He kept sobbing and holding me, hurting because he knew he was hurting me. I'm the kind of person that keeps giving. And, I gave him forgiveness and understanding, in the moment. I said I forgave him. He said he feels selfish, for still wanting me in his life. To keep being friends, because I'm special to him. I want him in my life, he's been my best friend and lover for so long. I assured him I felt the same way. But after he left, reality hit me hard. So fucking hard. I realized that, in the process of comforting him, I gave up being comforted in return. I cried by myself, because I came to the realization that the man I love has let me believe he loved me even though he didn't, for who knows how long he's felt like this. He broke my trust. He didn't trust me enough to confide in me. To talk about this change when it started happening, and only bringing it up when it was too late. By hiding it for possibly months of our relationship, all the while saying he loved me, he hurt me so much more. I feel used. Used for my affections. I feel lost. The rug was swept under me, with no idea how he was feeling. I feel like I can't trust in his words, if he had lied about his feelings for so long. And most of all, I hate myself for not being able to blame him. I can only blame myself. I still love him, and that knowledge is breaking me. It's not the first time I've been told this. That I'm better off as a friend. Not the second, or third time either. With these experiences, I've come to believe I am just not enough. I'm not good enough as a lover. Only as a friend. And putting all my trust and love into someone, so many times, has drained me. Beside the overwhelming grief over my relationship, I feel apathetic and tired. So tired. I have depression, anxiety, abandonment issues, PTSD from an abusive childhood (narcissistic step fathers and an enabling mother who takes on those same traits), and panic attacks. I have to keep reminding myself to breathe, and eat, and take care of myself. But, every time I try to eat, I get nauseous. Everytime I try to sleep, it's fitful and nightmare fueled. Everytime I try to calm down, I'm wracked with sobbing and on the verge of hyperventilating. I haven't eaten much of anything, or slept in 3 days. I find myself writing down my thoughts and feelings, to keep myself grounded, to be organized. That's what I do, because anything else brings me more pain. I haven't been this fucked up since I was 15, and my ex made me out to be crazy, made me think I had imagined our entire relationship and they never loved me to begin with. Ever since, I question myself, and feel I'm delusional. I wake up panicked because I have no idea if I dreamt up my lover or if it happened. I couldn't trust my own memories. It screwed me up, and I keep having flashbacks to it. I keep fearing I imagined my boyfriend entirely, imagined his love and deluded myself into thinking anything was real to begin with. I want to stay grounded, but my head is swimming. Everytime I think I find my footing, I trip and fall back into a spiral of self hatred and despair. Most of all, for the first time since I was 12, I want to stop existing all together. I'm afraid to be left alone with those thoughts, so I've been staying with a friend. I'm a mess. I haven't cried in front of anyone, just by myself. I don't like to show emotional vulnerability to anyone but my partner. They're the one I opened up to, allowed myself to be vulnerable with, and now I clearly can't do that. I don't trust anyone right now, not even myself. Thank you for listening. I'm not going to die. Not sure if it's because I'm too weak to go through with it or strong enough to hold on. Regardless, I might as well live to suffer."
6,vulnerability,BreakUps,6 months post break up: Thoughts and updates ,1,i6pinb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i6pinb/6_months_post_break_up_thoughts_and_updates/,2020-08-10 05:33:37,"6 months post break up here. An update on my journey of healing and forgiveness. What can I say? Some days Im happy, and some days I feel like I took 20 steps back. A major theme in my healing journey is the process of forgiveness. Its so fucking hard sometimes. Not a day goes by where I dont think about her. Ive admitted my faults and took responsibility and blame for all of the wrong doings that I have contributed in an 8 year relationship. When I think of her, its not anger anymore. Resentment weighs so heavy on my heart, and its super easy to beat myself up for the things that Ive done. I truly forgive her for hurting me in the ways that she did, but most importantly, I find it much more challenging to forgive myself. A lot of us on here have tried to play the victim card, only to find out that sooner or later, playing the victim is something that you never want to indulge in. Too much pride and ego will lead to self sabotage. My message to you is to truly throw out the ego and exude love into your heart through your actions. The universe will reward you for it. Accept your faults, learn from them. I often get these strong urges to say sorry for the things that Ive done... but the thing is I have already done that. I wasnt expecting an apology back, because thats not where my intentions were when I reached out. My intentions were to express vulnerability, and truly face my problems head on. She hurt me bad, and that caused me to end it even though I didnt want to. Because I still love her. Im in the process of a spiritual awakening, and this journey is oh so fucking bumpy. Im grateful for my life and all of the blessings and lessons the universe has taught me so far. I recently found out that she still has ill will toward me even though she claimed to forgive me and has no resentment toward me. We havent spoken in a long time and she has a new boyfriend. Good for her! Honestly, at this point, I just pray that shes happy. I hope that hes treating her well. I just hope that she didnt rebound to numb her pain and insecurities, because we all deserve to be loved. Its just that you have to learn to truly love yourself and be okay with being alone before giving your love to someone else. Its clich, but its 100% true. I can vividly remember asking why she was cheating on me, and one of the reasons was because she was afraid of being alone. The fact that she was with someone new 1 month after our breakup sorta tells me that she didnt want to face that fear with courage. Solitude with yourself is essential to self-love, folks. Meditate, love with a good heart, and trust the process. 6 months strong here guys! Single as a Pringle! Its not easy, but its definitely worth it. Peace!"
7,vulnerability,BreakUps,Breaking up with a guy Im seeing and that I care deeply about. Help please,1,i6xwtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i6xwtp/breaking_up_with_a_guy_im_seeing_and_that_i_care/,2020-08-10 14:07:47,"Ive (32f) been seeing a guy (34m) casually over the past 4 months. He is a sensitive soul and has truly opened up and showed vulnerability. He knows I dont want a relationship but there are mutual feelings there between us. Long term, we are incompatible and I dont want to date someone with whom I dont see a future with. I have broken it off before however I contacted him because I truly missed him. Despite my loneliness and care for him, this needs to come to an end. Last time I did it over text which was recommended on here, however rather cold and it hurt him a lot. Hes the type of guy that needs to process feelings and I know for him doing it in person would be better, but I know he is going to have a hard time letting go. Do you have any tips? I am thinking of asking him to meet me at a coffee shop. This is really hard for me to do, I really do care about him and I know the feeling is mutual. I know however, that despite me saying I dont want a relationship, that he has fallen in love. This makes me sad but its going to be the best for both of us. I know this is going to hurt him deeply. I think he knows its coming but I also think a part of him thinks Im going to keep seeing him. When I saw him last night he started to tear up saying he hopes its not the last time he sees me. This is honestly causing me stress. He has bipolar and I know this is going to be very upsetting to him. Any tips on what to say? Please dont convince me other wise. Deep down, I know this is what I have to do. This honestly hurts so much because I deeply care for him :( TLDR breaking up with a guy that has fallen for me"

If I come back to the relationship, I want to give 100% forever, an idea that frightens me and I cant do it in this moment. Besides this, I understand you didnt want to highlight your problem with panic attacks, but often times in arguments you mention a state of vulnerability in order to soften me. I never do this, maybe because Im a boy, but this time was not easy for me either. I dont know how to explain myself better, I dont know if its better or not what I do right now or what Im saying, I dont know if Im gonna regret it or not in the future, but Ive always have chosen the other way, meaning to stay in the relationship, and I was never fully satisfied (Im telling you again dont find yourself any reasons). I really want to see how it is if things remain like this, and this month is not a reference to that I feel like a manipulative bitch. I just wanted to mention to him how bad I am. Im broken, I think I stepped in a big depression and cant get myself out of it. It is now day 18 of no contact, and Im relapsing again.... please somebody.. help me"

10,vulnerability,BreakUps,I (29m) need help internalizing healthy processing techniques after leaving my ex(29m),1,i7u6dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i7u6dn/i_29m_need_help_internalizing_healthy_processing/,2020-08-12 01:51:53,"So I have been struggling. It's been a few weeks since I ended things, and only one since I started a strict no contact. She often berated me whenever I would show vulnerability. Saying things like ""are you done being insecure now? Are you done?"". Now I'd like to point out. The ""insecurity"" she spoke of, was my desire to clarify the boundaries we had in our relationship when we started getting a little space from each other. She would instantly get angry when I started a conversation about it. Saying ""I thought this was all said and done, what's so unclear"" when the previous week she had said ""I'm having a stressful day and this conversation (on the same subject) is overwhelming can we just talk about this later?"". Also it got to the point where she outright lied (after I ended things, when we were talking and clearing the air) saying we had specific conversations about the boundaries for us while getting space. The clear boundaries she told me about were never mentioned. Not once. She never apologised for her behavior btw. Whenever I would bring up what she had done or said that hurt me she would act as if I was attacking her. I feel manipulated. For more than just the reasons above. Although I think they're easily enough to question her motives. My question is this, have any of you been Inna relationship with this sort of double speak/moving the goal posts/lying have taken place? Like covert manipulation, where there is a possibility that the perpetrator doesn't even know they're doing it? How did your experience go, were there things that you heard or did that made it easier to heal from it. Do you have any advice for me? TLDR; I ended things with my manipulative ex (that has narcissistic tendencies) a few weeks ago and just started no contact. Any advice on how to stay strong, or help rebuild my self worth/ability to trust romantic partners again after this would be much appreciated."
11,vulnerability,BreakUps,"Early on there are no lessons learned, just pain and confusion",1,i9ong9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/i9ong9/early_on_there_are_no_lessons_learned_just_pain/,2020-08-15 02:02:37,"I'm at that early point where everything I feel is raw emotion. Completely raw to the point that I don't even know who is to blame or why it ended. It's easy to fall into a pattern of telling myself all the reasons we were incompatible, the things i did wrong, the thing she did wrong. It's like a broken record in my head. We were compatible, but there were so many obstacles. Time, distance, work goals, life goals, spiritual goals. Both of us acting selfishly with our lives, while being selfless in our relationship. The feelings aligned beautifully...the humor, the ideas, the conversation, the sex...but our lives just grew further and further apart because of how much we both felt we needed to accomplish, and the lives we envisioned for ourselves. And then when I finally decided to show my vulnerability...I would move, I would marry her, I would make it work and humble myself as a good husband...it was too late. Maybe if I had given her that sooner, we could have built on what we had instead of rebuilding the ruins of what was. There were some core differences yes, but nothing we couldn't work through as partners, best friends, and lovers. Good sex, endless conversation, endless laughter. I've realized after years of dating those are what I value, and I just assumed we would fall back together into some sort of new understanding...having seen the misery of being apart, of missing a part of ourselves. And now I have to let go of all that hope i had that someday we'd find each other again. It's truly done and I'll have to start over. It's time to rebuild."
12,vulnerability,BreakUps,I did it.,1,ia96l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ia96l7/i_did_it/,2020-08-16 01:21:28,"I broke up with him yesterday after 6 months. Long post ahead from the dumpers perspective. So our primary form of communication was always phone/FaceTime. Two days in a row where he FaceTimed me just to talk about himself and his day, and didnt ask me once how I was doing. This was prevalent throughout our relationship the last few months. We always did what he wanted to do, he made all the decisions, etc. We never really talked about the *deeper* stuff, it all felt very surface level. One time in person, he said something about how hes always the one to initiate sex, but it was said in a very snippy matter, and I responded back yeah, but at least I always ask you questions. He then proceeded to ask me little questions all night long that were insignificant just to be obnoxious. Is the room too dark? Is the laptop screen tilted ok? Are you under enough blankets? Are you hungry? It was kind of funny, but it also felt like he was minimizing my concern and mocking me. He could have brought up the sex thing by saying something like hey, I have something I need to talk to you about thats been bothering me like an adult, but chose not to. Last week I asked if he appreciated me because it didnt feel that way. He said yes, of course, and that maybe he just doesnt ask me the questions I want to hear but still asks me other ones, like what do I want to eat for dinner. Im sorry, but that doesnt count. I want someone to prioritize me more, check in on me, ask me how Im DOING. The world is on FIRE and I am an essential worker on the frontlines. My stress level has gone up tenfold in the last few months. It always felt like I was grasping for more reassurance and validation, while he was ok being this happy, go lucky guy where nothing really phased him. I understand that I have an anxious attachment style, and that I definitely need to work on my own self-love instead of looking to someone else to save me. But I think my needs were pretty baseline when it comes to having a partnership. I really dont think I was asking for that much. He would always say things like youre dating such an awesome guy, such a stud, etc. Never did he tell me I was the awesome one, or that he felt lucky to be with me. But it was also confusing, cause early on he was talking about us getting married and having kids and all that. He would talk about it incessantly to the point where I had to draw a boundary because it was making me uncomfortable. How can you see marriage in our future yet not seem to really want to *know* me or appreciate me? So I show up to his place last night, he still doesnt ask me anything about myself, just says lets get food Im starving. It always felt like I was just someone to respond back to him as opposed to having a real back and forth. Anytime I would bring something up about myself, he would either divert it back to himself or not really know how to respond. I just dont think emotional vulnerability come easily to him. So Im visibly upset as I spent the entire car ride over to his house crying, and he does not seem to be picking up on my body language until my eyes well up again and he finally asks, whats wrong? I told him I didnt think I was happy in this relationship anymore, and that I was looking for more emotional availability. He admitted he has a hard time communicating on a deeper level, and said maybe it had to do with his upbringing. I told him I thought we had different goals for the future, as I really dont think I want kids, and he desperately does. He then told me about how he never really thought I was that into him because the few times he invited me out with his friends, I said no, so he thought I didnt care. Again, he had never voiced this concern before. We live 45 min away from each other and most of our relationship was spent at his place cause my roommates havent been comfortable having other people over because of the pandemic. The times he did invite me out, I either had just driven to his place the previous day or had work early in the morning the next day so I declined. I also dont think its the smartest thing to be socializing with other groups of people right now. Like, he invited me to a bbq over Memorial Day weekend and played beer pong with like 10+ other people, obviously unmasked. I chose not to go, because it seemed like an irresponsible move. Of course, in an alternate timeline I would have loved to meet his friends. But hello theres a horrible virus going around and were all being told to stay home. There was also this whole other issue I couldnt get past with one of his close female friends. I felt stupid bringing it up again because he once again, told me nothing ever happened between them. Then why was my gut constantly telling me otherwise? He was always joking that I was still in love with one of my exes, or that I probably was texting my other boyfriend if my guy friend texted me. All the meanwhile, hes frequently texting his female friend, making her playlists, etc. So I started thinking.. is he projecting his inappropriate behavior onto me? Whatever. Whats done is done. I do have trust issues but how can I not when he straight up told me hes a good liar early on. I got up to leave the room and head home and he told me we could hug it out. So we had a sad, long hug and I left. Cried in my car for a bit before I noticed him in my rear view outside, holding a t shirt I left at his place that he would always wear. Told me he thought Id want it back since I really liked it. We looked at each other for awhile, he told me to be well, and I drove off. Today, I feel... sad, guilty, but also relieved. In the end, I just dont think we were compatible, and thats ok. I could have communicated more clearly which is the part I feel guilty about, but the times I did, he still didnt hear me out. So its not like I didnt try. I dont think hes a bad guy by any means, but I just dont feel like we were on the same emotional level. Ill miss him a lot. I woke up and cried. He was the most fun I had in a very long time. He made me laugh so much. Our spark was instant and I feel like it was mostly rooted in physical attraction/intensity.. but unfortunately thats not sustainable forever. I want dumpees to know that its not always easy for the dumper. I went back and forth on this decision for awhile but ultimately decided I was feeling more stressed than I was happy, and thats not ok."
13,vulnerability,BreakUps,My closure,1,ib626p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ib626p/my_closure/,2020-08-17 12:51:08," This is my closure. Just so you know, I know everything. I know all of the lies. The manipulation. The secrets. The disrespect behind my back. The rude comments youve made about me to others. I know. Your behavior over the past 5 months has been nothing short of disappointing. In the 5 years I have known you, Ive never known you to be so cruel and cold. Well, thats not true. This is how you are to your family. But to me? Never would I have imagined it. Someone who has given you everything and more since day one. Someone who gave you chance after chance after chance, even when you didnt deserve it. But I thought, hes worth it. How wrong I was. The way you ended things was absolutely the most disrespectful and dishonest way possible. To be secretly planning to leave me behind my back. Never once bringing up or talking about the issues. Instead making plans to leave me alone, jobless, and completely broken in that apartment. It wasnt until I had the balls to put my foot down after months of being ignored and gaslighted that I asked okay, what is going on here?. I had to pull it out of you, because you were not man enough to admit it, or even talk about it for that matter. Those couple months were the WORST of my entire life. Your actions caused me to feel so unloved, unwanted, and unimportant. I cried myself to sleep almost every night. And you didnt even care or notice. Probably because you were too busy texting and flirting with another girl from work, or because you were passed out drunk by 8pm every night. On top of your behavior, you constantly gaslighted me about a situation that turned out to be true. Not only were you dishonest and disloyal to me and our relationship, but you lied to me about it. Multiple times. How funny that I see photos of your arms wrapped around the same girl I asked you about multiple times while we were living together, and while we were on a break figuring things out. I asked you to be honest, even if it would hurt me. But once again, you were too cowardly to do that. Instead I find out that youve been sleeping together, taking weekend trips together, and God knows what else. And even after all that, I gave you ANOTHER chance to come clean. We had no strings attached, my stuff was moved out, we were over, you were free as you put it. And you still chose to lie. Liar. How does it feel to have that label? Once a liar, always a liar. And now that will follow you forever. Moving on from that. When I came out to get my belongings, you completely manipulated me. You had been doing what you were doing with whoever, and you took advantage of me. You took advantage of my emotional vulnerability. You wrote me a letter that was full of absolute BULLSHIT. Do you know that I rolled my eyes when I read it? Thats how I knew it was over for me. How I couldnt believe your words because of your past actions, lies, and manipulation. You said I hope we can be together one day by fate. No. That takes work. That takes hard work, and unconditional love. Two things that you are incapable of providing for someone else. You want things to come so easy to you, and dont want to work for it. Yet, you treat those who give you everything like absolute shit. You did that to me. And you know what, I let you. But no more. This is absolutely the last fucking straw for me. You are not the same person you once were. You are a different version. A version that is spiraling down a deep and dark path. You have emotionally abused me for years. Beating me down. Calling me controlling crazy annoying saying I have no friends saying Im too dependent on you you constantly put me down for having a close relationship with my family. A family who took you in as one of their own family even when you put in minimal to no effort. Are you jealous? Are you bitter? They were there for you. They did so much for you. They paid for plane tickets, Christmas presents, were there to support you when you needed it, treated you like fucking family. And you didnt appreciate any of it. You talk a big game about how you want a family and to be a part of one. Well you had that chance. And all you did was act cold, and lie to them. You lied to them when you said you would take care of me. You lied when you said you were ready to move to the east coast and start a family. All lies. Once again you are a liar and everyone knows it. I could sit here and call you every nasty name in the book. But the best thing I can say is that you are a disappointment to me. I thought you were different. You act as if you have it all together to everyone else. But I know you. I know you dont. And I never held that against you. I supported you through your ups. Through your downs. Your highs. Your lows. Your alcoholism. Your mood swings. I forgave you each and every time because I ducking accepted you for who you were and how you were. But I also enabled you to think that I would always be there for you, no matter how badly you treated me. I let it happen. And in one of the lowest, confusing times of my life YOU WERE NOT THERE FOR ME. I had no job, Covid was in full swing, I was depressed and anxious from being in the house, and from the sickness I felt in my gut that you were being dishonest with me. And guess what. I was right. In my lowest time you said oh its fine, youll get over it or stop worrying about it just do xy and z. You did not support me or comfort me once in that time. You were cold and distant and selfish. Even after 5 years of me being there for you through fucking everything. After everything we went through we decided to take a break. I was hysterical because I thought it was all my fault. And you let me believe that. And you convinced yourself of that too. You said to me I dont know how Ill feel in two months. I might miss you, or I might hate you. And there I knew you were manipulating me. You were going to manipulate the situation so that you could be the victim. Just like you are in every situation. Work. Your parents. Everything. Any way. You let me say over and over how sorry I was. And you never once apologized for any of your actions. Just your circumstance and situation. Im sorry Im so toxic. It runs in the family. Im sorry my parents abandoned me and made it easy for me to turn my emotions off. Its not my fault my parents did this to me Well I felt nothing when my mom cheated on my dad Well I found my ex flirting with other guys, so I just ignored it did you know all my relationships ended because I moved? Every relationship Ive had was toxic its my fault my parents were toxic?. In every statement YOU are the victim. But heres the cold hard fucking truth: YOU are making your own choices. You are making bad choices and blaming it on your past. Rather than rising from the shit you were raised in and exposed to, you are laying it in. You are rolling in it and asking why you smell like it. You are responsible for your choices. And youve made them. Stop blaming your past on what you choose to do now. You are a grown ass adult man. But you still act like a whiny child crying on their bed. Grow. The. Fuck. Up. Take accountability. Be responsible. Not only in your professional life, but your personal life as well. As I said, I, as well as many others are disappointed with you and your actions, behaviors, and choices. You know why? Because you act as if you are above it. And you can be. When you decide to start being a mature, responsible man. Not a cowardly boy. This is my peace. Knowing none of this ever had anything to do with me. I know I have my all. Everything I had. Yes, I made mistakes, but I also forgave you, and supported you through yours. And you could not do the same for me. You are not empathetic towards others. You are clouded by your own selfish, victim mindset. I hope you figure out how to treat people. How to appreciate others and what they do for you. How to be a man. How to be a decent person. Because of not, you are in for a long, lonely, depressing, unfulfilling life. Good luck. I am done. Do not involve me in anything anymore. Good. Bad. Ugly. Or great. I am throwing in the towel. For good. Goodbye."
14,vulnerability,BreakUps,"For anyone who is experiencing their first heartbreak and the loss of their first love, I have some reflections on mine, 20 years on..",1,iegqy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/iegqy3/for_anyone_who_is_experiencing_their_first/,2020-08-22 21:19:10,"Twenty years ago, from the ages of 13-17, i was madly in love with a boy. He was my first love, my first heartbreak. I want to share this story with any younger readers to assure you that you WILL survive your first heartbreak, even though it feels like you are *literally* dying right now. My feelings for my first love were like an explosive, unstable atomic bomb that could decimate entire countries with its ferocity. I felt like my entire body, mind and my heart would explode from the intensity of my love. I wanted to cry, laugh, scream all at once. He was my classmate at school and we shared the same circle of friends. He was, at the time, a shy, sweet, smart, diligent boy. I loved those aspects of his personality. It's what made me fall in love with him. We dated for 15 months from the ages of 15-16. During our relationship we were stuck in a cycle of push/pull. This had a huge effect on my emotions, ultimately, this is probably the main reason I was so desperately in love with him. He would push me away when he was depressed and it would devastate me, enrage me, upset me but ultimately, it would deepen my desire for his attention, my addiction to his love and for him. Then just when I felt rejected or abandoned, he would come out of his fog and he would pull me right back in with affection, emotional declarations of loving me, wanting me, and missing me. During these periods he was an attentive, loving, affectionate boyfriend. I was addicted to the good times. I was addicted to the crumbs of love he would throw my way. This was the era before social media or mobile phones, so talking in person, on the phone or via letter was the only form of open communication available. We had terrible communication, even for teenagers. I was incapable of telling him what I needed or wanted. I was always so acutely aware of my vulnerability due to how I felt about him. I was shy, too embarrassed, too insecure, and too self-conscious to really express myself properly. I would wait for his cues.. I was always so conscious of not smothering him, not appearing needy. I was unable to confront him with my concerns about how he was so hot and cold with me. I was terrified of his rejection. Did he love me? Maybe, maybe not. I think perhaps at a certain point he may have loved me. He told me he loved me first, he told me often. I don't know if he meant it or he was going through the motions of what a relationship is ""meant"" to be like. I think he liked me a lot. I think he enjoyed my company. One thing is for certain, he never loved me like I loved him. At the dying stages of our relationship we had email access. He ghosted me for weeks over the school break. I knew what was coming, I felt it in my bones, in my gut. I was miserable for weeks, waiting and anticipating what he was going to do. He eventually had the decency to break up with me to my face just before we returned to school. I held it together in front of him. I never let him see me cry. I never wanted him to know how much he hurt me; I would not allow myself to shed a single fucking tear in front of him. I waited for him to leave, I then burst into sobbing, uncontrollable, choking tears in front of my friends that wouldnt stop. I cried like I was dying. I felt like I was dying. In that moment, I could have died. It would have been sweet relief. I cried like that in private for months. A month after we broke up, he dated my friend right in front of me for three months. I couldn't get away from them. We had school together. We had the same friends. And I realised: this wasnt some noble, kind, sensitive guy who cared about my feelings. This was a horny teenage boy who didnt really give a shit about me. He didnt really think of me or what it would do to me, so it reconfirmed that he didnt care. My heart was crushed all over again, I thought being dumped was bad. *This* devastated me to my *core*. Because not only was I not good enough, someone else was a better option. The pain tore into my heart so badly that I felt like I couldnt breathe, like no matter how much oxygen I inhaled I couldnt get enough. It was quite clear that he had moved on before he had even broken up with me. That he clearly was over me well before I even knew he was. A lot of my pain and suffering also stemmed from the fact that he never apologised. He never followed up the breakup talk with checking in on me or attempting to ensure my welfare. He never gave me any indication of having felt bad for hurting me. He never attempted to redeem himself so we could still be friends. There was no remorse. There was no regret. There was *nothing*. He carried on behaving like nothing had happened. He immediately focused on getting a new girlfriend. His clear disinterest in my well-being and welfare was another huge sucker punch to my aching heart. He never spoke to me about our breakup ever again. Not once. It felt like he erased our entire relationship, like I was always just his friend. . That I was never that important to him. It had confirmed my biggest, deepest most terrifying fear: I didnt matter all that much to him. I couldn't understand *Why the fuck did he not want me?* Other boys asked me out during this time, several in fact. I turned every single of them down because my heart was still with him. It took me almost a year to get over the heartbreak. In the end, it was strangely my friendship with him, his own behaviour and who he became in later adolescence that helped me move on. He lost interest in school, he was depressed, he rebelled, he had family problems and as a result, he became a whole new person andhe started turning into a bit of a dick. I finally saw him in a very different light. Eventually, I noticed that I started to find him annoying and was quite repulsed by some of his behaviour. I knew that I no longer wanted his affection or attention. He wasnt the same shy, sweet, smart boy I fell in love with. I went off to study at a prestigious university, while he knocked about and didnt pursue any further education. He started a menial job and to this day, I believe he remains in that same job. We remained friends into our 20s and it was clear to me that he was now someone I would *never*, *ever* dream of dating. I feel a little ashamed to admit that I felt he was well, beneath me. He had no ambition, no drive, and no desire to better himself. I was quite astonished with how much he had changed and who he had become. Despite the trauma and the agony, I have no regrets. This heartbreak was a defining event in my life. It taught me to speak up for myself, it taught me to only pursue relationships with people who were committed, 100% invested in me. It taught me to recognise guys who maybe weren't into me as much as I was into them. I never pursued an emotionally unavailable guy ever again. I remember my love for him, my obsession and the subsequent heartbreak, the pain, the suffering acutely. Even 20 years later. But it made me who I am today. Healing takes time. It takes patience and it takes commitment. Things will get better. Slowly but surely you will smile again, laugh again and love again. You are worth more than the value someone who doesn't love you places on you. You are worth a lot to many people who you are yet to meet in your life. You have a long future ahead of you. Please don't waste it worrying about someone who doesn't see your worth."
15,vulnerability,BreakUps,Would you want a letter?,1,ifpy13,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ifpy13/would_you_want_a_letter/,2020-08-25 00:24:02,"Hi, dumper here. I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 6 months for a myriad of reasons: his lack of emotional vulnerability, huge communication issues, narcissistic tendencies, lack of empathy, trust issues. Lol. I swear he had good qualities which is why I feel heartbroken. He was the most fun Ive had with a guy in years, and we were always making each other laugh. We had a very strong romantic attraction, which is probably what kept us together for as long as it did. We had a long phone conversation two days after the breakup where he explained his side of things and why he thinks he is the way he is. He thinks it stems from a lot of early childhood trauma. I think he would benefit from some serious therapy, but thats not my place to say. And I dont think hes going to seek it out. I went to his place to pick up my things the other day and we had quite an awkward goodbye. I wanted to thank him for the good times but it just felt so weird I wanted to leave. Now, Im tempted to send him a short gratitude text.. but I cant tell if its more self-serving than it is for his benefit. To all the dumpees, how would you feel if your ex sent you a text thanking you for your time together and saying how they care for you? Would it feel like rubbing salt in the wound or would it be nice?"
16,vulnerability,BreakUps,Why do you think some of us love people who treat us terribly?,1,ig5x7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ig5x7p/why_do_you_think_some_of_us_love_people_who_treat/,2020-08-25 15:15:35,"Most people fall out of love when people treat them like shit. But for those of us who don't, why? I think it's because we accept that treatment and we fall out of love for stupid reasons. We lose attraction for reasons we shouldn't and love despite their toxicity. We do this because we don't understand why we are attracted to people. All the unhealthy things that attract us. You'll stay with a cheater and even claim you love him, eventhough this should cause you to lose interest. You will make excuses for a verbally or emotionally abusive partner. But you'll lose interest when they show genuine interest, pursue you, want to spend more time with you than you're used to, show vulnerability. You just never made the connection before. You chose to be mistreated because you think that's love. That's all you've ever known."

But beginning of may in lockdown she posted on her Instagram story and I replied with some backward sarcasm and we had a great conversation. So its all over FaceTime and phone calls (lockdown eh) We started speaking on the phone, first call was 5 hours, great chem, Second was the same again didnt realise, when you click time flies. When we FaceTimed each other for the first time she dropped her guard to me and told me stuff she went though and said shes never told anybody this(not even her best friends or a close family member) I was really empathetic and made her feel good about herself and caring. Two weeks later or so I dropped mine, again she was very empathetic to me and cared and said the nicest things Ive heard(which I havent told anyone either) something happens in my personal life at home whilst Im stuck at my uni accom but still affected me. My emotionally vulnerability is exposed, I turned to her because of the trust and confinement we see in each other. She was there for me, also said the way that you are with me and the way you treat me bringing me up and shes getting upset too. Shows the feelings towards one another. A week later I admit that I like her, we both admit were emotionally attached to each other. Admit its the empathy confinement trust and caring which what it was (its like 5-6 weeks by now) and I said I wanna progress into something serious with you and she said I didnt wanna get my hopes up because I didnt know you were on the same page. But now I can. So yeah great June was fuckjng great. I used to say: youre the most beautiful, I look at you and I just look at youre heart and it takes over thats whats the most beautiful, this connection weve made it so natural but unnatural with how quick it was. But its real. I said I want to give her my heart I owe her it and I just wanna make her happy, I appreciate her, shes worth a lot to me, I finally feel Ive expressed my.Emotions freely (by the time we are opening up more about our pasts/secrets) She used to say: I look at other guys and they just seem ugly but you seem the most beautiful, this connection I would be hurt so much if I was to ever let it go, I appreciate you in my life and I trust you, you make me so happy this is the happiest Ive ever been, she started crying over FaceTime once too with the way I told her how I feel. She also said my dad is my solemate said I have the same qualities as her dad. Said I could meet your mum over FaceTime with the way I feel so close to you. I was attentive to her self love issues and other issues too. Spoke about having sex and sexual banter too. I trust you like no other human on this planet. So we met up in July after ease of lockdown, first thing we do is kiss. Spent all day just sitting down talking laughing joking around kissing. Lovely day. Then towards the end of it I told her Im in love with her, she kisses me and whatever cant stop, said to me I want to give you the reassurance that there is that same feeling for you there really is, i just dont wanna say it yet. Beautiful 4 days later shes takes off the label of Bf and Gf and says it didnt sink in- she has really bad self love issues and esteem btw. I was like we said this and weve waited a month for this. Cant remember what she said, she said my feeling towards you havent changed nor will they ever. Great 3 days later from that ^^ she calls me in the night saying Im not good for you, youre so much of a better person than me, I dont deserve to be with you crying her eyes out, I uplift her by saying youre amazing I appreciate you youre worth so much to me and I fallen in love with an person. She broke my heart by Turning around to say, but I dont love you like that I love you like a friend - that broke my heart; I started crying said Im sorry Im not the right person for you- she turned round and said you are you really are the right person. After an hour or so she asked for space. So 3 weeks later- we Spoke- she didnt call me once, text me once, think about me once, whilst I was calling her, texting her, checking how she was. -that right there hurt. She didnt care. We spoke she said I had such deep feelings for you. Ironic- had indicating she dropped them deep feelings how the fuck is that possible?? Either she never had them, lied or fucked someone else, btw last time she had sex was two years ago. She Also said if I lost this connection it would kill me youre the most important person to me- how when you didnt message me once in three weeks. She honestly destroyed my self esteem, from feeling I was appreciated worth and cared for to feeling like shit. She said I cant be in a relationship but I need you in my life- Im not no simp whos gonna be a sideline or a backup. I said I would have but yeah shit changes when a person you love destroys you with their lack of actions. Actions speak louder than words."
18,vulnerability,BreakUps,It wasnt just me.,1,igzcv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/igzcv0/it_wasnt_just_me/,2020-08-27 00:00:01,"My ex called me manipulative, selfish, undesirable due to my emotional reaction, compared me to a three-year-old, told me Im not what hes looking for, was gaslighting me into believing that my search for connection is somehow needy, I wasnt up to his standards etc. I took to heart all that he said and it hurt. A lot. I did realize that my self-esteem needed work and I had to give up on being so attached to other peoples opinions that I would resort to people-pleasing. Im so much freer now. Being with him was difficult. He made it sound like all of the difficulty was my fault. His problems with FOMO, vulnerability, communication, lack of emotional connection... it wasnt just me, but he never admitted to that. Yesterday I was spending time with someone (someone I could be attracted to) that made me remember that its not supposed to be that hard. There are so many people out there who appreciate and like me regardless of my flaws. I need not pretend with them or try to be someone different, someone better. Of course I did all that I could to improve the parts of me that werent ideal, but my ex couldnt see that - and thats no longer my problem."
19,vulnerability,BreakUps,Goodbye.,1,iitajv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/iitajv/goodbye/,2020-08-30 00:29:36," Dear X- I know you know that I can't stop thinking about the person I thought that you were. All of my friends tell me that I'm in love with a fantasy version of you. Yet, I was there that first night when you asked me to go swimming with you. I remember the cool summer air, the soft smile on your face as we made small talk. It was a real experience when you had me over to your place, when you cooked me dinner and invited me to sleep in your bed. We woke up together, we explored nature, you told me you were falling for me. Currently, I still see you in my life, once or twice a week. We sit in the same room for 8 hours a day. I'm busy living out a dream of mine, you're mostly reading books about radical politics you dont fully understand. I look up at you and I remember the experiences we shared, I wonder if you remember them too, but it's left to my imagination because now we don't even speak unless you need to hand me the phone or ask me a work related question. When you said bye to me the other night and put your hand on my shoulder, I cried after you left. I want you to know that. I want you to know I can't stop thinking about it. I want you to know youve made it hard for me simply to breathe when I kiss you the most. I want you to know I'd give anything just to come over to your place again and share another meal, to share myself and my life with you. Yet, I already told you that after you took back what you said, and you didn't care. Youve lost the privilege of knowing those parts of me. Sometimes I wonder if you have supernatural power. When you looked at me when we were lovers, I felt higher than I've ever been. I was intoxicated with the intimacy, the vulnerability, the excitement of what was to come as our lives grew together. ""This is not casual.."", you whispered to me. You were right, it wasn't. It was downright manipulative. For as much pain as I'm in, for as hopeless as I feel, I don't deserve to feel this way. I am better than sulking in my room, typing posts on reddit to try to cope with the way I feel. I haven't gone on any dates since you called things off with me because I just can't bring myself to. Believe me though, I will. I'll find someone who accepts and appreciates me exactly was I am who also pushes me to grow, something you just weren't willing or capable of. I'm still in love with you, but I won't be forever. Thank you for what you taught me during the most intense, short lived summer fling of my life. I want you to be happy, I want you to find peace, I want you to find a partner whom you adore fully. I wish that it were me, but I understand it can't be. This is goodbye. Now get out of my head."
20,vulnerability,BreakUps,This is my first journal post to you,1,ijp3pz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ijp3pz/this_is_my_first_journal_post_to_you/,2020-08-31 11:43:59,"Im thinking of this sub as a place where I can journal. I have other posts here, and there will be more. Sorry if it looks annoying. Its been almost 3 weeks since I last saw you. Its been almost one week since you blocked me. At this point, Ive gone from sobbing everyday to now anger.. and sobbing everyday. Its exhausting to cry all the time and so intensely. Im not sure what exactly I did so wrong to deserve this complete silence out of absolute nowhere without warning. I wish you could tell me so I could fix it. Before we moved out of our apartment to two separate cities, we spent a month+ going camping and talking about how it would be difficult, but that anything was possible. If it didnt work, no hard feelings, but maybe being apart like that for a little while was exactly what we needed. We could have seen more clearly and taken a little time to ourselves. Thats what I did anyway, and I realized youre the reason for my life. Youre my soulmate. Youre everything Ill ever want or need. Im not perfect, I was doing the best I could at the time by making the decision to not move back to your city with you. I felt it was time for me to be with my fam for a bit. I havent been around them for an extended period in years. Please understand, I needed to go home for a while. But in that time I knew you were the only thing I wanted. By that point though, you stopped responding to me. Why? I still cant understand what happened in your mind and how you fell out of love with me overnight. We had such a special relationship. Was it always a picnic? Not always, but the overwhelming majority of it was a picnic on the best and most sunny day of my life. Remember when we drove to the beach that day in January to have that picnic? We were so excited about it. I miss being excited with you about life and all the day-to-day events that may seem insignificant on the surface. But they werent insignificant to meyou made them heaven on earth. Last week I flew to your city to stay with my dad, hoping to make it work with you. I came willing and ready to stay for months at a time here, and maybe a month or so at home to be with the fam. You werent really answering by this point, but I held out hope that Id get to see your beautiful face and hear your voice in person. The voice that calmed me down when I would have a panic attack. The one that told me I was your person, and that told me you wanted to be married to me one day. I know I said I wasnt sure I believed in marriage. But youve made me believe in it because YOU believe in it. I used to always tell you I love when you love things. That was so true and forever will be. If marriage is what you wanted, marriage is what you would have gotten. You were so sad I wasnt moving back to your city with you. I was sad too which I see I didnt express enough. Maybe if I did show that vulnerability, Id still have you. You taught me how to empathize; I was never good with that before you. You basically taught me how to feel in general. I remember after about a year or so of us being together how I became overwhelmed with how many emotions I noticed myself feeling. That was because of you and how you loved me so fully. Being in quarantine with you was literally the best time in my life. Did I need my space? Yeah for an hour or so every day, but when all is said and done, that was a time in my life that can never be matched. Being stuck inside with the love of my life. We cooked every day a beautiful meal together, we watched a show every night, we talked about your day at work even though I knew how it went because I could hear you all day at the table 10 feet away from me. I want that again. I want to go to bed with you at night again. I want to hear the good and the bad about your day again. Heres a challenge for you: I know that your friends probably got into your head a bit about me. Friends usually only tell friends about the bad timestheres not many people I know that send a weekly wrap-up of how good the week was with the significant other. But thats the truth, we had a model relationship for the majority of the time. My mom even noticed and would say things. She said how if my brother and his now ex-wife were on the same wavelength like how we were, they probably wouldnt have got divorced. So I challenge you, to quiet your mind for a minute about what your friends say, and remember the good times. Those meant something too. And those outnumber the bad times by many orders of magnitude. What about those? Those times want your attention too. Theyre screaming your name with my voice for you to notice them and feel them in your heart. You know my Reddit name so I hope you get curious about me one day and look me up and read this. Every text I get I look quickly to see if its you telling me you love me and miss me. Remember the frame you got me of us? It said: Love is patient, love is kind, love is forever, yours and mine. I know youre not mine anymore, but Ill always be yours. And Ill always be waiting for you. If we dont meet again in this life, Ill be waiting for you in the next. I love you forever and beyond."
21,vulnerability,BreakUps,Trying to make sense of the abuse and destruction of our love,1,hkofzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hkofzq/trying_to_make_sense_of_the_abuse_and_destruction/,2020-07-04 04:38:54,"I have to write this out to gain perspective on what I have been through. Any feedback is much appreciated. It's a long one though so I don't really expect anyone to get through it all. Two year long distance relationship ended last week. I am absolutely devastated. I totally love and adore this guy. His soul is the most beautiful thing I have ever come across. I really feel he's the love of my life. Sadly, he's quite traumatised and hasn't received the right level of care, and oh it's just so sad to me. Plus, I'm equally as traumatised in my own way. I find it tragic our trauma and life can ruin what would otherwise be something so beautiful :( I don't even have the energy to write this, but I have to, to get out all the guilt and shame that is NOT mine, that he poured into me. I absolutely know who I am. I have worked hard for over half my life in therapy and self-therapy to understand my trauma, habits, and behaviours. I know how much hard work I put into communicating vulnerably, kindly, lovingly. I know I'm not an abuser. He would like to believe that I am. Did I regress into an abusive communication style because of the pressure I was under? Absolutely. Is it my responsibility? Yes. Am I truly sorry and remorseful? 100%. Unfortunately though, after feeling so broken down and exhausted, I fell into his trap of admitting that I was his abuser, and I feel so sad that I betrayed myself in that way. Esp. because it means he can justify his discarding of me and NOT showing up/working on the relationship/taking any responsibility. He can just write me off as another asshole girl who fucked him over, without ever looking in the mirror himself. I have been so self-loathing this past week, as if I'm this horrible person, but I have to remember that manipulation and gaslighting are very powerful tools and I cannot be blamed. At least I know I stood up for myself until the very end, and I wasn't going to be twisted out of shape. I have been through this shit too many times to not know better at this point. So HERE I STAND, strong and resilient, KNOWING how kind and loving I truly am. All that matters is me, and that I am developing beyond this codependency and naivety. It was very difficult to have a calm, rational discussion about anything. At the start, I really tried hard to (I even would get pen and paper and reflect and summarise everything he said), but it seemed he just wasn't ever available for serious resolution. Even when I put us through couples counselling, he just wasn't available. He just seemed so hostile and passive-aggressive. So much repression, of course it was going to come out later. I totally called it early on, even tried to warn him, but nope, nothing would give. We totally triggered each other, apparently all the time. He repressed and bottled things so much, yet still giving off this ""I forgive and forget everything"" vibe. It was confusing, because he acted so nice on one hand, but his coldness and lack of empathy also shone through, especially during the most important times - when he'd make me cry. It was reminiscent of an abusive relationship 10 years prior, so I was constantly tense and on edge, which lead to behaviours like shouting and cursing. I found myself totally regressing into a childish version of myself, and I felt he even encouraged that. The empowered adult woman I was building for years had gone, and I found myself manipulated into being childish, angry and abusive. I felt that for him there was a pay off to me being this way. I told him countless times throughout the relationship that I felt he was creating this abusive kind of bond between us, that I felt he had this narrative in his mind and was doing anything to create a certain dynamic between us. (Has anyone else ever felt this, because I seriously think I'm going crazy. Then again, two of my close friends - one who does have BPD - have validated my experience and said they know what I mean when it comes to this.) I'm proud of him because he eventually got to a point of saying this: *This at the root is all about ego and insecurity. I may not have wanted to admit it but I do seek validation from our relationship and I end up putting all that pressure on us and on you, as a result. Maybe you have your issues to work on but I can see how I've been using that as as an excuse to not step forward. I'm afraid of making mistakes, of getting it wrong. I'm not being in control and empowered. I'm being stuck in victim mentality. I do not intend to manipulate, but I ended up doing that.* *All of the things I complain about are merely symptoms of something I'm inadvertently creating in order to avoid facing the fact that showing up and pushing myself out of my shell is uncomfortable and scary. This is probably what you've been meaning all along.* *I know where I need to focus and I just uncovered a blindspot. Thanks for helping me see. I love you. I'm sorry for being immature.* My understanding of who he truly is, beyond the mental illness: kind, loving, supportive, understanding, honest, loyal, trustworthy, dependable, smart, funny, charming, cool, caring, sexy, sweet, fun, sharp, interesting, sensual, cute, silly, forgiving, accepting, nonjudgmental, self-accepting, confident, and an absolute gem of a human being. He really is so wonderful and has helped me heal so much in my life. This is who he is. My understanding of who he is when he's mentally unwell/in his trauma: emotionally unstable (personality disorder? CPTSD?), stubborn, defensive, manipulative, selfish, cold, withholding, antagonistic, provoking, goading, blaming, shaming, victim, self-pity, self-loathing, projecting, sensitive, overthinking, hellbent on creating drama. Full of shame, great at masking and repressing his negative emotions. Doesn't communicate his thoughts/feelings in the moment, bottles things up, doesn't allow for intimacy/resolution, and then it all explodes into what was our break-up. Avoidant, emotionally/physically/socially anorectic, insecure, fragile ego, and toxic. He is aware of many of these traits, but he acts powerless to change it all, just believes that he 'is not good enough'. I am pretty sure he probably views me in both these ways too, and he'd be right about much of it. Thing is, instead of holding it all IN too much like he does, I let it all OUT too much. **That's the thing about this kind of dynamic though, isn't it - the person who shouts the loudest, is the abuser. Because you can see it, you can hear it, you can't deny it. But what about that silent kind of abuse, that's more subtle and insidious, often hidden behind a soft and gentle exterior?** My biggest issues in our relationship: \- Ever since I met him, he seemed cold, detached, empty, as if he wasn't present and didn't enjoy all the beauty/fun of life with me. I tried to be understanding that he had experienced significant trauma in his childhood/life, and I loved and supported him anyway. But then it got too much... So many moments that could have be filled with romance, love, connection were...actually just disappointing. He just... wasn't really there. And I took this personally, it made me feel that he didn't enjoy his time with me, or his time at all... Who wants someone who isn't present? I just wanted his vigor, energy, love, confidence. Unfortunately, MY issue was that I presented my dissatisfaction with a whole heap of resentment, grimacing, impatience, and rudeness - probably because I found his dissociative/cold state VERY triggering. He looks back on all these situations and thinks I was just being abusive and horrible, but he can't seem to see how frustrating it is to date someone who walks around like a phantom. I just wanted a fun, light-hearted, happy time :(. I know he did too. We both contributed to it sucking, but I feel like all that blame was put on me. I just wish he could have been like, OKAY, I hear her complaint, time to change this! And he did make so many efforts, but... It still felt like he was really distant. My issue though, is that maybe I overreacted to this, to the point where he actually shut down and felt discouraged. He says so, but then again he needs to take responsibility for shining his amazing light on the world. He's hiding away, and it's frustrating... but I should have been more encouraging and supportive. It was just hard. \- I felt so undesired, unwanted, and rejected at times (he felt this way too). We both traumatised each other sexually in some ways. Usually I'd turn away, cry, and just sigh or something. I felt instead of looking me in the eyes and trying to get some emotional intimacy flowing, he just took it personally, got defensive, and ended up hurting me even more. I felt so hurt in my most vulnerable moments (he did too). We tried working on this in couples counselling, but it just seemed to make it worse. I know I could TOTALLY GO THERE with him, but I felt he was so held back (I guess I was too). Like we could only get so far, and then we'd close up again. Maybe that's the effect of trauma on us. I never had him consistently, always... I had him in moments (again, he felt that way too). And instead of really supporting him at all times, I became felt so frustrated that my needs went unmet, and I took it personally as if he didn't want to meet them. I absolutely became SUCH an asshole because of this. I mean, who wouldn't, if you feel that your boyfriend doesn't want you? My confidence was absolutely crushed, I came to feel so unattractive (he did too). I have my own body image issues that got in the way (again, he did too...). I was expecting him to be more 'aggressive' and 'take me', but I couldn't appreciate that isn't his style. Oh it was just a mess. The annoying thing about all this is that I WANT HIM SO BAD and I know he feels the same way. Our chemistry and passion is AMAZING, we have such an exciting psychosexual dynamic, but we just can't seem to get over our trauma and demons. I just became so aggressive and mean, but the focus is entirely on that, and it doesn't feel right. So I'm taking what's mine, working with it, and giving him back his share. I wish he could have done more emotional translation to really hear that his girl just wanted him so bad. That's it, that's all. I just wanted him! Why couldn't he trust that? Can't he see that I was in so much pain and all I ever wanted was his love, affection, attention? He says he wanted that, but did he really? I just wish he could just communicate with me, and know that anger and negative emotions isn't the end of the world. Every time we have disagreed and actually discussed it (seems rare), it ended up with us being SO much closer and connected. I really wish he could have been open to that all the time. No point wishing though, is there? Forget the what-ifs. I want this guy more than I've ever wanted anyone. I just hate that he's written me off and let me go. I thought we were both invested in this process of healing and developing TOGETHER. That's why I was able to let go so much and just get into all the crazy with him - thinking that we'd be there for each other through thick and thin. I guess in the end it's not up to us to heal/fix each other, we have to go away and do that ourselves... Plus, it's exhausting. And I asked for SPACE, but that didn't mean I wanted him gone. And now he's gone and it's over. I feel so blindsided, he acted like he was totally in and committed, and then he can just up and leave like this like it's nothing. How unfair that he didn't give us ANY opportunity to properly resolve our issues. The most hurtful part of it all was after I sent these long voice messages explaining how it's ALL my fault, he sent me back SUCH a hurtful response, absolutely crushing my heart. I was always so vulnerable, and each time he'd take that vulnerability and crush me with it. He even said he should have fucked my housemate in his response. God, that hurt so much. He said I'm a 'sad pathetic broken little girl' and just all sorts of horrible things. I didn't deserve that. But maybe I did. I know I was just as hurtful, even more at times. I know he's hurt and angry at my own behaviours, but that's how he justifies his own hurtful behaviour, and it's not fair. All I ever asked for was honesty and to just talk to me. I was so supportive, loving, generous, and I could have SO BEEN THERE FOR HIM! I feel he treated me like an enemy! I did everything I could to prove I could be trusted, I gave him my absolute heart and soul, for what!? For him to tell me ""I should have fucked your housemate"", that he wants to go meet someone else. Some vague, jealous-making bullshit during the break-up about that one AirBnB guest who walked around in her panties? Or that he lied about some chick who he basically emotionally cheated on me with? Apparently he said they were in bed together and she came onto him, then he went onto say during the break-up that this was actually over the phone and it didn't happen? What the FUCK? I have no idea what to believe anymore. I don't get it, I only ever encouraged him to be honest and open with me, like I was with him. Never once did I lie, never once did I even sit with another guy, never entertained ANYTHING other than a relationship with him. Tired of these guys who act like they're so faithful and honest. Just be REAL WITH ME! It's like some people just can't imagine that someone could truly love, accept, cherish them - like it's not possible, or they just can't trust it. It's heartbreaking to me. They deserve so much love, and he deserves my love. But I just can't go on like this, it's really been damaging me. He made me feel bad for talking badly about other people, but when we broke up, I immediately saw those people with loving eyes. It's like all my fear, hurt, anger went onto others because I couldn't safely put it all on him. This relationship has really taken a lot out of me. In my foolish hopeless romantic head I still love him and I still want to make it work. I don't want to give up, I never would have. And maybe that's my problem. Maybe I need to let go and find someone who loves themselves enough, who can freely accept the deep, passionate and unending stream of amazing love I can offer. I want to believe that the soul and heart are all that matters, and all this other stuff is just nonsense. But it's not. It's SO IMPORTANT. I can't keep denying what I deserve and most need."
22,vulnerability,BreakUps,Seeing your ex yearn after a breakup...all the time and not speaking and pretending to not see each other,3,hkt77s,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hkt77s/seeing_your_ex_yearn_after_a_breakupall_the_time/,2020-07-04 09:23:50,"I dont know why Im posting this, I just need someone to talk to, someone to listen. Please dont be cruel. I love my husband. I just need to get this off my chest. I feel horrible for even writing this. I dont know what Im looking for. Is this normal? Is is normal to be somewhat affected by a break up even after you have moved on? I keep seeing this person everywhere I go literally. Hello there, My spouse had pulled into the grocery store parking lot. I was in the passenger seat and my oldest daughter was in the back. We were all getting ready to get out of the vehicle as we were adjusting our masks when I looked over and saw you standing next to the your vehicle which was parked in front of my spouses car. You looked as if you were texting, but you did not move or walk away from your vehicle let alone gesture to get in it. My husband and I were going over dinner plans as we closed the car doors. I kept my gaze on him as I did not want to draw attention to you. My daughter was still in the back seat playing on her phone as always. It was a hot day and I didnt want her to stay in the car by herself. I also did not want her to know that you were there. I told her that I needed her help with the groceries and she complained. I glanced at the ground and felt your eyes move from me back to your phone. You still didnt move. It was a good five minutes later that my daughter finally gave up her complaining and decided to go in the grocery store with me and her stepdad. I remember she was your favorite because you both had similar interest in food and art. How long were you standing there or did you leave once we were in the store? I didnt see your car when we got out of the grocery store. Your birthday was this past weekend and we have been broken up for three years. When I see you in public, which seems more often than normal, I think about you for from time to time, and yet we do not speak. I dont have your phone number or email address anymore and I doubt that you have mine. I could never bring myself to delete the videos and pictures of you with my children, the ones that the children took of us. Sometimes, I recall our former relationship, everything that happened and how you are a stranger to me and my children... I still wonder how you are and if you are in good health? Are you still the same person I once knew? I do not want to entertain the idea of you reaching out to me, regardless if you know Im married or not. Deep inside, I still care about you as a person. I understand that we may not have been right for each other but I know in my core that every feeling that I had for you was real and that I was in pain for a longtime and I can still feel that pain when I see your face in a dream, or hear a song that you and I shared together. Its the way in which we parted that hurts so. I know that I didnt get closure, never will and that you dont owe it to me, but it still doesnt mean that I didnt needed it, want it. I really thought that I was going to spend the rest of my life with you. I wasnt expecting you to break up with me that day let alone kick me out. When you text me that day in July, asking to pick me up from work and I said  No , thats OK, besides you should really rest your hands. You had driven hrs the night before for work and said earlier that your hands were really hurting as you were recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. I wanted to take the bus anyway. I had a good book I wanted to read and sometimes I do better reading on public transportation. I came home and I remember that you yelled  Get the fuck out, bitch, making fun of my illness! I found this, written in September of 2017, the month that I moved out of his place:  It has been said that breakups can be a liberating experience, with time and healing of course. I am in the thick of it. Haunted by the past perceptions that I had created of you and me. To live with the reality that the person whom you cared about was never real. It was all an act played so brilliantly. Feelings of shame and regret consume my soul. I just want to be free of this. My heart feels like it's burdened with led and may crumble at any moment. What remains of my heart burns with drops of my steamy hot tears that carry the virus of rage. I'm wondering if it's possible to love too much. Why does it hurt so bad after someone you love so much decided not to be with you, even when you knew deep inside that they probably were not the one? I lived with the idea that I can save this man, that I was different. I witnessed the change so slowly moving during our time together. At this moment, I don't know how to trust myself to love in that way again. I question if what I was looking for even exists. Vulnerability is my greatest strength and my greatest downfall. I am tormented by the thought of saving this man because this man was my best friend, when all the while I should have saved myself. It's just another sad love story, but it doesn't feel like it when you are in it does it? Living with abandonment, rejection, confusion...It's so easy to pretend I hate this person but it's hard because that's not who I am. I don't want this to consume me, to eat me alive turn me into a monster. In hindsight, I know this person is not the man I needed. The two and a half years we were together he could not be. Nearly 20 years older than me, interracial age gap relationship, he never married, never fathered children of his own , lived alone for 30 years... I feel like an idiot. Just take back what you did to me. Love does not know color or age as they say. Sadly, it was not enough to stand against societal pressures and stigmas, was it? I was strong enough, because of my character. However, it takes two people and I couldnt do it alone. It's exhausting living and caring for someone who was not capable of opening up. It does something to you. I believe that there were times when I felt more alone being in the relationship, lying there while he was sleeping, just wondering how be was, wanting to hug him, just wishing that he had noticed everything that I did for him. For him , I would do anything. I thought I did everything. I gave myself. I would see how tired he was from work or was in physical pain, and I just wanted to take that away if I could. I just wanted him to let me in. I just wanted him to notice me standing there, all the time I put in to get ready for him, dress up only to be rejected. Was there another woman? I dont think I will ever know.I had never felt so imperfect in a soul sucking way. He said I wanted too much and felt that I was draining him. That hurt. He also said that we were not compatible and that we argued all of the time. I didnt know that we argued because he barely opened up to me. He would just shut down and not speak to me until I apologized for what action I did that upset him. Im sorry that I wasn't more settled in my life. Finishing my degree and working full time as a divorced woman with children from a previous marriage was too much. I understand. Yet there times when he said that I was his family and my children were his children. There was this mask that he put on whenever he was around me it seems. How is it that within a week you can tell your partner that you aren't going anywhere and that you see yourself together with that person only to take it all away with some excuse in regards to your health? He didnt believe that I could stay with him as he aged. He feared being pushed around in a wheelchair. Thats what you do when you are you love someone. You take care of them. I would have taken care of him. He had also said that because he was getting older, he had less interest in sex. Im not sure if its normal to have sex once a week or every two weeks, but there are more than 100 ways to make love with out having sex. I know that he thought I was being unfaithful, after we broke up there were times when I would get dressed up to go out to because I wanted to feel attractive. He would see me and mutter under his breath slut. He would never come right out and say it. Its ironic because there were times when I truly believed that he was using me because he didnt want to be alone I am only here to keep his bed warm. And yet there were times when I felt his soul so deeply inside me, his beautiful blue eyes piercing into my soul while holding my hands tightly yet affectionately whispering you are mine and I love you. I believe that I'm worthy of love and I hope my heart heals for someone who is ready, emotional, physically and mentally. I believe that you should never walk on eggs shells because you are afraid of telling your partner how you feel because it will upset them and and they will run. Reading this aloud to myself I feel even more shame. Once upon a time I was stronger than this. I thought Could save us, I thought I could save you. I wish I had spent more time saving and loving myself. I thought I would be the one to thaw his frozen heart. I just wanted you to love me. I wanted to be chosen.  I dont know. Once, I thought it was going to be you. I just hope you are well and learned to love. Im sorry for everything that had happened between us. I didnt mean to hurt you. I know I must have hurt you too for you to react Im the ways that you did. Sometimes I feel that perhaps you treated me so poorly at times was to protect your self, but it doesnt make it right. I forgive you for hurting me the way you did. I hope that you forgave me for what I have done to you. We all deserve happiness."
23,vulnerability,BreakUps,When should you reach out to an Ex?,5,hrhwwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hrhwwq/when_should_you_reach_out_to_an_ex/,2020-07-15 15:36:51,"Hey everyone, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Clutch, I run a YouTube Channel Called The Truth of Love - URL One of the biggest questions I get is when I should reach out after a breakup. A number of channels have the standard NC rule, depending on who you follow the answer may be 30 days, indefinite NC...etc The problem is that a blanket statement doesn't work in breakups. 99% of cases, the trauma felt is much deeper than losing a loved one. **In the majority of cases, the issue is not the breakup itself, but what the breakup represents that hurts the most., whether that's abandonment issues, underlying insecurity or suppressed abuse** With that said, there are three scenarios where NC can be broken. This should be taken with a grain of salt. When in doubt ask someone who's not attached to your situation. (Stay away from family with these types of questions as they will just tend to support whatever you feel). 1. You were the dumper and regret your decision - As crazy as this sounds, there are dumpers out there with a huge sense of pride who refuse to reach out. If you're in the mindset, I would recommend you spend at least a few weeks really thinking over this decision. Remember you hurt this person, last thing we want to re-open an old wound. If you are certain that you wish to give this relationship another go, you need to be honest and open. 2. You were the toxic person in the relationship and your main motivation for reaching out is closure. Big warning here, a lot of people will use closure as an excuse to break NC with the secret intention to rekindle. I am going to assume that you're an intelligent person. If you want to lie to me that's fine, but if you're lying to yourself then we have bigger problems. 3. Enough time has passed where you have recognized the issues between you and your ex were circumstantial. This takes the following assumptions: * You have to be willing to take back your ex as they were during the end of the relationship * Rebuilding an old relationship takes 10x the effort as building a new one. Do you truly believe this person is still worth if after all this time? * You are willing to respect their decision no matter what they decide * You have changed - Usually this takes 6+ Months of NC, this is the key! People jump back into relationships when nothing has changed, does this mean the relationship is doomed? Not necessarily, but with internal change comes increased odds of success. Depending on the attachment style of the person you're dealing with you may want to change your strategy. Again this isn't a be all end all strategy. Instead this is meant as a guide to understanding the principles of a breakup. 99% of you will not incorporate these tactics by the time you can reach out, why? Mainly because we are attracted to people for two reasons: 1. They remind us of an element of our childhood we have yet to resolve 2. They feel familiar to us - Usually associate with upbringing in childhood. In both these scenarios, people resolve trauma through trauma. For example if I have an issue with abandonment I might be attracted to someone who is dismissive avoidant. In a breakup my conscious mind is forced to deal directly with the underlying fear of abandonment. As I recover, I discover that I am fine without this person, in fact I know that my love is worthy someone who wouldn't abandon me in such a way. In turn, by the time I have made changes and I am ready to reach out, I won't want to. With that said, if you have read all of this and still feel like you should reach out....don't! If you're reading this post it means you're still having doubts, so keep this is a constant in your life. Check this post in 24 hours, in 1 week, in 1 month.....do you still feel the same after each interval? If you honestly think this person is ""the one"" than what is another month going to do other than reinforce the notion of building a stronger relationship and giving you more time to implement positive change? So you've read this back at least three times and feel constant in your resolve, you can't just reach out to someone and say ""I love you"". Here are the strategies on how to reach out when you do depending on the attachment style of your ex. DA - Reach out asking to grab a coffee / drink, you should never mention the notion of getting back together on the phone. Set a time and place and end the convo until you see them in person. From there, get passed the awkwardness of the first 15 minutes until you're laughing and start with small flirting and touches, naturally things should progress assuming they are receptive. FA - Mention you have had some doubts about your decision and would like an opportunity to make it up to them. Not over the top, but enough to show a level of vulnerability. Give them an option to meet up and leave the ball in their court. If you can meet them somewhere where they feel safe, even better. AP - Mention that you're an idiot, and would like to make things work again. Provide a brief summary on how you came to this conclusion and let them set a date to see you should they accept your invitation. SA - Tell them that they have been on your mind and you would like to see them. When you do meet up, measure their interactions after the first 15 mins, are they flirty/receptive? If so escalate at their pace. **Personal note from me:** Although these strategies will help, they are not a guarantee. Like most things in life there is an element of risk. You wouldn't love someone if risk wasn't associated with it. After all, how can you truly appreciate something without losing something first? I know these are tough times for most of you. Things will be ok in the long run, things have a funny way of always balance out with enough time. I am here to help as are many others. Good luck to you!"
24,vulnerability,BreakUps,"Loved up, locked down and learning",2,hvvgfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hvvgfl/loved_up_locked_down_and_learning/,2020-07-23 01:09:37,"Hey guys, I'm a male from the UK approaching 30 and I'm going through a break up. At the time of writing this, the world is being crushed under the weight of the Covid 19 pandemic and businesses are slowly starting to open up again. Breakups are a truly awful experience at the best of times, let alone during a global pandemic. I'm the heartbroken in my situation and not the heartbreaker. That's not to say that my now ex girlfriend isn't or is also heartbroken, that's just for context. About 10 days ago, we woke up together and I had to say something after weeks of the relationship going into decline. We had a talk, I mentioned that I wasn't happy but I wanted to make this work and I was willing to try anything. She felt that whatever damage had been done couldn't be repaired. We both cried and she left, I haven't seen her since. And just like that, the person I had invested in and valued so highly was gone from my life. I didn't get out of bed that day, I cried and I've cried ever since. I won't deny it, I love her and I'm still as attracted to her as the day I met her. While lockdown certainly didn't help with things, I recognise I didn't maintain what I had. I don't blame myself entirely for it, a relationship works both ways after all. I'm about to begin 14 days of self isolating for an upcoming operation, which means I'll be alone with my thoughts and my mental wellbeing might take an even greater toll then it already has. You might think that I would be terrified of the impact this could have on me, but I have thought clearly for the first time today without my thoughts being dominated by my recent trauma. I'm actually here not to ask for help, but to offer advice to those who are struggling with post relationship depression right now and in future. I'm not a therapist, psychologist or a relationship expert and I'm certainly not a qualified professional. I'm just average everyday man giving personal advice from my experiences to hopefully help you through this. This isn't my first breakup by any means, I've had quite a few really tough heartbreaks and they've never been easy. I've learnt from each one and come out a stronger person each time. You will as well, you've gotta stay strong. 1. DELETE THEIR NUMBER AND BLOCK THEM ON SOCIAL MEDIA I know, it's become such a clich but I can't stress this enough. It's the most important step and I know it can be counter productive if you can remember their number off by heart but there should be very few reasons why you need to contact your ex (kids/mortgage etc). The same goes for social media, your ex is moving on and it can be extremely painful for you to see that while your feelings are still overwhelmingly tender, especially if they've met somebody else. You might as well throw your heart into a blender. Consider removing their close friends and family as well, or at least set their profiles to mute just so there's no emotional triggers that could remind you of your ex whilst you're flicking through Instagram or Facebook. Tbh, it would probably do you a great deal of good to have a total social media blackout for a little while. I know it's a big and difficult step, but just do it. Delete and block them to remove any temptations because trust me you'll only be making yourself worse if you cave in and relapse. 2. DON'T TURN TO THE INTERNET FOR SOLUTIONS ON WINNING THEM BACK. It's only natural to want your ex back after a breakup, but it's over. I'm sorry to be blunt but I'm being realistic. While on very rare occasions ex couples may reconcile, it's absolutely not healthy to have your heart set on it. The internet is a wonderful resource but it is full of websites with unproven and poor advice waiting to take advantage of your vulnerability for a profit. Don't fall for them. There's no magic way to get your ex back so drop the harmful mindset and come to terms that it's over. The sooner you find peace with it the sooner you will recover. While a breakup certainly isn't a competition, they left you so they have full control of this. They will come to you if they're interested in reconciliation, it won't work the other way around. And don't follow what you see or hear in pop culture. Romantic gestures, flowers, love letters or begging and pleading may work on Hollywood movies but they aren't going to save this. It's not worth the cost of your sanity or dignity. You may even come across as desperate, needy or just plain creepy which is going to push your ex even further away. Just don't hold onto hopes that things will return to how they were. They fell for a confident independent version of you that could control your own emotions. I'm guessing if you're currently reading this, that's not the version of you that you are right now. Focus working on yourself rather then making your ex the priority, you simply cannot move forward if you're clinging onto false hope. 3. PICK YOURSELF UP I know it's easier said then done, especially at this current time where many of us are either furloughed or have been made redundant. I'm currently furloughed myself, so each day is the same day. I wake up and feel like there's no point in even getting out of bed, then I ponder and ponder. You must remember this is a battle in your own head. It's just chemicals in your brain telling you there's nothing positive in your life right now. It's fucked up, you could literally have everything in the world but feel like you've hit rock bottom. You've gotta force yourself, get out of bed, have a bath or shower, brush your teeth and have some sort of routine to maintain a sense of normality. Eat something, even if you have to force it. I'm struggling with this myself, my appetite has gone completely and when I do eat something it's a fraction of the size of my usual diet. Which bugs me because I love my food. Don't binge drink, especially if you haven't deleted their number yet. Go for walks or a run to help clear your mind and focus your energy on a new hobby or skill. You're gonna need something positive to distract you since you've now got spare time on your hands. In fact, I'm typing this now as a distraction. It's an essential coping mechanism you will need at this time. Take notes of your thoughts and feelings, once they're on paper you might find it a little easier to process. 4. DON'T FIGHT THE GRIEF There's a toxic stigma around men like myself crying. A growing misogynistic culture has portrayed men that cry as weak and demasculined. Some of us even might have bad role models that tell you to just ""man up"". Don't let that bottle up your feelings guys. Let it out, you need this time to grieve. Same goes for women as well. We need to grieve the death of our relationships much like we've lost a loved one. If you feel like you need to be alone for a moment, go and be alone then cry it out. Cry until it's out of your system. Once it is, you'll feel better. You've gotta cut a piece of yourself off to allow yourself to grow and holding it in will just cause you unnecessary stress. Don't be afraid to talk to friends and family as well, they can't be there all the time but it'll help get your feelings off your chest. It'll be a huge weight off your shoulders. My mother and sister have been a huge help for me recently and are doing their absolute best to help me through this, we all need people like them for support. 5. BOX UP THEIR STUFF I'm being a little hypocritical here with this one but I know it's something I need to do, I just haven't brought myself round to doing it yet. Your home and your exes place are hubs for both yours and their belongings. Their clothes and other sentimental items are not the best items to have yourself surrounded with. They're a constant reminder of your ex and can set you back. Their stuff doesn't belong to you, you can't keep it and doing so will cause further hurt. Box it all up and put it somewhere out of sight. This includes any photos of your both. Either send their items to them or arrange for someone to drop it all off. I don't recommend it but if you have to deliver it all yourself, do it when your feelings are neutral and have both moved on. Which could take some time. Same applies with your belongings at theirs, give it time before any arrangements are made. Accept that you maybe without some of your belongings for a little while. It's not worth meeting face to face and potentially crush yourself for a T-shirt that you left around theirs. 6. TAKE YOUR TIME AND DON'T TRY AND MAKE THEM JEALOUS. This is time you need for yourself, and it's going to take time to find yourself again. As much as you would like it to, you're not going to heal overnight. It's going to be a long and lonesome road. You may have heard it's not a race, it's a marathon before, but I like to think of it as a journey with some emotional obstacles. Some days will feel like time is going so slowly but you will overcome it. I don't recommend jumping straight onto Tinder in search for a rebound or fresh relationship either. If you're attempting to make your ex jealous or looking for a quick companion, it won't make you feel better or make you feel like you've got the upper hand in the breakup. It's not a contest and your mental well-being will benefit greatly from not treating it like one. Comparing your journey to your exes is just as damaging. Don't even waste energy thinking about it. Dwelling on the past and thinking about what you could have done to save your relationship isn't productive, what's happened is now history and nothing can be done to change it. This is a journey where you go from a self loathing to self loving. Once you're ready, move onto something better. Meet someone new with your new found confidence or just stay single for some time, there's nothing wrong with being single. It takes as long as it takes unfortunately, there's no set amount of time but you will pick yourself up again. People are different, some get over this hurdle sooner and some do later. You just can't expect anyone to love you if you don't love yourself. Take your time, you will come out the other side of this a much stronger person. Everything I've said above may seem like common sense, but when you're mind is constantly flooded with negative thoughts and feelings it can cause us to behave negatively. We're going through trauma to put it simply and we need help where it's available. Don't be afraid to reach out because it's ok to not be ok. Nobody will judge you unless you're digging yourself deeper and deeper into a hole. I hope this genuinely helps you, I really do. Stay strong and you will recover."

(i actually ended up having a complete mental breakdown as a result. broke a bunch of glass, cut my foot open, mom walked in; it was ugly. but thats not the point). that was last night. and i woke up this morning (after barely 3 hours of sleep) regretting it all so much and so deeply. i feel utterly ashamed and disappointment in myself. so please, for the love of god, save yourself from that feeling and dont do what i did. dont make excuses for them. dont break no contact, no matter how urgent or desperate they may seem. no matter how much you miss them and still love them. unless theyre reaching out to reconcile with you, with complete openness, humility, and vulnerability, its not worth it to respond. i recognize that every situation and relationship dynamic is different (and honestly, a lot of you are probably better at self-control and setting/enforcing boundaries than i am lol), but seriously stop to think before you act. ask yourself if opening that pandoras box is really something that you want. prioritize yourself. be selfish. dont give them the satisfaction of your time, your attention, or your words (especially if theyve hurt you). let them squirm. let them be restless, uncomfortable. hell, youll probably feel uncomfortable too. but you owe it to yourself to stand your ground. and frankly, you owe them nothing. and to those of you that are sentimental and romantic like me, you arent disrespecting or denying the love you have/had by not responding. its okay to protect yourself. you can still love them and take care of yourself. i was going to post this using a throwaway account but decided against it. this is me taking my power back. this is my account and im going to use it how i damn well please. my thoughts and feelings are valid, and matter. this subreddit has helped me so much the past couple of months and this is my way of giving back. and even if no one really reads this long ass post (im sorry i dont have a tldr for you), ive done my part. ive said what i needed to say. this post is also a reminder to myself (and, i suppose, to all of you) to NEVER AGAIN put myself though that. to never again beg anyone to stay. to never again beg anyone to talk to me. to never again beg anyone to love me. to never again beg anyone to be honest with me. the right person for me will do all those things and more, naturally, on their own, because they WANT to. so, to any and all of you reading this i wish you nothing but peace and happiness. there is so much pain on this subreddit, but so much growth too. and im proud of each and every one of you for how far youve come (even if its only been a day), and for how far you still will go. yall give me hope. thank you."

Its been 476 since my break with my ex and I havent been able to get over her. Not a day goes by where I dont think about her and how much of an idiot I am. But enough with the shallow talk I need to give you guys some context. Pretty much my breakup happened over the course of a month and a half and was probably the most painful things Ive ever had to experience. It all started when my one of closest friends ex told me that she was worried for me bc I had seemed down recently. Coincidentally, I actually was, as I wasnt really happy with the current state of my relationship with my ex at the time and didnt know what to do. So I confided in her and told her how unhappy I was. Unbeknownst to me, this girl was not over her ex (one of my closest friends) and would fuck over my life. She used this moment of vulnerability against me and fabricated some insane stories that my girlfriend at the time was cheating on me with her ex. Now I had suspicions that she was Into my friend and this confirmed my suspicions, even though these were complete lies but I was not aware of this at the time. I was so pissed off I went to social media and posted a long rant about how much of a back stabbing prick he was at 3am in the morning. I go to bed in tears and wake up with my phone flooded with texts from all of my friends including the one I accused my girlfriend was cheating on me with. Just to sum up what happened they proved they were innocent and that my friends ex was a crazy psychopath out to get revenge. So I apologized to both of them. My friend instantly forgave me but my gf said she needed time to think about things. This is where shit really hits the fan. She pretty much ghosts me for 2 weeks and Im a wreck. I went days without eating and sleeping up until the point where I began hallucinating. After nearly 5 days without sleep I told myself in English class that would be the last day Id be on this planet and would try to end my life once I got home. Thankfully I passed out due to exhaustion once I got home and slept for a solid 12 hours. Fast forward till two days later as after a really emotional convo I decided to end it but quickly backed out of it. I know this is the shittiest thing I couldve done and Im fully aware. We are technically back together but it doesnt feel like it. We date for another month but we rarely talked. Eventually one day she texts me and says its over. I was a mess. I stopped sleeping again bc I was having nightmares about the entire thing and cut off most of my friends other than two of them. I thought everyone was conspiring against me and hated the world. But I mostly hated myself. Every thought I had was related to her and how I was a shitty person. Now heres the thing, and this is where I really fucked up, I decided to become friends with my old friend group again... including my ex. I know everyone says you need to move on but I was genuinely friends with all of these people and I know this sounds really lame but I dont really have any other friends. Over time I started to become closer with my ex and my friends started to think that maybe there was hope for us again. I was beginning to think that maybe there was hope for us again. And out of the middle of no where I got scared that I would get hurt again, so while talking to my ex I started flirting with some other girl and then made sure my ex found out about it. My friends, especially my two really close ones, were very confused and I never really told them why I did it. This is probably the most douchebag thing anybody could do, looking back there are a lot of things I wish I could take back but its too late for that now. After all of this however, I still cant stop thinking about her and she consumes my thoughts to a point where its almost unbearable. Ive been hiding this from my friends and anyone else I know and I dont know what to do anymore. I cant bear to live my life consumed by this self-hatred I have for myself bc of my failures. And so now I turn to the people of Reddit for advice: What on Earth should I do?"

I am a quite closed off easy person by nature, bad emotions I react and then forget. This breakup has so many old underlying issues popping up for me. Has anyone else felt with something like this? I used to hide in drinking but completely stopped that just short of 3 years ago. This is when she tells me that it started getting bad for her in our relationship cause I was a closed vault."

Girlfriend broke up with me fairly out of the blue just over 2 weeks ago. Said shed not been feeling the same way anymore for a couple of weeks prior, said the spark was gone, and said she needed space to work on herself and she wasnt sure if she was ready for a committed relationship right now. It was a short relationship, started in February and we were official by March and all was fantastic. We lived together during lockdown and I think the lockdown plus spending too much time together, and she had a fairly close family member die and was on a new pill that dropped all aspects of her mood, all played big factors in the spark dropping. On the night she broke up with me I pleaded - mistake I know - and said lets do no face to face to contact for 2 weeks to give her some space and time to reflect and see if she still felt the same way and she agreed. We said we might stay in touch over messaging, which I did a few times during week one, too much in fact, - my mistake I know I screwed up and Ive learned that - but she didnt respond, called her after a week and she still sounded irritated and said she didnt feel any differently because I still wasnt giving her space. So we reset and then agreed on zero contact for 3 weeks then we would meet up in person for a chat and make a final decision. 9 days in so far and Im doing well. How do I approach this chat and what do I say? If its definitely going to be over which right now Id say is a lot more likely than not, then I want some closure. But from things Ive read on here Ive come to understand that theres just going to be unanswered questions that Ill just have to live with that even if I ask her she wont answer. Like I wanna know why she doesnt want to try / fight for us when we had something so good going? Why we couldnt have stuck it out until things got more normal on the world and then seen how things were? Why could she never truly open up her feelings during the relationship when something was on her mind or give me the vulnerability I gave to her. And why didnt she say something earlier rather than just giving up all of a sudden? She mentioned wanting more space 10 days or so before the break up which I gave her and we never gave that a proper chance either. Like I said I know I probably wont get an answer to any of these questions and probably shouldnt ask them either, and Im already learning to accept that. Any advice would be much appreciated."

But I still had to live with her for another two weeks until I found a new place. We were both heartbroken for the first week, then it seemed like we got over it (for the most part). Ive been living on my own for a little over three weeks now and a few days ago it just hit me again. Ive been having dreams about her the last few nights. Why does it feel like I was fine until now? I barely thought about her for a little while, but now shes all thats on my mind. I know its bad to dwell in the past and I dont mean to do it. Im just so lonely, and she even kept our dog. I bought some dog toys and mailed it to the old place without telling her, hoping she doesnt hate me for it. I just miss my little guy. It sucks that I lost both of my best friends in one incident. She wont let me come see him or take him on hikes, which is understandable. I just hate the whole situation and wish it never happened. I made her resent me because Im too unemotional when it comes to love. That stuff is hard for me. I didnt grow up in a way where showing someone unconditional love was okay or encouraged. Its not like I dont have feelings. She loved me so much that at one point she even proposed to me! Yet I couldnt accept it because I was scared to love back. The vulnerability struck fear inside me. I write her letters every night pouring my heart out, but never send them. I know she would reject them anyways. I erased her contacts and social media from my phone so Im not tempted. But lately that temptation to reach out is still there. BREAK UPS SUCK YALL. And I used to be the person who would cringe at other people showing their grief over an ex. This is the first time Ive really felt that pain, and now I get it. At least Im still young at 23 years old. But damn are the feels hitting me today.

32,vulnerability,BreakUps,First Honest Post I've Made on Reddit,2,h9kxjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/h9kxjm/first_honest_post_ive_made_on_reddit/,2020-06-16 03:38:47,"Started dating a girl right after moving to NY for grad school. Didn't know what was going to happen, but we ended up dating for over 2 years. Things were good, but we got kinda stuck. We didn't talk about it until much later than we should have, and ended up splitting this past December. I had no idea how much it was going to suck. Throughout the relationship I had had these vulnerability issues from past experiences that I didn't even know how to address. After this breakup, it was like all my emotional walls came crumbling down and I was overcome with a flood of feeling, longing, heartache, and regret. It felt overwhelming for a while. Could barely function or go to sleep without drinking. Against my better judgement, I still followed her on social media, which is how I found out in February that she had a new boyfriend. The logical side of me knew she didn't owe me anything anymore. After all, I couldn't even tell her I loved her until after we split. Pretty messed up. Maybe a hail mary of sorts. I've been trying to deal with this and keep looking forward. Doing therapy every week. But I still think about how things ended just about every day. Thinking about how maybe if I had had a little more time we could've made something worked after I dealt with my personal issues. But I never got the chance and it's too little too late. I know things will get better eventually. But eventually just seems like a long time. Perhaps I'm just envious that things got better for her so quickly, or that I didn't really have the effect on her that I thought I did. Still trying to figure it out."

You are grossly naive, manipulative &amp; overwhelmingly selfish. Dont play it off as something you just cant do, PLEASE. YOU ARE A BAD PERSON. I knew it and I wanted to be there to help you through it &amp; fix it. I sat down to write you a letter about why I loved you and why I loved being with you like 5 months ago. I couldnt write it! I was planning on telling you this when I broke up with you the first time. But then you told me you hated yourself, so I withheld. YOU ARE NOT THE VICTIM. You hate yourself because you do what you want, when you want &amp; when you get caught or confronted, you pity yourself. Youre a fucking goddamn narcissist. Its not just me who you cant make happy. You cant make anyone happy. You ruined me, your ex, and a multitude of girls and felt bad for yourself while doing it. FUCK YOU. I cant wait for you to be out of my heart. The actual only positive thing I am able to take away from our relationship is that you showed me what I want &amp; what you are so incapable of fulfilling. 5 main things: Consider me always Care about me &amp; show me Communicate your feelings, vulnerability &amp; trust Go out of your way to make me feel like the prettiest girl in the world Be loyal I DID THESE THINGS FOR YOU WITHOUT QUESTION.

34,vulnerability,BreakUps,Really really good thing ending suddenly,1,hd6lp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hd6lp9/really_really_good_thing_ending_suddenly/,2020-06-21 23:03:53,"So a couple months ago I (M26) found this girl (F27) on a dating app and I was really hesitant to start anything because i wasn't sure about the distance (she's in Washington state, I'm in Iowa) and also the fact I was thinking of not doing the online dating thing anymore but i decided to go for it and what followed where seriously two and a half of the best months of my life. We instantly connected and got super vulnerable and deep with each other during our weekly dates and phone calls and daily texts. It's crazy the amount of similarities we found: we both were hesitant/fed up with dating apps and weren't too crazy about LDRs, we have the same favorite foods, a deep passion for arts and literature, same love life situations (4 relationships total, longest one 7 mos, and most recent one was toxic), both being Catholic but disliking the close minded stuffed shirt types, both creative really funny types, and both of us wanting something pure and honest and healthy out of a relationship and more stuff that i could make a whole post about. We even mutually speculated what a future together would be like and that was in the first month of knowing each other (but we left that alone, because there were too many variables). Now with this being during quarantine, we had to wait for states to open up again before we could meet in person and we both agreed to wait until then before putting a boyfriend/girlfriend label on us. We finally were able to meet in person, I flew out to her last weekend, and it was one of the best weekends ever. Here's the kicker though: we were both really nervous, and she didn't want to hug me when i first showed up as she was still adjusting to me being real and in person and the next day Saturday she brought up how we both check off alot of boxes for each other, but there's one box thats half filled in of her wanting to be with a guy who shares her profession of acting. I love theater and can vibe with her on that but I'm a writer and english teacher by trade. And we even talked a little more about it that night too. She was hesitant to do anything physical (hand holding, hugging) until she was sure how she felt feelings wise, to avoud leading me on. She said that week leading up to me coming she was kind of ready to just be friends but upon seeing me in person at the airport, it hit her that she did still really like me. But despite these conversations, we were able to hang and laugh and connect like those convos never even happened and everything was alright. And then Sunday, my last day with her happened. We spent pretty much the whole day at her studio apartment, getting donuts, making french toast, talking, she sewing some pants i ripped helping her move stuff, and me introducing her to Dnd. It was an incredible day. Then we kinda ended up sitting on her floor, hanging with her cat and we talked again about where we were at, and i suggested maybe giving it until a visit to Iowa we planned for July just to give it a final thought, and she wasn't sure about that. I related to her how we've given each other something awesome and healthy emotionally, but i wanted to phsyically give her something unselfish so she could look back and say ""for once in my life a guy didn't use me"" and she appreciated the sentiment but wasn't sure about it. I finally just said ""let me know if this is awkward"" and then scopped my arm around her waist and pulled her into me and she leaned in as well and we just rested there, laughing that yeah it was awkward, but it was really really nice. And then before you know it we were making out. After a bit, we stopped and she said she was really glad we finally did that and it was really nice, but it was the final barrier, the final vulnerability she needed to realize its not the box thing its not the distance thing and she really really wanted this to work out, but she has this feeling that she's pulled in a direction thats not me. I've honestly felt that feeling before with other girls so i could understand. It hurt alot, but I could understand. We talked out the end of it, and laughed and cried and were both open to maybe coming back to each other in the future. We still wanted to trying being friends too. We agreed that this was the most healthiest, best connection, best romantic thing we've had with anyone. We were even surprised at how awry the weekend went emotionally snd schedule wise (there was a lot of plans we moved around and improvised) we still had an amazing time together. So we finally hugged and then the next morning we said a tearful goodbye at the airport and we agreed on a week of NC and then checking in on each other. I get back to Iowa and send her several chunky texts thanking her for everything, how wonderful and beautiful she is, and goodbye for now. Then i settled myself in for the sadness to come and not hearing anything from her for awhile. But two days after i leave (and the week of NC started) she sends me a text thanking me for those texts and she'd be down for checking in sometime next week. I ask for a phone call or skype sesh, and two days later (yesterday) she agreed to a phone call but wanted to keep it 30-45 min. And this cuz I'm assuming she knows we could talk for hours and hours and certainly have before. So during that last Sunday, I was able to be in the moment and oddly at peace with everything, but now I'm really missing her and really wanting to get back with her. Like I said, I've been in her exact position before with another relationship, but I keep questioning why it ended so suddenly when things were so good for so long and we had such an amazing time together. I'm really looking forward to talking this coming Tuesday, and I think that will help both us feel better, because we always could talk things out and say what we feel that has helped before. I do wonder if maybe that pulling feeling was fear of how good it was? Like too good to be true, or waiting for the other shoe to drop and she ended it herself to avoid that pain? We both deal with anxiety (nothing extreme, but we helped each other reason stuff out and get things in order) and that ""shoe drop"" fear is something we both expressed earlier on when we were talking. I really do miss talking with her and being with her and she's everything i could have hoped for and more, romantically and friend wise. It's been a long time since we connected with someone like we did each other. I don't think I could say to her face ""I love you"" or I'm concinved she's ""the one"" or whatever, but I can say I could totally see a future with this girl. Also, I'm not saying she'll jump back into my arms come Tuesday, but I do hope we can come back to each other or at least be able to be really good friends. Thank you for reading this long long post and any thoughts, advice are welcome. I can answer any questions too."

A lot of people out there just want to use you, soak up all your energy and love, and then propel themselves into a life where they feel some of their insecurities arent so terrible. My ex talked about my insecurities. Hell I talked about them with her. But she never really shared any with me. And now shes out there, rationalizing about how I had too many issues and she had so little. But as a lot of us have learned, were only people. We all have issues. Some of us share those deeply in a hope for deeper connection, which is a very honourable and honest thing to do. Understand that the vulnerability you showed is strength. It takes a brave person to open up about their deep issues, things that tear at their very core. And some people cant create strength inside themselves to allow the world into those issues. Which is why they convinced you into doing it for them. Which is why you, sitting there thinking it was your fault, and that you may just be broken inside, are only helping that person feel a little bit better about the choice they made.

It was easier to end the relationship, and I still wanting to try but layed down and said ok without a fight. Im a pretty passive aggressive person, and dont tend to tell people what to do or put up a fight. Im not going to be with someone who doesnt want to be with me. So a year went by and I was hurt, I also healed in this time greatly. I wasnt with my slips, and personal issues during that time. I eventually became ok, with life moving forward and did better for myself moving forward. However, it wasnt until I moved closer due to work, you showed up again. It was the first day I moved in. At first I thought this maybe a sign. Then I heard what was being guarded from me... As I was healed and not expecting much. It changed my outlook on everything. I realized we were two different people after over a year. The same morals and things I had, you had changed with and lived a different life. Others became before, I created a perfect picture of them. Well like many girls before...turns out I was wrong as I usually was. Even at an older age, I keep learning the same lessons. Then we tried friends...it was short and sweet for a month. The more I let my vulnerability down, the more things started getting closer and out my comfort zone. I tried to compromise this, but it just didnt work. I remained 100% honest with what I wanted or expected from a loose friendship. However you pushed harder and sent mixed signals. I felt your pride was the biggest thing at risk for you. So therefore we closed that chapter, and both of us can move on. It wasnt anything either of us said recently. It was pride, past and future getting in the way. As well as change and expectations being too hard to handle. You may disagree, and I know you do. There isnt anything else left to say. It was great the 7 years it lasted. And that is my takeaway....memories. I dont think we could ever go back there. Its crazy how time moves so fast, and the amount of changes that can happen. Thus is life...and we all move on."

I've tried everything I could to make things normal again but it ended in a breach of trust and her removing me on all social outlets. I can't cope and am having a very difficult time focusing on school, work, self-care, exercise, etc. please help me. I'm at my wit's end. \------------------------------------------------------------ Hi, I will try super hard to keep this as short as possible. If you want to skip our backstory, scroll down the the paragraph that starts with **\*\*\*.** I'm 24/m and I'm not doing well at all after a recent breakup with my girlfriend / best friend of 9 years. If anyone can provide me with some advice, positive testimonies, I would be eternally grateful. &amp;#x200B; We started dating when we were just kids in high school. We had our issues but we were happy. Towards the end she kept giving me excuses for why she wouldn't move out of her parents house and in with me, but they were all valid reasons so I let it slide. Eventually we agreed to take a break and be just friends because our work schedules were so misaligned we never got to see each other. &amp;#x200B; Only a month afterwards, I inadvertently discovered that she was looking for roommates online. This hurt me a lot, because I had wanted to live with her for so long, and I confronted her about it. She apologized and explained that she didn't want to feel tied down and commit in her mid-twenties and that she wanted the experience of having fun and living with women her age (although she already did exactly this when she was at university.) I understood, but I wish she had communicated that with me while we were still together instead of lying and coming up with other excuses. &amp;#x200B; Things started to go downhill for us at this point, she was changing quite a lot as an individual, as most people do in their early/mid twenties, and becoming cold and distant towards me. Other incidents continued to happen involving her hiding things about her life from me. I was panicking and started to spoil her with dinners and vacations. We were still having sex and acting like a couple (holding hands, kissing, cuddling in bed) but I could feel her love for me was fading. I was trying everything to get our relationship back to what it used to be. I grew up with this girl, have known her for almost half of my life, and stood by her side as she transformed into a beautiful woman. My world was crumbling. &amp;#x200B; Finally, just this last week I inadvertently discovered that she had a setting enabled to hide her posts on social media from me. This hurt me beyond words, and there was no good reason for doing it because I was never a controlling boyfriend or cared about what she posted. As I'm sure some of you know - when you're with someone for nearly a decade, those kinds of insecurities are nonexistent. I never *ever* gave her grief for anything she posted online. (She is gorgeous and would sometimes post very attractive photos of herself online. This never bothered me and in fact I encouraged it because it boosted her confidence. She knows she's attractive and I was proud to be with someone so jaw-dropping.) So to me, this meant that she was deliberately hiding something that must've been quite bad. I confronted her about this and she provided an insincere apology and tried pretending like it wasn't a big deal. &amp;#x200B; This was the final straw for me, because now the trust was completely gone. How could I trust that she wouldn't do something like this again in the future even if we got back together? I told her I'd be willing to talk on the phone about what happened and possibly work it out despite the fact that I was very hurt, and she responded by removing me on all social media and cutting contact with me completely. &amp;#x200B; **\*\*\*** I am absolutely gutted. Our relationship had it's flaws but I didn't think it was headed towards this. I thought things were getting better and back to normal. I genuinely believe I was always a kind, supportive, and loving boyfriend. Of course I could've done better in some areas, but I was never abusive or disrespectful or unkind to her - ever. I'm having a very difficult time processing all this and I don't fully understand why this happened. She used to be very affectionate and loving towards me, I am now beginning to cry as I type this while I remember how much she used to care for me. There were never trust issues between us. I trusted her and she trusted me with anything. So this new behavior from her has me feeling such terrible agony. That's what makes this especially hard to process. For most of the time I've known her she's been an incredibly kind person and a wonderful friend to me. She's just so different now and it happened so fast. This breakup isn't even affecting her one bit. She moved on mentally months ago. &amp;#x200B; I am not *seriously* considering suicide at this point but the pain I'm experiencing is literally unbearable. I can't focus on anything. I'm in accelerated classes and working towards finishing my associate's degree, but now I can't even remotely focus on my coursework. I am trying my best to focus on myself and love myself but the thoughts about her are intrusive. My siblings are my best friends, and I'm sure they would support me if I talked to them about this. But in my family we are quite stoic and emotionally flat due to some fairly serious childhood trauma / abuse caused by our mother. Showing emotion or vulnerability makes my siblings and I rather uneasy, so I don't want them to feel burdened or see me as weak if I lean on them too much for support during this time. My friend group is the same way - it's sort of an unspoken rule that we don't get deep about things or discuss emotions. (Probably a toxic trait that we have as men.) I do have a wonderful therapist and she helps me immensely, but she has a busy schedule and I only get to talk to her once a week. &amp;#x200B; My whole adult life I've taken pride in the fact that I work through emotions with logic and reasoning and that it's very difficult to upset or anger me. I've always found a way to be somewhat content with life. So this degree of suffering is uncharted territory for me. I hate to sound dramatic but this feels like the end of the world to me. I would do absolutely anything to go back and delete every memory I have of her. If this pain persists for much longer, I don't know what I'll do. I need to move on as quickly as possible so I can get back to focusing on school and work enjoying life again. My biggest fear is seeing her with someone else before I've fully moved on emotionally. I think I would die if I saw that. Just thinking about it makes me tremble uncontrollably with anxiety. &amp;#x200B; I'm a mess. I wouldn't wish this pain upon my worst enemy. I know that I am not unique - all breakups are difficult and the pain subsides over time. But I need advice on how to get through each day. To think that this suffering could continue for many months or even years makes me want to jump in front of a train. Please help. If you have any advice or videos or books to share with me I'd be so thankful. Thanks in advance."

Just a memory, a learning lesson, a step taken. I see you. Time to time. We may not be connected anymore, on Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, Steam, heck even email. But to me we are, in the sanction of our memories. I had accidentally shipped a parcel to our old address. I had to go back and get it. I told my friends if anything comes up - in revisiting my past - that I'd call them. I knew and felt I wouldn't have to take up that offer. I know you don't live there anymore, and so it was easy right? I got there, picked it up, headed right out. Got the bus back, and for fun I felt to go back and read your last several messages. It ended mutual, and I'm glad it happened. We both learnt, and I was deeply happy for your future and wanted the best for you. This isn't personal, but thank you for a such a great time, a great memory, a benchmark to learn of what I would want for my future wife. We spoke about right person, wrong timing. I can't wait on you, and neither should you hinder your self-development for me, or anyone. But l hope, that once you've gone through all of it, growing up and getting into relationships here and there, that you'd look back at us, fondly, as a benchmark of what you would settle for.

My abuser cheated on me My abuser then tried to manipulate me into breaking up with them so they didnt have to do it. My abuser lied to me and gas lit me when I tried to talk to them about our relationship instead of leaving them. My abuser used every vulnerability and insecurity I had confided them against me to hurt me. My abuser built up resentment and made me feel guilty for expecting my love to be reciprocated. When I finally got them to confess that they didnt want to be in the relationship they told me it was them not me, but then dragged my name through the mud and told their friends we broke up bc I abused them. My abuser did this to hide the fact they had been cheating on me with the partners of one of their friends behind everyones back. My abuser watched their abuse break me when I forced myself to accepted it as true bc it was easier than them taking responsibility for what they had done. And then my abuser abandoned me. My abuser hurt a lot of other people as well in different ways at the same time. My abuser is proud of themselves for what they did and calls the selfish things they do that hurt other people self love. My abuser left me feeling like I deserved the abuse. My abuser is not an evil person My abuser is not a bad person. My abuser is a sick person. My abuser had a traumatic childhood My abuser has a lot of pain they were unwilling to face even when they acknowledged it. My abuser felt unlovable. Thats doesnt make what they did ok. My abuser felt better about themselves when they made someone feel the pain they felt. My abuse lied to me, their friends and their family but they lie to themselves the most. My abuser will never take responsibility for the things they did to me. My abuser hurt me But I still hope they get the help they need so they can stop hurting and so they stop hurting other people. My abuser treated me terribly but I let them and I need to work on why I let them treat me that way. I made excuses for them, their just too stressed, depressed or, more often then not, drunk to know what theyre saying or doing and they dont mean it. I let the fear of being a bad person and abandoning them keep me from doing what was best for my own health and let myself spiral into a pit of depression, anger and self loathing, till I didnt even know who I was anymore. My abuser is broken and unwilling to fix themselves so instead they tried to break me and I let them and thats on me. It was hard to write this bc its seen as weakness when a man express these feelings or admits to being the victim of abuse. Im not writing this for sympathy, I dont want reassuring comments or likes. Its not about being a victim, Ive been through worse and Ill heal with time. Im not writing this to get back at her. Shell never see this. Im writing this because if you are with someone thats treating you similarly, youve tried to talk to them about it and they refuse to change and youre making the same excuses I was you need to stop. You arent helping them you are enabling them and letting them know they can get away with the abuse. You need to get away from them. And Im writing this bc if you are staying with someone you dont love or care about you need to leave them as well. You arent doing them any favor by putting off the break up. You are abusing them even if thats not your intention. It is abusive to keep someone in a relationship they arent loved in just bc you dont want to be alone or deal with the break up. Be a grown up and tell them the truth even when its hard because lying and dragging it out will just make it worse for both of you. Its a pretty disgusting thing to let someone continue to put their all into a relationship that youve already checked out of. Even if it means going to Paris for your birthday alone."

I miss sharing details of my day and having someone tell me everything about theirs. I miss knowing that I am with someone who is secure in ""us"" and devoted to me. Having that commitment let me feel safe to reciprocate. I miss the vulnerability and reliability. Lying in each other's arms and knowing everything will be alright because we will work through it. But things change and so do people. We haven't been that way in a long time and I highly doubt we'll ever be that way again. We have been NC for over a month now after I was done with the constant push/pull and told him I'd like for him to figure out what he wants. I wasn't going to sit around and wait. I want someone who wants me, wholeheartedly. Today is especially tough. Today the concept of loss is almost unbearable. Almost. Stoicism is based on the belief that you can control yourself and your actions. You can accept the parts of the world that don't change and how you feel, then decide what you will do as a result. I accept that, right now, I am sad and jealous and angry and a bit lonely. I also know I have books to read, cleaning to do, applications to sort out, and friends to talk to. I have hobbies I've been putting off and learning apps to tackle. Even if we never speak again, I'll be OK. He might find his happiness with someone else who fits him better, and it will hurt at first and I'll be a lil bitch, but I'll still be OK."

Like many, coronavirus killed my relationship. It was the first relationship I had been in in over a year, and Im still hurting 3 weeks after it ended. Im not sure how to synthesize it still. First of all, the individual in question and I have known each other for years  we were friends since high school. In January, we reconnected, and I felt that spark that had always been there resurface. We started dating shortly thereafter. He was a dream at first. Attentive, caring, compassionate. He bought me this plush that I wanted just because I had offhandedly mentioned it, and flowers as well. I never asked, I just had mentioned liking/wanting these things, and he remembered. I quickly fell for him. Then the pandemic hit, and with it, quarantine. It was okay at first. Then I noticed he wasnt really texting me as much. Eventually, about a week before my birthday, I got the dreaded text  Im not ready for a relationship right now. Im sorry. Worse, on my birthday, he barely spoke to me, and completely missed my virtual birthday party. Now, understandably, I was confused. Had it been something I did? Said? Who knows. Perhaps foolishly, I accepted his invitation to stay friends, even though hes not ready to necessarily have me as a girlfriend right now. It fucking sucked at first. I found myself reaching out for validation and reassurance a lot. He still doesnt really text me very often, and I find myself drawing away from it too, but I still text him here and there. It still hurts at times,but Im mostly over it. It doesnt hurt as bad as it did at first. Theres just a few things that bother me. 1. The potential of a future. I think Im definitely remaining friends with him for this reason, and this reason alone. He mentioned that if were both in a good place in the future, he wouldnt hesitate to ask me out  and that he wouldnt stop liking me. I wish he hadnt told me this at all. It feels like it is to bide time for him to figure out what he wants. Yet, he also claims he doesnt know what the future brings. Fair enough. 2. He hasnt told his family about the break up, and his reasoning is that he doesnt want to answer any questions. 3. He always makes a point to say that hes not an extremely emotional person, so thats why hes not super affected by all of this. 4. I just feel like he was extremely selfish near the end, and isnt exactly deserving of my friendship... But due to point (3), if I decide to walk out of his life, hes not going to necessarily care. And I guess I want him to. The lack of emotional intelligence really disturbed me in comparison to the person I knew at the beginning of the relationship. 5. The breakup itself was just cold and clinical. He seemed detached. He never really cared to ask how I was, or check in despite dropping it on me suddenly. This breakup was preceded (by a week or two) by a long conversation in which I opened up about my fear of vulnerability. He reassured me, and that was that  guess I had been right in my suspicions. 6. I feel like an afterthought at this point. An accident, a little mistake in the timeline of his life. He said that a relationship was a distraction right now. Pretty hurtful thing to say to somebody you loved. 7. He claims that none of this has anything to do with me, and it has to do with his career stresses etc etc. He claims he needs to focus on himself, and that if hes not good with himself right now, he wouldnt be good in a relationship. He expressed a desire to be single for awhile. Do I bother believing this? We had plans to see each other after this was all over. Im second guessing if its even a good idea, and if I should finally just cut it off for good. What say you all? Should I bother holding out for a round two, or just block him and be done with it? *using a throwaway for anonymitys sake*"

I tried to save his ego by taking back certain things that I said..but you know what? I meant what I said. He seemed to feel that he could act in any way he wanted and justify his behavior by claiming that I was attacking his character. But I didn't say anything character-related. And if I subtly called him out on his bullshit? Whew, watch out...I can only imagine the reaction if I DIRECTLY called him out. He always placed himself in a victim role. I couldn't share my feelings with him without him putting on this false mask of arrogance and superiority...like an ""I'm above this"" attitude. It was annoying as hell. I just wanted some vulnerability, some authenticity. He couldn't look past himself to show care and concern for my feelings. I could see through his act. I just didn't quite know what was going on at the time. I just knew that his behavior was horrific at times and it frightened me. I made myself smaller to placate his fragile ego. I actually felt bad for him, but I couldn't tolerate that behavior. I'm glad that I pushed back and finally stood up for myself in the way that I should have all along. But then I have second thoughts and begged him to come back, lol. So that was an ego-stroke that he didn't deserve. If I knew then what I I know now, I would have left the first time he revealed himself as a monster. I knew something was very off...I just didn't know what gaslighting was at the time."
44,vulnerability,BreakUps,I'm confused how to feel about my ex.,1,gk1apv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/gk1apv/im_confused_how_to_feel_about_my_ex/,2020-05-15 13:09:44,"This is a all over the place and a tad confusing to read, very sorry. But thank you for reading I broke up with him less than a month ago and we had broken up before but it wasn't ugly like this time. I was betrayed and lied to and gaslighted. But whenever I find myself hating him, and hurting over all the pain he has caused me, I remember all his vulnerability. I remember all the times he hurt and cried about our relationship, work, school etc. I remember he is human, and I realize that sounds extremely cheesy. It's a little difficult for me to explain well but even through all the pain he has caused me, I still hope he becomes a better human being and not for me, but for himself. I definitely do not want to get back with him I understand my worth now after so many years, and yet!! I still wish he could someday genuinely improve and grow from his mistakes. Then it gets confusing again because I think to myself, ""oh my God why are you thinking this? He hurt you, and did shitty things for a long time."" Then I wonder if I'm okay mentally because I'm wishing for my toxic ex boyfriend to grow into a better human being. Maybe I actually want to go back with him and that's why I want him to be better. Maybe he still has a grasp on me and that's why I'm thinking this. That is basically my thought process every time I think of him. Once upon a day I told him you're a good person who just made shitty mistakes and I don't know if that makes me stupid and naive or hopeful. Maybe I can be all three"

I am learning to accept that sometimes we really do need to experience the immeasurable pain that comes with losing what is most important to us. Sometimes that is the only way to really see something for what its worth, to truly value it and view it from an outside perspective without emotions and attachment distorting the lens through which we peer through. Some of the most valuable lessons in life can only be learned through experience. The past cannot be changed but that doesn't stop me from continuing to wish that I had learned these lessons before we met, that I had learned them at the expense of a less meaningful relationship with a lesser man. You came to me with so much vulnerability, eager to trust me with your heart. I know I did not handle it kindly. What I regret most is not learning how to get a proper grip on my mental health before allowing you to take a leap with me. I would have treated you the way you deserve to be treated. The most agonizing feeling is having the knowledge that the pain I caused you could have been spared with just a little more action and self-care on my part. I am learning to forgive myself because it is essential, but you must know it doesn't come easy. I hope you no longer assign blame to yourself for our demise, you must be kind to yourself. I fully realize that by not practicing true self-love I allowed myself to become co-dependent. By not seeking proper treatment for my depression and anxiety I allowed myself to become controlling, overly critical, and argumentative. I find that men often base their life-satisfaction and self-worth on their partner's happiness in a relationship. You mustn't allow yourself to do this, you were and still are so very perfect. I am the only person who is responsible for myself and my actions, it was not your job to fix me and it certainly was not your job to be my emotional crutch. You were the most extraordinary partner and companion I could have ever asked for. You are everything I could ever want and more. I have never felt more bonded to a human being, we have the type of connection that people spend their whole lives in search of and rarely ever find. We have always been so compatible in so many different ways. Each of our personalities challenges the other in the areas that demand growth. We share enough interests and beliefs to nurture the deepest of friendships while simultaneously complimenting one another with our differences in a way that creates constant excitement, wonder, and intellectual conversation. I could never get tired of getting to know you, growing with you, or experiencing life beside you. We have the type of partnership that makes individual success inevitable. We are each incredibly driven, passionate, and eager to learn and when combined we are truly a force to be reckoned with. I know deep in my gut that I will never stop loving you. I have gotten to know your soul far too well for that to ever be possible. I respect you deeply as a person and I know we have something worth fighting for. We fell off track for a little while but what successful couple hasn't? How can we blame ourselves when we are only human? I want you back, if you will still have me. We aren't the same people as we were before and I would like to give our relationship the chance to evolve as well, but while in a healthier headspace this time around. I gave you a second chance two years ago and am now asking for one in return, but only if your gut is telling you we're worth it. I miss you deeply and always wish you nothing but the best. I hope life brings both of us pure love and sheer happiness, regardless of whether or not we carry on together or apart. I love you. I am in love with you."
46,vulnerability,BreakUps,I am just so heartbroken and cant move on,1,gtgtyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/gtgtyg/i_am_just_so_heartbroken_and_cant_move_on/,2020-05-31 02:20:30,"Hi all - I am just looking for some love and support. You can find my full story here if you have/wanted to take time to read the whole story: [URL The long and short of it is I started seeing a girl who 4-5 weeks into dating abruptly just ended things. Gave me the Im not looking for a relationship line. She seemed pretty emotionally closed off then. Then, I was scrambling a bit to figure it out because she said she really liked me and all signs she wanted to be with me. I sent some messages (maybe too long) after trying to figure it out and eventually just gave up. Out of nowhere, about 2.5 months later, she contacted me and we met and she didnt seem to feel bad about abruptly ending things, or the fact she dated someone right after me and it got a bit serious (she met his friends, family, etc...) and played it off as just something casual. Anyways, because I was so infatuated with her, and we clicked on so many levels, I dove back in and we had a pretty great relationship for about 6-7 months. I had some really difficult times towards the end and was really sad for a couple of weeks (my mom got cancer, a lot of emotions came to the surface from suffering from addictions before I met her including gambling, drinking). I have had issues my whole life with depression and emotional regulation. I was just very depressed for 2-3 weeks toward the end of things - crying, couldnt go to work. She was supportive, but also I could tell scared. She left me last July after all this came to a head. Despite having control over everything for 95% of our relationship, she took that episode And it just turned her off. I desperately tried to fix it and tell her the steps I was taking to work on myself and manage what happened, but she couldnt look at me and not see the sad face she saw during those times. I begged and pleaded for a few months, gave her space, and eventually we started seeing each other in December/January, but I felt I was on trial the whole time trying to prove I was a super positive person. I can be, and she saw that and developed super strong feelings for me, but I also am sensitive and certain things bothered me and we had some fights. Her best friend was cold as ice to me, and that bothered me, as an example. She was very indecisive about me from August-January, saying things like she used to see a future with me but now wasnt sure. Well in February she said she is moving and doesnt see a future with me. I reached out one last time in April and she said she didnt want to be in communication anymore. I care about this girl so much and it is so hard to find someone you click with on so many levels. Its just absolutely crushed me. I felt like I was frozen in a really rough moment in time and she projected a life with me of me being emotionally unstable and not dependable. I feel like less of a man for not being able to keep my shit together During those moments. We had to leave an event early because I couldnt handle the emotions. She convinced herself out of the relationship and thought we werent compatible. She thought I was too sensitive. Not positive enough. All the things she loved about me - my kindness, emotional intelligence, etc... went completely overlooked. She was seeing a therapist to see what she wanted in a partner because she wasnt sure. All I know is I felt her attraction to me and she even said she had very strong feelings for me. But in the end that episode just turned her off. I continue to work on myself and try be happy but Ive lost a lot in my life as a result of bad choices Ive made. Its been just gut wrenching this whole thing. And the hardest thing now, and why Im posting, is despite everyone saying to move on, I dont want to move on. I know I have to, but I cant. I am crying virtually non stop every day because of her, and constantly beating myself up for showing my vulnerability during those moments. I have pieced together through social media shes seeing a new guy. And this guy, from all the evidence Ive obtained from his social media account, seems like a nice/great guy but is my complete opposite in terms of personality. Every single post shows him dancing, laughing, being incredibly light-hearted, jovial. Hes an entrepeneur and loves to speak publicly. He seems to have everything I was missing. And this is exactly what she didnt like about me. To me the videos/posts look so stupid - like hes just a giant jokester, doesnt take anything seriously, etc... Obviously Im projecting. So Im stuck in a loop I cant get out of. I want her back so badly, and I know watching social media isnt healthy, but I cant stop. And every time I do, I see how jovial/fun this guy is and am reminded of all the deficiencies in me. I want her back so badly. I dont know what to do. I know theres probably nothing I can do. But I constantly beat myself up for blowing this. And I cant stop just watching time go by and imagining her relationship with this guy is strengthening. I need help. I see professionals and everybodys advice is the same - move on and forgive yourself and that she wasnt the right partner. But thats not good enough! I want her. We did connect on so Many levels. But maybe I felt it more strongly than she did. Im 34 and had my fair share of relationships and Im not saying Im hopeless about finding someone else, but I just feel so behind other people my age and have no desire to meet someone new. I want her. Im starting to obsess about her. Ive respected her wish to not be in contact but just keep thinking if I say the right thing shell give things another chance. I know so many of you are probably going to tell me it hurts but to move on. And I want answers on how to get her back. This is my girl. Everyday that goes by it just seems to hurt even more. And piecing together 2 days ago she was seeing this guy just crushed me. Please help. Im so heartbroken and sad and debilitated. If things ended because we werent compatible, I could accept it. Like has had happened in many breakups before. But I cant help but feel I screwed this one up so badly by her seeing this side of me. She said something like I never knew what depression was until I saw you in those moments. A false statement completely. It was temporary. I get it scared her, but I tried everything to help us move forward from it - seeing a therapist, seeing MY therapist (something she asked to do) - but in the end she refused to do that."
47,vulnerability,BreakUps,Shall I break NC?,1,gunh7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/gunh7f/shall_i_break_nc/,2020-06-02 02:16:59,"Hi. My first post on here. Me and my ex broke up about 3 weeks ago now. Just over a week ago, last Saturday, we were messaging in the evening (and havent spoken since). She brought up how she had to block me on Instagram on her private personal account to help her so that she couldnt see me moving on. And she said that she might have to do it on her public blogging account too if she cant 'pull myself together and stop looking at your account'. This saturday just gone, I posted a insta story of my fam and I enjoying a picnic outside in a park, with personal protective equipment (some of my fam are vulnerable). In hindsight we shouldnt have really been outside in a public park considering the pandemic and vulnerability in my fam. I think later that night she blocked me on her public account. I just want to message her and ask her if she has negative energy towards me and whether blocking me was hostile/aggressive and whether she hates me, or if its just because what she said last saturday about it helping her. It bothers me when someone has negative feelings towards me or hates me."
48,vulnerability,BreakUps,"My ex cheated on me 6 times. Needed to vent frustrations, maybe some of you can relate.",1,guq1u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/guq1u9/my_ex_cheated_on_me_6_times_needed_to_vent/,2020-06-02 04:32:37,"First, I'd like to preface this by saying I made my Reddit account last night and have no experiencing posting before. I made it because this was weighing on me a lot, and I needed some outside input. That said, I apologize if my Reddit Etiquette is lacking, so forgive me in that. This is also a very rant heavy, long post. My (21M) relationship was only about 8 months, on and off. She (19F) was a college freshman, I was a senior, and we met through a mutual friend. Over those six months she became my best friend, but it was really flawed. I get attached really quickly, and that comes with possessive behaviors. I also have issues with dependency or rejection that branch from that attachment. Because of that dependency, its hard for me to accept when a relationship doesn't work or is toxic. I get prideful and believe it can be fixed. For me I feel sleazy if I am talking to more than one person at a time in a dating sense, I'd feel like I wasn't respecting the person and the potential relationship otherwise, so exclusivity is really important to me, even early in knowing someone. its also hard for me not to project my beliefs onto the people I date, setting those expectations. She had her own problems, and since I still respect her I'll be discreet with it all. Due to some really toxic early relationships she had, she would have insecurities regarding friendships, and would see sex as a means of keeping people around. This made it so that she didn't see sex as an intimate thing, and she would have trouble setting boundaries in relationships. If someone was interested in sex, she didn't see that consequences of giving it to them, and so she wasn't able to make platonic relationships that didn't just become that. The exception was that when she was in a relationship, she would be obsessive over that person, and wouldn't cheat and risk losing them. The issue comes that when in a relationship, she couldn't really develop platonic non-sexual friendships, because she couldn't get over that physical mental barrier. She never had time to be single, so she never built herself as an individual and never learned to build friendships with people that didn't become sex. She never developed the desire to say no, because there was no consequence to saying yes, it kept people around. People left when she said no. When she came to college, she broke up with her boyfriend, and met me almost immediately. We became great friends immediately, and I wanted to date. She stayed at my place, and I fell for her. She didn't come over with the intentions to be exclusive and official, she still wanted time to be single so she could be an individual and build those foundational social skills, but she didn't want to lose me and she knew I wanted to be official, so she wanted to try to deal with her problems while being with me. Had the timing been different, I think things would have worked out better, and we both saw those red flags going in of me being very vulnerable and possessive and her not wanting to commit, but we were both too prideful to leave it and accepted that we could make it work and compromise to stay together. The biggest issue was while exclusivity was a must for me to start a relationship, it was incredibly intimate for her, and while sex wasn't intimate to her at all, it was one of the most intimate things for me. Completely contrasting values. We both clearly said how we felt going into it. She still had stuff to work through regarding defining intimacy, and I was possessive and was hurt by a lack of exclusivity. Within the first few weeks of dating though, she would hookup with someone, and I would take it really personally. I would think she didn't care about how I felt, and it hurt my trust in her. She said it was a misunderstanding on her part, and worked hard to fix it, but it set a really unhealthy foundation, and that lack of trust led to more fighting. While drunk she would cheat again with the same guy, and it would hurt my trust to a point where I started getting really bitter and aggressive, and we went on break before it could get worse. After spending some time away from each other, we still cared about each other and wanted to be together, but if that was going to happen I would still be really vulnerable and attached. That night she asked me if it would hurt me if she hooked up with someone while we weren't dating, I said yes, but it wasn't my place to govern what she did as we weren't dating. I told her that it was her choice to make, and she got drunk and hooked up with the guy. Maybe I was in the wrong to assume she would chose to take my interest into account and decide against doing something that could hurt me. I assumed that she would respect that I was still vulnerable and wasn't trying to get over her, by her request, because we wanted to get back together. Regardless, it led to more fighting, excused as a misunderstanding on her part. We got back together after about a month of fighting and distance led to us thinking we had a good understanding of where we were. While it seems dumb in hindsight, I was really attached and didn't want to leave, I kept giving her chances because I wanted things to change and she gave me faith that they would. She was genuinely remorseful for having hurt me, but she was really defensive of her actions regardless. We got back together and things were good for a while, until one night she went to a friends house to help them study. They both got drunk, and she was taken advantage of. She defends the guy and doesn't hold it against him, she has trouble saying no when sober, but it was assumed consent and wasn't what she wanted. Regardless, it hurt that given all the chances I had, she put herself in a situation where she was drinking heavily alone with a guy she used to be FWB with at 1 am. I was the dick though for saying she cheated by being raped. That situation was messy, and ended with neither of us really happy, but we wanted to be. She went on a trip during spring break, where she got drunk and made out with another old FWB at 3 am. She stopped as soon as it happened, saying she had a boyfriend, and texted me in the morning that it happened excusing it as her being drunk. It still hurt as bad as if it was purposefully done with the intent to hurt me, and I couldn't see it otherwise because after all of these chances she knew the effect it would have on me. She kept assuring me I could trust her and stay around and be vulnerable and attached like that. It got to a point where I just wanted her to act like she wanted to be in a relationship with me, and she couldn't do it. She told me to breakup with her while on her trip, sobbing that it was the worst day of her life. ""If you're just going to leave, do it now"". I let that manipulate me, I was scared to lose her, so I swallowed how I felt justifying it with her having stopped when she realized what was going on, and stayed with her. She came back and was really distant. She was aggravated by me being around, and dismissal of me. How I was when we broke up. She told me afterwards that part of the reason for her behavior was that she felt she got away with cheating on me on spring break without any consequence. It bothered her, but she didn't know how to approach it. She felt she should have been held more responsible, and was mad at herself for taking advantage of me. She would come to me near the end of the school year and say she was feeling uncertain in our relationship. She was insecure with her ability to be an individual, and that she didn't know how to establish boundaries needed to make platonic friendships without having a boyfriend as an excuse to decline. Her only reason to decline people interested in her was because of the effect it would have on her boyfriend, and she wanted to have more security than that. She wanted to be able to make that choice for herself. I told her I wasn't going to breakup with her again, that she would need to be the one to do it. It was messy, and it ended with us taking some time not talking to each other. We got back in touch, and she told me that her goal was to use her time being single to find herself as an individual, and not be stressed by the pressures of a relationship. She assured me that she didn't want hookups, she wanted the opposite. She wanted to use the time to develop and build platonic relationships, and learn to respect herself enough to want to say no. Develop a sense of sexual intimacy. I said that I was still really attached and vulnerable, and would be hurt if she used the time to hookup and so I needed to not be around. She said that she was willing to compromise with me because she still wanted me around as her friend, and wanted to try getting back together when she dealt with her problems. She said I didn't have to get over her, because she wasn't over me. We could be in a halfway point while she tried to fix her problems. I took her hookups very personally, it felt like she didn't care for how I felt and that she didn't respect the effort of staying vulnerable and open to her, for us, despite her wanting to breakup. Because of this, I couldn't be around if she was going to be hooking up. She told me that she wasn't going to use being single to hookup with people, and if that changed she would respect the vulnerability I had and tell me. With that transparency established, I felt I could trust her. That same night she went over to someones house who she figured only wanted her for sex, which he did, and he took advantage of her not knowing how to say no. She assured me before leaving that she wouldn't let something like that happen, and would be very clear with her intentions. She told me that night what happened, and was upset with herself. While it isn't what she wanted, she didn't resist. I wasn't able to handle it, and said I couldn't stay attached. If she would be in such an experimental place and putting herself in these situations where she couldn't honestly tell me what she would do, I would have to get over her. In doing so I wouldn't know if a future together would be possible. I said I would have to block her and separate from her life to deal with it, and she said she felt like killing herself. I let that manipulate me, and I told her that I would try to compromise and stay in her life as her friend while trying to detach and get over her. She'd spend the next week ignoring me and acting strangely, and near the end it seemed something was bothering her. I pressed her, and she said she messaged and hooked up with the same dick that took advantage of her. She felt that while it was demeaning to herself to sleep with someone who didn't respect her, she did it for herself, knowing that it was all he wanted and she wouldn't be ruining a friendship by doing it. She actively didn't think that it would upset me, and assumed that because I was trying to get over her I wouldn't want to know. She showed complete lack of care for how I felt, lack of respect for what I was trying to do for her, she hid it from me when I asked her for transparency, and I knew I couldn't trust her. I blocked her on everything and spent the next week trying to break my attachment, which was channeled into a lot of anger, blame, and aggression. She would contact me on something I missed while blocking her, and I let all that aggression out on her. It led to two days of fighting, where she begged me to keep her around, and wanted us to get to a point where I could get over her without hating her, and she could get past her problems. Despite all the trust issues and relationship problems, we knew everything about each other and were best friends, and we didn't want to lose that. I told her that I needed to be able to trust her, that I needed full transparency. If I was going to get over her and stay around, I needed to know that she respected how I felt and cared about how it would hurt me. She said that she wasn't interested in hooking up anymore, I asked that if she wanted to that she'd tell me. My reasoning was that it would let me know that she was acknowledging how I felt regarding the intimacy of it and was assuring me that it wasn't done to hurt me, that she had no intimate feelings for who she was doing it. She told me she wasn't sure about it; that it felt imbalanced in her favor. She gets to do whatever she wants while I am attached to her waiting around, and all she has to do is tell me beforehand so I can sit around and think about it. I said I agreed that it didn't seem like a good plan, and I wasn't comfortable with it, but it was the only thing I could think of that would act as a compromise where we were both happy. She wouldn't have to limit her actions by being exclusive, and I would be reassured in that she cared about me, but with how flimsy it seemed I agreed that I needed to think about my intentions with the compromise more, and that I wasn't okay with it. Two days later, I am talking with her and she is acting weird, and I press her and learn that while she was blocked she hooked up with the dick a third time while blocked, and didn't tell me. Despite how much I stressed transparency and honesty, she felt it wasn't relevant because it was before we talked about that. In a vacuum it wouldn't have been relevant, but given all the promises she made and all we had been through, it sucked and felt she was lying and hiding it from me. I started trying to talk to her about how I wasn't okay with the compromise, and felt I needed to think of something else, because the thought of her hooking up while blocked was physically upsetting. While telling her I felt uncomfortable and hurt, she was actively texting and inviting someone over for a hookup. She told me, like I asked her to, and I was really hurt. She justified it saying he probably wasn't even going to come over, and that her intentions weren't really to hookup. She invited him over because he was a friend, but also she was feeling touch starved. She wanted to cuddle, and cared about him enough that she questioned if it was a good idea to hookup with him instead of trying to stay platonic. That changed to, ""if he wanted to hookup I wouldn't say no"", to her just wanting to hookup. I realized that the only reason I asked her to tell me was so I could try to talk her out of it, which was selfish and stupid of me. With how much she confided in me that she wanted to use this time to build platonic relationships and set boundaries, it seemed insane and I tried to convey that. She said it wasn't my place to say, and that he was on his way. She told me not to hate her too much and said goodnight. I blocked her on everything again, this time not missing anything, and I don't intend on going back. We were both really prideful and selfish, but in the end I was hurt by what she did. She showed that she didn't care about how I felt, she just wanted what was convenient to her, and her own insecurity involving abandonment made her say anything to keep me from leaving without any intention to uphold it more than she had to. She knew I wasn't okay with where we were, I told her, and she had the ability to wait until I was at a more stable place. Instead she invited the dude over, and defended herself saying 'I told you just like you asked, you can't be mad at me."" I can't trust her enough to be friends, let alone in a relationship. Before leaving, I sent a final message saying all of this, and while it was venomous, It was closure. It's been three days since. I keep seeing her with these other guys in my head and it ties up my stomach. I dreamed about it and it made me sick. I don't know if there was any way we could have worked, maybe if I wasn't so attached at the beginning that prevented her from being able to work through her problems. She cheated on average once a month though, 5 times while drunk, and I can't really justify that. Now that I know I can't trust her and don't want to be together, I feel getting over her will be easier, I just hate it got to that point. She was the best part of my life. &amp;#x200B; **TLDR;** My girlfriend had problems with exclusivity and intimacy. I was possessive and got attached really easily. Both of us were too stubborn to leave, and she cheated 6 times. I was unable to move on and stay friends with her after breaking up because she actively was hooking up. To keep me around while I tried to stop being vulnerable, she mislead and lied without being willing to compromise. When I decided I couldn't trust her and it was toxic for both of us, I blocked her and made a Reddit. Any advice you guys have to make this easier would be appreciated, I am more just looking to talk about it with internet strangers, and honestly venting all of it like this already put me in a better head space. I am sure I will hear back from her, but I told her I wouldn't be responding if she did find another way to reach me."

You aren't the fire that warms them on the occassion that they are cold, that once they're done with you, all you'll ever be is ashes, you are a flame meant to light up in fiery that is hard to put out, YOU SHOULD NEVER BE ONE OF THE ASHES AND SHOULDN'T ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE ONE OF THE ASHES. Build yourself up so much that even how many times they try to break you, you don't topple over. Build walls, build gates, don't burn bridges. Be selfish, protect yourself, be wary, trust no one with your vulnerability. The moment your heart is in their hands, it's gonna crush you. You aren't certain if they'll handle it with care, cradle it, keep it safe from harm, or put it away for no one to touch. Those hands maybe soft to touch and has explored parts of you no one has but those hands have capabilities to crush, to destroy, to hurt, to choke, and throw away things you have just started to build. Don't put yourself in a situation where you willingly pour out and give your heart out to someone whose hands felt familiar, whose arms circle in an embrace you have longed for, whose lips feel soft while it interlaces with yours in endless pleasure, whose tongue has spoken words which have made you melt and have given you the momentary reassurance that you thought you needed, no matter what, keep your heart to yourself."

Two weeks into dating I had to go into quarantine and it's been a month since we last met in person. A couple of days ago he called me to tell me he's not ready to be in a relationship and that he lost the ""spark"". I was taken aback because things were going really well and although social distancing from each other was difficult, I really thought that we were making things work for the time being; we were talking on the phone every night, sending each other jokes throughout the day while he was at work. The only change I noticed over the past week was that he stopped engaging into anything sexual over the phone (he said he was thinking about breaking the news, and it felt inappropriate, which I completely understood). What we had was from the very beginning a really emotionally invested friendship/relationship; he has always supported me when I felt down and even when I tried to hide it, he's almost sensed that I was upset and helped me through it. I have tried to be the same for him. We joked around and it felt really normal and okay, and we've had a couple of video calls. When I've had doubts enter my mind, I've dismissed them because I felt like it was going to be okay and that he had no reason to want to end things. (for reference, I have doubts because this sort of thing keeps happening and I haven't been in a relationship lasting over two months) When he said he wasn't feeling it, he couldn't explain why, and said that there was nothing absolutely wrong with me. He said he didn't want to keep carrying those feelings of uncertainty on until they got worse. He got really upset when he told me, and seems to be confused by his own feelings. He really doesn't want me to feel like there's something wrong with me. We are still talking, almost as if nothing happened, and agreed we care too much about each other to ghost each other. I'm very confused by the situation in general, and although I've experienced the ""I lost the spark, I don't know why"" stuff many a time before, it usually ends up in neither of us talking. This time, its like everything is the same. I embrace it, because despite the circumstance, there is no reason for us to argue or stop talking over it. However, I want to understand how likely it is that this happened because of self-isolation. I don't want to hope for all eternity that he will change his mind, but at the same time, I don't want to live in hopelessness either. I understand that it's difficult for new relationships to survive the pandemic, and we are so good together that I can't think of any reason as to why we shouldn't date. He is not great at communicating from a distance and its always been easier for him to just meet people, and he frequently accidentally leaves his friends on read. I wonder whether he just felt too much pressure from himself to be a certain way or constantly be in contact with me. He's also said how I was the first person he's dated in years, and the first time that he has tried to be as vulnerable as possible. This level of vulnerability is really scary for him and out of his comfort zone, and has frequently said how much it scares him. I am wondering how possible it is that he is just too overwhelmed by the whole situation, and whether his decline in mental health since self isolation is a huge factor in this decision. When we talked about it, he said it very well could be, but wasn't sure and didn't want to lead me on. I don't know what to do, or what to think. I would really appreciate any insight I could get into the situation. TL;DR Started dating right before going into self-isolation, everything was going great until he said that he's not ready to be in a relationship. We are still talking almost as if nothing happened, and I don't know whether this all came from his internal insecurities and fears, or self isolation mental health, or whether he's genuinely not interested anymore."

Because of how this masking of what he was really feeling manifested in our relationship (accusatory behaviour, gaslighting, lying, and eventually what feels like cheating) i also started to distrust him, his behaviour not only brought up trauma from our previous relationship which i had worked really hard in therapy to overcome, it also brought up other abusive situations ive been in which spiralled has me into a deep depression/anxiety cycle which im still trying to get out of. i found out he was hiding watching porn from me, hiding that he looked at his ex girlfriends sex work account, and that he was also hiding looking at sex work accounts of girls he had attempted to cheat on me with in the past. this was over months and i was and am devastated. if he hadn't of hidden all of this from me it wouldn't have lead to this breakup, he's admitted to me recently that he has an addiction to porn and if he had of been open about that i would have been understanding but he wasnt and its broken my heart for the last several months having to deal with a parnter who wont talk to me and makes me feel like im not enough. today for the first time in a long time i looked on his facebook to see he's been adding a bunch of girls, i can only imagine why. and im really cut up about it, it hasnt been very long since we broke up and he's all i can think about and when we talked to tie up loose ends he said the same but this is not behaviour of someone whos heartbroken right? i cant even imagine having sex or chatting up another person at the moment, i keep thinking that maybe ive made a mistake and i should give him another chance but this makes me think maybe i was right to leave? im so confused and all i want to do is ask him why hes adding all these young girls but i cant. i miss and love him with all my heart, my whole world has been turned upside down and all i want to do is talk to him. what do i do? was i right to leave? i feel so lonely can someone please help"
53,vulnerability,BreakUps,My relationship story :(,1,g86m9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/g86m9b/my_relationship_story/,2020-04-26 12:42:08,"When I was 13, I met a girl (EG) who I didn't find attractive at the time, but apparently EG did. I was 13, but I looked 11. A year goes by and we remain friends, but EG never revealed it to me. One day, my cousin gets a text from EG telling him that she likes me. Being the cousin that he is; he tells me. I didn't find her attractive at the time, but I thought it was cool that someone had a crush on me. 4 years go by and I start falling for her friend. Her friend and I have a bad falling out and I am destroyed. As I'm going through the pain of heartbreak, EG is there to comfort me. We talk for hours at night on discord. We would just joke and mess around and flirt a little bit. I started to grow feelings for her, but I wanted to make sure they weren't fake feelings because of the vulnerability I felt after the heartbreak before. I waited until I was completely over EG's friend before I can see my real feelings for EG. My friends would be in the call sometimes and always ask, ""When are you guys getting together?"" We would always play dumb, and never actually talk about it. My whole mindset was finishing 2019 without a girlfriend, and I did not want to break it. My best friend (BF) would ask me why I wasn't going for EG, and I would explain to him this story. My parents were having a high school reunion in Vegas, and to make a long story short, 3 years ago they had the same high school reunion and there was a girl, my age and lives in Florida, who thought I was cute, and I wanted to see what I can do for one night in vegas with her. I didn't want to have a girlfriend to stop me from flirting with this girl. After telling him this, BF reminded me that one night with this girl won't compare to a great relationship with EG. I thought about it, and I realized I was being stupid and go for someone who I like and likes me back. A couple of weeks go by, and I ask her out. We go out to watch the movie ""Joker."" There was friendly flirting throughout, but not much. By the end of the date, I tell her I really like her, and she felt the same way. It felt great, and I felt a good future coming my way. We start texting like we're a couple every night. I'm the happiest I've ever been. The only downside; her family can't know. Halloween comes, and I have a party at my house. It's going great, but then I see her go in my room alone, and felt like ""THIS WAS MY CHANCE!"" I follow her in, and we kiss. It was her first kiss. I could tell. It was still a great feeling. The rest of the night goes well, I say thank you to her mom for taking her and the night ends. She tells me that she will never break up with me, but if we ever do we know that both of us are mature enough to stay friends. I then go to Vegas and meet the girl (VG) I was supposed to try something with. We become good friends and me, being a good boyfriend, never tried anything. EG became suspicious about VG because I told her the backstory to it. I reassured her that nothing would happen, but what I didn't know is that EG will always have a problem with her. A couple of weeks go by EG's friend and I become friends again then EG and I go on another great date, and we make it official. However, I don't like hiding it from her family. I ask EG if we can at least tell her mom. EG agreed and tells her mom. The mom was fine with it and really liked me anyway. The real problem was EG's dad. EG's dad is a very strict and controlling father. EG is not allowed to leave the house without his permission, even if her mom says yes. Let me remind you that EG is 18 years old, and is being completely controlled by her dad. EG is his first daughter and he told all his daughters that ""When you're 12, I see you like you're 8. When you're 15, you're 12. When you're 18, you're 15. When you're 21, you're 18."" It's ridiculous. I told EG that, I believed that her dad would like me. I'm not the type of guy to hide from parents. I will be respectful and straightforward with her father. She believed that but was so scared to tell him. She told her mom what I said, and she hopes that he will open up someday. Because of this, we were only able to see each other 1-2 times a month. My mom thought this situation was kind of ridiculous. My mom called EG's mom and they had a good conversation. My mom said ""You should be lucky that my son is not hiding it from you. You know how respectful he is and how well he acts around you."" EG's mom agreed and said she would try and hint to EG's dad that she should be able to have a boyfriend. To make a long story short, she was never able to tell him. Despite how annoying that whole ordeal is, I had to ask myself, if she is even worth any of that bull shit. I believed she was. If I had to hide it from her dad until he was ready, I would do that for her. A couple of months go by and we finally tell each other ""I love you."" We go on a date on Valentine's Day, and I'm just gonna say it was.... good. 2 weeks go by, and quarantine has begun. Here's where the trouble comes. EG tells me that she's tired of hiding this from her father. She feels guilty and deceiving. She just doesn't know what to do. I offer the solution to just tell him. However, she said that that is something that just can't happen. We argue about it for hours, but we finally just cooled off. The next morning, I leave her a text saying, ""I think you need to figure out what you want. It's really not up to me to decide anymore. I do think we can get through this. This is just another hurdle in our relationship. Breaking up is not even an option for me because I love you."" EG decides that she's going to step back for the relationship for now. She said that this really isn't a breakup, but more as a halt. I clarified it with her. I know that this is a breakup. It completely broke me. I sobbed and cried for hours. I cried myself to sleep. I couldn't help but think that I did something wrong. For the first time, I don't know what I did wrong. Then I made a mistake in messaging EG 3 days later. I just checked up on her, and she said it was too early and I understood. 2 weeks go by, and I see that she's playing overwatch with our friends. I wanted to join and thought it was a reasonable time to start gaming again, but do not join the discord channel they are in. Our friends have been asking me to game with them for a while, so I just did it. We game for a bit and I see that she's muted in the voice channel, so I had the not so bright idea to type and ask ""Do you mind if I join the voice channel? If you don't want me there I won't join."" Without responding she just leaves the voice channel. I then type, ""I said it's ok if you don't want me in there. you don't have to leave."" She then types, ""no just join."" I then type ""are you sure?"" She then types, ""I'm not going to repeat myself."" I don't know why, but for how little that seems on the outside, it affected me a lot. It just wasn't how we used to talk. I joined the call for a bit, but I left because I just wasn't happy. A week goes by and I confront EG about it, and she says that she was just being straight forward and I shouldn't think much of it. A couple of more weeks go by and we have an argument about how she isn't even trying to be friends with me. She realizes it and tells me she's fine with having me in the calls at the same time as she and we can try and be friendly again. The next day, I join the call and everything seems good. She isn't on the call, so it's just me and our friends I type in chat telling her about my home situation. She doesn't respond after a couple of minutes and I say ""\[nickname\] hasn't answered my question."" She then types ""don't call me \[nickname\]."" I'm a bit taken back by that, but I just say ""4head still hasn't my question."" She then says ""don't call me that either."" I'm a bit confused. She then joins the call and I say, ""Hey. You still didn't answer my question.."" EG then says ""yeah I don't care."" I am now thinking ""Ok... She seems mad... I'm just gonna play and have fun, so if she wants to be mad at m for no reason then whatever."" The rest of the time we played, her friends would talk and she would laugh and have fun, but I talk she's rude and dry. I just didn't get it. After I left the call, I told BF about it, and he said that I should confront her about it because I did nothing to push her buttons. So I did. We then argue... again... She talks about why am I even gaming with them and she's not being rude just straight forward. I tell her that that is complete bull shit and she knows it, and we go on and she finally realizes that she fucked up. She apologizes for everything and wants me to give her another chance. I... give her another chance. Btw, between all this, I start talking to VG about this and I explain everything. VG and I start getting closer, but just as friends. I even did a petty thing with VG, which she agreed to do, which was, post a screenshot of us face timing on my Snapchat private story. I believed that after all this, EG wouldn't be dry and I wouldn't be confused anymore. The following week, she was dry with me every time we talked... I decided to just stop talking to her for a while. A week goes by and she asks me why I stopped gaming with her and her friends. I tell her how I haven't been myself and she's been dry with me. She then tells me that she isn't 100% yet and that's why. She understands how I feel and will try not to be dry. VG and I start face timing every other night, and she's telling me that I'm acting like I'm EG's bitch. I should know my worth. But I'm just so hung up over her that I can't let go. A week goes by and I just don't bother joining the discord channels when I play with EG and our friends. I'm kinda over the dry bull shit. Now that my mind has been everywhere, I get the bright idea to talk to EG's friend. The one I had a thing with before EG. Let's call her EGF. I ask EGF what her whole opinion about this is, and she tells me that she feels like we tried being friends too early, and EG needs to open up to me more because... SHE... STILL... NEEDS... SPACE... I can't believe I had to hear from her friend to find out that she still needs space. She also told me that EG has a problem with me talking with VG, but knows that she can't control me. EGF doesn't want me to give up on EG, and totally understands how I feel. EGF just really wants EG to open up to me and she said that Eg is supposed to talk to me soon. I tell my best friend and VG about this and they both say the same thing. I need to move on. I have been patient with her this whole time. I never once exploded my rage on her. VG tells me, ""if life didn't go it's funny way, and if I wasn't talking to some guy right now, I would totally go for you because you're a catch. EG doesn't see your worth and you need to see that. She is treating you like, you're still gonna be there when she's ready, but no. She needs to go for you."" That's what brings us to now. It's been a week since I had that conversation with EGF. EG still hasn't talked to me, VG is now sort of dating her guy, and I am alone and sad. It's been two months since we broke up. I loved her with all my heart. Maybe I loved her too much. She tells me to doubt her love but reading this from my perspective, you can see how I can doubt that. I'm honestly just stuck. The obvious thing to do is move on, but we didn't break up because we hated each other. We broke up because of one problem. But that one problem was strong enough to tear us apart. I'm sorry if there are typos. I was tearing up writing this."
54,vulnerability,BreakUps,Self-respect and Commitment,1,g8ok6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/g8ok6n/selfrespect_and_commitment/,2020-04-27 09:02:53,"I cant control her finding someone else more attractive of an option, but understanding why we feel the way we do is important to making healthy decisions and Im expressing a concern. Ive let her go, but just because people have rights to do things, doesnt make it the right thing to do, and if she wants to try to snuff out her feelings for me for someone else she has that right; but it doesnt make any of what she did to me okay in the slightest. So of course Im hurt. Of course Id prefer things were different. But I love her and its my duty to say something to someone that because its her right and her choice, the guilt shes feeling is the consequences of her own actions, and her own feelings, not ones Im pushing on to her or manipulating, and if nobody is watching out for her since I cant be for multiple reasons, then shes going to keep doing this to herself. Thats why its my duty to say something, I cant physically be there right now and wont be able to handle seeing her with someone else right now. Its a core value of mine to always try and find a way to help people I care about if I believe they are in need, and I had the self-respect to do that. I guess its just possible she believes that the people who dont get divorced, are the people who never have problems in the first place. That would be a legitimate compatibility issue, and probably the lies she was referring to feeling is the source of her guilt. Which worries me not just because I obviously want our relationship to succeed, but for her own mental health. I mean, if you dont ever have problems in a relationship, its more likely than not, that its because youre both just content and dont care about each other enough to be invested in losing each other. Sure, healthy partnerships have less significant issues, less frequently, but I got to know her underneath those issues and I know shes worth it to me. Unless someone helps her, shell keep jumping ship from relationship to relationship for the rest of her life searching for happiness in others, feeling rejection, and believing something is wrong with her all over again because shes chasing the high of the honeymoon phase and the lack of guilt she feels for feeling jealousy creep in. She has this deep rooted insecurity with jealousy cause of her moms jealous rages. She doesnt believe shes supposed to feel ANY jealousy at all, or shes a maniac. So then she bottles it up til it explodes. So Im pretty sure she wants to find a new relationship so she stops feeling guilty about how much jealousy she feels for me because she doesnt want to let herself feel like she deserves to own me. Im not gonna lie. I really dont want that to happen, but I cant do anything about it. Shes gone, for now at least, and I hope at most. I just have to believe shell come back one day because she is very invested in us; the guilt, the jealousy, these are natural signs of investment in and a longing for a relationship. She has unhealthy coping mechanisms, and like I said, doesnt have a healthy view on jealousy, probably partly reinforced by her shitty relationship with her ex right before me, and it makes her very controlling, as learned from her fucking cunt of a mom. Shes been working on it, but when she broke up with me last year, it touched a sensitive spot and I didnt realize that it started to bring out my controlling side too. We became toxic for each other for a short bit there, 3-4 months there, and because of it she believes its just a compatibility issue. I figured my shit out though, Ive done it before, but because it caught me off guard it looked like we were just toxic. As time goes on well heal, perspective will come to her and I. A 2 year relationship that wasnt toxic, just a person being toxic because of her pain, is not a toxic relationship. Not when I did everything to support her that I could, including push for her to get professional help and build her up after being kicked down her entire life by nearly everyone who she should have been able to trust. Which is why just cause shes probably pursuing someone else, doesnt mean I cant stay loyal and keep loving her just in case. Thats my decision and I own the consequences of it. Shes still growing and she still wants what anyone else wants, someone who truly loves her, and to feel truly loved. One day shell realize what that is and understand that she has that with me. She just has to learn that true love of herself comes from within. She said she has no feelings for me, but cant bear to talk about the proof that she still does quite just yet because it would shatter her with guilt, her jealousy. I know Im setting myself up to be a doormat, but love takes courage, something shes struggled to maintain with us and I dont fault her for faltering. Im well prepared now for her to take advantage of me though, for her codependency to come out when the next relationship ends and she realizes she has me on the back burner. I was once like her and we all deserve forgiveness for our mistakes. When she does return to me, for real, Ill be ready. Shell be afraid of feeling rejected by me though, because shes capable of no greater betrayal. She might even be overcompensating to not have me on the back burner by trying to shut down my feelings the way she is. Which is why I can only prove my acceptance of her and all her flaws by staying with her. I love you Noodle Legs, my Dick Turner. One day shell have to come to accept that me waiting for her is my choice too. I can handle my mental health just fine. I know what my limits are and in the event that I am taken off guard, I know I have friends and family who I can turn to to help me get my minds off of things. Ill heal, because I already and always respected myself with her, and Ill know when she truly isnt worth it if she ever isnt. Because thats what we discussed commitment was. Just because shes not capable of it right now, doesnt mean she never will be, because she wants to be. When I see that shes stopped caring about me and there truly is no helping her because she no longer wants to be in a committed relationship one day, itll hurt, and Ill have lost some time, but Ill be okay with that because I know what I want and made a gamble and lost. I will be able to recover from it and accept being just friends with her. I could just be in denial, but Ive made peace with that and it will only be revealed by time. I could be vicariously trying to forgive myself for my past sins, but Ive explored that possibility already and I forgave myself when I had the self-respect to stop punishing myself and walk away from my exs abuse. There are no rewards without risk. Theres no love without vulnerability. I have core values that I believe in and am standing up for. Core values she expressed she shared and theres evidence that she still does. Thats what guilt is, its understanding that youve betrayed something you hold dear. A value, or a person. If she no longer felt any possessive feelings left for me, like it seems she does, well then Ill know soon enough. She does deserve me if she decides she wants to be with me, as unpopular of an opinion as Im sure that is around here. So even though she reserves the right to see other people and pursue other desires, I deserve to choose to pursue my desire."

These are all the items I no longer want. They are yours because I agreed to send them to you if I wanted to discard them. Ive put off discarding them for too long to my detriment because of this. I think your self doubt/self loathing rubbed off on me- and it consumed a lot of my mental resources dealing with it. Ive learnt/relearnt self love and self compassion. Ive went through a 100 stages processing this break up. I feel it was necessary. I want to be able to spot trauma so I dont fall into terrible patterns again. Trauma attracts trauma because its familiar- i want to not bring mine into my future. Running away from it or simply pretending its not an issue does not work without compromising quality of a relationship through lack of complete vulnerability/authenticity. If i cant face parts of me, i cannot show my whole self to anyone. Furthermore, I feel a lot more confident in my ability to set and accept boundaries and communicate effectively. Lastly- when i was bargaining for your affection during the last couple months before our breakup and after out breakup- i gave you far too much credit for things - which i feel like you already know, and while i dont know how much credit is actually due-i know i taught me love- not you. You were just at that place at that tine. I wish you the best of luck on your journey to do the same. I hate that how beautiful you were was on of the reasons I fell for you. I feel its a perfect reason to fall for someone but i know i stayed for far too long for stupid surface level reaons. I feel our relationship was largely glued together through hormones and infatuation. I hate that it took all of me and till my breakup to find out and know for sure that i dont think either of us loved eachother. I knew when i realized that all your words were just empty promises. I dont think I believe in the kind of love we were set up to have."

I met this person (lets call him E/19) on Facebook and I immediately fell in love with the way he talked. Its like he was being an asshole to me yet at the same time making sure to not hurt me or sound serious whenever he said dumb shit, and idk i just loved the asshole who could be soft for me at times (he was also funny as hell and his good music taste makes me cry, its that good and thanks to him my playlist is full of amazing and beautiful old American songs ) Then at some point we started sharing pictures and I immediately told him the first time i saw how he looks like that he resembled G-eazy the rapper a lot lol. He hated the reference but he just gave me his vibes in terms of looks and especially with the slick back with a low taper on back &amp; sides haircut which apparently im in love with ( something i didnt know until i met E) Anyways, with time he opened up to me more which was something i loved because i could see that he trusted me and genuinely treasured me even tho he rarely showed it and he wasnt even the type to trust someone to that extent. Tbh, i was taken aback by his lifestye that was a complete mess the more i got to know who he was. He had an addicted brother and they always got into fights whenever E tried to convince him into getting rid of his serious addiction, and he was broke to the point where he started sleeping in his truck bcuz of the bed bugs, he smoked weed almost 24/7 and he got this ex drug addict girlfriend pregnant during a drunk night even tho they were already an ex-couple when they were having sex that night. I was seriously surprised how i didnt block him or why my attraction toward him didnt stop, in fact it got even bigger and it drove me crazy how he didnt look like he was surprised or confused that someone like me was so so SO attracted to him. Wed fight over silly things and Id threaten him to never talk to him again and hed be like  sureeeee and then he wouldnt text for real and Id start missing him so badly that I just give up eventually and text- like he was SO confident and SURE of how deep i was falling for him and I guess that made me fall for him even harder. Eventually we started flirting way too much and even having deep conversations sometimes and finally I decided to visit him after months of chatting online. I live in an European country and hes from the US so I used to visit him twice a month and crush with him for days.. The first time I visited and touched him and hugged him is when i was sure i fell deeply in love with this random guy who had a complete horrible lifestyle especially compared to mine. I couldnt stand staying at that place he called home the first time i visited but at night and just laying on his chest felt so much better than anywhere else and as cheesy as this sounds its the pure and honest truth, just touching him made me feel like i had everything i ever wanted and desired from life. We started getting serious (when it comes to the nature of our feelings) the more I visited and even though nobody voiced anything about dating and being official, he knew exactly that I was his and he also showed me the vulnerability in him that made it clear he was mine even if he never said it out loud . With time more ugly things started coming to the surface like how he smoked wayyy too much for an example , or how he treatrd me badly sometimes and talked shit to me, or how his friends used to hit on me behind his back, or how his financial issues grew bigger or how our different social status got to his head.. It didnt help how I realized with time that E wasnt just a bad boy type of person , but he was ACTUALLY a bad person to some extent. He was mean, ignorant and a heavily racist white boy who just didnt give a shit. With time i realized how toxic he was and how I started closing eyes on many shady/illegal or horrible things he done just because it was him. I come from a well off family and Im pretty(or so I was told) and I know I had to feel like he didnt deserve a person like me in his life and that he was just so fucking lucky for an ass like him to have a person like me head over heels for him but instead, i felt the complete opposite. I felt like he was all what I deserved. The real problems begun when his babymamas stomach got bigger, shed try to smoke behind his back and shed ask money from him all the time using the excuse of its for the baby just to make him more anxious over the fact that they were having a baby at 19. E was excited and couldnt wait to become a dad tbh despite the shitty circumstances tho (unlike his babymama), he looked for a new job and started saving money and dreaming about the life that hed afford for his babyboy and well, I kept visiting, and by the sixth month he was ready to move out to a better apartment and so he did, but this time along with his babymama to make sure she wouldnt do anything stupid. Then there is this one time when I visited again....When the plane landed he wasnt at the airport to greet me as usual so i went to his apartment alone, cleaned the mess that greeted me and waited for him to comeback. Apparently they had a checkup appointment and I grew so jealous that I had a fight with him when they got back which ended up with us having sex again. The next morning I suggested that id be taking care of the baby when hes born because his mom was leaving as soon as the baby is out of her womb, I even offered financial help but he grew so furious and called me a crazy bitch for wanting this and that I should wake up already bcuz my family would never accept a person like him and that we will never work out and this has to end eventually, and well the fight grew bigger and he slapped me and i slapped him back so he packed my bags and took me forcefully to the airport and told me to leave and never comeback.....this was one week ago. I cant stop thinking of him, his touch, his smell, his voice and his face ever since i came back home. Yes, there are times where it was too much for me to handle his attitude especially when things got physical,,, but idk, all what ik is that i miss him so damn much and im so in love with him and i just cant handle this feeling. Thinking of moving on and never looking back again feels so wrong on so many levels. E, You are honestly the pure definition of failure because even after moving out and getting a new job you are still a fucking mess, you are also a piece of shit and you are toxic af but i still love your broke ass so damn much, please why cant you just appreciate me more. I know you love me, i really do.. why cant you give us a chance??? Why am i not asking you to give us a chance yet even though i want to so badly.... I really do not think Ill be able to move on from this, at first i thought the reason why i liked him so damn much was because of the sex. He was good, and he knew every side of me and I wasnt embarrassed to show him every aspect of me and he wasnt intimidated at all by anything when it came to me or my sexual preferences. The bliss he made me experience each time made me think that what we had was just sexual, but our relationship was always beyond that. Under all this toxicity we have so much love to give to each other yet life just seems to be against it this love.."

I still can't go into it fully. Yet there were weeks and months where I would curl up for entire days, and a sense of coldness would sweep through me and my teeth would start chattering and I couldn't make them stop. It was the cruellest thing that ever happened to me - was madly and utterly in love with her, the pure kind, she slept with friends, enjoyed my pain, all that, everything. I spent so long utterly broken. I dreamt of suicide all the time but something in me told me to keep going. Only in the last few months have I recovered more. I realise what a great learning experience it is to be utterly destroyed. I realised I deserved it all. It's made me much more attractive as my maturity and DNGAF has soared and being handsome and a junior doctor, I have no shortage of choice. I've been with girls since, never more than casually, and whenever the slightest ounce of emotion arises within me, I cut myself completely off. I refuse to engage in any form of commitment on my part 100%. I don't mind when they get attached, I simply don't care at all other than it leads to better sex. I couldn't care less if things ended with me tomorrow. Regarding hook-ups, but also just relating to pretty much anything. I feel like everything is transient and it doesn't bother me anymore. If I begin to care, I leave myself or gradually just stop and usually find some bs justification to save their feelings/save face. I protect myself always. My walls seem unscalable. it worries me a little. I feel jaded and have a reputation as a player but deep down, it's not that. I'm just broken. I have absolutely no attachment to anyone (friends/family excluded). My being seems to revolt at the slightest hint of vulnerability. And plenty have been really nice and I would have probably pursued some further before. I just have no desire to ever put myself in that position of weakness again. I leave when things become anyway hinting towards seriousness and often just ghost girls I date. Something seems wrong with me. I want to live for just myself and untouched by those feelings again. The idea of a wife makes me ill. I feel part of me has died. I feel disgusted by the world. All I want to do is walk away."
58,vulnerability,BreakUps,For those of you struggling to move forward after a breakup,1,ffxk4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ffxk4m/for_those_of_you_struggling_to_move_forward_after/,2020-03-10 03:45:07,"You know what one of the biggest reasons why you arent able to move past the breakup? Its because you havent accepted it. Maybe youve accepted it in your mind, but you havent really accepted it. Its normal to be sad after a breakup, to miss the other person, to think about the good times. But when its over, you need to know that its over. Im speaking from experience, and one thing I learned is that not fully accepting the breakup makes the healing process that much more painful. When I didnt fully accept the breakup, (even though I had in my mind) I lived with these thoughts in my mind: - I wish he could see how well Im doing. I wish he could see me thriving, I want to show him that I was living my life well without him. I want to run into him when Im thriving just so I can prove to him that I could do it. Im doing better without you. - I ruminated about the relationship over and over in my head. From the very beginning to the end, I thought about all the details and the moments we shared, thought about all the things that went wrong. I thought about everything he had ever said to me and hurt myself over and over. - I made myself a victim. Albeit being cheated on at the end, I was not a victim to the relationship. I was just as immature and toxic, yet I saw myself as a victim. I painted him as this monster in my mind and scarred myself. This trauma made the moving on process that much harder. - I obsessed over whether he ever loved me or not. I obsessed over trying to decipher his psychology. I spent hours every day for months trying to learn psychology so I could better understand someone who I thought I knew so well but didnt. - I only saw things in black and white. I needed an explanation. I needed to have a story in my head of exactly what happened, why things didnt work out, and why I was betrayed. He was a narcissist, he never loved me... I tortured myself with extreme thinking. This pattern of thinking made me ruminate and obsess over the breakup for so much longer than I should have. I could not let go. I continued this thought process for over a year until I finally met someone else. But this thought process/incomplete healing carried over to my next relationship and played a big role in it falling apart. When I got out of the next relationship, I had a different mindset about the breakup that made things easier for me which are: - realize what I had done wrong. I thought about all the things that I had messed up on, about my shortcomings and immaturities that contributed to the end of the relationship. Resenting the other partner only makes it harder for YOU to move on. When I realized this, I felt more sorry and grateful than resentful and heartbroken. - just trust that the relationship was real when it was real. For too long I tortured myself wondering if my ex- ex ever loved me. But this time, I decided that it doesnt matter. Just believe that in the moments you shared in your relationship, the love was real. - stop looking back. Again, this is about not ruminating what happened in the past. Be grateful to have been loved when you were, but also realize that YOU are whats important now. Just think about this: Be grateful to have been loved, but realize that you are the most important now. I know breakups are hard. You wouldnt be human if it was easy. But just a change in your mindset can really help you shorten/mitigate the pain. Its a relationship. You never know exactly what happened in the relationship unless you were in it. Heck, even if you were, you only know your side of the story. Relationships involve intense feelings and vulnerability. It can be complicated and its never so black and white like youd wish it would be. Dont obsess over trying to understand everything because you never will. Just reflect back and learn what you can. Let yourself feel your emotions, let yourself reminisce the good times. Let yourself cry to our songs. But most importantly, realize that you are whats important now. Its your future and your life."

Ive been watching YouTube videos and reading articles. I also did this when I left my abusive rship years ago and realized he was a narc. It helped me put something that feels so hazy into clarity. Something tangible to associate with these complex feelings. I also started watching this guy Coach Craig on YouTube and while at first the videos seems like its all about winning back your ex, its actually more than that. Its about the feelings both parties are experiencing and how sometimes things just dont work out. The dumper is not going to contact you because theyre grieving in an entirely different way, they cannot let themselves show you their vulnerability. They cannot let you know the pain they are feeling because they believe their decision is right. One thing is clear, no contact is best. I also really enjoy being on this sub because it doesnt make me feel so alone. I see people who have been with partners for 1, 5, 10 years and have broken up. Were all feeling the same emotions and trying to get through this emotional turmoil. -from one broken heart to another"
61,vulnerability,BreakUps,HOW TO LET GO (LONG POST),1,fns14f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/fns14f/how_to_let_go_long_post/,2020-03-24 08:10:05,"TL;DR: A friend and I got too close, emotions got heavy, feelings were completely unresolved, it ended on a bad note. I need help letting go and arriving at a deeper understanding that this person is not worth any more of my energy. I'm terrible at letting go when I really cared for the person in question. I will preface this by saying I have a partner of 14 years who is completely aware of everything and has been helping me through it, with a great deal of patience and understanding. Our relationship is not sexually open, but he knows I get close with other people and understands that things like cuddling are not inherently sexual or sensual. We communicate freely and our relationship is healthy. And yes, I understand that this kind of situation is unique and admittedly can be weird for a 3rd party. Not everyone is cool with it. I get that. Both of us believe in platonic intimacy (mostly of the cuddling variety.) And now, the story. At the end of January, there was an intense three-day acting workshop at the acting school Im attending. I didnt work in it (couldnt afford it at the time) but I audited, and only for one day. It was fantastic, but intense from 10 am to 10 pm watching actors work is a lot. Its beautiful and its harrowing. When it ended, I was emotional, vulnerable, and touch-starved. And something clicked for me. I suddenly understood why actors are notorious for fucking each other. all of that high emotional energy and drainage has to go somewhere. Everyone went to a party afterward at one of the instructors houses to unwind. The first person to start a conversation with me was a fellow student called Jason. As we were talking, I just looked at him and asked him to hug me. He appreciated my bluntness about what I needed in that moment and gave it to me freelyit was long and it was healing. I hugged and spoke with several other friends throughout the evening, but something about his energy was so gentle and healing. So, its about midnight and I find some really good bourbon in the freezer. It doesnt take much for me. Then, the host suddenly needs everyone to leave at 1 am. This is unexpected, and I cant drive. Jason insists on taking me back to his place and calling me a lyft in the morning. Okay, cool. So once were at his place, we spend most of the night talking and just having a really nice time. When were finally ready to sleep, we just cuddle, and its so.good. Something both of us had a deep need for, and didnt realize it till we had it. In the days following, were texting non-stop, exchanging music, sharing our love for theatre, talking about doing scenes in class together, everything. Hes consistently telling me how much he craves and adores me which, you know, feels good. Among other things, like ""I'm a lovable soul. A precious soul. That I'm breathtakingly wonderful. That ""beautiful"" isn't enough to describe me. I'm watchable and desirable. That he felt like he found his long lost...someone from another life."" I feel inexplicably drawn to him. His energy is so warm and gentle. He seems to have keen empathy (our acting coach specifically points this out at one point while giving him feedback on work he's doing in class.) And, yeah... we're actors who have worked in front of each other. That's a level of vulnerability and understanding I have never had with anyone I've been attracted to. At one point I share some of my drawings with him and he says Youre making it easy to fall in love with you. So stop. I cant say I was surprised it tends to happen. So in response Im just like Haha, I was going to say, dont cause it does happen. And he says I wont. and I say Famous last words. .. So then a few days later, I go to his place to hang out again. Were cuddling, talking, listening to music. I cant stop wanting to kiss him, so after several hours, I do. 100% initiated by me, but he reciprocates. It turns into a.long make-out session. And holy shit is it good. Like I havent felt in ages. Ive been attracted to/vibed with other men since being with my partner, but never like this. All of them were ultimately selfish and acted entitled to things I couldnt reciprocate, so things never went very far, and the attraction died quickly. This feels entirely different. And yeahwe want to have sex, but for obvious reasons, we dont. Hes the first one to say We should stop.but I dont want to and I say I know, me neither.but we have to. So we stop, cool down, have some water, etc. He doesnt want me to leave, but I do. Because I like my bed at home. Ha. So all day the next day Im on such a high. Im so fucking happy and just riding the high from it all day. Its like the taste of him is still in my mouth, the smell of him is stuck in my frontal lobes. Just.making me crazy. So were talking about how good it was throughout the day and just carrying on as normal. Then suddenly he says We obviously cant keep this going, it never ends well. And I just wasn't ready to hear that at that particular point. I would have come to that realization later, obviously, but him just suddenly saying it was unexpected So were talking about it and he says If we were to continue, emotions would arise and. I have to protect myself against that. So obviously, I say I understand, and hes right, but Im still hurt by this sudden shift. I dont like the way it feels. So Monday comes. We see each other in class. Our interactions feel strange and awkward. When class is over, he goes to leave very quickly, Im standing outside with him and its cold. He says he doesnt want to wait for the bus so will probably walk home. I say I can drop him off, no problem. I do. The tension is so thick, the distance is so palpable. When getting ready to get out of the car, he opens his arms for a hug and I go nope, were getting out of the car for this. So we do. energy has completely changed. Its not tender and warm like it was. As hes walking away. I should have fucking said something but I didnt. He says Ill see you.. and talk to you.. with his back to me. CHRIST. We're actors!! There's no other way to read that. So I text him the following day saying If I did anything to make you feel like you had to put that much distance between us..please tell me. I want us to be able to talk about things. The distance was palpable. And he says Im just using distance to quell any lingering deep emotions. Just wanting the fire to go out, thats all. And that was the first time I saw you since that. Just dont want to confuse emotions and such. And I dont really want to keep talking about it, just want to move on. Okay so fuck. Two and a half days go by with no communication. Finally I send him a meditation video and he responds with Ohheyyy, I meant to let you know I switched classes. And I dont want you thinking it has anything to do with anything, but I cant help it if you do. ?!?THE FUCK IS THAT?!? For context.theres a Monday and a Wednesday class. The Monday class is always full because a lot of people, thats the only night they can come to class. The Wednesday class has nine people in it. He has been at this school for two years and just happens to switch at this time. Yeah. So I tell him the way I feel about it and he says Dont overthink it. I do that too so I get it, but dont. and Im like. Well fuck, since you seem to have zero concern or regard for any of my feelings, Im going to tell you what they are. Ive been hurting. The way you phrased your text about switching classes made me think that not only did it have everything to do with me, but that you wanted to make sure I knew that. I had asked the day before if we could hang out on this day, his last text was asking me what time, I told him when I was free.no response. I follow up asking him again. Its noon. He says hes out drinking and has no idea when he will be back and that I probably wouldnt want to see him drunk anyway. I tell him that if he doesnt want to see me he should just fucking say so, so I can stop wasting my time worrying about it. And hes like Cmon, this is why I have a rule about not doing things with anyone from class, but I broke it with you, and now Im dealing with that. So, fuck what Im dealing with I guess. We talk more intermittently throughout the evening, finally he invites me over I am dead tired but feel like I wont get another chance to see him, and I want some semblance of emotional closure before opening a fucking show (oh yeah, that's a thing that was about to happen...) because this whole thing has been way too much of a distraction. I dont really want to go.. yet I do. I get there, and hes not answering calls or texts. He lives in an apartment and theres a gate that locks from the outside, I stood out there for a bit and was about to get back in the car to leave, but then another resident just happens to be coming home. I get inside the gate, his front door just happens to be unlocked homeboy is OUT COLD on his couch. I sit and wait for a minute to see if hell wake.then gently nudge him. Hes fucking planet 19 high on mushrooms. So were trying to have conversations but obviously they arent very successful. It helped to be in his arms again, but I really fucking wanted him to be sober. I think maybe if I wait it out till the next morning, we can have a sober conversation.. after a lot of struggling I manage to lift/coax him into bed, and try to fall asleep myself, but hes snoring. That's where the I draw the line. The following day's texts are: You happened, right? Yes, I did. I was lucky someone was there to let me in the gate because you were unconscious when I got in Oh ya?! Yeah Sowwy. ?!? Since then, the distance remained. Our conversations were very clipped. It fucking hurts, and I hate it. This has never happened to me before and I dont know what I was expecting, but sure as hell not this. So a couple more weeks go by with no communication. One day I text him, I wonder if Ill see you again and he said Of course you will and I say Goodwhen? He says Not sure yet. I kept fluctuating between being mad at him and thinking hes absolutely not worth any more of my time or energy and then just..wanting him to hold me again, so badly. I told him I didnt want to be in a relationship with him, because I didnt. Just to be close to him and continue our conversations because they were really great, and that was why I got emotional when they ended because it seemed like he was enjoying them too and then suddenly there was. just nothing, and that was painful. I could still only guess at what he was feeling because he wouldnt tell me. My gut told me he was ghosting me because he couldnt fuck me or date me. It seems like whatever he was feeling, he was only able to deal with by avoiding me. Another week or so passes with nothing. Finally, I tell him I miss him (not just a simple text- I actually send him a picture of me holding a fucking sign with the words ""I miss you"" on it. Yep.) And the best he can do in response is send a kiss emoji. So then, I say ""I'd be so happy to be in your arms again, or even just to hold your hand. I know I can't give you everything that you want, but some is better than none, isn't it? I just want us to get to a place that doesn't hurt. Is that possible?"" His response: ""I don't know how to reply to these texts. Please stop."" So then..... a few more weeks pass. Finally I tell him ""I never meant to drive you away."" And he says ""You didn't. I just had to cut off the lingering emotions. We are all good."" Even after that, responses are intermittent and clipped. He won't even answer ""How was your day?"" texts. Won't respond when I send him songs. He's big into spirituality and energy, and is preparing to do an Ayahuasca ceremony - not in Peru, somewhere local. I tell him that I'm excited for him, and that I wish I could hug him and wish him well. He says ""You can wish me well!""..... I ask him for an imaginary hug. No response. Two more weeks. We've now arrived at last Wednesday. I text him just asking ""How are you?"" we have a casual conversation about stocking up on food (cause you know...) The following evening I call him, we catch up - he has withdrawn from our acting school after being there for two years and is now saving money to travel and preparing to apply to a few different schools around the world for clowning and physical theatre. He's clean, sober, and uh, celibate... (oh but, when I jokingly bring up the night he was on planet 19 and say I was glad I could get him into bed, he says ""Oooh..."" ?!) When I ask what his feelings are toward me, he says ""100% friendship."" I'm like...... not really what I was asking but, okay. I tell him I miss seeing him and he says ""Well, you remember what I look like, right??"" ?!!? We can still hang out right? Yes, as friends. Is cuddling okay? No, because it would be ""inappropriate,"" and not in line with his ""traditional values"" and ""if he gets a girlfriend, which is his objective, she would not be okay with that. So he can't, like, start that and then cut it off. It's gotta be one or the other."" ...... he literally keeps putting the ""as friends/we can do that as friends"" qualifier on everything like we're in high school. I tell him it's unnecessary and to please stop doing it. I know this pattern because I've seen it so many times. I know what's coming. I had the gut feeling weeks prior to this but I REALLY didn't want to believe it. He's going to meet a ""nice girl"" within the next six months, settle down, pop out a kid or two, and think about me as he fucks her in missionary position every night. (This is not me being arrogant or snarky. I am 100% speaking from experience.) The following day I message him, ""When I asked what your feelings were toward me and you said ""100% friendship"" that wasn't what I meant at all."" He says ""Well what did you mean? You have to be direct with me or I'm just going to default to assumptions."" I say ""Alright, real simple. Answer yes or no. Do you have love for me? Do you have space for me? Do you value my presence in your life?""..... ""Love? what kind of love?"" (FFS...) ""At one time you told me that I always have your attention and love. So, whatever you meant by that."" ""Yes but I meant the kind of love you have for a friend."" ""Yes, okay.... remember how I said you didn't have to put that qualifier on everything? We're not in high school."" ""Well I thought I've been pretty clear with you on everything so we either resolve and move on as friends or we don't."" and I say ""No no you have been quite clear. You have to keep me at arm's length because you can't stick your dick in me. Sad."" ""I don't need this in my life. Goodbye."" ""Am I wrong?"" ""Yep."" ""Then enlighten me."" ....nope. Couldn't even be bothered to argue or to defend himself. That was it. The end of everything. So.....wow. I'm really struggling here because, honestly, yes, my feelings for him went a little deeper than they should I have. (Yes, my partner knows.) I have no idea where I could have possibly gone with it had things continued but JFC, I wanted a better turnout than this. Ultimately I realize it is best we are not in contact. But I am shit at letting go, especially when I really care for someone. I haven't been in a ""breakup"" since I was 16. I love too deeply and I care too much... it's just who I am. Usually when someone fucks off it's for enormously petty reasons that have nothing to do with me and everything to do with their own jealousies/insecurities, so it's easy enough for me to cut ties. This is something I have never truly dealt with. I know there's no going back now. I really fucking thought he could be a person who showed up for me and loved me without expecting anything, and I was ready to be that for him. I was there even when he wasn't. I kept trying. I tried so hard. Even though we couldn't be together, I wanted to love him. I really struggle when someone mistreats me. Because I know who I am and that I don't deserve it. And not only that they can do it but not even feel bad about it. I know that absolutely no one is exempt from people being shit. But it honestly just.... baffles me. I know there's nothing I can do. I wish I there was some way to make him regret the way he treated me. To leave a trace of myself. To know I'm haunting him. I'm still trying to let go because it still hurts so deeply. I'm trying to find my way back to myself and to my work. This in combination with the isolation is not helpful. I can't focus and show up in my acting work. So, if you've got advice on how to let go, forget, move on...? and how I can FULLY AND COMPLETELY arrive at a deeper understanding that he is not worth another thought, tear, or breath... PLEASE share it. I need all the help I can get right now. If you ACTUALLY read this far, I am extremely grateful. Thank you. &lt;3"

I'm fortunate enough to have a strong support system and I was super lucky to meet a couple of people who helped me tremendously in processing the breakup and my emotions. I haven't been on this sub in months, but just yesterday I realized that it's a good idea to share my experience with you. I know a lot of you here have just been broken up with and it hurts like hell. Hopefully, my post or parts of it will help you in one way or another. 1. **You will want your ex back.** And that's okay. If the ending was abrupt and you were given bullshit excuses for it, you'll need time to detach. Chances are you are still in love with your ex to some extent, so wanting them back in your life is natural. If you were left for someone else, the dumper had already attached themselves to another source of happiness and lovey-dovey emotions before breaking things off with you. They have a head start and you will think it's unfair, but the sooner you accept things for what they are, the sooner you'll be able to focus on healing. 2. **If you were left for someone else or if your ex moved on quickly, you will inevitably compare yourself to the new person.** While it might not seem like the most productive or helpful thing in the world, it is natural and just another part of the healing process. You will either feel inferior to this person or wonder how your ex lowered their standards so much. It's okay to feel the way you feel about the other person. It's natural curiosity and if you use it right, you'll maybe find areas of your life that you need to work on. In any case, with time you'll realize that it's not about who's better. We're all different people. We all bring different things to the table. It's all about timing. 3. **If there was another person involved in the breakup, I want you to know that it's okay to label what your ex did as cheating.** My ex swore that he never got physical with the person he left me for before he broke up with me, but for a couple of months he'd stay late at work to play cards or board games with his colleagues or spend every Friday night with them, using this time to establish a bond with this new person, effectively dipping his toes in emotional cheating. To this day I'm still not sure if he slept with her or not while we were together and at this point it doesn't even matter, but for months I was reluctant to label his actions as cheating. Why? Because he told me he didn't sleep with her. The moment you acknowledge they did you dirty (for me it was labeling what he did as ""cheating"") is the moment you start truly healing. 4. Speaking of cheating, there was this breakup coach-lady whose name I completely forgot, but she had an article about cheating and something she wrote in it has stuck with me to this day. It was along the lines of: ""**While you may have provided a fertile environment for cheating, the choice to cheat is theirs and theirs alone.** An emotionally mature individual will sit you down and talk to you about what's not working for them in your relationship. An immature individual will seek another source of happy hormones"". So if you were cheated on, don't blame yourself. Chances are, if your ex cheated on you, they also tried to shift the blame onto you. 5. You'll want them to experience the same pain they caused you. **You'll want karma to catch up to them.** How come they break your heart and get to walk around with their new boo and no care in the world while you haven't been able to function properly in days? Not fair! In the end, and I promise you this, it will not matter what happens with your ex. A year, or two, or maybe even five, you will not give a damn about what's going on with them. 6. **Healing is non-linear.** I remember that three months after the breakup I felt like I had already moved on. Boy was I wrong! Shortly after, I was hit with another wave of anger and sadness. The important thing in these cases is to not bottle things up. If you do, your repressed emotions will find a way to manifest in one way or another - headaches, waking up multiple times at night, having trouble sleeping, maybe even having nightmares and panic attacks. Cry your heart out, scream in your pillow, maybe punch it a couple of times. It will benefit you in the long run. 7. **Use this time to grow.** Yeah, I know. The last thing you wanna do after having your heart broken is to get off the couch and learn how to crochet or write hiragana. It starts with personal growth. Try to identify what parts of you need to be worked on. Dig deep and when you feel like you've hit the bottom, dig even deeper. Even months after the breakup I kept discovering things about myself that I had to work on. Give yourself permission to be emotionally vulnerable and use that vulnerability to transform yourself into someone you'll be able to love and support your whole life. I thought self-love was just indulging in unhealthy food every now and then, but now I know self-love for me is accepting my mistakes and flaws and learning to live with them. Contrary to what I've always thought, I don't need to be perfect. I need to be me. 8. **Your appetite will probably be non-existent.** I had trouble stomaching any type of food for a lot longer than I want to admit. It's needless to say that this is extremely unhealthy and not worth it. I remember how the morning after my ex broke up with me, he was already telling me about what he'll have for lunch while I was sitting there wondering if I'll ever be able to taste food again. What helped me was eating out with friends and family or having them over for dinner as often as possible. I don't know if my brain was automatically mimicking what the other people were doing or deep down I just felt less anxious around them, but it helped put food in my mouth and I'm grateful for that. 9. **Move your body!** This is incredibly important. I'm sure many of you have already heard or read how important it is to exercise after a breakup, because it helps you cope with stress and anxiety. And it does, that's totally true! But I want you to know that it took me months to get my ex out of my head while running on the treadmill or jogging in the park. The first month was the hardest. I'd often tear up in the middle of a workout routine and risk falling on the treadmill because of my blurred vision. It's not worth suffering a probably permanent injury because of someone who probably won't care to check in on you if you do. So be sure to move your body and be sure to let your emotions flow freely, but be careful to not mix those two up. And if you don't feel like hitting the gym, at-home practices are amazing! Even a simple 30-minute walk in the park can help improve your mood. 10. **There will be times when you'll be out with friends and everything will be going well, people will laugh and have fun, but you'll be sitting with a drink in your hand and a fake smile plastered on your face and your mind occupied by the breakup.** It used to happen a lot to me in the first couple of months after the breakup. It's okay. This too shall pass. 11. **You will be irritated every time you hear that your ex doesn't deserve you and that time will help you heal and find someone else.** But it's true! Your friends, family, online breakup gurus, and just pretty much any random person that tells you time will help you heal is right. That doesn't mean it's not frustrating to keep hearing it. But that's okay! It's just another part of the healing process. Right after the breakup I couldn't even imagine what it would be like a year later. I thought I'd never stop loving him. I thought I'd always be in pain. Well, everyone was right. I'm no longer hurting. 12. **The goal is to reach neutrality.** Right now I'm at a place where I neither love nor hate my ex. I think maybe a small part of me will always hold some love for him, but that's it. I can't control his actions and neither can I control the outcome of this (or any other) situation. It's enough that I take responsibility for my own actions and choices. Let the dumpers take responsibility for theirs. 13. **You will probably overanalyze everything they said during or after the breakup.** I never got that ""I miss you, let's get back together"" call or text that breakup gurus promise you'll eventually get from your ex and it used to make me super sad. ""Am I not worthy enough to be breadcrumbed?"" That's what I used to think. It was just another manifestation of my need to control the outcome of this situation. It's okay if you get that call. Maybe your situation isn't as dire as mine and maybe there is a chance for you and your ex to reconcile. All breakup stories are different. But it's also okay if you don't get that call or text. You just keep living your life in the best way you can. You need to put your own happiness first. Your ex sure as hell won't do that now. 14. **If your ex doesn't contact you, that doesn't mean they have forgotten everything you two have shared in the past**, even if that's what they told you when or after they broke things off with you. I used to think the 5 years we were together didn't mean anything to my ex, because that's what his behavior during and after the breakup made me believe. It took me a while to realize that you can't just forget someone, especially a person you had something good going on with for an extended period of time. I have people that I only ever dated for a month or two and to this day I still think about them and wish them well. It's crazy to think that a committed relationship that lasted years can be forgotten in days. 15. **You won't be able to make sense of your ex's breakup reasons for a while.** Before he got with me, my ex had another long-term relationship. He was left in pretty much the same way I was by him. I still can't wrap my head around how you can put someone you supposedly loved through the same excruciating pain you had to go through in the past. It's beyond me. In some cases, and I think especially when there's a third person involved, your ex will resort to plain bs to explain why they've decided to end things with you. You will overanalyze every word they say to you, but with time you'll realize they just didn't know what to say - either because they didn't want to hurt you or because they wanted to alleviate their guilt. I kept replaying the breakup in my head for months in an attempt to find a similar story online that had a happy ending - and back then a happy ending for me was getting my ex back. I kept reopening an wound that should have stayed closed in order to heal. 16. **Don't blame yourself if you keep reopening said wound.** It's probably different for everybody, but it did take me more than half a year to stop watching breakup videos or read breakup articles that gave me false hope. 17. At one point you'll have to face yourself and honestly answer the question - **do you really want them back?** Half a year after my ex broke up with me I thought I'd be able to forgive him and give him a second chance - should the opportunity ever arise. More than a year later I realize I won't be able to ever trust him again and I don't want a relationship that lacks trust. 18. **You need at least a year to truly feel at peace with the breakup.** This one is probably the most controversial point in my list, because healing after a breakup is an individual process, but hear me out. My ex broke up with me two days before Valentine's Day. So I had to go through Valentine's day, his birthday, our anniversary, my birthday, and the winter holidays without him. When we were together, he used to be the first one to call me on my birthday or when the first snow of the season started to fall. When I went through all these holidays and special occasions without him, it was like my brain fully registered the reality that this person is not in my life anymore. In a way, I think it's better to trick yourself into believing that your ex has been sent to another planet or time traveled to the Renaissance period. 19. **It's okay to take your time dealing with your ex's belongings that you still have at your place.** After I found out about the other person, I put all his clothes in a bag and hid it in a small closet that I had no other use for. I just couldn't throw away his things. Months passed and I got involved with a charity organization that needed lots of male clothing in good condition. What I coincidence, I thought. I also needed some free space for my new board games, so it was a win-win situation. 20. I like to stay that **when you're in the eye of the storm, all you see around you is dark clouds**. The storm will pass. I promise you. One day you'll wake up and they will not be the first thing on your mind. It took me a little over a year, but I can safely say I'm in love with life, with myself, and... with another dude. Things will be fine. Stay safe, everyone!"

I dont want to remember being entranced by the smell of his cologne, the sweetish salty aroma of his genitals, or the sound of his voice. I dont want to remember how connected my heart felt to his, while he pushed me away from his heart space and his vulnerability. I dont want to remember how much and how loudly he made me laugh. I dont want to acknowledge how big this hole in my soul is since you left me. I am in pain without you every single day."
64,vulnerability,BreakUps,How do you deal with the unbearable nausea and headaches in the days to follow a breakup?,1,f0at4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/f0at4g/how_do_you_deal_with_the_unbearable_nausea_and/,2020-02-08 00:56:26,"We met when we were both very young, and both fell head over heels in love with each-other. Things progress quickly over the next 2 years as we began planning our future and discussing our hopes and dreams. It was an incredible relationship, so healthy, would never do anything to deliberately hurt the other person during (rare) arguments. I felt completely unstoppable with him. Hed hold my hand and I could fly. I felt like a goddess, my final self, my best version. He made me blossom. And then all of a sudden its gone. He holds my hand, you know I love you. And with those words my eyes flooded with tears. That night I had been laughing, talking over dinner and asking about his day. And then I blink and hes staring into the distance as I choked on my own vulnerability. What followed was far from malicious. We both cried as he explained hes too young to make such a strong commitment and that its nothing to do with me. Those words haunt me. He will always be the one that got away. Too young and naive for so much. And the worst part is I understand him. I want to be mad but I cant. I want so badly to hate him so I could at least have a reason to move on too. But I love him more than ever. And the thought of dating someone else makes me sick. Im finding it hard to eat, I keep gagging on every attempt and lose my appetite on the first bite. I have no motivation to do basic things like shower and brush my hair. I feel like a shell of a human. When I finally let my guard down it all crumbled. I told myself that she wont have to go through this again. And Ive failed her once more."
65,vulnerability,BreakUps,Its been 8 years since. But no woman has come close to matching up to my ex. Is this normal?,1,f0rcus,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/f0rcus/its_been_8_years_since_but_no_woman_has_come/,2020-02-09 00:08:16,"I went out with this girl in highschool for two years. She wasn't conventionally drop dead gorgeous but still cute and pretty. She was pretty crazy about me from the get go. It took me a bit longer but I slowly fell for her. Eventually I was so in love with her, other women just felt bland (best way to describe it) We had fights sometimes like normal but we were overall great together and the sex was fantastic. The relationship ended because her parents decided she should go to univercity on the other side of the planet and she was tired of fighting them about it. We tried long distance but I eventually ended it because I could see she would be better off without me. Well, it turns out I was right, a few months later she had a new boyfriend and I was probably still on a bender figuring out how much weed and liqour it takes to make you forget what month it was. I eventually did get over it and got on with my life. She's even getting married now and I couldn't be happier for her. The problem is that now, 8 years later, other women are still as bland as before. I can tell if they're hot and enjoy looking at hot chicks any day. But even then I judge beauty standards by how similar thier features are to my ex. And even if they're hot it just feels bland, like when you're sick and have no appetite. You can tell the food looks and smells good, but you just cant get yourself to eat anything. I was in another relationship for half a year in 2015/2016ish. I definiteley developed some feelings but they were fairly weak. I felt like I was doing both of us a disservice by pretending to love her so I broke it off. I probably have a hard time allowing myself to be vulnerable as a defense mechanism. And intimacy requires vulnerability. I also havent had sex in 8 years. I'm a bit socailly conservative that way and random women in bars are even less appealing to me than the average. The other girl I was with was a virgin (I broke it off before sex on purpose, I know how attached you become from it). Anyways, I've started the P90X workout regime (always a good classic workout) and am eating better. I think if I can make it a bit easier to get laid and force myself to sleep with some broad once and for all it might make things better. What do you think? Should I? Is this normal? Has this happened to you? Sorry for the long post, and thank you in advance for any advice you can give me. Cheers, and I wish you well."
66,vulnerability,BreakUps,Unable to tell if she's passively reaching out or just spiting me. But it's killing me inside.,1,f0wo1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/f0wo1p/unable_to_tell_if_shes_passively_reaching_out_or/,2020-02-09 06:50:24,"To make a long story short, my ex uses a number of similar platforms as I do online, granted we live far and beyond each other and no longer have the risks of crossing paths that way. This was a 4 year relationship that ended back in October, with mutual communication ceasing in December. I make sure to avoid her like the plague for my own sake, and we attempted friendship that got turned into a very bad falling out over money (she wanted reimbursement for gifts, ones that I never asked for: she is not the most genuine person on the planet). She told me to leave her alone, she no longer had positive feelings towards me and that she's moved on - I should too. Didn't speak to her again starting about a week before Christmas. Some time 3 weeks later, she messages me simply asking for money again regarding a gift she got me last year. I ignored it. Another week and some change later, through a shared platform (one a game, another a chat server) she approaches me in silence or indirectly, says nothing, idles, leaves. That's it. The chatroom, in particular, she makes a short profile change that reads ""im better than u"" for probable self reassurance or more likely to try and snidely comment at me. I do not respond or engage. Most recently, so another week and some change later (so now, February), I am having a conversation with a mutual friend that she scarcely communicates with, granted we apparently share this group chat (hard to know, she never used it). She attempts to hijack or insert herself into the conversation so I drop it, start up another one about an hour later, and she does it again. So these few interactions have spurred great anxiety in me, to a point I am dreaming about her again in trying to decipher her intentions. I doubt she misses me. She has nothing but resentment for me. So I do and don't understand and try to read it beyond surface level. I so badly want to reach out to her but she has used and abused me and my emotional vulnerability so many times as it is. Has slandered my name, lies compulsively, makes me out to be a thief. Among other things. She refused to see wrong and apologize once things escalated, she seemed to before until I got serious about wanting to break up over these issues. I don't know anymore. I'm already drained and helpless feeling. I can resolve the issues in theory and have spoken some of it over with my therapist and whatnot, but that nagging feeling keeps crawling back in. It's embarrassing that I give so much stock to things that matter so little."

Arguments are characteristically disruptive, they are a clash between two different opinions. | Im not saying its scary to do it, but there are probably better methods to spend your time than talking to a brick wall | They will not change their mind due to one person. It takes a collective voice Ex: this here feels like me talking to a brick wall Me: Nah Ex: i am a collective voice i am a representation Me: I dont think you should be speaking for all the pro choices...imo Ex: why not Me: There are those that choice to be pro choice because they have severely been disregarded by their community. | I dont think you can speak for all those that have been raped | I mean there are other reasons but you get what I am saying | Choose your battles [Her Name]. And to choose your battles you need to understand your personal goal and the outcomes of the encounter Ex: the outcome is me using my voice regardless of whether or not somebody listens to me. clearly you do not understand what it means to be passionate about something bigger than yourself. i can speak on behalf of rape victims and women who have been abused as i have and people of low income people of different backgrounds. because their voices are continuously silenced through culture legislation and the harmful idea that nothing can be done. if i would have been too afraid to perform my speech on racism, i never wouldve gotten the out one i did which was unexpected even though i didnt reach everyone i made a difference opened peoples eyes. its on them if they agree or not but no one is more powerful than me and the passion i have for advocating for other peoples rights Me: A little hurtful... I am passionate, this is something I am not passionate about(compared to you, clearly). What Im passionate about is helping people, having the knowledge to give them the quality of life they deserve. I like to treat every human the same, I dont truly understand the life they have lived, so that gives me no authoritative judgement to say that they are right or wrong. I will speak, but not on matters that prove to be non-constructive. And I still dont think you can speak for rape victims. You cannot full heartedly sayI can speak for you, I know the experiences you have experienced, the sadness, the feeling of hopelessness, to the extent that you live. I know that I will be able to say everything you want to say. Remember the best source is always primary. If you feel that they are silenced, aid them in speaking their voice. They are the best source for the experiences they have lived, not a person that they have only spoken to. You have only experienced secondary hearing. They have experienced every sense to a primary degree. Again, not saying youre afraid. It is on them to agree but when they already have a set opinion, Chance of change is slim to none. Instead set your focus on partnering with pro-choice individuals and create some form of organization for those on the fence if you truly are passionate as you speak. | But your life is yours. You will make the ultimate judgement in the things you do | Btw throwing insults like clearly you do not know what it means to be passionate... is not proving your previous statement of being level headed. Insults wont get you far in life and only will provide an environment of anger Ex: i say that because it is true it is not an insult if you take offense thats a personal problem. i say that because you dont understand. you do not knoww what i have been through and for you to judge and assume is wrong. someone has to be raped for them to be valid as a representation? do you have to suffer from stage 4 cancer to help your future patients? the circumstances dont matter when i am a woman and thats all i need to be a representation. even a man could be a representation and voice for those who cant or wont speak out. i say that you are not passionate and dont understand because maybe you havent been involved the way i have but in saying those things i am honestly devastated hearing that from you. as a future professional in the medical field, i am disappointed that you have this ugly worldview on life. like weve discussed before, you think everything is an argument and confrontational and it doesnt have to be. i am the lion and people like you are the prey. that is the root of the problem, that people think its nonconstructive. imagine you have a patient who has been violated and they are too scared. you have no idea what it means to represent. this man is not an aborted child is he? so then what makes him the representation? the only thing he represents is the people who continuously fear people into thinking that they cant do anything. its not about changing their minds its about speaking MY mind and refusing to allow the alt right other such people to continue silencing people and taking away their rights and their autonomy. i actually have helped people who are victims i do so more thank you but fixing the issue starts at the root of the problem. all of the things youve said have been insulting to me as a woman, as a person, as an intellectual, and as an advocate. but not only that but to the people who i aim to fight for. THAT is how you create and provide a better of quality of life. | i could never imagine myself with that mindset it is so much more harmful than you think. | respectively, i can no longer take part in this conversation or any future conversation with you. the work i do changes lives. i hope one day you are able to open your mind and your heart to the truth i have spoken and i mean no ill intentions. Me: Youre wrong about your first statement, I explained what I am passionate about. Because I do not share the same methods of expressing my beliefs does not give you the right to say I am not passionate about anything. Do you think a raped person that remains quiet is not passionate about their situation? I hope you say no, otherwise I dont know what to tell you. Youre right I dont know what youve been through, but this can be flipped to your understanding of others. Speaking for others and helping others are two different things. I do not need to know their experiences when dealing with their condition, I only need quantitative indicators to treat. Sure understanding their trials and tribulations would help, but that alone does not cure a disease, unlike qualitative measures data. Do you think a man has the right to sayI know what a raped victim feels like, Im friends with one. Its like saying I can say the n word because My best friend is black. No, you do not share the same experience as those who have suffered. And to say you do is an insult to them. Another analogy, someone has recently lost a loved one, it is Ill advised to start talking about your losses, instead help maintain on the topic and aid them in understanding their situation. Your situation is nothing like theirs. Again throwing insults. ...you have this ugly worldview on life. We are having a conversation, I have not insulted you... Like I said, if you think they are being silenced let them speak. Help them convey their experiences. They know what they have truly gone through, you only have a glimpse. Then speak YOUR mind. Dont represent for those that you have not experienced. Sure, you can state experiences you have heard, but do not so it in the manner of definitive passion stating that THIS person wants THIS unless they have given you the right to say it for them. The root of the problem is not a presentation in the environment of other pro-lifers. Work with cases where people are still on the fence, they contribute to the bulk and will feed towards the movement. The more voices you have the more likely you are to switch the more stubborn of minds. I do not mean to insult you. What parts did I say, specially, have induced a manner of insults? Not saying to not fight for them, but you state that you want to speak for them. Their voice is not yours. They have different motives than yours. | If you cant even have a conversation with me, how are you able to have a conversation with someone with the complete opposite mindset? | Im going to let you know this. I am on the fence. I believe that a woman has the right to say what happens to her body, but I also have the belief that unborn children do not have voices and have no say in what happens to their life. Start with people like me. You will gather a greater following with those on the fence rather than those already on the deep side Ex: i can do it all. | they have to give me the right to say it? do you hear yourself | so then who is fit to represent? | what about low income families who cannot afford a child Me: I mean yeah... what if some uneducated person started saying they can speak for Hispanics | It would provide a poor reprenatation Ex: i cannot believe you just said that Me: What do you mean? Explain Ex: i am educated Me: Not saying you... | Im saying that if anyone can speak on others behalf it risks uneducated people speaking for others | When social norms are applied, they are non discriminatory and are applied to everyone | In terms of representation. Represent what you truly know, not what you may think you know | Im not versed in pro-life or pro-choice but one argument for income problems is adoption | I dont know the intricacies of this debates situation so I do not have a say | See what I mean. What if I started to represent that case without any knowledge. I would only bring false representation Ex: im a woman and by that i am representation because this is legislation against my being my autonomy my person. Me: Yes you are able to represent a woman. No man can say what its like to be a man. But apply that to those that have been raped, those that have experienced things you have not | Woman* Ex: but i have been okay [my name] i am a survivor | as you said only say what you know not what you think you do Me: What does that mean? | The survivor part | What are you trying to imply Ex: that was the last straw im done with this | if you dont understand then i dont know what else to say. Me: ... I am confused | If someone is confused you wouldnt explain? Like thats the core moment when trying to persuade a person to the other side Ex: its self explanatory read it again use your common sense Me: Like what are you a survivor of? I dont know your life and dont know what you have survived, I cant use common sense for that Ex: why do i have to explain my life to you Me: I can guess but it would be wrong of me Ex: its already been wrong of you | stop acting modest Me: You dont. But you said you survived something, just trying to get an insight | Why should I stop acting modest... | Like Im not even kidding, if you shared this conversation to others they would say I have not said anything bad about you Ex: i am a a rape survivor so you can shove everything you said down the gutter you reek of ignorance. you havent said a single bad thing about me plays no role in this conversation. start with your self thats where the changes need to happen. i SHOULD NOT have to explain my life and what ive been through as some kind of validation for you as you seem to disregard and be insensitive. people like you are the problem | i am now going to stop responding to this conversation. please stay away from me and my life. Me: Im truly sorry that happened to you, and I could never know what it would ever feel like. But this is your life and if you dont want me in it, then you have the right. I wish you best in all your endeavors. | Just so you know, this conversation does not taint your record in my books at all. I still think you are a passionate strong willed woman that will go on to do amazing things in her life. Too bad I wont be in it. Ex: it has tainted your record Me: Sad to hear that  [she blocked me after but I sent her this] Me: Oh hey btw. You may not consider me a friend anymore but I still care about you, I care about everyone. If youre still hurting from your experience dont feel like you cant reach out to people about it. There are many resources online. You can also attend support groups. They can help you challenge your feelings of powerlessness and vulnerability. The number one step of coping is always opening up about what happened. Anyways, let me know if I can help in anyway, I never turn down a friend in need | I did some research, because it personally effects me now, in the people I care about. Thank you for educating me"

That I wanted to paint together, to show you what I knew and to learn art and colour theory from you because that's what you were good at. This is not even mentioning the money I spent on you to encourage YOUR hobbies, to support you, and that all benefit me none except wanting to see you do well and caring for you! So no.

It's really easy for me to be hard on myself when I check up on him in a moment of weakness, or when I go through old photos, or hurt my own feelings by looking up the new girl he's been seeing. But lately even on my hardest days I've noticed a major difference in my strength. Yesterday I hovered over clicking that girl's profile for about 10 minutes before deciding to clear it from my search history. This past weekend I almost called him drunk in the bathroom, but instead turned my phone off and went back out to the dance floor. I can spend all day beating myself up for even having those moments at all, or I can be happy that they're small signs of moving forward. I wish I could thank the people in this sub enough for sharing their vulnerability and reminding me that I'm not alone in the pain and the struggle. I wish I had you guys two years ago when it happened the first time. So thank you for being here now."

I can't completely understand what you're going through but I like being comforting to you. That's kind of fucked up to say. That I like to 'find joy in your vulnerability.' I don't Not saying you said that. No one did. I'm just clarifying for this thread. I do find passion in being able to allow you to know that you have someone with you at all times. No matter what. I find a passion that I can comfort you and that I'm able to check on the person who means the second most to me in my life, right after my grandmother. I know I can't be on much help to you when you're having rough days. I'm sorry that today, well yesterday technically., you had a rough and bad day. I hate to hear about it but I let you know I'm available for you. I didn't mean to make fun of you when we were texting. I didn't expect my message to come off in such a way when I was joking about you finding a man who can cook for you and laughing that you mom interrogates every guy you have come over. I didn't mean to be so insensitive. I know you were having a bad and I was trying to cheer you up. I know you didn't want to deal with your drunken mom and when you tell me the things that happen it really hurt me because I care for you. I'm glad you were able to eat some food today/yesterday. Its shame your mom doesn't buy food for the house. I didn't ask if you ate dinner but you probably didn't. I don't know. I really liked that you found comfort in me in my conservative lifestyle. Not a political &amp; social philosophy, though I'm sure my conservative side may tick you at times. I know you don't express emotions but I can read you pretty well. The comfort that you find in me is that you know I don't drink, smoke, vape, or do drugs. I know you felt safe with me because you really don't like the way your mom acts with alcohol. I guess my trait is a safety blanket. And I like that you're able to feel safe with me :). I hope you have a good day tomorrow, Love. Do good on your swim meet and eat some food at school. I know it's not the best but please eat something. I'd drive to you can get you food if I could but I can't sadly. 1150 miles. \~Baby Boy."
77,vulnerability,BreakUps,Thankful,1,eoekps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/eoekps/thankful/,2020-01-14 13:13:31,"I have this neighbor who can be a little much sometimes. She's an older woman who always seems to come over right when I'm having a quiet moment to myself. She pounds on the door shouting my name until I answer and will then talk to me for ages no matter what I'm doing. Recently she did her usual thing coming over at the worst time. I opened the door with tears pouring down my face. My s/o had just broken it off and not in a kind way. She started babbling on about bringing me oranges and then stopped short when she saw my face. I told her what happened and she comforted me in her way. I'm in a new area far from home with very little social network. She knows this and told me as she pointed to my car and my little house. ""You be strong! These things you have you did on your own. They are yours and no one else's. You should be proud of you accomplishments and indepence."" She went on for awhile some of it helpful, some of it a tangent about crazy men who kill their wives, but finished with a hug and told me she loved me. Since then she knocks on my door frequently. With plates of food and fruit. Between that and some things that escalated in relation to the breakup, I ended up having to share the news and some details with my higher ups at work. They were floored. Offered me cookies and support, and gave me whatever leave I needed to ensure I had the time I needed to recoup and that any affairs were in order. I made a friend. They're going through a divorce and are in therapy too. We talk about the ways we're trying to grow, how we take care of our mental and physical health, share music, and they don't bat an eye when they ask how I am and I end up spilling my guts about barely eating for a week and the mental stress sneaking up on me and hitting me with a funk. Despite hardly knowing each other for any time at all. I'm thankful for each of these people because that was probably one of the hardest things to swallow when it ended. How alone I felt. So far away from family and friends. I've always been transparent, though perhaps not vulnerable. Vulnerability paired with strength is something I'm working to achieve. After a break up it's easy to want to become the force of nature I know I can be. Impenetrable, unshakable, and intimidating. But I didn't really have that option this time. Not if I wanted to get through this and do better next time. And frankly I didn't want to be impenetrable anymore. So I was vulnerable. Sometimes to complete strangers. And just within a week I've found myself with a little community of support and budding new friendships. So I won't let this experience break me. It didn't and it won't. I will continue to be honest, vulnerable, transparent, and fierce. I can walk through fire, but I don't think I have to this time. I'm ready to do better things and make better choices for myself. So if you're going through a breakup too, just remember that there are people out there who will love you and help you heal. Friends or strangers, they are there. You just have to let go and let them in."
78,vulnerability,BreakUps,"Our entire relationship was a lie, but am I wrong to still love him?",1,epkbe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/epkbe9/our_entire_relationship_was_a_lie_but_am_i_wrong/,2020-01-17 01:51:37,"Hi, new Reddit user here. My ex (22, M) and I (22, F) just split after a little more than two years together and I was completely blindsided. About a year ago, we had a fight about being together after we graduate undergrad (we are graduating this spring). I was ready to be long-distance, but he said that he didn't want to be with me after college. We talked later and he gave a really good reason for why he said that (it's a bit private, but I'm a skeptic so it was a really sound reason). We stayed together and for the past year he has been subtly alluding to our lives together once we graduate-- we'll visit each other, etc. It made me really happy and so when we finally had The Talk last week, I was floored when he said that he couldn't see himself with me in the long run. It turns out that he's been lying to me our entire relationship. He said that he thought I was amazing when he asked me out, but he could tell that I'd had a rough life (I had a pretty tumultuous childhood and kind of toxic parents) and he said that at the time he thought that I was someone he could take care of. He said being with me gave him purpose. This whole time, he has been doing anything and everything to ensure my happiness to the extent that it eventually weighed him down because he felt responsible for my feelings. He said that this whole time he felt like a caretaker rather than a partner. He said he was scared to be in a relationship and to be vulnerable; and he thought that love was just giving but he eventually realized he was wrong. He realized a few months in to our relationship that he didn't want to keep up the pretenses, but he was scared to talk to me. I was always so serious about keeping open lines of communication because my parents divorce after about 25 years of being together. But it didn't work. So all the times he said he loved me, it turns out he didn't mean it. All the times he alluded to the future were lies, too. He knew how much I loved him, but he didn't tell me the truth early on and spare me this heartbreak I am feeling now. When I found out I was stunned and I still am. For a bit of background, I have struggled with feelings of anxiety and depression for a long time (because of said childhood) and I threw myself into that relationship with everything I had. I wanted to be a part of something healthy and incredible and I think between the two of us, we ruined that. Reflecting, I can see unhealthy patterns in our relationship. We were co-dependent (last year, we essentially spent every spare minute of our time together), he was never vulnerable and always placed my needs/wants before his, and I focused too much on him because it made it easier to ignore my own issues I need to work through. But I was so serious. I thought I was working so hard and being a great girlfriend and crushing the relationship game. Even after everything I've been through, I made the decision to put myself out there and trust him, because that's what you're supposed to do. True trust comes through vulnerability. But he lied, never told me how he was feeling, and basically controlled our entire relationship. I thought I had it good because we got along so well and literally never fought, but now I realize it was just because he never told me what he was thinking. I put my heart out there and now I feel lost and alone. Because I lost my best friend and the man I thought was going to be with me for the rest of my life. So I guess I am looking for answers. I'm so hurt because he lied. We ended up talking seriously about why we split and I know that he is dealing with guilt and pain and shame, but that is it. Everyone makes mistakes and it sucks that I had to be his, but I really believe that he is the sweetest, gentlest boy out there. He struggles because he thinks that people don't like him, but he has no idea how much people like him. I told him I loved him, how amazing he was, but maybe it wasn't enough. He made me feel good, but treated me terribly, but I still love him because I gave him my heart. Is it wrong of me to still love him? Do I really even love him or is just a serious case of attachment? I know without a doubt that I care so much about him, because he treats people so well. I feel like an idiot because I look back on these last two years and I wonder if they were a waste. Every single thing was a lie; can I even count this relationship as real or worth it? Nothing he did was out of malice, but every mistake he made, I have to suffer for and I am so angry, humiliated, hurt, and betrayed because of it. He lost a burden and a friend. I lost my partner, my best friend (because even if he wasn't honest, I was always so vulnerable with him), and a future with him. Sorry this post is so long; I wasn't sure whether to go to r/advice, but I decided to come here first. TL;DR: My boyfriend betrayed me by lying the entire relationship. Was my love for him and was the relationship even real?"

Why was it so difficult to love me when apparently I am quite lovable. Also, why did this new guy have to show up now? Couldnt he have appeared 6 months from now when I would have my shit more together and my emotions in check? I wanted to stay alone for a while. But this new person just showed up and it feels natural to go along. It feels natural to let him in my cracks of insanity and vulnerability.

Were cordial friends at first but feelings resurfaced. She meets someone else new (most likely a rebound). I feel I got taken advantaged of. Will do NC but still believes we have a chance (once rebound ends). We broke up in October 2019. After about a week of space we decided to be friends, or tried being friends anyways. Early November I call off the friendship because it was too hard for me and blocked her on everything. She tried to reach out multiple times during no contact but I never responded (it was nothing substantial). Then after she reached out saying she was struggling mentally, I caved and started talking to her again. Things were cordial at first. We talked probably around 2-3 times a week. Relatively short text conversations and rarely over the phone (were LDR). Eventually the conversations started to pick up and we began talking every day, FaceTime dates, exchanging I love you and I miss you. It was clear to me that feelings and redeveloped and that we were on our path to reconciliation. The issue begins that we never talked about our intentions. Since I was broken up with (never wanting the breakup in the first place) and were emotionally intimate again, I thought the direction we were headed was obvious. Things were natural and free flowing between us. Her perspective was different. Her intention was to keep talking with each other until someone else came along. Surprise, someone else came along. I feel like a fool. She used me to feel her void and took advantage of my vulnerability. The second someone else came, I was left behind. At first I was angry with her and she became defensive. But after a short hour of not talking she called me back extremely apologetic (not that it means much). She said I am right, that shes a selfish lover and did not consider my feelings at the result of her actions. She cried. I said (very calmly if it helps paint the picture) that I want nothing to do with her anymore. I need space, which I do and will take. BUT - I know whats going on in her head. Shes confused as hell and is using the rebound guy. She doesnt know how to be along and is trying to continue the advantages of our relationship to her new one. Maybe its just my ego, but all signs (that Ive read and watched on YouTube) point that the new guy is indeed a rebound. The sick part of me STILL thinks (after all the bullshit Ive been put through; Ive definitely made some horrible decisions myself just to be clear, so its not like its just her and not me) that I have a chance. I guess Im not sure what Im asking, Im just lost and needed to vent."

He's recruited a handful of low quality people to sit across the atrium and stare me down, and it made the first week of school very difficult. We are now in week 3 of school and week 7 of break up, and I can... with great relief... say I'm generally fine. I'm trying to celebrate that I'm an emotional person. We tend to want to hate ourselves for feeling and for caring and for loving despite being dumped. We've conditioned ourselves to associate the pain with weakness, and resent our own hearts and bodies for experiencing the loss. I'm tired of feeling ashamed for loving him so much. I'm not ashamed I opened my life and heart to him, I""m not ashamed he dug his way under my skin and earned my vulnerability. He made me feel safe enough to be the truest form of myself and I found a reality that I was comfortable and happy in for the first time in my life. It ended, and no one was the bad guy. Relationships end every day, but there wasn't a villain in ours, which is a mixed bag. There's no one to hate now, and I'm sure he's going through the pains of it now, surrounded by people who relish in misery so they seek to perpetuate it in other people. I on the other hand flourish and thrive in positivity. I seek higher vibes because dragging my broken heart along the floor only gets it dirty. I won't sit here and say I'm not mad. I am. He's immature and he undervalued me and my love for him. He cut and run instead of staying and fighting. He resented me for my successes over him and let himself bathe in that resentment until he could no longer love me back. I know he's hurting in his loneliness, but he's throwing his body-weight into stirring up rumors and gossip to support his very childish decision. He doesn't see yet that his isolation has nothing to do with actions I took. I was the light that drew people in, and he reaped that benefit. I was the love and support that elevated him, and he will soon find that he cannot generate such confidence on his own. I believe the good we do for each other does create palpable influence, even if the gratification isn't instant. Sometimes we have to sit back and wait until the other person truly finds the suffering in our absense. They may never understand their actions in creating their own misery, but misery will exist for them regardless because, like I was with him, good can cloud out bad only for as long as it is appreciated. He stopped appreciating my role in his life, and allowed that good to go. Whatever residual effect he's nursing is unsustainable. He will spiral and he will crash and none of his buddies will build him back up. I know this. And the man I miss no longer exists, and the man I want I have not met yet. This man.... this boy.... my ex.... no longer matters. And that is power. You will be fine too. They might not realize yet what they lost, but they have lost it regardless."
82,vulnerability,BreakUps,Question about a somewhat recent encounter with an ex,1,ewb6ff,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ewb6ff/question_about_a_somewhat_recent_encounter_with/,2020-01-31 06:54:28,"about a week into my breakup my ex text me saying that she had never felt so bad before (over a break up) I said some nice things back like I miss her. Then she said when she thinks about me I'm with somebody else and it drives her crazy. I didn't say anything after that because I couldn't think of anything and I also get scared to talk to exes during a breakup. I don't know why I'm like that but my heart instantly drops to my stomach if I see they contacted me. Even though what she was saying was nice. It's been about 3 weeks since she sent that and I haven't heard from her except when she dropped off a few more of my things on my front porch. Really stupid things by the way like a bag of instant mashed potatoes and some Starburst. No idea why she felt the need to drop that crap off... I'm rambling. So I haven't heard from her since and I'm honestly starting to feel like I missed my window into repairing us. When she messaged me it was on Facebook and we were still friends which for her is rare to do that. She must have had troubles deleting me entirely. I just feel like I missed my window into talking with her. I mean, why else would she have sent those messages? What was the point of telling me that she was hurting so bad she was going to break into pieces? She is not like that to show vulnerability. So there was a reason and I should have tried talking to her more. I can't stop thinking about it now that I missed my window and now she has probably moved on. I guess my question is, do you think that was a window of opportunity or do you think I would still be here alone? I'm sorry for rambling guys you know how it is. I'm just a wreck over here. But thanks for listening."

We broke up mainly because he felt disconnected, he moved to another country and could no longer see a future with me and meet someone new that could make a connection with... Its was mutual, but then I asked him to reconsider and he eventually ended up breaking up with me... Now I cant stop thinking of all the mistakes I did in the relationship and how they affect him and us... Like how my fear of intimacy and vulnerability stoped me to get fully connected, and how I would sometimes avoid him and ask him not to touch me, or how Id be so stubborn when he asked me to change something he didnt like... He genuinely has the most beautiful soul Ive ever met and I cant stop blaming myself for having put so many limits to myself and to relationship since the beginning! I never even said him I loved him and it breaks my heart that I never will now! And I cant take off my head the words he told me when he broke up with me, that he felt our relationship was based on a friendship not on passion, and that it was very adult relationship... I now know its all my fault because I didnt allow this relationship to grow to places it couldve grown and now its over... People keep telling me its ok because I wasnt really to be vulnerable and intimate and this needed to happen in order for me to understand that but its so heartbreaking because I just lost the most important person in my life because of it!"
84,vulnerability,BreakUps,A Cheaters Remorse,1,eeh5m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/eeh5m3/a_cheaters_remorse/,2019-12-23 18:06:55," I fought so hard for you. Everyone would politely tell me that you weren't ready, were not secure in yourself, assertive, or confident. ""They are wrong,"" 20 year old me I would reassure herself throughout all these years. ""You're fucking worth the fight."" Afterall, everyone has their personality quirks and flaws, right? But atlas, they were right. I mean, what kind of couple lollygagors and stagnates around for 7.5 fucking years?! Some context: I was born 'n raised in a strong-- super --christian household. I was also homeschooled from the grades of k-9 or 10th-- I lost track. I met my ex off of POF (a dating site) when I was barely turning 20. He was 26 at the time. Let's see how it unfolded. The red flags: You slowly choked me out of my social life and made zero effort in building relationships with my friends/family, as I did yours. Let's not forget that birthday party I threw you with all your fam bam and friends (as I would expect any SO to do). You never put any effort to bring us together. You showed no promise of proposing for a future with me, after 6+ years, when you knew that was important to me from the very start of our relationship. You knew the turbulence it caused me at home too. You always prided yourself for your ability to troll others, and feel zero remourse. How did I not see that as a red flag? Trolling comes from a place of insecurity, to put others down in order to feel superior to them. That was a recurring motif with you, as I see youve been trolling me throughout the years, all the while cloaking it with humor. Now I know that this is a character flaw to be avoided, not a normal psychological behavior. In fact, I've been turned on by men who are much more confident and assured in themselves, meanwhile praising the accomplishments of others, than you ever have in the past 8 years. I trusted you, expecting acceptance and unconditional love. Afterall sharing ones deepest darkest thoughts is never an easy task. Because, honesty is the best policy to me. Me being able to identify my weaknesses does not mean that I am weak. Being able to be honest with myself, and to you, shows strength and confidence. You couldn't do the same in return. You saw it as a vulnerability. It scared you. Thus, you rejected me-- which I don't hold against you, you are well within your rights to do so-- but it was the cowards way you rejected me. I have blamed myself for a lot of things throughout our relationship, but you avoided taking ANY responsibility for it. I understand that we are both intellectual beings, capable of manipulation for our own personal gain. You knew I internalized my emotions and tended to self blame/hate (why do women tend to do this, again?), you used it for your own personal gain through passive aggressiveness, leaving every opportunity to question your intentions to ""plausible deniability."" You made it feel as if everything was my fault, but it wasn't solely me, it was you too-- you were gaslighting me. How you were preparing yourself for the grieving process while still being with me. You were waiting for me to self-destruct, and to take that or any opportunity to run away, meanwhile leaving me to be the bad guy. You didn't have the courage to break me off completely while no backup plan for yourself, after I had rightfully asked to be let go of. No, you couldn't do that for me; You still needed me as a crutch-- to be your safety net. You could never live with the responsibility of being the one who made a choice and to stand by it. You pushed me to my breaking point of self-destruction through your passive-aggressiveness and gaslighting. I did not see it as that at the time, instead I foolishly had you on a pedestal and gave into the self-loathing. I simply despise how you watched me go down and in the aftermath of it all-- then tell me that, ""I am confident that I can do better than you."" Or, that I didn't have the same standards as you,-- that's because I had to lower them for you. The thing is, those words you have said, that is not how I would treat anyone that I love or had once loved. I would never be so insensitive and hurtful. Now, I am proud that I can at least identify you as toxic -- that I am not an awful person, or unqualified to be your romantic partner as you once told me that I am. Neither one of us are ever going to be perfect people, and we have both done things to hurt each other, purposely. I take full responsibility for my own actions, but it ceases to amaze me how much you tend to deny any part or participation in it. Now, as I pick myself up and put myself back together, I can confidently say that until you take responsibility for your narcissistic manipulative actions, you will only cause further damage in your future relationships. I was bright, empathic, and independent before I met you. But that made you feel insecure and fear that I would leave you-- I did have many suitors -- so you had to take me down to your level. You siphoned my own self confidence, through my words of positive affirmation to you, until you felt strong enough to leave me. You arent a monster, Im sure you didnt always have the worst intentions for me, but you did always have a sharp tongue that would manage to bring me down. Say hurtful things, then later revoke them-- claiming that it wasn't the true you or that they weren't your sincere thoughts. Your "" primitive emotional response"" is what you would label them as. That your higher self or inhibitions is what made say the things you did. I want to choose to believe that what we did have was genuine for the past 7.5 years. We both tried, then after all efforts exhausted, we failed. But, as most failing couples, we failed not only due to only me -- as you tried to rationalize it-- but on both our parts. I will no longer fall victim to my own deep insecurities, such as yourself. I have learned how to own them, take responsibility for their existence and control them, and intend to never compromise myself in fear of having someone leave me over them. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove to myself my own strength. I now know that I can be confident in myself without the need to tear down others, after all you are a proudly pronounced troll (Mr. Jazz Hands). I am and will be the GOLD standard now. You however, will be left behind as simply copper-- the kind of person who needs to bring others down in order to feel superior. Now you could dispute all of the above to ""Cheaters Remorse"" or some biases, but I can at least walk away and say that I: I can say that I am the one who reinforced your love for science and factual tangible base of evidence for arguments. (It's all about them citations after all!) I can say that I have been out of the country, skydived, and bungee jumped before I met you. Ever since meeting you, I have done nothing of the sort, hell at age 35 you still have done none of the sort. I can say that I encouraged you not to settle for just an AA, but to go for that BSN instead. You're strong and capable of it. Hell, go for the N.P.! You're still capable of more, if you wish. I still believe in your capabilities. I can say that my rational side of me comes from within me and is not linked to you. Sometimes, you would make me feel as if my points were completely invalid and that I was irrational, thus feeding into my own self illusion of self-worthlessness. I can say that I understand how no matter what I say, it is evident that I have had past childhood traumatic experiences to discredit me, which would be true, for we all have those. But, at least I never falsely pretended to understand you and offer the complete well being of you and your psyche--the mechanisms of which way you worked-- then leave you when it was best suitable for me and my own selfish needs. I can say that at least now I will never put anyone on a pedestal and make myself feel inadequate. It's funny how I graduated, in a STEM field, at a way younger age than you, yet I invalidated myself? Imposter syndrome is a real bitch. But lessons have been learned and progress will continue. I can say that I never held the fact that you foolishly squandered 50k on an impulse neurotic decision (5k of which you still owe mebut of course you won't pay me back for that) and I NEVER held it against you or used it as ammunition. I knew it would hurt your pride, so I didn't touch it in a negative or critical manner. I can say that I really did truly loved you. And that if the roles were reversed, I would have trusted and believed in you if you had asked for a break to help the anxiety and depression that you were currently going through, because trust is the foundation afterall. I can say that I truly believed and bought into the hopeless romantic idealization of you. You turned me into a pathetic Ted Mosby. Safe to say that I won't be returning to that point of belief, now. I can say that I have witnessed when you went out of your way to display your unconditional love and made me feel like the most significant and special person in your life. I can say that I will always look back at our time together and feel a tinge of pain for the loss of you. I can say that I am human after all and that so are you, our unique demons and faults are what determined our incompatibility and how hard we would have had to fight for each other, had we stayed together. I can say that I did not cheat due to an emotional or physical affair, but due to the depression, anxiety and the lack of trust in our relationship. Proof? I am not sexually attracted to the man I slept with, nor had I daydreamed our ""future"" together. I felt and still feel NOTHING for him. I did it out of pure anxiety and self-loathing, a dark fucked up place where only the darkest inner corner of myself resides. Looking back, I petty that girl, but I now have the capacity to understand and appreciate her call for help, meanwhile avoid her resurfacing. Why do I self guilt? Because I care to keep a rational perspective and be held accountable to my actions. At this point, I have no doubt that I am an amazing woman capable of true independence-- whether it be financially or emotionally. But I am aware of what I lack. I feel that you have preyed on that. I can say that because you are 6 years 3 months 19 days older than me and of-more-life-experience-than-me-admiration, I let your opinion override mines on numerous occasions. Thus, leaving me with a sense of invalidation, to my own fault. I am capable of rational thought, and can validate myself after all. Which I am now condoning for. I can say that as I near my 28th birthday, knowing that I have spent all of my 20s growing with you by my side, the realization of not having you hurts and it installs a fear within me, but I feel exhilarated to face my fears head on and prove my worth to myself. To be my own sense of validation as I face new life territories without you. I can say that we had a great run, but the ending factor of our relationship was not because I was, ""not good enough for you,"" it was due to the lack of trust, understanding and supportive outside circumstances out of both our control. Now, that's keeping a rational perspective. I can say that I wrote this entire thing intoxicated I will be working on this. It seems to be the only way for me to let out my feelings and let go of them simultaneously. I suppose meditation and exercise will soon be its replacement. But don't you dare put the entirely of your cowardly escape on me. I am not cheap, nor will I buy into your sale of my inadequacy. Goodbye dear former lover, I truly tried with all my being, for us and appreciate your value in my life. I can now let you go and move on with my life. Such ""cathartic relief."" Now, stop texting me after I have clearly told you not to do so. :) We are not friends."

I watched his favorite youtube music reviewer and listened to that guys top 5 albums of the year. I don't know why I wanted to do that. Maybe to feel closer to my ex. Maybe thats what I'm missing right now. That closeness you develop with your person. The wordless conversations across a room spoken with a smile. Knowing they're there, just for you, because of you, to be with you. It makes a room full of people feel less enveloping. I miss the closeness we had, and I'm angry at the time we took to develop it. The nights one of us got drunk enough to drop our guards a little bit more and slowly slowly the vulnerability became less scary. At some point it stops being terrifying to bare your soul and you start, somehow, enjoying laying yourself out to this person who worked so hard and was so patient to earn your trust and confidence. He worked so hard with me. Earned every tiny detail of my life, and with every story he pulled me closer to him until we were fused in a way I thought would carry us through. we weren't, actually. we weren't carried through anywhere. And now I'm alone in these rooms full of people with their persons and I have no one to smile at, although I'm smiling to everyone. I manage to find myself expert in these situations, having practiced to perfection the right tones and gestures and faces a single woman at a couples party should display. How tragic to be an expert at appearing like you're not devastatingly alone. How sacred was a bored glance from your someone begging you to let this party be over so you can go home, have sex on the couch and both pass out watching John Oliver. I hate the holidays.

Top reason is that I didn't realise it was over when it was over - May 2019. I genuinely believed something was wrong with me because I have bipolar disorder, anxiety and depression. A few months pass. She moved out to what I suspect is her dude friend's flat. My rent doubled as a result. And I was still paying for some things like mobile data for her. She even topped up that data bundles at my expense and didn't tell me. She knew just as I knew that living separately would cost both of us more and she still did that. She was to pay me back for a lot of what I financed her for, but didn't. More precisely, she paid me back half of a significantly reduced settlement amount. She straight up ghosted me on an October payment which screwed me financially. Then, when I really needed money for my FUCKING MEDICINE end November, she was late again! The day after she was late I blew up her phone with calls and voice notes because I FUCKING FINALLY chose to take care of myself as best I could - therapy and medicine. The day I blew up her phone she said she never wants to experience another Dec 1st like this. She paid. I got my medicine. It's really painful to be so vulnerable to someone who literally knows you, knows your illness, and still blames you for being desperate for medicine. I was crying for resources to cope and she just blamed me for doing what I needed to FUCKING LIVE! Some definition of love says you open yourself up to someone, letting them know your vulnerabilities, trusting they won't hurt you with them. She hurt me by withholding medicine money and blaming me for fighting for MY FUCKING LIFE! I'm so angry with her for literally not being there for me, even as a ""friend,"" when I went through an episode. The last payment to me is due 31 December 2019. Sadly, I've chosen to close off so much of my vulnerabilities since she hurt me so badly. I've decided to become so damn self-sufficient I think my heart turned to ice. I just can't risk trusting someone else to be there for me in my open vulnerability. I thought she loved me the way I was. But when it comes to keeping me alive, she practically told me to go die somewhere. I'm so hurt. I'm alone, not by choice. And I'm afraid to open up again to anyone else ever again in the same way. My therapist and I resolved to go the self-sufficient route so I get my emotional needs satisfied 75% and open up at most 25% to someone else (since being human requires connection to other humans). Yet I can see my heart never letting anyone else in. Because I choose to live. In the end, I know I'll succeed in getting my drugs sorted. I'll live. I'll be ""okay."" But I've got lingering doubts if I'll ever be as vulnerable to another as I had been with her. I'm not sure if that's really a win for me."

I revisit our old conversations and it kills me to not have this rapport with anyone else. Are they also scared to move on from their ex? Im revisiting this image of this person who I adored so wholeheartedly, and Im reflecting on how vulnerable and safe I felt with this person. No one has granted me that space and openness since then. And Ive given others that vulnerability and yet they have spit it out like what Im offering them is indigestible. Ive grown so much that he wouldnt recognize my strength and courage to move along, and there are days where I dont care about my growth and I wish to be with my person again. I do think that loneliness has a factor in why I feel this way and since living in this city has made me feel more isolated than before, I frankly hope to meet someone as great as he was to me. It saddens me that I cannot find a mutual exchange of affection and energy while I date in this terrible city (NYC). If anyone whos reading this can relate, share your words."

I kept things above board and didnt discuss my emotions about it. But This made me angry because he said he wanted to do no contact and i felt like he was using this as a way to see how Id react. I posted a rant on insta story which I have been using as an outlet for me cause he NEVER looks at it. He saw it. Called him to apologize that he saw it saying it wasnt meant for him it was meant for my close friends and he was so so angry at me. He said he was glad he saw it because now he knows to not reach out to me about his pain throughout this breakup. He was like youre lucky I even picked up the phone. He felt so betrayed that I would rant and bash him to everyone. Granted, I didnt bash him in the post, just talked about how I was pissed off he would reach out about how sad hes been feeling after he explicitly said we could not talk about emotions with each other. I just kept apologizing and explaining that it was coming from a place of pain not hate and I got confused when he said we couldnt talk and then he reached out so soon. I feel like Ive lost my power all over again. I felt like I was doing so well by him not knowing what I was really feeling and now he knows all of it. Furthermore I embarrassed him on a public forum and I feel so so bad that I hurt him and undermined his vulnerability. All I can do I guess is apologize and hope he forgives me. Hating myself all over again."

He simply opened his arms wider and hugged me tighter. He never saw me the way I saw myself, instead he convinced me I was someone worth loving. That I had good qualities inside of me, that I wasnt a failure, that I had achievements to be proud of. He saw things in me I never saw in myself, and he never judged the way I battered and tore away at my own self-esteem. I think this is the struggle with having an inferiority complex. Its always knowing youre not good enough, but he full on accepted me the way I was. The way I saw myself (the pathetic, crybaby, loser). And I could come to him for anything because it was safe to do so, he was non critical of my flaws and he never tried to change a single thing. He unconditionally loved me. Thats the meaning of love. When you see someones true vulnerability, when their eyes are cast downwards from being ashamed of who they are, thats when he loved me even more. When I am fucking embarrassed to simply be myself, he just quietly mumbles to me: everythings going to be okay. The soothing, comforting, and calming feelings I get from him and my memories with him are what make life worth living. I hate myself, theres no denying it. Its an endless self-pity party. But he loved me despite that, despite my imperfections, despite my constant negative attitude. And thats full on acceptance; that is love. A girl never forgets how you make them feel because you teach them that its okay to love themselves and others. That its okay to show your worst parts, and have them be loved. The most biggest regret in my life me bringing him down. Always having him support me, reassure me, comfort me, when he could be so much happier with someone else. And yet at one point, we still chose each other. But I feel so much guilt for putting him through everything he did not deserve, for making him feel burdened by my problems, when he has the potential to be and do anything in this world. My god, was he loved. He was loved infinitely, by anyone and everything. And the only person who couldnt see it, was him. Thats why he loved so hard; he wanted to show other people what safety and stability felt like because he never knew love (or so he thought). And I just want to give this boy the whole world, because I know he deserves so much more than me, that he could find someone prettier and better anyway, and yet he chose to love me despite the mess that I am."

A choice. You decide to cut yourself open, to tell someone how you are feeling down in the deepest parts of yourself. So heres the thing: You dont get to decide how other people will react to seeing your insides. Not everyone is comfortable with that level of emotional gore. Some people wont even respond to it. &amp; does that suck? Sure. But it also tells you something about their emotional depth. Its okay to be too much to handle. Dont sew yourself back up or shape your emotions into a presentable mold that the other person is comfortable with. Instead, walk away &amp; choose the people who not only embrace all of your twisted &amp; messy insides, but are standing at the ready with a knife all their own, ready to be just as splayed open &amp; vulnerable as you are."

The first two times I embarrassed the life out of myself. I messaged, I cried about how sad I was. I had to convince you as to why you shouldnt leave me. Two days later we would be back together. We knew, both of us, from the beginning we were going to deal with a huge fundamental dealbreaker. Still, we gave it a shot. I cant decide if I regret this or not quite yet. Im sure I wont when I am completely over you, but I cant really see that day anywhere in sight. Its the second, going on third day. It kind of feels longer, as it was brought up sooner than we made it official. I started grieving the night we brought it up. You avoided it all you could. I regret even teasing the idea of it, because now here we are. I brought up, in a slurry of my insecurities, that maybe I wasnt the person for you. You simply agreed. See  this is where many of my problems come from. It never felt like you fought for us as hard as I did. I dont know if I should be ashamed of myself or angry with you. Probably both. I cant believe we let this go as far as we did, and now I am a heartbroken mess. I have dated many people before, one relationship for years, yet I have never been in this spot before. There were many nights I spent imagining our wedding. The proposal. I was never much of a marriage person until you came along, and god I would have married you in an instant. I always imagined us eloping, marrying in our privacy and enjoying eachother without the hassle and expense of traditional weddings. I would have, I still would honestly, do anything for you. This is where I am learning what I have done wrong. What I need to fix. I had many, many insecurities within myself, some of which Ive overcome, and some of which still rear their ugly faces daily. I also remind myself to take you down off of the pedestal I put you on, that you have your issues too. The communication on your part was HORRIBLE. I love you to death, but you have got to learn to speak those ugly truths when they are necessary. I know its tough, Im sure you probably didnt like the strange feeling of vulnerability that comes with that, but it has to happen. You told me you loved me first  three months into the relationship. You then decide a year and a half later that you really cannot do this. Im so lost on how I should feel about this all. I will always love you for showing me the world through new eyes. Ive loved before, I am sure I will love again, but you hold a place very dear in my heart (right now it just feels like you took my whole heart with you though). I never looked at someone and felt such a pit of happiness, of love and of longing. This feels like my first very true love, and it feels clich and funny to say that, but its true. Being left in the remains of you, scattered in every crevice and dip of my home, feels like Im simultaneously on panic mode and eternally empty. I see you everywhere. Youre in all of my hometown. Your home is clean of me, though, and Im sure that helps you move forward. I cant look anywhere without thinking of you. You took the ugliest parts of me, my vomiting, my drunken spew, my sobbing in the shower floor and you loved me despite it. You told me how beautiful I am, though sometimes Id react poorly (hey there insecurities!), it always sits in my head. There was no other person that caught my attention. Still, I look around and I cant find interest physically or otherwise. I think of the love of my life, I think of you. I have eaten hardly anything in 60 hours, my body feels as if it is trying to kill itself with the pain. Everything in me wants to message you, like old me. I want to convince you, to remind you, that things do not have to be this way. I know you loved me. Maybe not on the same level, maybe this was all bad timing, but it was generally mutual. There was no one wrong thing done which makes it tough to dislike you. I only wish you were more honest about your feelings with me, maybe I could have saved myself from falling too deep (this is doubtful though. I feel the day I see you again I will be in tears). Im not going to do this though. You know every reason I will tell you. You know every rebuttal I have, every little sob that will come from my mouth. You know. So here is where I refuse to do this to myself. You chose to leave, you can choose to reconcile, you can choose to be gone forever. This choice is all on you, and I am refusing to reach out again to do this. Part of me hopes you will reach out, but the majority of me knows youre gone. I know youre good at this. I am jealous of how well you can detach, the self control. I feared before that I wasnt trying hard enough, but I know now I did everything I could. I cannot keep you if you do not want to be kept. I only hope the pain stops sooner than later."

Shrinking the synopsis: I have never been so intensely attracted to anyone in my life. We met at a music show, and instantly hit it off, though right then the circumstances weren't feasible to begin a relationship. It was clear there was mutual attraction. We stayed in touch for about a year after the night we met --&gt; I moving around for work and he finishing his doctorate program. I returned to our neck of the woods about a year later and the time was ripe to give this 'True Love' a try. We lived about an hour apart from each other: he was planning to move closer to me in order to give our partnership a shot. We enter into partnership in the beginning of the summer. Over the course of the summer, I was getting my bearings with job change/housing. I have horrible commitment and abandonment issues and was having difficulty accepting how quickly the relationship was moving (ie him moving to this city where I grew up and have historically run away from). The month he was supposed to move (September), he runs into an issue with the job he got due to background check issue from an old legal dealing and has to reapply. He asks for support and in a fit of anger I tell him I can't do that and he calls it off: the move and the relationship. We decide to take some steps back (friendship) while he figures out his bearings now that he's not moving including making sure his legal proceedings are sealed, finding a job where he currently lives and unfortunately also replacing his car that just died. He decides to stay in the city he lives (about an hour from me) as he has a great community for support out there (he is a community leader in many ways). We stay in touch, me hoping we can get back together and continue on with the distance. Fast forward 2 months, he is not sure if he can ever forgive and move beyond what happened. He says he felt that at many points in the relationship we were not meeting each others needs and that he feels we are incompatible. He can't offer anything other than friendship. He feels him moving here was us giving partnership a shot and he doesn't want to do long distance anymore as this is what caused many of the issues in the first place. I am devastated. I look back and realize I didn't appreciate what I had until it was gone. I took advantage of thinking we were soulmates. I didn't prioritize our relationship. I have so much fear around intimacy and vulnerability. I would do anything to have him living here with me. I am so lonely. He is truly a gem of a human. Yesterday I got a letter from him that sounds like he is no longer 'in love' with me. And it was my wake up call to get rid of the false hope. I feel so so so so so broken."
95,vulnerability,BreakUps,Is my(me 25f) soon to be ex ( him 27m)a narcissist ?,1,e0js9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/e0js9b/is_myme_25f_soon_to_be_ex_him_27ma_narcissist/,2019-11-24 03:07:31,"Hello, I have been struggling to understand my boyfriend. For over 1.5 years. I question whether or not he is narcissistic . Sometimes I feel like he is and other times I feel like no way, he can't be. We met 1.5 years ago. On OkCupid. We went on a date; and basically hooked up and then he never left. He was still in my apartment 3 days later and I thought that was unusual. Met in May of 2018 and fast forward to February of 2019 and I was feeling suffocated by him. To start he convinced me to let him move into my apartment even though my roommate at the time was not okay with that. I loved my boyfriend so I said yes eventually but I felt pressured. He was at my apartment everyday anyways and that was the argument he used to convince me and it worked. He would be stuck to me like crazy-glue ; literally he would hold my hand while we were in the house together. I would have nightmares of being smothered by him emotionally. Anyways. At the time I wasn't over my ex so I still had some lingering feelings from my first relationship which I told my boyfriend since day one and would even update him about how that was going along. One day I felt particularly disconnected from my boyfriend and he took the entire day off of work to stay with me because he wanted to know what was wrong. That was then. He was always a self - centered conversationalist ( topics were mostly about him and his company literally obsessed with it .) But he had a lot of incredible qualities. For example he is the most intelligent person I have met. He studied algebra at 8 years old and by 12 he was already coding and creating games. And he had a sensitive side... Or so I think he does .. that's the part i am a bit unsure of. He used to tell me he missed me after days of work; would tell me he cares about me and tell me I was the best every two days. At that time he wasn't paying rent at the apartment but he helped with other things like groceries. Then Christmas came along and my dad scared him into getting a second job to support me. ( I personally think that was unacceptable of my dad ) bur my dad pointed out that when my roommate moves out he would have to help and maybe put his name on the lease. My boyfriend agreed and got a second job. He would even go as far sometimes as telling me that he struggled with the amount of work he has at his startup and questioned whether or not he should stop being a CEO because he wishes we could spend more time together. But he never quit ( and I didn't want him too ) and he got the second job. He worked two jobs. That's when our relationship began to change; once he had payed me back for all the months he stayed at my apartment for free a grand total of 7; he would start talking about doubt in regards to our relationship how he felt like he couldn't be in a relationship with the amount of work he had. But here is the thing. He would work 15 hour days ( with and without the second job - he only did that for another 8 months and quit - now he only has his company and pulls the same stunts ) and would go out every weekend and not tell me where he is and come home the next day. He also had a drinking problem and my mom is an alcoholic and for a long time I had no alcohol in the house policy . Which I learned to change and be less hard on him for his drinking. But regardless it would drive me nuts when he would go out with friends and ignore me. Entirely. After he would be working the entire day and barely give me a call. 2 months ago he broke up with me but we still live together. He said we can be together till he moves out . This week he complains to me that his best friends girlfriend dumped his best friend and what a birch she is for doing that... ( Ironic I know ) but then tells me he feels guilty because she dumped him because his friend was always working ( his friend is his employee ). For the longest tie.i have been telling him to take weekends off. He is obsessive with work and works every day except one day he will take off out of two weeks. The past week I have had a gallbladder attack and have been in pain every day. Supposed to go to surgery and have had health issues throughout our entire relationship. He is not very supportive. If I tell him something that's upsetting me and start to cry he will tell me I am too emoitonalt for a 25 year old , as if being dumped is not a reason to be sad and as if being neglected multiple times a week for the sake of drinking with friends is not a reason to be emotional. He was never like this before. He used to talk to me about our issues and apologize but he always sturggled to work on them in practice. Now he just ignored me and shuts down. Am I crazy ? Am I the toxic one. Am I too emotional for having basic needs and wanting support ? Is it wrong that after we have decided to be exclusive and move in that he thinks going out to parties without me / going out and not every letting me around his friends is acceptable ? Is he a narcissist. How do I know. He is very intellectual charming and comes across as a well-rounded person and good listener but some things don't add up. His mom abanonned him for years as a baby into his childhood and then came back. His father was a cold person who worked on computers when they were just being made ; a coder. His father was also an alcoholic. Am I a fool for letting him stay with me until he can conveniently move out ; is it normal that I feel unsafe about showing vulnerability around him ; sadness / physical pain from my illnesses. All of my friends love him but nobody knows how neglecteful he has been at the exception of one. I don't tell most of them because they all have crushed on him and they also don't believe that cheating is bad ( I need new friends I know ) I feel so alone and like j cannot trust anyone . Should I take his things and pack then up and kick him out today or have a conversation ? Yesterday he went out when he told me he would come home . Lied to me twice on the phone just to get rid of me. I know this sounds all bad I left out the good times we have together but when he acts neglectful it really takes away from any bit of trust I have left for him. I need help. Should I kick him out or no ? Is he a narcissist. Help. TLDR ; Boyfriend who is a bit self-center moved in with me 1.5 years ago only a moth after we met. He didn't pay rent originally but payed me back all the money down the line. He used to be very attentive / caring ; now he is not and he broke up 2 months ago with me but we still live together and still treats me like his girlfriend. He sometimes goes out the whole night without telling me after working 15 hour days ( as he does nearly every day ) I know for a fact he isn't cheating but is it acceptable that he keeps pushing the boundaries of how neglectful he can be to me ? He wasn't like this the first yr of our relationship but is now. I need help ; question 1.should I pack up all of his stuff and end it together before he leaves conveniently in January ?question 2. And is he a narcissist. TLDR;"
96,vulnerability,BreakUps,How do you get over someone you're still deeply in love with?,1,e15x01,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/e15x01/how_do_you_get_over_someone_youre_still_deeply_in/,2019-11-25 09:25:48,"TLDR: Sad and difficult break up, but still with a lot of love between us and the possibility of a future in a few months time, which has drastically deteriorated since. I'm still so in love with him and I can't cope with it. Me \[21F\] and my boyfriend \[27M\] of almost 2 years (we were friends for 3 years beforehand) split up 2.5 months ago. Our relationship wasn't perfect, and we'd had quite a major fight, but decided to work through it in July. It wasn't always easy, but for the most part we were doing great. In late August, we attended the wedding of one of his childhood friends, with a large group of his other friends and their partners. All weekend, everything was so great, all his friends were commenting on how happy we were, how lovely I was, how they've never seen him this happy before and how great I've been for him (and he's been friends with most of them 20 years). We talked on the drive home from the wedding and he tells me that our relationship isn't just back to before the fight, but it's the best it's ever been and he's really happy we worked everything out. I was moving to London a few weeks later for my 2nd year of uni, which we knew about for a long time and wasn't that big a deal, as it's only a couple of hours away on the train, as originally he was going to be moving with me, but decided to do a college course and try and go to uni in London the next year instead, so that he could get a better job (he wants to get into computing which is really hard without a degree). So we had 2 weeks at home together after the wedding, I went to New York with my mum for a week and then I was only home for 5 days before the move. He had been working a lot while I was in New York, doing a lot of double shifts, so was understandably tired when I came back. But baring in my mind I had 5 days to pack up my life to move and say goodbye to all my friends and family in my hometown, I really wanted to try and spend some quality time with him before I went. And so the day I came back from New York, everything was fine, other than both of us being tired, as was the next day, but then on the Wednesday, I had my driving test in the morning (I failed but I was kinda expecting it), he went to work, and we had plans to go to a weekly quiz night we often went to with friends. At the quiz, an argument arose between me and another one of our friends (who was my ex's childhood friend first, but separate from his main group) over the friends birthday, as me and my ex had plans with my family that we weren't really looking forward to, but it was important to my family, and they were over a year old. Me and this friend have often disagreed in the past, but this was the first time anything had actually been publicly discussed. My ex had basically told his friend he was planning to bail on my family for just a regular night out, it wasn't a special birthday or anything, but hadn't told me anything like that at all. So we left early, he tried to make a joke which I obviously didn't respond well to, and we got into a huge argument on the way home. Everything I said or asked him for about 10/15 min was just met with shrugs and 'I don't know' until I was so frustrated I just said for home not to come to the family party, not to visit me in London and not to see me again if he was that unbothered, and he just said ok. We ended up arguing and then calming down and just talking in the car for about 3 hours outside my house, and he said he felt overwhelmed with starting college, changing jobs, and the subsequent lack of money, me moving away and everything else going on, he just felt too under pressure and he still loved me but wasn't sure if he was still in love or not because he didn't care as much as he thought he should about me leaving. It was basically just awful, and I had to move away 2 days later. Just under 2 weeks after the break up, we met up and had a huge talk, that was really open and honest, we were both heartbroken but just kind of aware that we were both feeling that way and we still loved and cared about each other so so much. He kept bringing up how he was still attracted to me, but that he didn't have the space in his head for a relationship at the moment, and how he wouldn't be surprised if in a years time when we've both worked on ourselves, we still end up together, but that we just need some space to grow as people at the moment. When we talked about the wedding he started crying and had to go outside because it was too painful to talk about how in love we were then. He said he couldn't imagine not having me in his life and that he knew he'd never meet anyone that loved and supported him the way I have. He said that he's never met anyone in his life that understands him the way I do too. He was really insistent on being friends, and I told him I was sure I'd be able to do that, but that I was willing to try basically, as we had a couple of events we had tickets to etc. We were both crying, holding each other, and neither of us wanted to leave that moment, because I think we both knew this was the real end. I still didn't understand what or why this had happened, but I felt a lot more peaceful about it afterwards. 2 weeks later, we met for a coffee and he was in an absolutely foul mood, forgot his card so I had to buy him coffee, sat there talking about basically how awful everything was, and then being like I'm fine though!!! I'm over it!!! Which I obviously didn't believe, but then he started essentially having a go at me for not being over it yet, how I'm 'harming myself' by wallowing, and how I'm doing 'exactly what everyone expects' and being predictable by being upset. So I was just like... wtf??? And the whole day just made me feel even worse because I had no idea where it all came from. We had tickets to see Impractical Jokers later on that week, which was why we'd met initially. So we went to that, it was awkward initially, but we shared a bottle of wine and then it was tentative, but ok, as ok can I could've hoped for really. He also apologised for how he'd behaved at the coffee. We also had 3/4 beers each after the wine so we were pretty wasted, so when the show finished an hour earlier than we were expecting it to, I asked if he wanted to get another drink, which is when the whole night like switched. He started having a massive go at me, saying I wasn't his friend and that I was just trying to get him into bed, and that I specifically wore an outfit he liked for that reason (it's a normal outfit I've worn to a lot of gigs before, a little dressed up but still casual, plus he literally turned up in jogging bottoms and I've never seen him wear them outside home/the gym before) that he didn't care about me and he never did, and loads of spiteful stuff like that. I basically just got really upset because I didn't understand where it was all coming from cause the night had gone ok, and I got off the tube with him at his stop because I didn't want to leave things like that between us. So basically we ended up getting on the next train together too, it would take him all the way home and it was just an alternate route I could use. I missed my stop because we were still arguing, and it basically culminated in him telling me he hated me, whilst crying, and leaving me in NW London at 1am, obviously very visibly upset, make up down my face, still drunk, the works, miles away from my flat (SW London) with no idea how I was going to get back. I was so acutely aware of how vulnerable I was and also that he was the only person who knew where I was. He texted me about 20 min later that of course he didn't hate me and he didn't mean it, but didn't actually apologise. Over the next few days, we texted a little about what we were going to do about the next thing we had tickets for as it was only about 8 days away, and he insisted I didn't go, and paid for 2 150 tickets instead of just his one, so that he didn't have to see me. Through that whole conversation, he was really rude and dismissive and refused to listen to me, but made me listen to him. I also apologised multiple times for my part in the train situation, and he is still yet to acknowledge it. We met up about a month later (currently about 2 weeks ago) to close our joint bank account. It was technically fine, but so cold and weird, and he told me he doesn't want to see me for 6-9 months. The problem is, he works (only 1 day a week) at the place I'm going to work over Christmas break, and I don't really have any other job options, and I really really need the money, so not doing it isn't an option, but he's fine with us working together in this state? He said I apparently need more time - which I corrected him to we - to be friends, and that he's getting really anxious everytime we meet up and stuff like that, which is why we shouldn't see each other, but I don't understand how a) that'll be different in a work context (we work in a small, close team), b) how time will change that, because the issues will still be there unresolved, and c) how the fuck we ended up here? I've also had mutual friends talk to me about how concerned they are about him, how he doesn't talk to them at all anymore and they never see him, he's drinking loads and started smoking again etc, and honestly I'm really worried about him. I know he won't talk to his family (could write a whole other essay on that), he's no longer talking to friends at all, and I was the only person he was ever really open with about his feelings, and he struggled a lot with that, because he was never really allowed to express himself growing up, he just supresses everything. I've tried to support him through our whole relationship with that but it wasn't easy on either of us (he always thought I was too emotional in comparison which tbh he's probably right about but I'd rather that than nothing), and I almost feel like because his mental health is in a bad place and he's feeling so overwhelmed, and I'm the one person he was vulnerable with, by breaking up with me, he's tried to remove that vulnerability? Because even the night of the gig, I know him well enough that he was just lashing out to push me away - doesn't make it ok, and doesn't mean it doesn't hurt, but I know him well enough to know what he was doing basically. There's literally so much more I can say but this has already gone on forever, so my point of this post is, how can I deal with this? I'm obviously furious and heartbroken and upset, but I still love him so much that it seems small in comparison. I did want him back through most of this, and it's only in the last week or so that I've realised I actually don't, but it's only this person of the last couple months I feel that way about. The person I've known for 5 years is still in there and I still love that person so deeply, that's the person I talked for hours with about moving in together and getting married and having kids and having a future and an entire life with - and it wasn't one sided. I don't understand how or why this happened and it is killing me. I've missed so much of uni and networking opportunities (I'm studying music so just as essential as class) that I'm seriously considering deferring the rest of this year because I'm just wasting my time and money by being here. I've lost most of our mutual friends, but most of all I've lost my best friend. Because we met at work, we've spent 5 days a week together for pretty much the last 5 years, and I feel as if I've lost half of myself. I know that I can't change how he's behaving or make him realise what he's throwing away, as much as I want to, so I just want to know how I can feel better. Because yeah I'm getting up and eating and showering and sometimes going to uni and stuff like that, but mentally I'm still just shellshocked, I don't understand what changed literally from the morning to the evening on the day of our break up, and what has happened to make it worse since, and I can't deal with it. It's been almost 3 months and I still feel worse everyday and I know I can't get our relationship back, not now, but I'm struggling to deal with the possibility of this being forever, and I'm struggling to live in my head everyday. I'm scaring myself with how I feel because I have a history of depression, I know just how bad I can get and it terrifies me. I just don't want to feel like this anymore and I don't know how to make it stop without getting answers from him. I've talked to friends until I'm blue in the face and exhausted and everyone is sick of hearing about it now, not that they'd say it to me directly. I'm just not moving forward and I've had enough of it, I just want a break. So please, if you have any advice at all, send it my way. If you've read all of this you're a champ."

When we hangout it feels just like we are together again. We talk, laugh, cuddle, and have sex. Hes always the one who initiates even though hes the one who broke up with me. He even told me he still loves me the other night (we were drunk tho). The chemistry is still on fire when we are together and it feels like were still in love. I dont know how to feel because I wanted him back so bad at first but then after a period of NC and loads of self improvement/healing, Ive realized that I dont want anyone in my life who doesnt want to be there. I just dont understand why hes wanting to keep me in his life Iike this when hes the one who left me. And now that Im healed hes back around. I still love him and I love spending time with him but I dont know what his intentions are. I know that if I ask him it will put me back in that state of vulnerability and I cant handle being rejected by him again (the new and improved me is confident and collected). I dont want him to know that I even want him back because I feel like that will just ruin things. So for now Im just going with the flow, because honestly I would take him back eventually, because our relationship was great for the most part, but part of me feels like this is going to end badly and the last thing I want is another heartbreak. But I dont want to miss out on the love of my life either."

I'm starting a career and I'm excited but at the sametime I just want to tell her... I want these moments of vulnerability and sadness to be done with already... I have fun with friends and I have fun doing my hobbies again. When there are down times my mind just crashes... it just begins to think about everything again and I hate it. All these memories are intrusive and I can't stop it. Every. Single. Day. I tell myself I'm over her but I'm so tired of lying to myself. As much as I want to say I'm over her I just can't believe myself. There are days where I'm normal and enjoying my life. Then there are moments where everything just sucks and all I can think about is her leaving me for another guy... I just want it to end.

I was so shocked, as I was the one to convince her so much that I would stay forever. Yet she left out of nowhere with little reason. Recently I had a moment of vulnerability and texted, we talked about our lives since in way too much detail. It seems she completely regrets it, left it because her past trauma with her mother bled over into my family relations. My mother is very unkind and it deeply affected her. But my ex admitted it wasn't because of me, that I did nothing. She partly stands by her decision because of my family, but it seems that if I fought I could have kept her. Furthermore she told me the short amount of time before she was...enjoying herself with someone else, I'm sure you get the idea. She also leans on substance to null the pain. And being with that guy, doing these things, it's frequent, and up to this day. She tells me she wants something in the future when I'm away from my family. But I don't feel that's fair to have left me in my hardest times so that she may experience whatever pleasure she wants and just pick back up later on when she feels like it. I don't know if that's irrational or harsh. It was her right to leave. But that doesn't change the consequences. Hell, I've even tried just recently to experience some fun with others of my own, but to my luck the emotional impact has stuck...my body does no cooperate. It seems like I could have fought to avoid all this and we'd be fine. But is that even right? I mean wouldn't there be some pretty big issues in a relationship anyways if she just up and tried to end it *all??* I just really need the support, some reassurance here...I don't know much anymore. Thank you."

She lived in so many layers of denial and obscured world views it was almost astonishing. Her parents were arifirce then FBI so naturally Im pretty sure no matter what passion or love she had (like her love for jazz and music) she had been brainwashed to only go the government military path. It fucking disgusts me how much her parents are fucking snakes. She use to talk about how bad they were until one day she stopped. It was sickening but I ignored it. But back to the story. Both of us fought a lot because neither of us had set security. We were weak and carried a lot of baggage me from my childhood her from past relationships. I was her first real love. She was my first. Nothing was easy but everything was worth it. But things started to lean one way. She was alwasy the innocent one because when she reacted it was sadness and faking but my cover up for weakness and embarrassment was anger. Id never hit. Never yell. Only sharply attack with words. I was alwasy the enemy but I needed saving too deep down. I hate myself for the burdened my father gave me to only know anger when scared. After a year of off and on. I went to counseling. Leaps were made. I didnt even realize how much more ok I felt with who I was. Not perfect mind you. But I pushed hard to be someone worth loving for her. Everyday was a internal battle of anxiety, insecurity, and vulnerability and when it overcame me it always came back to ridicule and anger. But it happened less and less. But even as I wasnt perfect. I tried. She didnt..... each day I wanted to be better and I took those steps. She only acted like she wanted to be. Ether but was too lazy. She ran away every time something was bumpy. Got weak every time there was uncertainty. I was fighting for two to help her know that just because life gets rocking you dont alwasy have to run cause ur scared. She joined the air force. It only made her worse. Bring ups. Small issue....I dont understand....try to explain how I feel.... I need to think maybe this isnt working......I know your busy but you say you love but all you do is hide away with ur new friends .....this relationship isnt working.........no......thats not at all what this was. It was another bump and because you found something new again I alwasy take the heat. Im a punching bag.....a safety net......I know deep down you love me but your own ignorance a fear tells you that its weak to love for some reason. That just because your in the military and your a grown up now having emotions is for children. Yeah grown up my ass. Growing up isnt working your life alway and ignoring life itself that you wont even listen to you being your own inner voice on what you really want. Its confronting what scares you and fighting for what you care about. But no. Your too grown up to have a independent thought anymore. Good luck and a solid fuck you for being such a ignorant cold piece of shit."

I just saw you yesterday, sat down next to an arguing couple, on their way for divorce for infidelity, it was more funny than sad though, the man was rude and audacious admitting his infidelity, he cared not about his children nor his marriage, he wanted nothing but to escape jailtime, his poor wife although not admitting it, it was as if she was begging him to give her one, just one reason to stay, thats all she needed, just one hint of him wanting her to stay, pathetic isnt it? Not the wife, the wife was a marvelous real being, it was the man, I pitied the man. I saw you, and all those feelings I had buried deep down didnt even need to resurface, they were there, they were always there, and it felt natural, being with you felt natural, I had tried, tried and tried to detach myself from you, and detach you from my every thought and my happiness, but failed every time. I fought and lost countlessly, I would always come back to you, hoping to be forgiven, like a man allergic to freedom escaping prison, and coming back hoping that this time they will build taller walls, add more barbed wire and guards or squeeze him tighter in a cell so he would never attempt to leave ever again, but this time I wasnt admitted back, I was at best allowed to drink cheap whiskey right outside the gates and gaze inside without ever setting foot. It felt natural walking next to you, eating with you, laughing with you, looking at you, it felt surreal. But it wouldnt last, it never does. I never understood you, nor you me, yet you brought me life and took it away. I saw you and I hoped it wouldnt be the last time, my soul was begging for you to beg me to stay, or just a sign, a hint of you wanting me as I do but all you said was  It wouldnt change anything, it killed any last hope I had of me and you, I took your shades off your hand in the dark movie theater and replaced them with my hand, I couldnt hear what you said, I just smiled as if I did, I couldnt bear talk or ask you to repeat yourself. You wondered why I was restless and uncomfortable, I was fighting a battle, a battle of acceptance; that I am caressing your hand and it was the last time I was ever going to caress it, it was the last time Ill feel your hand on mine, the last time Ill smell you and feel you and hear your voice. I was missing your touch long before I lost it. Forgive me, forgive my doubts, forgive my sins, for Im leaving you one last time and Im never coming back, I hope you miss me like I miss you, I hope you look for me in every man you meet like I look for you in every woman I see. I hope you regret me, I hope you regret you and me like I will."

Im no longer in a place of hurt like when the break-up first happened or resentment like when I wrote my break-up story/progress on here this summer. In fact, the day after I wrote that post I saw my ex and we didnt acknowledge each other. I cried for days after that. I thought it would take me longer to get here but when you finally realize that this is out of your control and the only one you have is you, theres really nothing else to do but move forward. Dont suppress your emotions. Feel them then release them. Theres no more relationship. Accept that as well. Youll heal from this pain but you have to allow yourself to. Thanks to all of you for showing me just how much love there is out there. I discovered this community fresh out of my break-up and youve really helped me get through this knowing I wasnt the only one. Thank you for your vulnerability and honesty. I have a lot of love to give and I want to share it with someone who reciprocates that same love back to me. Heres to me and you, dumper or dumpee, finding the ones were meant to be with.

You showed me a love that was unconditional and that would stay, no matter the dark pasts or the mistakes Ive made. You demonstrate what its like to not be afraid of vulnerability, and to share the deepest parts of yourself even if you are scared to. I think that takes a lot of bravery and courage, that youre willing to expose yourself and put yourself out there, knowing theres a chance youll get hurt or rejected. And still you did it for me. You made sure I felt the love and the respect that any women deserves in a relationship. You made it easy and comfortable to let go, to give in and to trust in you. You created a stress-free environment and a safe place, one where I didnt have to worry about being left if someone sees the worst and most unlovable parts of me.

I wasn't expecting you - I told myself I'd take a year to focus on my goals and my wants for once. That was the smart thing to do, after all. It made logical sense. After four years of someone telling you that you're not logical and scolding you for being something they're not, logical sounded good. When I answered your post, I wasn't even really sure why I did it. All I knew is that it made me \*feel\* something. It had been so long since I truly felt \*something\*. You were honest and vulnerable. You were unapologetic. You seemed like an old soul, and I was immediately drawn to you. So I took a leap. Those first days were like a runaway train. We couldn't have stopped it if we tried. You told me you loved me. It was fast, but I knew I loved you too. You matched my hopes and dreams and desires one by one. You shared a tatter of your bruised soul, only a sliver, but I could tell how deep the wound went. You've lived a life - a big life. A big life that has both hurt you and grown you. I haven't lived a life that big at all. You amazed me and overwhelmed me in equal measure. The only thing that scared me was how much I wasn't scared - of our love, of you. Logically, I knew we were crazy, no one would understand! How could they? They weren't us and they didn't know what we shared. What we \*knew\*. Inside, I felt my clinical, jaded heart melt. I hadn't even realized that somewhere along the way I had started to view love as a transaction - a bill to be paid, a chore to check off the to-do list, a condition in a binding document. I let you sweep me away and cover me with your protection and adoration. Your insistence that we'd find a way despite the distance and the uncertainty of timelines and responsibilities we knew we couldn't change right now. And each sleepless night bled into the next hazy day - nothing but you on my mind. You surprised me again with flights. We had to see each other. To hold each other and kiss the lips we'd seen and thought about, but hadn't yet touched. The waiting nearly killed us! Seeing you approach in the airport was one of the sweetest memories I will ever hold. Your arms engulfed me perfectly. Our lips found each other effortlessly. I wasn't meeting you for the first time, I was meeting you \*again\*. Like I told you, this was just a continuation of a conversation we'd been having in another life. But somewhere in those few days we had together, something changed. I got scared. Suddenly you were real. Your vulnerability was real. We were real. This was real. And that meant that what we had could really go away. You could really go away. And take my softened heart with you. I started to curl up inside myself and the doubts crept in. About myself, my worthiness, my ability to care for your heart and past wounds. And I felt you curl up too, but I wasn't sure if it was because of me or because of your own demons. When you left, I felt your peace of mind leave too. You retreated into yourself - to solve a problem? To have a think? You couldn't share. You needed space. You need space, like I know I do too. But my fear got the better of me. I let the doubts run rampant. And I let you go. Because in a whiskey-soaked moment, retreating into myself - the only person who can't leave me - was more comforting than the comfort of your words, your arms, your heart. More comforting than waiting for you to open that beautiful mind of yours. And you let me. Because whiskey-soaked moments still count. Because words have significance and can't be unsaid. Because you've been through enough, and in that moment I became one more woman who let you down. There's no doubt in my mind that you are my soulmate. I felt it weeks ago, I feel it still. But I pushed you away. And there's no one I can blame for that except myself. Now I have a bruised soul too."

Im rediscovering myself and my sexuality post the assault and I cant the thank you enough for being there to when I needed you before the end.

109,vulnerability,BreakUps,I need some outside insight on what the hell Ive been doing to myself: I believe my ex may be a sociopath and I codependent.,2,d1tr96,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/d1tr96/i_need_some_outside_insight_on_what_the_hell_ive/,2019-09-10 03:08:53,"Hey guys. First of all, I love this sub. I recently joined and have been reading all the posts and they make me feel so hopeful and not at all alone or isolated. Im hoping for the best for everyone.  Where to begin. I met my ex back in April. He was in my city for school and is originally from another town/province about 8 hours away. I originally just wanted somebody to hook up with and I felt as though Id made that quite clear. We went on a date, went back to his place, hooked up, and I went home. He then texted me that night after I made it home and since then had never stopped. About a week after we hooked up, school had ended and he moved back to his hometown. We still continued texting and talking and he was very forward about still wanting to see and spend time with me. By the end of May (so one month in), he had asked if Id be willing to come visit him if he paid for a flight out. I said yes, and then he ended up having a job interview in my city the week I was supposed to fly out. We instead decided it made more sense to see each other then. We saw each other, all was good. He brought up how he was looking for a job close to where I lived, which I found interesting after only a month of talking. I should mention that I have been through a fair amount of trauma in my life and have mental health issues, as does he. We opened up a lot on our first date about that and connected very fast. I definitely think we trauma bonded and that connection came extremely quick. He was then back in my city the next weekend for his convocation and invited me to come with him to his convocation party, which I did. Again, all went well. But on his drive back home Sunday, he started to share with me that he knew he had issues especially regarding his mental health, ex: he can easily go cold as he has major vulnerability issues, he knows that he is capable of really hurting others, etc. I should also mention I work in the realm of social work and of course, Im an empath as fuck (classic). We talked about it and he said he just felt like I deserved to know that he had issues. I definitely took it as a red flag, and I pulled back though we continued to text. About 3 weeks later I had a conference in his city. We met up, went for dinner, spent time together, etc. It was great. By this point we hadnt talked about exclusivity but we both had said we werent seeing or talking to anybody else. He then told me that day that hed accepted a job offer in his city that would likely have him travel often, and far. Before I could say anything he told me he would fly me out as often as I wanted and was hopeful id still want to continue what we were doing and see where it went despite distance. When I got back home to my city, I texted him and let him know Id need space for a couple days as I was conflicted about where to go from here with more distance and his new job. He was really receptive and said he understood and that he was still here if I needed him. Then that night, he texted me a paragraph saying he was there through thick and thin, whatever I needed he would do, anything I needed he was there. A sweet gesture, but not exactly the space I was asking for. I found that interesting and noted it as well. Within a day of starting his job they flew him out to a new city, another 10 hours from HIS city, and that has been his new home base. When he moved out there he really ramped things up: FaceTime, daily phone calls, asking for my schedule so he could find what flights worked to book to fly me out and him flying out to me, asking if Id be interested in spending my birthday out there, etc. Then, his job transferred him again to a new city in a neighbouring country. I was pretty devastated as I felt like we were really in a good place and then it was crushed. His company/work is also all consuming (Ive looked the company up on reddit and everything is the same as hes said  14 hour days, working weekends, moving at the drop of a hat, etc), I was very conflicted about if I should keep going with this or if I should walk away as it didnt seem at all realistic to pursue a relationship. But by this point I was already in the feels of it all. Fast forward to this past weekend. My friends planned a surprise birthday trip for me and it so happened to be to his home city. It also ended up that two days before we left, he found out he was given the weekend off and would get to fly home. He was so excited, said he couldnt wait to see me, how lucky we were that it worked out, etc etc. Friday night he flies in and I let him know were doing a girls night but that Id see him Saturday. Hes consistent all day Saturday, asking where well go, what time. Then last minute pulls the I have a family friend in the hospital Im going to visit can I pick you up tomorrow and we can spend the day together tomorrow instead. Im not an insensitive pos but Im also intuitive and that did not sit well with me. I explained that I knew visiting hours wouldnt be all night, that he could still meet up with us after, and that I felt super sad and shitty that we were finally in the same city and he couldnt make it work for even a couple hours. His response: no response. No text back. No Im sorry youre upset can we talk about this tomorrow. The next day (Sunday) he called me around 1:30 pm. I didnt answer. I still havent heard from him again. I feel like I should have ran when he straight up said he can go cold and has those vulnerability issues. But I didnt. As they say when somebody tells you who they are, believe them. Ive been back and forth on whether to just completely ghost, or say my piece. Id like to call him back and completely come unglued, tbh, as I feel I deserve to be heard. But at the same time, does it really matter? As for the codependency, I think Im loyal to a fault and Im worried about getting sucked back in. I need some insight, guys."
110,vulnerability,BreakUps,Re: the obsessive thoughts,15,d1tyvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/d1tyvd/re_the_obsessive_thoughts/,2019-09-10 03:24:41,"I watched a video recently regarding why we constantly think about our exes. Weve placed labels or symbols of our affection onto them from something we have been lacking in our lives and we typically develop those tendencies way early in life. So a neglectful parent or family members who neglected us we seek out attention from them and then when we get romantically involved that partner fills that missing need so we place that symbol or label of affection on them unfairly. I liken it to dropping our grocery items in anothers basket. We entrust them with these items because we want them to be able to carry that for us when in reality we should be carrying our own shit in our own basket. So when this person says no to us or to carrying our grocery items we feel neglected all over again. We feel like a hurt child wondering why we werent good enough and that pain strikes through to the heart of our issues. We are reminded that we are not desired but thats just our minds telling us that. And that wouldnt be the reality. That would be our obsessive and wounded minds trying to convince us that this is our reality. Dont believe it. I bet if you look closely you are desired in some way. By a grandparent? A close friend? A pet? A child? Yourself? Those with abandonment issues tend to only accept the love from those who abandoned us because growing up those were the actions of people closest to us. So that feels normal. But its not. So we ignore the healthier relationships because that doesnt ring true to us. So we neglect whats healthy and become attached to whats not healthy. So back to the analogy, remove those grocery items from anothers basket. Put them right back into your basket and carry them all the way to the check out line. Pay for them. Take them home and make a nice healing soup out of them.  Own them. Take full accountability for them. Work through them and turn them into something great. Dont place your baggage onto someone else. Its not fair to them and it cheats yourself. No matter what they did, they are still a human being trying to make sense out of the world and life just like you areno matter what age you are. People learn at their own pace. Let them learn their lessons but take care of yourself first and foremost. No matter whos to blame you still have some accountability to own up to and learn from. So learn from this situation. Heal and cry if need be. Become pathetic for a time if need be. That will shed some light on your vulnerability and will eventually clear room in your heart for another. But you have to go through these growing pains in order to grow and learn. Be good to yourself. Be kind to yourself. Show yourself some love because you deserve love and you are loved. "
111,vulnerability,BreakUps,My own perspective and advice,22,d2ukmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/d2ukmp/my_own_perspective_and_advice/,2019-09-12 04:24:14,"Dear broken-hearted ones, I am here to share my story with you. I would not share it if it were not because I believe it might truly help you all, for my own perspective has completely changed since the first nights of insomnia, sobbing, general misery. This is what I think: if you, like me, felt completely broken and in despair after a break-up, then that means that you needed the break-up. When my partner broke up with me, I felt completely devastated. It was the least mutual breakup you could imagine. Throughout our 5 year long relationship, she had always been the most loving one. Yet one day she started to have doubts and to feel subsumed by the relationship and decided to break up. I felt devastated. But now I know that she was right. It took therapy, exercise, and strong friendships to get over it. But in the end what helped me was not to improve myself or to look better. What helped me was to understand that she was right: from a fairly independent person, I had ended up becoming totally dependent on her for my well-being. It hurt so much not only because it was worth it, as many people say. It hurt so much because I had let myself fall into a position of total vulnerability that is not advisable to start with. It is of course normal to feel sad. But to feel suicidal, depressed, etc... that reveals problems that go well beyond a relationship. You will be surprised to know that after six months apart, after six months re-building our own selves and exploring brief relationships with other people, we are back together. But we came back together from a completely new place. If I could only give you one piece of advice, it would be this: romantic love is not an ending. There is no person you end up with. Romantic love is a part of your story. If you feel that your whole life is shattered, then the relationship was not healthy for you to start with. Work on understanding why you feel that way and on re-building yourself. Happiness will come, and it will be better than when you were on the relationship. I am certain."
112,vulnerability,BreakUps,"""True Love Waits"" - Radiohead",2,d5cj4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/d5cj4a/true_love_waits_radiohead/,2019-09-17 15:28:31,"Having some thoughts tonight. As I stand before a huge week before me, and enter the unknown of setting foot into my new career (Paramedicine), I'm having a lot of racing thoughts. I miss her. Just like many of us miss them. For so long, I believed she was someone who she has certainly proved she isn't now. Isn't this always the case with our ex-lovers? It makes me think, wow--maybe they really were THAT person that they are now and I simply missed the signs. The memories are tainted. I don't know for sure if she cheated, but she left me and got with some stranger within two weeks when I NEEDED her the most. I still needed her. She was my best friend and even though I was incredibly stressed and a little distant, at the end of the day I thought we had some kind of future. I always told her we could never be friends after being together unless all feelings were gone. She hated hearing that. Now I have to face the rest of my life without her. I thought it was pure luck that I found someone like her to begin with. She was the BEST and WORST thing that ever happened to me. She taught me so much about myself, and yet slipped the sharpest knife under my skin. She had me convinced that she never WANTED to let go of people. She tried reaching out to old friends, old ex-lovers to be friends many times while she was with me because she never wanted to end on bad terms. I admired that about her. She was cheated on for a long time by her ex boyfriend, and then ultimately they never spoke again. I saw the hurt she went through for a very long time. She said I helped her and saved her. I got her into the program for the field she always wanted to be in, and I heard recently that she excelled and got her license. Even though I told her I wouldn't be contacting her again for any reason, I thought she would at least check in or let me know she got her license. Maybe she feels guilty, or maybe she simply just doesn't care about me anymore. The latter is hard to believe, but I guess I have to accept that regardless she's not in my life anymore. It's painful. They say that love songs can be the most foolish to pay attention to in a state of emotional vulnerability. Radiohead's ""True Love Waits"" I believe really captivates the feeling of acceptance towards someone who won't love you the way you love them. We love our ex-lovers, but they don't see us the same anymore. Some of them we'll never hear from again. Some of them we miss dearly. Some of them hurt us so badly that we make the mistake of doing really harmful things. At the end of the day, they just aren't on the same level as we are and that is so god damn painful. I can't believe she's really gone. It's been four months. ""Not friends. Not enemies. Just strangers with some memories."""
113,vulnerability,BreakUps,A different kind of breakup.,1,d6golr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/d6golr/a_different_kind_of_breakup/,2019-09-20 02:42:26," Hey all, quick story: I was dating a wonderful woman since February of last year and overall things were going well. Wed get into arguments on how I handle manifestations of my anxiety/OCD and my partner would frequently express her doubts of being able to handle it. Any time things would be rough for a while, this talking point always came up. Things were going well since I started seeing a therapist again, learning not to betray boundaries with her and working on using her as a means of coping with stress. But we made dinner last night and she became silent. We began exploring and the subject came up again: I dont know about our relationship because of your mental health. She said she has been trying to make herself happy with me for a while now. She feels like she hasnt been happy for a bit. Based on her physiological reactions (sobbing, hyperventilating and shaking), I believe she has been holding this in for a long time now. It killed her to finally tell me that she hasnt been happy. It struck like a cold lightening bolt in my chest and the ice cold feeling coursed through my arms, stomach and travelled down my body. It hurts. The pain is real. Im not running from it, Im not avoiding it. I am fucking sad. I love her so much. Because of this though I feel like I have to let go and move on. If she feels like she cannot handle my mental health, I will respect that because thats her choice. Not 15 minutes into work today, two coworkers asked me if I was okay because I seemed off. I immediately started sobbing at my desk and sought refuge in the restroom stall, making sure to mask my sobs when other men came in. I opened up to my boss and we chatted in the conference room for over an hour and she provided some good insight and advice. Ive established support with my room mates and explained how I am going to need them for a while to feel okay. Right now, my partner and I decided to take a week to see if this is something we can salvage, but I dont think it is because this is something that has come up multiple times in the past. Matter of fact, I have been exactly where she was last night in college with one of my old partners. I refused to acknowledge the reality of our dissipating relationship. And it came out very violently (sobbing, shaking and hyperventilating) at the end. I know how she feels and it may arguably be worse than what Im experiencing. I fundamentally believed that something was wrong with me at the time of this breakup circa 2016. Why cant I hold down a relationship? What is wrong with ME that caused this relationship to fail? It took me a long time to realize that there isnt anything wrong with me, we were just incompatible. It took a lot of self-reflection, therapy and time to realize this. I had no support from my friends, mainly because I never opened up. I didnt want to seem weak and show vulnerability and dependence. But this breakup is different. Shortly after leaving her house, I knew it wasnt because of me as a person. I didnt blame myself or reduce myself to a mental disorder. I didnt think that there was something inherently wrong with me. It was just sadness. Cold. Fucking. Sadness. The tragedy of it all. We had such a good relationship, social life and sexual life, but we were different from each other. I experienced mental health issues frequently while shes never known anyone who has struggled with anxiety/ OCD. This pain is awful. I know there are going to be times in the near future where Im going to miss her and smell her and see her and be reminded of her. Im going to find various objects of hers in my house and its going to set me back. I will allow myself to feel everything I am going to feel. I plan to use this time to nurture myself and learn more about myself. I just want to type out the internal monologue for all the men in the future who will go through this. I want everyone here to know that pain, loss and sadness are universal emotions that we are entitled to feel as humans in this world. With all this being expressed, lets chat. What has helped you heal from breakups in the past? What should I try? What should I avoid? I feel like I am in a decent enough place to cope with what I have, but I suspect the tough times will come. Its my inclination to prepare for fallout, but it hasnt come yet, this gives me hope that Ive grown and matured as a former hopeless romantic who needed to be loved by an other to have a sense of self worth. This is the first time that I havent doubted who I am and my worth after a break up and thats fucking amazing. Thank you all for reading all of this, and a TL;DR is necessary I suppose for those in a crunch: TL;DR: breakup = mesadnolikey but Im okay, what do now?"

115,vulnerability,BreakUps,Confused and Hurting: He loves me but isn't falling in love with me,1,d8qv7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/d8qv7l/confused_and_hurting_he_loves_me_but_isnt_falling/,2019-09-25 04:01:01," *I went through a break-up on Saturday that's left me confused and really hurting. His reasoning was that he wasn't falling in love with me and didn't think he could get there. While I know we can never fully understand what someone else is thinking or feeling, I'm hoping maybe some of you who have had similar experiences can provide some insight.* To give you a looooong background - My boyfriend (24) and I (26) had been dating for 8 months. This was his first ever committed relationship. His only dating experience has ever been hooking up and he's never had crushes on anyone, let alone been in love. I've been in a couple of long-term, serious relationships. I told him I wanted to be exclusive in April after about 3 months into our relationship. He wasn't sure initially but later decided he wanted to be as well. He explained that his reservations were that he wasn't sure if he was capable of falling in love with someone (which made me so sad to hear), and was worried about any relationship becoming loveless and unhealthy. But he wanted me to feel good in our relationship, wanted to continue dating me, and wanted to build our intimacy, ""I want to get to know more about your relationship with your parents, what you liked to do as a kid. I want to be nice to you."" Our relationship was going really well until June, when he broke up with me the day after getting back from a vacation. I was completely blindsided. He said he wanted to be able to have sex with other people, which was a dealbreaker for me. I didn't understand why he felt this way when we'd been having sex multiple times a week and he said it was the best sex he'd ever had. One time during sex he told me how beautiful I was, how lucky he was to get to have sex with me, and how lucky he was to get to know me. And he is rarely an effusive person. He cried just about as much as I did while he was breaking up with me. He is also generally a person who does not show vulnerability. This was the first time I'd ever seen him cry and he was besides himself. He told me he loved me and that he really wanted to stay friends. I've never seen someone look so crestfallen and devastated as when I told him I didn't think I'd be able to. About 18 hours later he texted me saying he made a huge mistake and had fucked up. He said from the moment he left my house into the next day he couldn't stop crying. We talked about it and got back together. I was so relieved and so was he. He explained that what he initially thought was a desire to have sex with other people wasn't the case at all, but that he was experiencing a lot of emotional baggage surrounding sex itself. I asked him how long he had been feeling this baggage and the desire to break up with me and he said it was only during the past week that he was on vacation that he realized he felt that way. He had been putting such intense pressure on himself to be having sex that sex with me became a huge source of anxiety and untenable stress. I asked him to explain to me what exactly he was having such anxiety about but he wasn't sure, and he never really explored it with me again. I told him I never expect anything from him and that I wanted to support him as he worked through this. We took a break from sex for a couple of weeks after which we set expectations about how often he felt like he was able to have sex. Since June we have had multiple difficult conversations about sex, about what it means to us, and how we can have a healthy sex life. He told me that his sex drive has always been inconsistent. In the past when he wanted to have sex he would seek it out through random hookups every couple of weeks, but that it was a dissociative experience for him, and toxic. If he hooked up with someone he wouldn't want to see them for at least three days because of the emotional labor of the experience. I knew he masturbated every day so I once asked what he did when we spent the night together and didn't have sex (after he tried to break up with me we only had sex every 7-10 days but spent \~3 nights together per week) and he told me he still sometimes masturbated while we were in the same house. When I asked him why he would rather masturbate when we were in the same house when he could have sex with me he said it was like when youre hungry and you have a choice of staying home and eating a granola bar for dinner versus going out to a nice meal, sometimes you cant be bothered to go out, so you just stay home and eat the granola bar instead. Hed rather masturbate even when sex was an option because he doesnt always have the emotional capacity to have sex. He has struggled with low-grade depression for a long time, and only recently started taking medication for it, both of which he has said have affected his sex drive and capacity for sex. But for someone who claimed they didnt place a lot of emotional value in sex, it certainly seems like he did when it came to his emotional relationship with himself. The other point of difficulty we had in our relationship was our future. From the time we first started dating, he knew he wanted to move to a new city. He hated living in our current city, hated the winters, and hated his job. He had hoped it would only be a couple of months before he moved, but when his best friend was in an accident that left him paralyzed from the waist down, my exs plans of moving were up in the air. In July, my ex finally decided that he did want to make a move happen, decided the city he wanted to move to, and the timeline in which it would happen. This decision happened to coincide with when I was falling in love with him. I told him that I was beginning to fall for him but he said he was unable to reciprocate the feelings because he didnt want to be in love only to move away and break his own heart. While I understood that he didnt want to fall in love only to leave, it broke my heart that he didnt feel capable of fully leaning into the experience. I told him that and asked him to the best of his ability to continue to be fully present in our relationship and open to whatever feelings might develop, which he said he would do. During the same conversation, he invited me to an out of state family wedding, where I would meet his immediate and extended family for the first time. He recognized that given everything else we discussed it may not be a good idea and that I could do whatever felt right. I ended up deciding to go to the wedding and in the meantime I also decided that I wanted to move too. I had been thinking for the past several years about moving to the city he also wanted to move to, and for a variety of personal and professional reasons, the timing finally felt right. In regards to staying together in this new city, we both decided that it was too soon to decide. Wed only been together for about 7 months and we wanted to make one big decision at a time. Hes also been very focused on getting to a place where he wants to be in his career. Hes also been very worried about his friend who was in an accident, crying to me at times about just how hard it was to make the decision to move because he doesnt want to leave his friend. After meeting his family I started to fall for him even harder. I felt like we had worked through our difficulties and were closer than ever. But I was also feeling increasingly anxious about where our relationship would stand when we both ended up moving, so I asked him his thoughts on it again. He basically said that he wanted his moving to be a new start and that he felt like he needed the opportunity to better himself and that he felt like a fuck-up (he went to a very good school, and has only been in his first job out of school for 1 year, is using his major but not exactly in his line of interest. I would hardly call that a fuck-up) and he couldnt imagine doing this while bringing a relationship along with him. I said it sounded like he had basically already made up his mind and decided, contradicting what he had said a couple of weeks prior. He said he guessed he did but that he didnt know and feelings change. We talked about the possibility of taking a break when we moved and he said he wouldnt care if I were casually hooking up with other people, but that he wouldnt want me dating anyone else. Even though it would be painful if I were to date someone else, he said the worst thing that could happen was if I didnt stay in his life at all. He knew that was a lot to ask of me, but that he wanted to be with me and it didnt make sense to him to make any decisions about our relationship now if we didnt have to. He said this too when we had the conversation in April about exclusivity. I had expressed that I wouldnt feel comfortable continuing our relationship if he were dating or having sex with other people. Even back then he said that he wouldnt mind if I were having sex with other people, but that he wouldnt want me dating anyone in the same emotional capacity we had been dating. Fast forward to this past Saturday, and he texted me and said he wanted to talk. I got super anxious and asked him what he wanted to talk about. He said some relationship stuff had been bothering him but that he didnt want to talk about it over the phone. I asked him if he wanted to breakup, to which he replied I dont want to jump to breaking up when I have problems, thats backfired in the recent past, I want to communicate with you and again not over the phone. This eased my anxiety but I still had him come over to talk anyway. The second he walked through my door I knew by the look on his face that he had come to break up with me afterall. I couldnt believe it. He said he hadnt started falling in love with me like I had with him, and didnt think he could match my enthusiasm for our relationship, that continuing didnt feel right anymore. I said he had made me feel so loved, that I didnt understand why what we had was all of the sudden not enough. I asked him how long hed been feeling like this was bothering him and he said only in the last week. I told him despite all the love he had given me, and the times he had told me loved me, I felt like he never really tried to be open to \*falling in love\* with me. That it always felt like he had walls up, and how could he expect to fall in love when he never fully let me in. That he never tried to ask me the questions and get to know the things he said he wanted to get to know about me back in April. I asked him how he knew he wasnt falling in love. He said he didn't know, that maybe he was self-sabotaging, maybe he wasnt ready for a relationship, but that he had to take the risk of listening to his instincts. That he wasnt happy about it but that he needed to do it. He told me cared about me, that I was his friend, and that he wanted me to be happy, but that he didnt see our relationship continuing to 10 months, to a year. He was crying but not nearly as hard as I was. But when I asked him if I did anything wrong, that was the moment he cried the hardest, and he couldnt say no fast enough. I had to ask him to sit with me and give me a hug because I didnt want him to leave. He had been sitting at the end of my bed or standing, not looking at me whenever he talked. I told him I was going to miss his little kisses and cuddles and he said he would miss them too. I asked him if he had romantic feelings for me and he said he did. As he was leaving, I told him I was going to miss him a lot and he told me he missed me already. I kept hoping he would text me the next day like he did the last time, saying that he had made a mistake. But he didnt. The only thing thats happened is that hes already unfollowed me on instagram. I know all of this is indicative of the fact that he probably wasnt ready for a serious relationship or to be in love in the first place. But what I cant understand is why he said his reason for ending things was because he wasnt falling in love with me. He said he was afraid he wouldnt be able to fall in love, then that he didnt want to fall in love, and then later he wanted me to stay with him even though he couldnt give me the promise of staying together through the move. None of those things struck me as someone for whom not falling in love would be a dealbreaker. I know he was struggling with not being happy on the day-to-day because of his job. I know a lot of his emotional energy was going toward his friend, that he was still dealing with getting his depression in check, and that he seemingly had issues with self-esteem/self-worth. But he did love me, and up until this weekend it seemed like that was enough. The other thing I cant understand is why, in spite of our relationship difficulties, he expressed love in the way he did. He was always affectionate but especially in the last several months of our relationship. He was always giving me little tender kisses, big hugs, cuddling up to me. Every morning after we spent the night together, he would roll over and spoon me for as long as he could before getting up. He would hold my hand as we were falling asleep. He would smush my cheeks and say how I was cute he could cry. He would compliment me on the way I looked. He once told me a long list of all the things he liked about me. One time when I thanked him for being so nice to me he told me that I deserve nothing less, and that being nice to me was like watering his favorite plant. He made an equal, if not more of an effort than me, to plan dates and for us to spend time together. He was always happy to see me. When I was sick he would come over just to say hi and bring me food. Once after a dinner with his family where there wasnt enough food to go around, without asking if I was still hungry because he knew I wouldn't want to bother anyone by saying something, he got up and went to the kitchen and made me pasta with homemade pasta sauce. He told his mom it was because I wasnt getting enough to eat. When I was down or worried he always made an effort to encourage and support me. He told me he brought me to meet his family because I was special and important to him. He brought me to meet all of his friends after only about 6 weeks of dating, and continued to bring me to spend time with his friends regularly through the rest of our relationship. His friends told me how much they liked me, and how easily I fit into their family. As a nonprofit employee, he insisted on paying for everything. From ubers to his house, to shared groceries, to meals and dates, because he didnt want me to have to worry about spending time together. For his birthday, I made him a cake from scratch. When I gave it to him he embraced me for the longest time and couldnt stop thanking me. He once told me he was never and would never be as emotionally or physically intimate with anyone who he considered to just be a friend, and I know he has never shared his life with anyone, even his closest friends, in the same way he has with me. It breaks my heart that he wont be a regular part of my life anymore. I truly love him and am in love with him. I want him to be happy and to do what he needs to do, and I deserve to be with someone who is ready to embrace a serious relationship. But I just cant stop thinking - in spite of all his own personal issues, how could someone who did all they did for me, let me into their lives in a way they never had let anyone before, not want me to be with anyone else, still love me, but not be *falling* *in love* with me at the same time. Perhaps Im having such a hard time understanding because I would never be able to do all the things he did if I only loved someone, and werent also in love with them. After talking it over with friends and based on the info I have, I feel like the issue wasn't that he wasn't falling in love with me, but that he wasn't ready to fall in love. I don't know if he knew this, and I don't want to make assumptions about how he was feeling. But I just can't fathom that you could share your life with someone the way he did with me and not in your heart of hearts be in love with them. It's another thing to actually be able to accept those feelings in your life and actualize them, which I don't think he could. I also can't understand how someone who up until a couple of weeks ago could seem like they weren't prioritizing falling in love, would have such a change of heart for their own sake. I knew he didn't want to hurt me and he had expressed that worry before regarding our differences in feelings, but the breakup was more about how not falling in love was \*hurting him\* not that it was hurting him to hurt me. The idea that he thinks he couldn't and wouldn't ever be able to fall in love with me is so much more tremendously painful than just the timing wasn't right for him. I find consolation in the idea that if two people are meant to be together one day they will be, but it's hard to find that consolation now while being under the impression that he thinks I'm someone he could never fully be in love with. *TL;DR: my bf broke up with me because he said he wasn't falling in love with me? what has been your experience with being on the giving or receiving end of I love you but Im not in love with you""? What did being in love versus loving someone look like to you?*"

I know this quote is not something that can immediately solve all the problems and heartaches, but I am learning to fully accept my own present. I am leaning the distinction between thoughts and feelings. A lot of time, my mind is crowded with thoughts about the breakup and the relationship itself. These thoughts would make me feel a mixture of emotions, then new thoughts will arise, and they become a distraction, preventing me from fully sinking into my feelings. Today, for the first time I have experienced the sadness that Ive been carrying, with no distraction. I lied on the floor with my eyes closed for 45 minutes with no distraction. I was not scrolling mindlessly on my phone, the room was silent. I allowed my thoughts to come and go, and truly got in touch with my own vulnerability. It was overwhelming, it was frightening to be completely drowned in my own sadness and nothing else, but I did it. This is the first step of me knowing myself, and accepting that it is okay to really feel sad. I dont need to keep running away from myself."

This is the highest, purist and bravest form of love anyone can offer. Never be ashamed of that vulnerability, and be glad that you were brave enough and strong enough to be vulnerable, even if it wasn't appreciated or recognised. Don't be afraid to be vulnerable again, the next time your heart is open it will sing because it is open to another brave vulnerable soul who is open in return."

Not a piece with that person, your memories, where you last saw him/her, where he/she is now and where he/she is not. Collect all your parts and start patching them up together again. It is your duty to build yourself again. Your broken and sharp edges might cut you in the process. Just bleed. Eventually, the blood flow will stop. The healing will then start. All wounds heal unless you keep on reopening them. Reclaim your life. He/She doesn't care about you anymore and it is okay. You shouldn't too. Everytime you close your eyes at night, let go just a little and in the morning, be a little less broken. Until finally, you let go of everything and you will wake up one day and you are back whole again. Be patient and just endure the pain. Just keep your head high and embrace your vulnerability. This is not the time to replay what happened but just leave it as is and move forward. He/She is moving on with his life and you should too. Imagine him/her getting far while you are left behind in the same spot where he left you. Start moving with any energy you have left. It is a good beginning. Just continue thriving. Choose yourself. Stop putting that person or the both of you in the options. It is long gone. Just focus on yourself. You are what is left in your life right now. Erase him from the equation. Don't be stubborn to resist the change. This is happening. This is happening right now. Face it. Stop rewriting what is not happening. Don't wait for more evidence to come up. It will just hurt you some more. Decide now and commit to it. Hope is not what you need but true release. Do not look for triggers. It is not healthy. Obssession is not healthy. Attachment is a poison. Longing is a virus. Don't succumb to these sickness. You are hurt enough already so heal from it and do not aggravate your situation. Let go. You can do it.

X, Life is just better with your smiling face, your name lighting up my phone with some story or joke, you making fun of slam poets who always talk about lit-up phones. It's better when we're eating pizza or getting high or exchanging massages or sharing secrets. It's better with someone you're so close and comfortable with that you tell them things you've never admitted, or let them do something sexually new, discover that together. It's better with us discussing things so passionately because we have similar tastes, but different enough that we can show each other a new perspective. It's better because we grow together. You can't say you didn't grow in huge ways. I understand that we need to grow with space from each other, but I don't accept or understand your claims that you actually don't love me, or the idea that a future together is unlikely. If you don't love me, you're a great actor. In our future together there will be space to breathe and grow, to follow our passions, to share joy and sadness, there will be a million fun dates where we just laugh the whole way through, because we get each other's humour like that. There will be communication and vulnerability, because all relationships have conflict and I'm determined to work through it in healthy ways. There will be your family, who I'll forgive and who will accept me eventually because I make you happy. There will be support. There will be food. There will be love. There will be jazz bars and dressing up and rooftop sex and axe throwing and reading aloud. I have faith in you, in myself, and in us together. I'll see you soon."

When we started dating, (after we both went through bad marriages, unhealthy relationships, loss of a parent growing up), we found out we lived practically parallel lives. We started talking (at 39 &amp;amp; 40) and realized he lived four houses down from me until he was 9 or 10 or so. We both lost our dads - about a year apart. Way too soon. We married our ex-spouses on August 2 and August 3, same year. We built and moved into our houses the same week (miles apart). My dad died on his dads birthday. Theres so much stupid shit that we shared, just weird parallel lives type of shit. I let myself believe there was meaning in all of this. Before this, I was a pragmatic, logical, keep you at arms length type of woman. I dont equate sex with love. I have never had an issue just doing what feels good at the moment and having no regret afterward, no sentimental type feeling after someone makes me cum. None of that. After my separation with my ex husband, shit didnt change who I was at the core; when it came to having a connection with someone, being able to fun night of laughter, ridiculous stories/experiences, followed by great sex never seemed to affect me in a way I saw most people experience. Its how Im wired, I thought. For the last two years, he was who I wanted. More than anything. I am a flirt by nature and have somewhat of a history of the grass seems greener (or the dick seems better) mentality but with Adam, I could flirt but never thought once I would follow down that road, I gave him my all. Everything. When I think back through my relationships in my past, I-had a tendency to keep one foot out the door. This. Was. Different. I actively stepped outside my comfort zone because I finally realized that I cant continue that way and expect someone else to give me his all when I cant find that part of me Until tonight, I thought he was the exception to my view most relationships are shit. He was kind. He was supportive. He was level headed. He was sweet. He remembered details. He didnt yell or swear at me when he was upset or angry. He was gentle and he was right there to calm me down when my sleeping subconscious took ahold and turned my dreams into nightmares that I somehow lived through. He wasnt insecure. He assured me that he wouldnt leave when my PMS hormones turned me into the watered down version of the antichrist. I saw him in every part of my future. After what seemed like a long time (6-8 months), I introduced him to my kids. My daughter was about to graduate college and I wanted her to love the heart I thought I saw in him. My son (13 years old) kept his distance but in the last 6 months or so, he (my son) opened up and shared things that I could not fathom. He became ethans favorite.closest friend. I got used to them palling me around. I could see their motives but not understand their tactics. There is always the fear of rage. But more than that, they need us for something. My burden unfortunately is to figure that out. While a lot of people enjoy the strange hospitality of these judges, most dont understand how much theyre fucking themselves and are just fine with that. Also (to the OP) I misjudged you. You are a warrior. sadness and shock took over and The empty void in my gut will be what kills me, but hopefully I can redeem myself enough to see everyones pain dissipate. It feels like I already took it all. II will never be able to forgive myself for letting someone in my kids lives. This hurts so much and my son loving him after this long period of time is just too much. I can fail myself but failing my children because of my lack of keeping my head together and not protecting their vulnerability is indescribable. He will talk about him for a long time. I just dont know how to explain this to anyone. I dont understand. tl;dr I let every hesitation I had about relationships go. I was right before."

I told her if she keeps thinking I am not the one then I will never be how much ever I try. So things became really awesome we loved each other. Her parents and family loved me. Then 5 months later she came home and ended things saying we were incompatible. We had minor arguments like every other couple I communicated but she kept things in her heart. I became vulnerable and showed her how much I loved her and she said I wants to move in some day, have kids, engaged etc. And suddenly it all ended. After couple weeks she started going out on dates with our common friends and then my best friend. its been 3 months I still get thoughts in my head all day but they are not viscous anymore. Occasionally makes me anxious. I know my self worth and I am highly secure person but I guess my 100% vulnerability towards her hurt me alot. I have been meditating alot to feel all the emotions coming in my brain but I cannot stop thinking (Not the past, not the break up) just about her. Before me She was engaged for 3 months(Aug 2017) and her fiancee ended it for self worth Issues and lack of communication, then aftercouple months she dated another guy for 3 months, then after that another guy until she met me.

She came from an evangelical upbringing like I did, but hadnt completely worked through her deconversion when we started dating. I was her first for a lot of things. Physical intimacy, sex, weed. She has a pretty serious anxiety problem that we worked on throughout the relationship. I dealt with so many panic attacks and manic periods that I cant even remember them all. Originally I kept things fun and light but as she pushed me for more commitment and vulnerability I let my guard down and fell in love. The more vulnerable I became, the less I feel like she was attracted to me. Throughout all this, the sex was a challenge. I did everything I could to try and help her get off, but no luck. I bought her first toys, I tried everything she wanted and then some. Read *She Comes First* and put it into practice, but nothing. Whats crazy is that she still wanted to have sex ALL THE TIME. Wed spend entire days in bed fucking. She loved it, but no orgasm. It was really messing with me that I couldnt make the girl I love cum. A month ago I left for a trip to Mongolia (Im from the US) and while I was gone she hooked up with 3 different guys, one guy multiple occasions. This wasnt cheating by our rules as we were open, but she had never been with anyone before and I was just shocked that she slept with 3 people while I was gone and never checked in with me at all until it was over. I was pretty upset and asked that we closed the relationship until I get back and we can decide what to do then. Whats crazy is that early on she had expressed similar concerns about being open when I would see other people so I always made sure to check in with her way before, and after to make sure she was still okay with our agreement. As soon as I got home from my trip she says she wants to see me and asks me to come over, but says she has strep so shes sick. I decided to surprise her with soup and a strep care-package (cough drops, etc.) to make her feel better. So I get all this stuff together and come over to her place. I get set up in her kitchen to cook then go check on her in her room. She wants to cuddle so I get in bed and cuddle for a bit. We talk about my trip. Im there for almost an hour before she brings up that she wants to break up. Her reasons are pretty bullshit. Youre a really great boyfriend, this just doesnt feel right for me. Now I dont know where to go from here. My self confidence is shot. She says its not about the sex but I dont believe her. I think she finally got off with someone else and thats part of why shes leaving me. I feel ugly, small, bad in bed. I really fought for this relationship, I always went above and beyond to make her happy or make her life easier. Weathered all her anxiety issues and manic phases. Then she just dumps me out of the blue after having her first hook up. I just dont know why I wasnt good enough."

May be in a new relationship. I know she does not love me anymore. I feel constant guilt until the point where I cant relax or sit still or sleep. Its been 7 months now since she ended things. I know she made up her mind about me and our relationship, she felt nothing would advance and that we grew apart and I was in transition trying to find a new job. I feel so stupid after years of doing long distance that she moved into where I grew up and the environment we lived in wasnt conducive to growth or happiness for me or both of us. We worked opposite schedules too. I knew from the beginning it wasnt a positive change for me. I went along with her plan even though I wanted us both to move in together somewhere. I never got the change I needed, she did by moving somewhere new, and then she said we just grew apart multiple times the last time I saw her. I guess thats the only closure Ill get. I had no idea how she was truly feeling because she didnt express it to me or talk about anything. Shed go back to where she was from for a weekend and then detach from me and make important decisions without including me or letting me know before what was going on in her mind. I didnt change my circumstances enough because I felt stuck in my job, where we were living and this is why I feel extreme guilt. I didnt do my best for my own life which inevitably would impact our relationship. I guess its a struggle with the environment Ive been in and self belief due to numerous things, including ongoing health issues. Why do I feel like Im worthless and ugly all the time? I look in the mirror ever since things ended and I feel lost and like Im really not good enough. I hadnt thought this way for some time. The last time I saw her I could tell she doesnt care about me anymore. She got the change she wanted, met other people and grew. Over time, I didnt see the other people she was meeting became more of a priority than us being together. From the beginning of dating her, I always felt large groups of friends took precedence over one on one time (minus the honeymoon phase). Maybe she never loved me that much but just needed my emotional support? This thought makes me feel deep and terrible pain. Like there was always someone she wanted more. Since she slept with others soon after both separations and once 2 years ago while we were back together. I wonder why she stayed with me then. Was it just comfort and then she moved somewhere new and found she had a lot more options than the guy she was with for years from college? Like I became a nonentity. Meanwhile I was always doing things for her, always there in the ways I knew how. Its strange the way she acted toward me right away. Like weve been acquaintances or friends for years and not in love. I blame myself because its like I let the love die due to where we lived, stress about what Id do for my career and not knowing how to create new circumstances and positive change for myself. I think for her this conclusion is matter of fact and totally without emotion. Theres a coldness in her about this that doesnt feel warranted to me. I feel like I gave my power away to someone else. Everyday I push myself but feel Im fighting a losing battle. Like Ill never feel wholeness again. Like the vulnerability, tenderness, sweetness, and love I shared with her, opening my soul, cannot be undone or given away again. But shes onto the next and theres always someone new out there. Her friend wrote on social media: I fall in love with a part of everyone and she liked it. I know what theyre getting at, but thats so easy. Its easy because knowing groups of people on the surface isnt the same as committing to the good and bad. It doesnt take any effort or work like I feel long term relationships actually do over time. I know I failed though and thats all I keep thinking about. That and mourning the loss of her and who I was, who we were together. Thanks for reading this. I just feel stuck and in pain."

So, naturally, I started to try to heal because you left me with all these expenses that were shared. Everything doubled. Then you came back again. I told you to leave me alone but the anxiety set in. I let you come over before work. You cried and apologized and were begging and pleading for another chance.

My ex-GF and I broke up at the end of January. She ended it, giving me vague reasons and tears. I was so shocked; it was only days after she was gone that I had so many questions to ask and a host of emotions to keep me company. We dated for a year, though it was an extremely intense, first-love kind of situation. Since then, it feels like she's completely vanished, leaving only traces that she was ever there in the first place. A box of our stuff under my bed. A taboo conversation topic among friends. A familiar Netflix show or beach. We don't talk at all except for a birthday text and a lot left unsaid. So here I am, over 7 months later and still alive. The break up exposed a lot of fissures in me: a depression I'd been going through and suppressing to try to make things work, a need for my friends and community that I'd neglected, and the understanding that my personality requires connection and emotional vulnerability - something I wasn't able to express in the relationship. Therapy has helped in understanding all of this. I won't lie and say some days I don't wish I could trade the new things I've found for a time machine back to the good times I knew. Sometimes, I just let the pain wash over me until I feel numb and raw. Here's the point: there's no rules. There's no timeline. I thought for so long that I was following all the right steps and on track to be over things as soon as possible. That's not how it works. I will say you can save yourself a lot of pain down the line by just accepting all of the negative emotions after it happens. By feeling everything. I've moved forward with my life in a lot of different ways, but I'm definitely still not ""there"" yet. I don't have a ready-made list in my head of all the things that the break up made \*right\* for me or how much better my life is or how much I've moved on. I've kept going because that's all I could do. And I like to think there's still strength in that. Hopefully, this post can help anyone feeling similarly.

We were still having fun. We were still wholly committed to the future and caring for each other. The toxicity came from the inability to communicate our true feelings. I remember feeling hurt because I could tell he was more upset about a situation then he let on. I often held in little things because I just wanted us to not have to fight over little things. Little by little, we grew a resentment and that resentment killed our fire. We match each other with our values, morals, and lifestyle we would want to lead. We have a similar sense of humor and both love meaningful conversation. I am so attracted to his personality and his looks and I know it was mutual. We lacked vulnerability and trust for each others hearts. That can destroy anything. We were also not sexually meeting up and I know I made him feel disappointed because I had the higher libido. I tried compromising but some days its hard to feel rejection. Then there was my mental health and I know that completely put everything in a bind. We really were on eggshells. I am so going to miss this guy, but I know within my heart that this truly cant work unless we both can change or compromise and really want to work in it. He didnt want to do that or felt that he reached his limit. Thats okay. At first, I was upset and hurting deeply. Now, I am proud of his courage to do what was best for him.

Both people in a relationship owe it to each other to make sure that they are as kind and truthful to each other as possible and that both people try to get the other person out of the relationship as healthily as possible. If someone makes themselves vulnerable to you it is your responsibility, even as an ex, to be kind and respectful to that vulnerability. That doesn't mean staying with someone you don't like. And breakups suck, people get hurt. That's never going to change. But to just say, ""they are an ex"" and you don't owe them anything is wrong and a cop out. We can all do better than that. If your ex reaches out to you about something that is bothering them or you know you did something wrong in the relationship don't just hide behind that excuse. No contact is often the best way forward from a breakup. But don't use that or the fact that someone is an ex to be a shitty person."

After, I tried to express my emotions and said that I was feeling really secondary in our relationship and would appreciate some time just the two of us (we hadn't had any time to ourselves in weeks). He goes off on a tangent that he needs to put his needs before anyone else's (which I understand), but then suggested that he needs me to go to therapy and Al-Anon because my father triggers him. &amp;#x200B; He accused me of being abusive after I stood up for myself after he abandoned my friend and I on a hike - left the two of us alone. My friend could barely walk and had an anxiety attack from being left. I had to help carry her halfway down a mountain. So I got angry at him, saying, ""really? going to fucking leave us behind? not cool."" I was so upset he did that. Maybe I overreacted, but I wasn't going to let him get away with that behavior. He didn't think he did anything wrong. But abusive? &amp;#x200B; Finally, he refused to come to visit me after my dog's sudden death, then when I became upset he wasn't there to support me, he said that he watched his father blame his misfortunes and his emotions on other people and I needed to deal with it myself. &amp;#x200B; Then when we ended things, all he said was he had some things to deal with that he hasn't addressed with his fathers death and he needed to detach for a while. No closure, no explanation. Again, I understand. His mother is a self-described mental health guru, and it's been giving me terrible anxiety that she's been feeding these thoughts to him - that I'm just like his dad, and he needs to remove me from his life. I really worry that he won't seek actual therapy and just take his mother's advice. It's so incredibly hurtful. I would never do a thing to hurt anyone, and I always put others before me (but trying to learn to put myself first). &amp;#x200B; I tried to meet his needs, be communicative, express my emotions. I realize now I was codependent on him, but I'm kind of struggling with the logic of it. There are definitely things I know now with my codependency that I didn't before, and I would've done things differently. I know I was reacting to his changed behavior. I know you need to detach and not let other people's actions and emotions influence you, but how are you supposed to express when you've been hurt in a healthy way? I tried to open up a conversation, but I was getting nothing. I'm just so confused and hurt and sad. &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the long rant. Just need to vent. Anyways. First therapy session ever this afternoon."
132,vulnerability,BreakUps,Forgiveness.,4,clk8v0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/clk8v0/forgiveness/,2019-08-04 01:52:29,"Whenever I am having a day where I carry the grief of the break up so intensely, I give myself and my ex forgiveness. I will have a conversation with him in my head, as communication or contact is not an option and not helpful to anyone at this point. At first, I would tell him that I forgive him. I remind him that there will always be a chord between us and that I will always find love, care and compassion towards him, even within those moments of hurt. But lately, I tell myself that I forgive myself. I forgive myself for completely abandoning myself and my needs, for being extremely codependent, for constantly fearing abandonment rather than being present and enjoying our love, for the underlying doubt and fear of vulnerability, for not making my needs or my boundaries clear, for not always respecting his boundaries. I forgive myself for the anger and frustration I felt that I failed to communicate. I forgive myself for remaining within circumstances that were detrimental to my own and his mental health. I forgive myself for taking so much responsibility. I forgive myself for not saying no. I forgive myself for how I spoke to you when you told me you wanted out. I forgive myself for getting lost in our wonderful, complicated, intense love and trying to constantly preserve it, rather than fully enjoying and embracing it. I forgive myself for idealizing you, and I hope you can forgive me too. I forgive myself for creating negative narratives and renditions of you for all of this to make better sense in my heartbroken states. I forgive myself for not being fully honest with this pain. I forgive myself for losing sight of how sweet and loving you were as a partner. I forgive myself. I forgive us. It is so important to get past these hurt emotions and understand that you and your ex were two complicated, mostly incompatible people who had tremendous love for each other. It was two people clinging and respecting that love so much, that they overlooked the incompatibilities and the poor logistics. It was such a beautiful thing. Its important for us to see it as a beautiful mess. Even if there was dishonesty or infidelity. Even if the last leg was full of resentment and anger. I wholeheartedly forgive us. I can truly feel it and it sometimes brings me to tears. I can let go of this pain and hurt because I understand the situation from a distant, birds eye view. I know that one day I will look back on our memories with a massive smile on my face. I know that he will be able to too eventually. We will heal, maybe one of us will take longer, but we will heal. We will bring the lessons weve learned into our relationships, perhaps passing those lessons on. We will be happier and better off. Perhaps one day, we can not only look back on this with indifference, but we can feel proud and honoured. Maybe Im being too idealistic but its the most honest and optimistic thing Ive felt and thought since the break up. I hope this resonates with someone here. I wish everyone the best on their journey. Please remember to be kind and honest with yourself, as well as your exes. Forgiveness is so important because it is the door to acceptance. I have so much love in my heart and I am sending it your way! "
133,vulnerability,BreakUps,2,1,clmr8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/clmr8k/2/,2019-08-04 05:29:53,"The 1st was a whirlwind of a love, completely took my breath away and swept me off my feet. He was charismatic, always attracting anyone towards him with his outgoing and warm attitude. He had this way with everyone, somehow getting you to divulge your deepest and darkest secrets with him. He also had a secret vulnerable side to him that it was so hard to resist, after all, every girl wanted to be the one he finally opened up to. Being with him felt very safe and secure. He deeply valued loyalty and had a very grounding feeling towards him. Love with him felt so easy as he protected me and calmed all my fears and angsts. There was never any judgements or criticism because vulnerability was seen as a strength in his eyes. He was so beautiful too, and you could tell he had faced his own demons and darknesses he must have climbed through in his past. Something about him though still remained kind/softhearted, and I greatly admired him for being such a good person in a cruel world. He was broken beyond repair, but I wanted to be the one to sew back all the pieces, and to stitch together the ripped seams. The 2nd guy was a bit different; he had an understanding nature to him. He was more boring and predictable, but with that came the stability and peace. Love with him felt comfortable (he had a more homebody vibe), like Sunday mornings with breakfast in bed, or cuddling until we fell asleep. Physically? He didnt attract me but he had a nice personality - overly nice at times. Easygoing and easy to get along with was his nature I suppose. While he was nothing like my first love and I am glad he was different in many aspects, looking back, Ive realized he really just doesnt compare. He isnt the charismatic man I once had met, or the man Im looking for. He falls short in a lot of ways that my great love/the love of my life fulfilled, and I am craving for so much more. He doesnt measure up in a lot of ways and that should be okay with me but I always go back to the 1st guy because he met more of my requirements. I guess its true  we never forget our 1st love, and we compare everyone else we date to them."
134,vulnerability,BreakUps,Things That Helped &amp; Things That Didn't,86,cmdu11,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/cmdu11/things_that_helped_things_that_didnt/,2019-08-06 03:15:07,"My ex dumped me two months ago. The story is long and complicated, but suffice it to say that I was deeply in love with her and completely blindsided by the breakup. But she had already moved on to someone else before she broke up with me. I've been working a job away from home this summer, so our entire breakup took place over the phone and text. I'm going home tomorrow, back to the city where she lives, where we created so many memories together. Going home feels like a monumental step in this process because I'll finally have to start building a new life without her. I feel like I've been in a state of suspended disconnection this summer, like my life has been on pause, but when I go home everything will be real again. I'll be moving into a new apartment, looking for a new job, and finally moving on. I've spent the past two months struggling to heal, overthinking everything, reflecting on the situation, and trying to learn from it. I'm finally feeling a little better, but I'm nervous to go home, so I'm writing this post to remind myself of the journey I've been on and the progress I've made so far. So here's my experience. I hope it helps one of you. 1. **Time heals.** When she left me, she told me that in hindsight she had always only loved me as a friend, that she still loved me, and that she wanted to be my best friend. This made no sense to me, so I tried everything I could to understand. I read all of our text messages looking for clues. I thought back over every moment in our relationship, the good and the bad, trying to figure out if anything about our relationship had been real. I journaled thousands of words. I crafted text messages and letters to her that I never sent. I read every article I could find online about breakups, unhealthy relationships, healthy relationships, how to be friends with an ex, how to rebuild trust, etc. I researched attachment styles, bipolar disorder (she has BPD I), mania, impulsivity, hypersexuality, codependency, gaslighting, commitment issues, fear of intimacy, transference, and anything else I could think of that might explain her choices. I read this sub obsessively. I started therapy. I spoke to friends and family. I meditated. I went on walks. I listened to music. I watched Ted talks and listened to Brene Brown's *Daring Greatly* audiobook. I even downloaded Co-Star and researched the compatibility of our astrological signs, because she believed in astrology. The only thing that really helped me was time. It took me two months to stop ruminating on the situation and start to accept that I would never find the answers I was looking for. I still think about her a lot, but the pain has lessened with every passing day. The idea that time heals is the hardest thing to accept when a heartbreak is fresh, because you have no control over it. You just have to let time pass and hope you feel better. But as it turns out, it's true. Time heals. 2. **Social media is poison.** When I found out she had cheated, I spent two weeks obsessively looking at her Instagram and her new flame's Instagram. She wasn't talking to me, so this was my only connection to her. I was looking for clues, trying to see if they were happy together, trying to understand what she saw in this new person that she didn't see in me. It was torture, but I couldn't stop. When I finally deleted Instagram and Facebook off my phone and had a friend change my passwords, I immediately felt better. With every passing day, I cared less about her and her new relationship. I cared less about how she was spending her time. Of course, I still wonder about what she's doing sometimes, but it's no longer a constant obsession. Quitting social media was one of the best choices I made. It's been nearly a month, and I have no desire to go back. 3. **I control my reality and my memories.** When she left me, she told me that we weren't breaking up because you can't break up if you aren't in a relationship. She said she thought of our relationship as a hookup. She made me question my memories of our time together. She made me question if anything between us had ever been real. The truth is, our relationship was far too intimate on every level to be considered a hookup. After talking to some friends and to my therapist, I realized that she was gaslighting me. She had decided to rewrite our past so that she could feel less guilty for cheating. I don't think she was doing it intentionally or maliciously, but she was doing it. Everything would have been easier for me if she had just acknowledged that she did love me once but that her feelings changed and she fell in love with someone else. But she's too emotionally unstable and immature to do that. It took a lot of strength for me to hold on to the truth I felt in my heartthat our love was real and intimate and deep. Things ended badly, but that doesn't invalidate the love we felt when we were together. I know that I loved her, and I choose to believe that when she told me she loved me, she meant it. I can't control how she's choosing to rewrite her memories, but I will not let her rewrite mine. 4. **Mental illness does not excuse bad behavior.** I spent a lot of time trying to justify her actions based on what I knew about her disorders and what I'd learned from my research post-breakup. I have a lot of empathy for her, because I can see how her bipolar disorder and childhood traumas affect her choices and her relationships, including ours. There are certain patterns associated with BPD and her particular traumas that help to explain her impulsivity, her recklessness, her codependency, and her fears of intimacy and commitment and abandonment. I have no background in psychology, but a lot of the things I read helped me understand her better. That being said, her mental health challenges don't excuse her cheating. They don't excuse her gaslighting. They don't excuse the fact that she still hasn't apologized for the way she treated me in the end. They don't give her the right to refuse to take responsibility for her actions. Turns out, you can be mentally ill and still act like an asshole. 5. **I gave everything I had.** For a long time, I never thought that I would have the chance to fall in love. I always thought that something was wrong with me, that I was missing some fundamental piece that everyone else seemed to have. As I entered my mid-twenties, without ever having been on so much as a date, I gave up on the idea of love. Love was a thing for other people, I decided. And that was okay. I knew I could get along by myself. But then she came into my life, and suddenly everything changed. For the first time in my life, I felt truly seen. For the first time, I wanted to take care of someone. I felt protective of her and she felt protective of me. We felt safe with each other. We made each other happy. We were each other's best friend and more. I took care of her when she was dealing with the side effects of her medications. And I did it not because I felt obligated to, but because I genuinely wanted to. I wanted her to be healthy and happy, and I did whatever I could to support her. I listened when she needed to talk. I never asked her to change a thing, because I never wanted her to. I saw her flaws and accepted them as part of who she was. I gave her everything I could and I loved her in the best way I knew how. I told her I loved her, and I also showed her through my actions. I never did anything to hurt her, and I never will. I still want her to be happy. At the end of the day, I know that I gave her everything I had. It wasn't enough for her, but that's not something I can control. After she broke up with me, I made my feelings clear to her. I didn't hide how I felt. But nothing I could have said or done would have changed things. I gave it my all, and that's all I can ask of myself. 6. **It's okay not to be friends, and it's also okay not to know what you want.** We started as friends and then became creative partners and then romantic partners. Our relationship was deep on many levels and when it imploded, I felt like I lost not only my love but also my best friend and creative partner. I've struggled a lot over the past couple months to figure out whether or not I want to be friends with her. At first, I thought we would definitely be friends. I couldn't imagine my life without her, and I told her that. But then I found out about the cheating and that changed things. I told her that we couldn't be friends, and we've been pretty much no contact since then. I still don't know if it was the right choice, but I do know that the less contact we've had, the better I've been able to heal. There are days when I feel like I respect myself too much to ever speak to her again, and there are days when I miss her and just want to text my best friend. I don't know if we'll ever be friends again, but part of me feels like our story isn't over. For the moment, I am learning to accept the uncertainty. I'm learning to imagine a future without her in it. But I also haven't ruled out the future in which we are friends. Either way, I know I have more healing to do and I don't have to decide today. 7. **I am strong. I am resilient. I am emotionally stable.** These are not things I knew before this breakup. I didn't know I would handle this whole thing as well as I have. It's been one of the most difficult experiences of my life, but I know now that I have a greater capacity for empathy than I ever realized. One of my main concerns after the breakup was just trying to understand the situation, to understand her, and to understand myself. I recognize that sometimes my feelings are irrationallove is irrationalbut I have the maturity to step back and assess my feelings and think about how they are affecting me before I act or speak. I've learned a great deal about myself since my breakup. I am strong. I am resilient. I am able to be vulnerable. I can express my feelings. I can ask for help when I need it. I am not broken. I am human. I matter. I do deserve love. I am capable of unconditional love. And I deserve better than what my ex gave me. I respect myself now enough to know that. I am not perfect. I have my faults. I'm working on my issues. But that doesn't mean that I am unworthy. If you've read it this far, I thank you for reading my novel. As a bonus, here are some specific things that provided me with a little relief: * Guy Winch's Ted Talk: [How to fix a broken heart](URL * Brene Brown's Ted Talk: [The power of vulnerability](URL * Alain de Botton's talk: [Why you will marry the wrong person](URL * Brene Brown's audiobook [Daring Greatly](URL * [Talkspace](URL online therapy * [Headspace](URL guided meditation app * Lizzo's album [Cuz I Love You](URL If I've learned anything, it's that heartbreak isn't linear. I'm feeling okay today, but tomorrow might be a different story. I'm still healing, and I know there will be more ups and downs. This post is to remind myself of how far I've come. Even though some days it doesn't feel like it, I have made progress. I have to remember that. I hope hearing my experience has helped you a little bit, and I hope you can recognize the ways in which you've made progress and grown as a person since your own breakup. Heartbreak is hell, but love is a gift and we are all privileged to have experienced it, if even for just a little while. I wish all of you the best of luck in your journeys to healing and acceptance. Stay strong, friends."

I've realized that in the process of ending out relationship, my ex showed me a side of himself I had no idea existed. In the beginning he was a model boyfriend. He was sweet, caring, perceptive. He knew what I needed without me even having to ask, and he jumped at any opportunity to be supportive of me and show me how much he cared. But things got stressful for him when he started school, and at a certain point it was a snowball of him burying his head in the sand so far he practically forgot I existed as an autonomous person with her own needs. I was unhappy about it, but I made excuses for him. I wanted so badly to hold onto the person that he was in the beginning that I refused to see what the situation had become. Our relationship functionally ended months before it officially ended. I just kept holding on, hoping he'd snap out of it. He didn't. When he initiated the breakup, he was rude, he stonewalled, he was condescending, and scoffed at me when I was vulnerable and told him how I felt. He ended our relationship in the most discourteous fashion simply because he was too much of a coward to handle it maturely. Afterwards, when things had calmed down, he thoroughly demonstrated that he lacks the emotional intelligence to even begin to share his true feelings with me. He was vague, he contradicted himself continually. He went out of his way, completely unprompted, to illustrate just how sad he was about our breakup but insisted that he wouldn't be changing his mind about it (despite my never asking him to). The entire exchange left me feeling entirely turned off to the concept of ever going back to him. It's close to 3 months out and I can say I'm almost thankful for this - if this is who he is under stress, I'm not sure I'd want to entertain a long-term future with him. Stress isn't an excuse to treat a person so disrespectfully, especially when they've been patient and understanding with you. I deserve more than someone who thinks its okay to scoff at my vulnerability just because he's scared about dealing with his own emotions, and I sure as hell deserve someone who cares enough about me that he's not just gonna bolt when things are hard. If you don't like the person you're dating under all circumstances, good, bad, and in between, it's not worth it. It's been said on here a thousand times, but when a person shows you who they are, believe them."

I showed him a side of me no one has ever seen before. He forced vulnerability out of me. There were aspects of myself I kept hidden my entire life that I brought out, just for him. Because I could trust him with them. All for him to betray me, lie to me, seek out another woman. Court her while we were still together and see no problem with it. Funny how our entire relationship I was suspected of those activities and hes the one who was capable of them all along. Its just hard making that transition from seeing them as a truthful, courageous, beautiful human being to nothing but an unfaithful, manipulative, liar. A person who has convinced themselves so hard of their own truth that they still dont see multitude of what theyve done. I know I am already everything I used to see him. Its just really hard because Im a very untrusting person in the first place and it feels like he walked away with a part of me I am going to struggle very hard to get back."
137,vulnerability,BreakUps,[REPORT] Met up with ex today after 4 months NC - Positive story :),118,c1fozp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/c1fozp/report_met_up_with_ex_today_after_4_months_nc/,2019-06-17 08:12:56,"Hi all, &amp;#x200B; This subreddit is usually filled with heartbreaking stories so I thought I'd share a positive story from my meetup with my ex today, in case it inspires anyone out there. Spoiler alert, it went amazingly. &amp;#x200B; **Context** * She \[28F\] broke up with me \[28M\] 4 months ago because she ""no longer saw a future together"" * Reasons behind the breakup were I took her for granted/feared commitment/feared attachment * Ended amicably, but reluctantly on my behalf * Went straight into NC, although this was broken by both of us a couple of times... * We share the same friend's group so would often see eachother on a bi-weekly basis. When we did see each other, we were respectful, friendly, but distant. **Since the breakup** * Since the breakup, I worked on myself and my issues hard, as I never wanted to lose someone who means that much to be ever again. * I made it clear to myself, God and the universe that I would love for us to get back together, get married and start a family together, but only if it's meant to be, and only if there's mutual respect and love for each other. * Whenever I would see her, I would ensure it was a positive encounter and would add a few flirty comments here and there. * I also worked on making my own life amazing, improving my business, my social life, my health and everything else going on. **Setting up the meet** * Having come back from holiday, I saw her in our gathering within our friends group and we caught up briefly. In this encounter, about 3months in, she really opened up and told me how unhappy she is. * She expressed vulnerability and I knew that she had realised the grass wasn't greener on the other side and I finally felt she was getting her just deserts. * During this experience, I made sure she was feeling better and also said we should catch up sometime. That's when we put a date in the diary and went straight back into NC. &amp;#x200B; **Today's meet** * We met up and went to a local street festival, the sun was shining and it was a perfect first date-ish day. * We were both clearly anxious, but settled into things very easily after. * We were lightly flirting with each other and out of no where she grabbed one of my fingers and we kept hold of each others finger throughout. * We went to the the park and were catching up on our lives and were very close with eachother, i.e. she was lying on me, I was playing with her hair. It all felt incredibly natural and with no pressure. * We grabbed dinner and this is where things became a lot more serious and we discussed some of the personal issues she had been facing. She told me she had missed me and she was happier when we were together. * We didn't kiss as she said she wants to take things slow, but did set up another date for next weekend. &amp;#x200B; **Lessons learned for anyone who wants their ex back** * You have to radically improve your life, like seriously work on your issues and become a better human being. And you should do it for you, never the other person. * You have to get your 'mojo' back, i.e. you have to find yourself again and be the person you once were. It's very typical to lose yourself or undervalue yourself after a breakup, and things will never work if you're in this state of mind. Get yourself back on track in life, make yourself attractive again to other men/women and find your sexy badass mojo again. * You have to be prepared to lose them in order to win them back. I don't want to jump the gun and say that I've exactly ""won them back"", but it's very well on that path... However, at this current point in time, I genuinely don't need them anymore. I have an incredible life, I have amazing friends and I have women chasing me left, right and center. This is a healthy position to be in and it removes that sense of neediness you sometimes have post-breakup. I *want* her back, because I value her, but I don't *need* her. * Be very wary of the power dynamics in the relationship post-breakup, and do what you can to restore a healthy balance. If it is tilted on their side, they will not respect you and therefore will not be able to love you. * I can't think of anything else really, but the main thing is really just that, find yourself again and believe me they will pick up on it. &amp;#x200B; Hope it helps someone out there, any questions shoot them my way. Good luck x"

As always, all advice and thoughts appreciated. **Context** * Please read here: [URL &amp;#x200B; **Situation** * Following last week's date, I saw her on the Tuesday in a mutual bar where a few of us go too, we were relatively cold with each other and I ended up sleeping with another girl (although she didn't know this). * I (STUPIDLY) messaged her on the Thursday showing some vulnerability (something you CANNOT do in these situations) and set a plan for the 2nd hangout. * We were chatting a bit on whatsapp, but I was chasing her and her validation (something you should NEVER do, as it should be mutual). &amp;#x200B; **Gameplan** * My gameplan was to set up a meet and just chat about us and what we want as I didn't want to play any more games. * I also don't want to waste my time reconciling with someone who isn't on the same page. &amp;#x200B; **The date** * She suggested we do a picnic, which I reluctantly obliged, as it messes up my above game plan. * We met and instantly it was cold, and we were both hissing at each other. Her reasons were because I didn't completely agree with the picnic idea so she had the 'well fine what ever' attitude. * We went to the park and things got a lot better very quickly, started catching up and she instantly initiated contact, wrapping her legs around me, lightly touching my arm etc. * I was reluctant to give her too much attention, but I did and it felt natural. We discussed us and our situation and she said she knows what she wants and that's why she's here to see if I can give it to her... * This is what she said she wants: * To be treated like a princess * To be given attention, to be given flowers, yada yada. * To which I replied, I cannot do that without us both doing so... i.e. **I won't treat her like a princess unless she treats me like a king**. * To which she replied, that's the issue... it's now like a contract, love is selfless yada yada... * Anyway, we sort of end it on a let's see how things unfold sort of thing and when we get to the train station we kiss and make out, passionately and our hands were all over each other. * She then leaves saying I expect you to send me messages and gifs and flowers all in a jokey manner. &amp;#x200B; **Analysis** * One major thing to note here, is that we're both Alphas and what is really going on IMO is a game of dominance. * Pre breakup, we had the perfect arrangement... I led the relationship, but passed my decisions past her and it was based on a mutual respect and love. It was perfect. * Now she wants to wear the pants and she's fighting HARD. * She is the strongest women I have ever known, and pushes me to my absolute limit at times... * She is trying to control the relationship, make me chase, and make me submit, which I simply cannot do. It's not in my nature and I would rather walk and find someone I can collaborate better with the make it work. * Therefore I really have come to the conclusion that this probably will never work again, because we're going to keep butting heads to see who gives in... &amp;#x200B; **Next steps** * I have changed my mindset completely from 'attempting to fix things' to 'embrace this as life/game experience'. * I will chase, TO AN EXTENT, but always aim to meet up in person. In person, I will have fun and be sexual with her like I would any other girl, but I will not continue chasing her validation like a bitch. * If I see her in the friends group, I will flirt and aim to meet up in person, but will not chase her like a puppy dog. * I will continue dating other women and if she wants to put in the work too, then maybe we can hang out, if not I have absolutely no doubt that I will meet someone better who doesn't give me so much shit. &amp;#x200B; Any thoughts on this, next steps and how to play it will be greatly appreciated! Also any questions you have, fire away! &amp;#x200B; **P.S.** To all the guys here, Alpha women will absolutely push you to your fucking limits, but if you can deal with it you can deal with any girl after that."
139,vulnerability,BreakUps,"I have a crush, and I am afraid",1,c50c5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/c50c5o/i_have_a_crush_and_i_am_afraid/,2019-06-25 11:52:16,"I'm only year and a half out of an 11 year relationship, and I've been talking to this guy who's funny, smart, talented, sweet, and we have so many things in common. The problem is that asshole ex of mine has made me so afraid of falling in love again that I don't want to start anything serious. I don't want to feel the love again, because those extreme highs just make the extreme lows possible. I was so sure of the last relationship lasting forever that I put all of me into it. I let everything go. I allowed the vulnerability to run free. I loved. I trusted. I gave. I wore myself out. I got crushed. I don't want to feel the love again, because I don't want to feel the pain of losing it again. I still long for being in his arms. I still wish I could wake up next to him, and that's what makes me so afraid of feeling anything for anyone else ever again. I don't want to miss anyone anymore. I don't want to hurt that much over anyone anymore. I thought the last one was the forever man, and he wasn't. How am I to trust my feelings to pick another that won't make me feel that way again? As much as I want to take this leap, I just don't. As much as I want to risk it, I really, really don't. The thought of going through all that again, makes the idea of a relationship not worth it, but I think what makes me so scared is that it might actually be something that will actually make me feel those highs again. I don't think I would be so afraid of it if I didn't think I could be so happy from it. Is this why breakups suck so much? Not only do you have a loss of what was once your life, but now you aren't sure if you will ever have a life again? Ugh, I never thought I would say that it sucks to like someone, but here I am. It really sucks to like this guy."

I hope betraying me in every way possible has now at the very least resulted in your happiness. I hope one day youll remember the heart that never left you. The heart that was always certain. The heart that saw through the truth and the lies and never doubted your potential. The heart that never treated you as if you were second best or made you feel like you werent always number one. Love the heart that hurts you, never hurt the heart that loves you. I lost myself in my anger. In my hate for you. I dont want you. I dont want to be with you. I will never again present my heart to you in a box. I will never allow another vulnerability to surface. How could you do it all again? How could you just do the same thing all over again? I had a spirit that absorbed all of the plans we made. I believed you. I fell second best when you were always the one person I just could not lose. Im sorry for my hateful words, but I cannot apologize for the hate I now feel in my heart for you. Ive forgiven you, but the way I feel will never change. I am responsible for so much, but I argued with you and fought for you because I wanted nothing more than you. I have nothing left. The love I had for you in my heart is gone. I break down randomly from this because hating you hurts me more than you ever hurt me. Even how you treated me in the end. You did what you needed to do for you, I guess. It was always about you. When you wanted to, we did. When you wanted to stray, you did. The balancing act is now over for you. The one that forgives first is always the strongest. I am sorry for all of the days I went silent because I was terrified to tell you how I was feeling. I wont apologize for the times I was accusative now that I know the truth. You wanted the safety net. As the both of you played games with one another I was the one you knew would never leave. I was never Plan A. I miss the person I thought you were. I remember looking over at you and realizing just how terrified I was being there with you that night. I miss the way you took my luggage from my hands when I walked in the door like I was yours all along. I remember the looks in that room - they knew we were a power couple, and that we made things happen. I miss holding your hand in the Uber and through the airport. I even miss Panda Express. I miss kissing you goodbye. I miss the way my heart felt so full during my flight home. I miss all of the promises you made. I miss what I felt was a love that had returned. I remember the way the shampoo stung my eyes as I looked over into the glass. You cared nothing of your insecurities and stepped into my shower. You told me you just couldnt lose us again. I remember running my hands across your skin while occasionally finding my way back up to kiss you while pleasuring you. I remember how you felt inside me, and how I allowed myself to open up in a way I never had with anyone. I miss how my body trembled. I miss how you wouldnt fucking stop because you could tell I loved that shit so much. I miss every fucking thing I thought was real. Now, all that is left is the reality that I have nothing left to ever offer again. It isnt because I do not want to. Its because you left me no choice. You cannot cut me and not expect me to bleed. I gave you everything. I gave you every part of me. I hope you are genuinely happy. I hope all that we had was left in the sand for something that will prove to be valuable. Thats all I ever wanted, and you knew that. Youve always known that. There is someone else. He is genuine. He was loyal. He was raised to respect women, and Ive never seen anything less. I hurt him. I hurt him because I wanted to pursue my growth and realized my life was laced in uncertainty. I believe he loved me when he said he did. He forgave me for hurting him. All of this, this was my karma. All of this time.. Even while I was with you, I havent been able to get his words out of my head. He said almost two years ago that he would always be there, and no matter what we would always remain friends. His sisters embraced me, his oldest especially. His mom took the time to mail a gift to me individually on my birthday when she owed me nothing. I made a mistake. I should have never let that go, yet my heart knows how unfair it is selfishly expect more again, but its what I want. I dont need to block you anymore. I dont have anything left to say to you. I waged the war. I allowed it. I was weak to you. I loved you. I trusted you. I lost you. I believed in you. I hope one day you realize you had someone who was scared to shed her skin, but wanted nothing more than to explain everything. If you ever think of me, or if you ever find this, just know that I never meant to hurt you. All I ask, please.. please. Please never hurt another heart that loves you. Be good to her. Let her in. Give her a genuine chance. Block your exs. Dont run game. Dont play chess with her heart."
141,vulnerability,BreakUps,Guide to Forgiveness,2,c63hwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/c63hwk/guide_to_forgiveness/,2019-06-27 19:39:05,"5 months in to the day. Things are getting better but I have come to the point that I feel an immense resentment for my ex's neglect and the circumstances of our post breakup interactions. In my desperate times, I've always resorted to.. praying? And I've found a direction that I hope would help people. On the forgiveness subreddit, someone helpfully posted this link: URL Which is a comprehensive guideline for forgiveness whether it is for yourself or for someone who has wronged you. It talks a lot about what forgiveness really is. How it isnt about condoning the bad stuff that has happened. It is a freedom of judgement and resentment. It is such a thorough guide with several steps and questions to help you through your healing journey. And if you're interested there is a section on reconciliation as well. I will be doing the exercise this weekend... hopefully to finally come to peace for myself. I just cant be trapped in this hellhole of anger and grief anymore. I'm so desperate to feel something else apart from exhaustion and pain. And I hope this will help others find their release too. Good luck everyone. This sub has helped me feel less isolated with my recovery. Being broken up is just an excruciating exercise of humanity and vulnerability. Hang in there. It will get better. We arent alone. I wish for you all to find peaceful times."
142,vulnerability,BreakUps,"New to reddit, recently broken up with the love of my life, explored what this platform offers. Mostly rubbish, bitterness and reciprocating toxicity to other peoples relationship ",10,c8jvcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/c8jvcx/new_to_reddit_recently_broken_up_with_the_love_of/,2019-07-03 14:52:52,"I have been through hell, at least what it feels like hell the last 2 &amp; 1/2 months. And Im not nearly this bitter as comments left by people on Reddit. Stop spreading your negativity and toxic experience on others. Its okay to share and grief and compare the similarities, but holy shit, people on here are BITTER AF. Grow up, learn from your mistake. Not one relationship is exactly every way identical to yours, or mine, or theirs. Projecting your experience like its been there done that, nitpick any topics, relationship experience, travel experience, whatever it maybe, they are all different, its endured by different people who do not feel exactly the same way YOU feel, circumstances vary, environment is different, and most importantly PEOPLE CAN CHANGE. Look at yourself in a mirror, are you the same person when you were 5? 10? 20? 30? Physically, emotionally, mentally, NO. There are plenty of people who genuinely can/want/do change. Take accountability for your share of wrongs, every problem has 2 streets, its never one sided. Stop telling people to just leave &amp; quit. Im not saying perpetuate abuse, learn and grow, change, and make your the one you love and miss is doing the same. Implement healthy boundaries, seek couples therapy, START THE FUCK OVER IF THEY ARE TRULY SOMEONE YOU LOVE AND CARE. Only if these things can be implemented that is, sure there will be many people who will still try to manipulate the relationship, but what difference does it make suffering missing them or being with them? Even those stubborn people, like myself, can change if they are WILLING. Quitting is easy, no matter what it is, quitting is the easiest thing. Relationships are not supposed to be easy, we set unrealistic expectations based on media portrayals and thinking theres some sort of perfect relationship out there. You gotta be kidding right? We all can time to time mistreatment others we love, often those we love tend to get mistreated the most, but thats also called being in a relationship, whether romantic or just as friends, or as family. Even the healthiest relationships have arguments, fights, and differences, but learning how to cope with stress, learning intimacy, learning respect, learning how to communicate, through research and therapy, there are plenty of EXs that are willing to put in the effort and time to CHANGE for the better. Instead of listening to people with shitty experiences, which we all fucking have, go read how you can change that, learn about relationships, learn about how you should show empathy, go SPEND YOUR TIME PROGRESSING TOWARDS GROWTH, bantering back and forth with someone who just gave up, someone who didnt put in the time and effort to seek change, people who just gave up, that will give you momentary relief, but its just bunch of strangers looking through a tiny little scope of your problems, told by your perspective. If my ex was roaming around this platform, no fucking wonder she would just quit, because almost all of the comments when people share their pain and suffering mixed with their hopefulness and wanting to give it another chance, are all just told to WALK. No. Take the break if necessary, vent, grief, be sad, thats fine. But learn about traits of healthy relationships, approach your ex/lover/SO with propositions and willingness to change after you have taken accountability, felt sincere remorse, and change their flaws. Most things can be adjusted, everything takes effort and time. But faith and belief in the loved ones, along with the pain they have suffered will truly make many people grow and want to be a better partner, a better individual as a whole. Go look up couples counseling, learn about couples communication, recognize the poor treatments that may have been endured by both, so next time you can stop them before it becomes a cycle, turning to an abuse. I am guilty of many mistreatments towards my ex, I am taking accountability for my behaviors, I feel it to my bones with sincere remorse, and I take each day working on my character flaws that negatively effected her and our relationship. Make a list, change what you can, the limit you set is set by your own imaginary boundaries, your insecurities. Embrace your vulnerability, it takes courage to acknowledge such, its not cowardly to be vulnerable, it takes acknowledgement to show such emotion. GROW THE FUCK UP. Your comment, a stranger, someone who knows nothing but a small sample size, can sway an individual to forever turn their backs on someone they truly care for and love. Instill faith, instill resources to help them fix the problem, not every solution is WALK, QUIT. Sure not everyone will make the changes, but with proper knowledge and guidance, people can change and do change often. Even TOM BRADY has a coach, LEBRON has a coach, guidance and knowledge is an important tool to help people grow, even at their best, because we all have room to grow no matter what age we maybe. When broken up, take the time to be constructive of your own behaviors, put yourself in their shoes, try to see why they may have behaved that way; we can all blame others, its easy to, but more often than not, if you let go of your own egos, you will see plenty of growth and thing you may have done that made people reach in such way, even creating the cycle they displayed, because if you love someone, you should be showing compassion and faith, right see how you can learn and take those lessons to either start fresh with your ex or with a brand new individual. My ex showed me compassion in return I showed her frustration because I could cope with my depression and stress. I am willing to change because I have identified my poor behaviors, and her reactions, she gave me love when I was oblivious, blind. This is helping me want to change even more, even though I am no longer with her, I never want to display such to anyone else in my life. WE CAN CHANGE IF WE TRULY WANT TO. Everyone has flaws, try NC, utilize your time to work on yours, and hopefully the other person has also, if not, then propose the idea to them and set plans so both parties will follow through and commit to such and grow as individuals and as couples. If they fall off, help them back up, thats why we have one another, to keep each other accountable, but to also show compassion and belief to grow and keep course on the right path. If you love your ex/current SO, take each day to learn, to see how you can change to create a more healthy relationship. Sure theres 6 billion people, but we are all unique and you did fall in love for someone for their qualities. Not everyone will change I get it, but I grew up where I have failed in many different things, but without the support of loved ones around me, I would not have accomplished some of my successes. Sometimes itll be 80:20, sometimes 20:80, but making sure that both of you do not get too comfortable to perpetuate the mistakes, a healthy relationship will stay mostly around 50:50. Even after implementing solutions, and actually working on it, and they still dont change, then you make your choice, sometimes leaving them, the pain is what helps us grow the most. A loss teaches you much more lessons, than a win. Be compassionate to one another, breaking up isnt giving up, sometimes thats the best thing you can do for someone to acknowledge their flaws, take accountability for their actions, feel sincerity of remorse, and seek out ways to change."

He told me if it didnt workout with me, he wouldnt want anyone else. Weve been NC for 2 weeks now, we were already NC for almost a month before I broke contact because my vulnerability got the best of me when I found out he was seen with another girl and had to ask for clarifications in which he said they were just friends. Now he posted her on his story on Snapchat (I didnt have him, his friend sent me it). I just feel so disposable and irreplaceable. I havent let myself go since the break up. Ive been going to the gym consistently. Ive been hanging out with my friends. Im also in therapy as well, but when I found out it hurt like hell. I gave this guy my heart and soul, gave him everything I had in me, if not more now hes with someone else. Love doesnt suck, this guy does."

Betrayed my trust in little ways and big. He never touched another and yet it felt like he never touched me. But I loved him. Deep and hard and forever. Even when I hated him I loved him still. Longed for his touch and for his attention. His love was like the sun, warm and bright, but it never lasted and I lived in the shadow of his past our entire relationship. Every time we fought I ran. I left him over and over because I couldnt face what I knew, that I didnt trust him. The thing is he always chased me though. He always came for me with love and patience and that same relentless vulnerability that hooked me the first time and made me ignore the red flags flapping in my face. So I went back but I returned to a man more broken and worn than before. How could I not see the wounds I had caused him? He was bleeding so clearly and yet I couldnt see out from under the shadow he had cast on me. The last time it was him who left. Disappeared when I needed him most because I had done the one thing he asked me not to do. When he begged to return I had no energy left. Nothing but anger and disappointment and longing for the hope of a future that seemed so far away. So I pushed him away and now I am left alone. He said I had never moved on from his betrayals. That I was still on day one while he was moving mountains to clear the path forward together. Maybe he was right and I need time. They say a wound wont heal until you stop touching it."
145,vulnerability,BreakUps,Read this is you're hurting and feeling hopeless,89,bnfmme,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/bnfmme/read_this_is_youre_hurting_and_feeling_hopeless/,2019-05-12 04:59:34,"I \[25F\] was in your boat 10 months ago (and it really fucking sucks), but please trust/believe me when I say that it gets so, so much better. Last August my ex boyfriend \[26M\] cheated and left me for someone else \[19F\]. I was heartbroken, hopeless, lost, depressed, and at one point suicidal (HEADS UP if you continue reading, I do go into this. Reader Discretion is advised). Now-- I am thriving, happy, and enjoying every fucking second of my life, but it wasn't easy to get to this place. It took a lot of time, patience, and work, but it was so worth it. Now when I look back at my break up/relationship-- I smile instead of cry, I laugh instead of hating myself, and I am thankful for every moment and bit of the heartbreak because if it wasn't for the countless amount of days I spent in my room crying, I wouldn't be this incredibly happy person today. I am not the person I was before, during, or after my ex boyfriend-- a man I thought was the love of my life/my forever person-- I am incredibly different, in such a beautiful way. I know for a fact that ANY of you reading this can become the happy, joyful person you've always wanted to be BECAUSE of your break up! Here's my story/journey (month by month) of how I recovered and healed from a break up I thought would end my life for good. END OF AUGUST My ex dumped me out of nowhere using the typical bullshit excuses such as: ""I need to find myself"", ""It's not you, it's me"", ""I'm just so unhappy with who I am"", ""I don't want to bring you down with me"", ""I'm doing this because I love you"", ""I want to be with you forever, but can't right now"", and my personal favorite-- ""there's no one else"". I was pretty shocked because a week prior everything was going great, but life happens. I called and cried to my friends analyzing every detail of the relationship and his words-- trying to answer the unanswered questions. A week later, my ex was Facebook official with a girl that he reassured me was ""just a friend"" our entire relationship. She posted a picture on Instagram of them kissing with the following caption, ""When you and your boyfriend are Bradgelina and she's Jennifer Anniston"". My heart shattered. I was devastated and my world felt like it just ended right then and there. I blocked him, his new girlfriend, and all of his friends and family on every social media platform. I spent the rest of the month locked in my room, sobbing and blaming myself for what happened. SEPTEMBER There wasn't a day or second where I wasn't crying. I was wishing and praying for my ex to come back and tell me he made a mistake and we'd live happily ever after. I downloaded every dating app and tried to fuck the pain away or find a new boyfriend to fill the void. I was desperate to make the heartbreak stop, but this backfired on me big time. I felt awful about myself, the little self esteem I had left was gone, and I couldn't look at myself in the mirror because I hated who I was. I stopped eating and lost 20 lbs (I was 115 lbs before the break up, 95 lbs during September). I started picking my face and skin because I felt I was so ugly. I wanted to destroy myself-- I just didn't care anymore. My friend was worried and referred me to a therapist. I started going once a week (I highly recommend finding a supportive therapist to help you heal during this journey if you haven't already). While she always made me feel better during our sessions, the pain was still present. OCTOBER I was still crying everyday, talking to anyone who would listen to me/validate my feelings. I started to have anxiety and panic attacks when I tried to leave my house because EVERYTHING reminded me of my ex. I felt like I couldn't escape him, so I shut myself out from the world. I quit my job, deleted all my social media pages, turned off my phone for days at a time, and sulked in my room. I felt ugly, fat, worthless, unlovable, not good enough, pathetic, and undeserving of happiness. I contemplated suicide for the first time, but I didn't tell anyone. IF YOU ARE FEELING SUICIDAL PLEASE GO GET AND SEEK HELP, TELL A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER, DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO PREVENT YOURSELF FROM SELF HARM!!!! NOVEMBER I dreaded that the holidays were approaching because all I could think about was how happy I was with my ex this time last year, and all the years/holidays we celebrated together-- but now he's happy and celebrating them with her. I slowly started eating again, but it was a chore. I felt a tad bit better (mainly because of therapy), but I was still hurting so much. I couldn't find any joy in life. I was a wreck on Thanksgiving and my family started to get worried. DECEMBER At this point my friends and family were telling me to ""get over it"" and ""move on already""-- side note: if ANYONE tells you these two things, don't listen to them. They have no idea what they're talking about and everyone's timeline and healing journey is DIFFERENT. Take YOUR time to heal, however long it is. Fuck what anyone else says/thinks. I was still sobbing and hurting everyday, but I finally got the courage to leave my house (and didn't have any panic/anxiety attacks, YAY!). My friend threw a party and I met a cool dude \[25M\], we had a good conversation and made out. Everything started to feel a little better, and I was hopeful to feel like I'm FINALLY moving on from what happened. I started casually dating that guy from the party and things felt good again! It was nice to have a crush/interest, but I was still thinking and missing my ex constantly. JANUARY After a month and a half of dating that guy, he told me he wanted to be exclusive. I haven't told him about my ex yet, so I thought this was a great time to open up about what happened. He was very understanding, supportive, and compassionate-- it was a great feeling to be vulnerable with someone I liked again! But then...he ghosted me. He told all of our mutual friends I'm ""damaged goods"" and was Facebook official with another girl TWO DAYS LATER (I really know how to pick 'em lol). All the little happiness and joy I started feeling again went out the window. I went back to sobbing, sulking, and feeling hopeless like I did back in August, except this time-- IT WAS A MUCH, MUCH WORSE PAIN. Not only was I grieving the betrayal/heartbreak from my ex, but from ANOTHER guy. Now I was dealing with two heartbreaks instead of one. A week later, I found out my ex was not only cheating on me with the girl he left me for-- but with my BEST FRIEND. The girl I went to for EVERYTHING, who was there for me during my darkest days during my break up. I felt like I lost everything, and hit rock bottom. I genially believed something was wrong with me and I'm just the type of person people will abuse, cheat on, and leave for someone else. I lost all hope and faith in love, friendships, and myself. I thought life wasn't worth living for if I couldn't find love or the courage to love myself. On January 27, 2019-- I took a razor blade and held it against my wrist with the intention to end it all...but I just couldn't do it. Despite all the hateful thoughts, beliefs, and words I would tell myself on a day to day basis-- there was still a little part of me that hasn't given up. I decided to listen to that little part of me. I threw the razor blade away, told my friends, family, and therapist what had happened and that I needed help. I wrote a reminder to myself on a note card: ""JANUARY 27, 2019 is the last day you will wallow in self doubt, pity, and negativity. It is the last day you will let your past define you. It is the last day you will let your negative thoughts define you. It is the last day you will let ANYONE define your worth, value, and story. It is the last day of feeling like nothing. It is the last day you will feel like anything less than THE QUEEN YOU ARE"". I will never forget that day. It was a huge turning point for me, and that's when I started my healing journey. IF YOU ARE FEELING SUICIDAL PLEASE GO GET AND SEEK HELP, TELL A FRIEND OR FAMILY MEMBER, DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO PREVENT YOURSELF FROM SELF HARM!!!! FEBRUARY I started seeing my therapist twice a week, and turned INWARD for the first time in my life. I've always suffered from insecurities and never feeling good enough my whole life. I was a people pleaser and would constantly seek external validation. I believed ""if I just had X, Y, and Z-- I would be happy"". WRONG. That's not how life works. If you're constantly looking for external happiness, you will never be happy. Happiness, love, and healing starts WITHIN YOU-- you can't find these things through anyone else. My therapist told me that because of my insecurities and low self esteem, I tended to date and attract sociopaths/narcissistic men and friends-- everything started to make sense. I looked back at my dating track record and realized all my ex's/men I've dated all have the same patterns, red flags, traits, and were emotionally abusive. No wonder I had incredibly low self esteem! I started doing extensive research on the Cluster B personality disorder, and felt so validated about my experience(s) for the first time in my life. I joined an online community for Cluster B Abuse survivors and told my story-- the responses and amount of love I received made me cry tears of joy. I am so thankful to have found this support group. I started reading self help and self love books, watching life coach's YouTube channels, and listening to podcasts on how to actively improve and better yourself everyday. I was still sad and crying, but it felt different. Instead of crying because I felt worthless, I was crying because I've accepted what happened. I decided to sit and feel every bit of my pain and accept myself for who I am. I was more compassionate towards myself. Things were beginning to look up. MARCH I started feeling happy again. I'm smiling more, and allowed myself to cry (instead of punishing myself like I used to). I'm finally grieving properly and took my time to heal. I joined a gym and started exercising, taking yoga classes, and mediating. I started looking into nutrition and invested in clean, healthy meals-- while still also treating myself to something sweet/""bad"" once a week! I read a new book every week, I journaled all my thoughts and feelings everyday, I was way more open with my therapist about what was going on, so she can help me properly. I tackled problems I had in child hood, and learned how my background/experiences formed me into a person I didn't want to be. I wasn't ashamed of my feelings or what I went through-- if anything I EMBRACED them. I listened to music again, started going out/ socializing with friends, made the decision to be single and work on myself everyday. I was committed to start doing and feeling better EVERYDAY-- even if I did feel the depression some back. APRIL I began to put MYSELF first everyday. I did what I wanted, when I wanted, and always took care of myself. I made sure everything I did was for MYSELF and not for anyone else. I went back on social media, only following accounts and people who made ME FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF (Please-- unfollow all the bullshit people who don't make you feel good, life's too short for social media pettiness). I started to set boundaries and learned how to say ""NO"" to others, while saying ""YES"" to myself. I cut out every toxic person in my life (including family members and really close friends). It was extremely hard, but so worth it. I have a strict routine filled with fun events, foods, and people that make me happy. I treat myself everyday and use the pain/anger/sadness I feel to channel my inner creative. I started writing, painting, and opening myself up to new opportunities. I gained back the 15 lbs I lost, looking and feeling stronger. I am so grateful and thankful to wake up everyday and I made a vow to love myself unconditionally-- especially when I fall or fail. MAY I still hurt and get angry from time to time, but it doesn't consume my mood, days, or life like it used to. I don't cry everyday, but if I feel like crying-- I let it all out! I embrace my feelings and vulnerability. I notice myself changing, loving, and taking care of myself everyday. I let people tell me who they are through their ACTIONS and not their words. I don't tolerate bullshit people or negativity. I don't compare myself to others. I don't let anyone's words define who I am, I DEFINE WHO I AM. I don't listen to people's ""advice"" that I know isn't good for me. I trust my gut, intuition, and myself. If I fail or have a set back, I don't beat myself up. I wrote down 20 Positive Affirmations that feel true to me and I read them every morning and night. I love myself unconditionally. I accept that my life and no one's life is perfect, but I love the imperfections instead of wishing them away. I don't crave attention from my ex or anyone who has ever hurt me. I do not want to ever speak or talk to these people ever again because I know I deserve better. I am in an honest, healthy relationship WITH MYSELF. I am my own best friend and always will be (with or without another person). I love and embrace my mistakes. I smile and laugh everyday and enjoy every beautiful moment of my life. I am not the person I was before, during, or after my break up. I am a person I never thought I was capable of being and damn, does it feel so good to reach this point! I got my dream job, and met an awesome dude two days after. I choose to have fun everyday and to take things slow if I start having feelings for another person. I educated myself on red flags, toxic traits, and emotionally abusive people to prevent myself from falling for another person like that. I refuse to let myself hit rock bottom again. I refuse to be that little person who hated herself every fucking day. I am happy. I'm thriving. I feel fucking awesome-- and I practice self love and self care every second of every day. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I do hope my journey/healing has shed some light onto whatever you are going through right now. I am so sorry you are hurting and heartbroken-- I still feel those things, but I'm also grateful I feel those things because if I didn't, I wouldn't be doing so well today. Sometimes we have to lose everything in order to gain the world-- I'm confident I have gained the world.

I turn on the hot water and let it fill up the tub. I add salts and oils and bubbles. I light the candles and turn off the lights. I strip myself naked and step into the boiling water. I let myself sink to the bottom:I let my tears fall. I let myself miss you, wish for you, grieve for you. The water turns salty and cold and I lie there thinking of you. And then when I'm ready, I pull the plug. The sound of the water draining is sudden, like thunder ; yet, aching like the groan of an old rocking chair. The water flows and quickly washes away until I'm no longer submerged. I feel the cold vulnerability of the open air; I shiver. I open my eyes, breathe deeply, sit up and watch as the pain of you circles the drain."
147,vulnerability,BreakUps,You taught me...,2,bo7buv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/bo7buv/you_taught_me/,2019-05-14 04:37:32,"You taught me how to love unconditionally even though you thought it was something I never showed to you. You taught me how to not be in my head so much even though you constantly live in yours. You taught me that I can maintain a long-term relationship even though it ended just like the others. You taught me that I could live with my partner even though you felt suffocated and needed space to figure out who you were again. You taught me I could introduce someone to my friends and family even though you are more upset about losing your social circle. You taught me that I could be a support system to you and give you the space you needed even though you knew you would never feel the same way about me again. You made me realize that you were never willing to work on yourself even you told me to change to cater to you. It has been two weeks since my break up and despite the fact I saw it coming I still feel devastated. I felt the distance, detachment and lack of intimacy for a while but never voiced anything. Im at fault as much as he is. Its scary to think about how dependent you are on a partner, especially when you live with them. At times it feels like you lose your sense of self and what truly makes you happy. I felt obligated to put him first and made myself second. I have an incredible support system of friends and family yet I look in the mirror every morning and feel like Im alone. I fell into the trap, like most people, of talking to my ex after our breakup. The raw conversations describing the hurt and emptiness I feel, hoping that my vulnerability will hit a nerve and maybe he will admit he feels the same. But it doesnt. He talks to me as if nothing ever happened. Reaching out about things we appreciated when we were together. He is happy there is some sort of new found normalcy between us and reiterates that hes committed to a friendship when Im ready. Ive never been friends with an ex before so Im not sure why Id start now. I tell him I want the same down the road but this could also be because Im still in love with this person. After a couple of days of us talking regularly again and my friend informing me that theyve already seen him on a dating app after a week and a half of us being broken up, Ive told him I dont want any communication between the both of us. He is looking for a distraction to replace me and that can only work for so long. Me on the other hand, I want to embrace the new found quiet in my life. I want to learn what makes me happy again and settle for nothing less than what I want and deserve. As clich as it sounds, I need to learn how to love myself before letting someone else into my life. I need to accept my flaws and not look at them as a burden, I dont need to apologize for being who I am. You taught me that there is someone better out there for me."
148,vulnerability,BreakUps,How To Heal:,59,bp2zqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/bp2zqq/how_to_heal/,2019-05-16 06:22:33,"It's been just about a month now since my ex-girlfriend broke up with me. Shattered. Broken. Numb. And more. I've felt all of these things since then. I know it hurts, but here are a few things to keep in mind, and some helpful tips that worked for me to get through this hurt together. We are going to be okay. 1. HIT. THE. GYM. The endorphins and chemicals released in our brains after a good workout are addictive, and it will keep you coming back for more as you begin to see those results. That time you spent trying to cater for your ex and always having to make sure they're happy, use that time to get in the best shape of your life. You know what no one's EVER said after a workout? ""I sure did regret that"". No one has ever regretted a workout, I promise it will help you blow off some steam and give you something positive to focus on. 2. Find out who you are and what makes YOU happy. When we are with someone, and they leave, we feel we have lost a part of ourselves. Our lives were intertwined with this individual, and in a way we became reliant on them moving forward in our lives. You were someone before your ex, right? If you had been with your ex-partner for a long period of time, and can't remember who you were... guess what? You can REINVENT yourself. A new person, with likes/dislikes, hobbies, things that make you happy, absolutely anything you want. The possibilites are endless. Put yourself first. 3. No more snooping on social media, block/delete them from everything. This has to be the toughest one I personally had to endure. I get it, it's difficult. You want to hang onto every bit of what you can, because you miss it. I know. But you have to realize doing this will cause anxiety, fear, sadness, and becoming bitter. This person, they hurt you. They do not deserve your attention, or your care. More importantly, it allows you to not live with anxiety, and worrying about what they're doing, who they're with, and what's going on in their lives. And you know what? None of that matters anymore, because they chose to not have you as a part of their life, so why would you want them to be a part of your life? The first couple weeks are the toughest, but I promise you that the weight lifted off your shoulders will be tremendous. It's worth it. They're not important anymore. You are. 4. NO CONTACT. Ever notice this is pretty much a helpful tip in every post, YouTube video, or article you read? There is a reason for that. Maintaining contact will ALWAYS have you thinking there is some sort of hope this person comes back to you. If we have that, we can never truly heal and move forward, and become our own person. Once again, I know how hard it is, but you NEED to do this. Do it for you, you're important and you matter. You are beautiful. 5. Time. It's the most clich thing you hear, but there is good reason for this. We all heal in different ways, and at our own pace. Give. It. Time. As the days pass, you'll think of them less and less. And one day, we will be able to have days where we do not think of them whatsoever. It will take time, it is a process. We didn't buildup these feelings and emotions for this person overnight, what makes you think we will lose them overnight? We won't. Let time take its course, and focus on the other tips to allow yourself to heal. 6. Know that you can do whatever the hell you want now. Sometimes in relationships, things become stagnant. You stop growing. They stop growing. You as a former couple, stop growing. I noticed this in my own relationship. Since the breakup, I've reconnected with older friends, went rock-climbing, and am getting out more to explore the world around me. Use this to grow as an individual, and do things you weren't necessarily able to do with your ex because you were too busy trying to please them at every turn. You're free now. The last little bit I'll have to say is this... you're precious. You loved, gave your all, did everything you could in your power to make things work, yet they still left you. That just goes to show they do not deserve you. You'll find someone who appreciates your efforts and does not take your vulnerability for granted. For now, take this time to learn and grow, to heal. You're a valuable person, and I love you for doing your best. For being vulnerable. For opening your heart up. Do not let this change how much you open up and how much you let yourself be vulnerable going forward. Vulnerability is the key to lasting relationships, in all aspects of life. I'm proud of you for being vulnerable, knowing rejection was an outcome. Do not let this change that vulnerability, I promise it will be reciprocated when you find the right one. For now, let's heal. Let's grow and let's make sure we are the best versions of ourselves for not only your soulmate, but for you. You are the most important person in your life. We are going to be okay, I promise."
149,vulnerability,BreakUps,The key to moving on.,116,bqzrqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/bqzrqg/the_key_to_moving_on/,2019-05-21 05:04:28,"I remind myself every day to look at the evidence. When I find my heart getting back into those habits of pining after him or idealizing him, I take notice and remind myself of the facts. The truth of the matter is that my ex hasnt tried to reach out or make amends. And the fact is that he decided that he no longer was willing to invest time and energy to our relationship, into me, and into our life together. The truth is, he never really took major steps or made sacrifices for me and that didnt matter to me. My love for him so incredibly strong, and that is the truth. My love for him was so encompassing that I ignored the evidence that our love wasnt always mutual and that our common goals were never shared in the end. That is the truth. But then I also need to remind myself of how beautiful of a person he truly was when he was strong and feeling in control. I cant deny that and I certainly cant deny the mad love I felt for him. I cant deny that when the relationship was good and strong, he was the best lover that Ive experienced. But to deny the beauty, is to deny the uglier, darker parts. It is to deny my own and his own contribution to the flaws in our relationship. What we had wasnt perfect but I wanted it anyway. We both did at one point. And I am lucky to have experienced it. My point is, is that when we are being honest and truthful, we really do free ourselves. Understanding our breakups in a fair, honest way that continues to humanize both parties while holding BOTH accountable will give us that closure we need. It can really give us a sense of control and power of ourselves during the painful times. Those moments of clarity, serene acceptance and lightbulb moments come this way, I promise you. It hurts and it can be really difficult at first, but I feel like Ive already let go. Once Ive stopped throwing myself pity parties and wallowing, I started examining and speaking to myself with full honesty. And this honesty was the key in my ability to accept and release the loss of what I thought was the love of my life. Because at the end of all of the reflecting, we realize that everything that had happened was going to happen. It is really liberating to let go and put the internal struggle to rest. I still hurt from time to time and I experience nostalgia from time to time, but I treat them as fleeting moments. I remind myself that this person no longer loves me and I no longer have to fight and work so hard for that love. I have all of this space in my giant heart for me, my loved ones and the things I love to do. Its hard for the first little while, as we dont know what to do with all of our excess energy, emotion and time. But I promise you, if you start being 100% honest with yourself and you take those love goggles off, youll ask yourself Ok so that happened. What now? and its very scary. Because now we understand that nothing is simple and nothing is black and white. Relationships are complicated and not always pure bliss. We want to protect ourselves from that pain again. We want to fill that pain with something else. Thats moving on, right? Definitely not. We need to be honest and true to ourselves at all times, especially now that times are hard. That means recognizing the beauty, light and joy with the ugly, dark and hurtful and choosing to focus on the unfamiliar possibilities that you have yet to treat through. Also, remind yourself of what you have. Remind yourself of your health, if you have it, your family if you have it, anything that you have. The fact that we are able to spend hours on Reddit and be introspective with our lives is a good indicator that we live a pretty decent life. We have that room to contemplate and explore because we arent consumed by simply surviving. Practice gratitude because it really could always be much worse. Once you start fully embracing what you have, you will begin to feel excited about what is to come. I hope you find this helpful. I am in such a different place than when I was 3.5 months ago. It took a lot of action and a lot of willpower still NC and strong. It took a lot of reading on mindfulness, human psychology, vulnerability and just the human emotional experience in general. It took meditation, affirmations, journaling, therapy, gratitude lists, forcing myself out of bed and money. Its still taking so much of my energy and so much of my focus. But I have to try and Im still trying. I will continue to try new things if I find that things arent getting better. You have to. Because this shit is the type of shit that will build resilience and wisdom for when shit really hits the fan. I hope youre all having the best day, whatever best means to you today."

It's like talking to a brick wall are you even hearing what I'm saying or are you reverting into your own mind in order to preserve some sort of vulnerability. We spent 10 years together how are you so collected? What clicked in your head that decided it's over, give me something get mad, get sad, get anything, show me some pain give me a reason to stop loving you, a reason to stop caring if you make it to work on time or if your coffee is made right or if you took snacks to work since I know your busy and won't get to grab lunch. Make this numbness go away I really don't know anymore what step do I take do I talk to old friends who I got too busy for, do I just pack my things and go leave our house our family find a new spot to grow, I can't I won't leave my little one behind, you want to be co-parents then consider how I feel. It took two to make this marriage it took one to destroy it now let's pick up the pieces and build two new healthy homes. I'll wait, I'll wish you happy birthday, I've even bought you something from the kid. You can't take this love away but you can turn it into something horrible full of disgust and animosity something no one wants. I'll do it for the little one I'll put up with the BS, until we can move forward. Just know I love you and will always love you you are a beautiful human and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors."
151,vulnerability,BreakUps,Coming up on 7 months,3,bskczk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/bskczk/coming_up_on_7_months/,2019-05-25 04:24:17,"The title says it all. I was engaged to be married. The sheer thrill of being there was great. Im not going to lie. It was one of the best moments of my life to be in a happy and loving relationship. There were issues, but you tend to ignore the red flags when you think they are hick-ups in the grand scheme of things. Unfortunately, so much happened in the last month of the relationship, that I was forced to end it. This happens more often than you might think. First and foremost, you will always feel a sense of loss. It doesnt matter how much time passes. They will always pop up in your head, at the most inopportune times. Its the nature of love and loss. You cant really combat it, but you can always sprinkle in some healthy thoughts about the process of detaching and determining what is going to be right for you in the future. You will love again. There are so many wonderful people out there. This sub is full of people who have been through what youve been through; some have gone through it way worse. Remember that someone made a decision to end it. Whether you were the one who did it or not, it doesnt matter. That was the end. Love can save a lot of things, but the cold, hard truth is knowing when youre saving yourself. That is the ultimate act of love and defiance. It does get better. You meet new people. You find things that bring out your best. Sometimes youll see old things and remember what was, which will bring out your worst. But its all a part of the process. You will learn to laugh again, to love again, to give someone your vulnerability again, and you will be stronger. But most importantly, you will learn about yourself and what you are made of. You will learn what it truly means to be in charge. So if you are feeling hopeless and hurt, you will get through it. Dont go around it. Go through it. All you are doing is tempering yourself to withstand the hardships for those tough times, and becoming resilient enough to fight for the good. Fight for the good. Fight for what youre worth, and fight because honestly, thats the only thing you can do. Never, ever give up."
152,vulnerability,BreakUps,"2 steps forward, 1 step backward",2,bt18vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/bt18vn/2_steps_forward_1_step_backward/,2019-05-26 09:43:22,"The most useful advice I've read since my breakup one month ago is you have to let go of someone who was never really there. &amp;#x200B; You never truly opened up, or showed your vulnerability consistently, always keeping a wall between us so that you're not hurt. You also cheated, for paid sex, I could have forgiven if you had made amends for it as I loved you so much, if you had redeemed yourself, if you had finally confessed that you're afraid to love that I had made you wanting to change because you don't want to lose me but no, you weren't afraid to lose me, I just fooled myself.. because I believed our love was strong,that we wanted the same things, we made so many projects for the future, the chemistry and the connection was unreal, we would get each other instantly but yet you didn't trust me enough to let your fears go and to see past yourself. You only loved me when it was convenient for you, when it was easy and you were good to me in these moments but as soon as I would bring up my needs it would become difficult and it translated when I discovered the betrayal you fought for 3 weeks, because sure it would have required for you to only think about someone else for some time... You sabotaged it from the very beginning because you were never really committed to me but you used me for your own self-esteem, you never really gave in. Still playing games after one year... and the way it finished showed me the seriousness of your selfishness and your emotional immaturity. You didn't considered me, you just hang up the phone and never called me back, it's been almost 2 weeks now...Sure I told you to move out, but you betrayed me and I couldn't take any longer you seeing my love and my will to forgive as a weakness, but you did and you were never really there anyway... You only are in relationships so that they make you feel good about yourself. You want someone who praises you even when you direspect them or give them the minimum. &amp;#x200B; Glad I discovered that now, rather sooner than later so that I live my life fully with no subterfuge and so that I let some space to someone who truly know themselves, who want to let the past in the past and learn from their mistakes."

It is EMDR therapy which focuses a lot on childhood trauma that follows me into adulthood. One of my biggest issues is my history of abandonment. Through my father as well as my fathers family and up to present, with my most recent ex. After my ex and I broke up back in the middle of April, I felt abandonment. I pretty much came home one day and none of his stuff was there. Fast forward the last week or so, my therapist and I decided to focus on three examples of abandonment; the earliest, the most difficult, and the most recent. Im not one who shows a lot of emotion. Not really a fan of crying in front of people, but im all about sharing how I feel. Well, we went over the earliest time and through the question she asked and events I talked about and I lost my shit. I cried and cried and cried. The event we talked about wasnt even a sad moment, but the events following were. I felt amazing after that and was eager to finally dive deeper into my break up. Today, I woke up knowing I was going to bawl my eyes about this damn break up. We were together for over two years, lived together, had plans to move back to my hometown, since the moment he left, NC has been going strong. Meaning he blocked my number, signed himself out of the lease, blocked me on facebook (which I later deleted entirely). I went to find him outside of the college we go to after his class ended. I skipped mine so I could do that to talk to him. He was so cold and I bawled my eyes out in front of him for the first time ever which has helped me get to the point im at. Well, today in therapy, we talked about that exact moment and all of the feelings of being rejected. It sounded hard to do. I didnt shed a single tear nor did I manifest the idea of us being together. I realized that I did everything for that man. EVERYTHING. I handled all of the bills, I planned all our trips, I planned our future, tried to talk about and fix all our problems as a team and he just went along for it. So basically, I was his damn mother. Hell no. With EMDR, it creates a visual effect, I couldnt help but replace the thought of the ex with a vision of a child who isnt getting what he wants. Instead of imagining our last moment together as me, a 24 year old woman, breaking down and offering up full vulnerability to a 28 year year old man who isnt willing to listen to or fix our problems as a team, I imagined me, having control and accepting my new life that Im meant to live and the ex, as a child who still has a lot of growing up to do, which I can no longer do for him. So pretty much, Im letting myself let go for real this time. Thanks, therapy!"

You empathized with my suffering and pain, and had compassion towards whatever intense mood and situation I was in. 2. Validation. Coming from someone with deep-rooted insecurities and a fear of vulnerability, your constant reassurance brought peace to my storms. 3. Loyalty. This allowed me to put faith and trust in you without a single doubt in my mind. I never had to worry or constantly stress about another girl, another women, etc. I could trust you completely because I knew you would never openly betray me or stab me behind my back. 4. You believed that I could be somebody. You saw a different version of me, and Ive never had anyone look at like I wasnt inherently flawed. In your eyes, there exists a reality where I am without defects and deficiencies. 5. Kindred souls. I never had to work or even communicate what I needed from you. Somehow, we had a mutual understanding between the two of us. Our love felt way too good to be true and easygoing because there were no fights or disagreements. 6. I was the dancer on the stage. You were my support and pillars. For once in my life, you let me take centre stage and I felt free to comfortably be me while you gently held me up."

You made it comfortable to express my flaws, to show some vulnerability, and let all my guards done. Ive never felt so secure and protected, theres a very grounding nature to the relationship. Im now missing that safe and warm place to be in. Whether its in your arms or talking to you until 4am, I need that social support and lack of judgement. I dont know how to go about life, now that Ive experienced total safety and comfort. I think for someone who has severe social anxiety, the total-free judgment zone is crucial to building healthy connections with others. Its the fact that now its gone and Im trying to re-seek those feelings of calmness again."

With same heart. With same values. Same accomplishments. Same affection. Same body. Same feelings. I'm not a different person. But you dont see it or feel it. You want something else thay indent know about and that makes me feel I'm not enough for you. And it hurts. Because I was enough for you. And you were appreciating me.and you were grateful to have me. I was your princess and you treated me like a royalty. But I am not anymore. You are not happy with me. I do love you, but I also want your happiness. Love is not just about making one person happy. It's about making sure both are happy, and making effort to fill in the gaps for happiness together. Love is not about restriction and orders. Love is about adoring your lover as he/she is. It's about setting your loved ones free and let them be with you because they value their relationship with you. You let your lover make mistakes and learn from it. You teach them by being compassionate and caring. You see their feeling and vulnerability when they are mad or when they complain. You fogive your partner and let them make the effort to change and grow with you. You trust they can be better and empower them by recognizing and praising their efforts. You become the person with big heart and create a safe space where your lover can be themselves, with all their flaws and insecurities and misunderstandings. Love needs time, paitient, mutual effort and willingness to make it work. That's how you know you love someone. If you can pass the judgment you would care for their wellbeing. I set you free my love. You mentioned many times you are not happy with how things are going between us. If you can't find happiness with me, I let you go and find it with someone else. I will miss you."

For almost three years (it would have been in four months), I thought my partner K and I had the most beautiful, stable, and healthy relationship. We read relationship books, talked about our feelings, and practiced vulnerability and honesty and always amended during fights. For the entirety of our relationship, we always knew our goals (we were both going to do our PhDs) and so we knew we would be long distance. We've also been long distance for chunks at a time (up to three months) and these experiences have gone well and made us stronger and more capable. I had thought that our incoming long distance would have been fine because we had ""practiced"" it so many times. Two weeks ago he admitted to me that he wanted to ""transition into being friends"" because he was scared that we wouldn't work out long-distance in the future. Specifically, he said that when he gets a career (he didn't get into any PhD programs and is now looking for jobs in his field), he wasn't sure if he would *want* me because the long distance would be ""too difficult"" when he's at that point in his life (which could happen anywhere from a month to four monthswe don't know when he'll get his career). Needless to say, I was completely blind-sighted by this because I thought we had previously done the work to prepare ourselves for it, down to planning our visits and our day-to-day routines. I am also pretty damn sure that he was backing out because he was so *scared* of us ""not working out"" that he'd rather opt out of the whole thing than risk us failingwhich is, ironically, making us fail. He says that he's not sure of what we will be so he'd rather be friends right now. Also needless to say, there were hours of talking, screaming, tears, fights, arguments. For a little while (for the week left when he was in our hometown before he moved home), we decided to go ""day by day"" and trust that we wanted to be boyfriends together and so we were able to stay together (it took him a lot of convincing to get to that stage). Now, four days after he moved home, he tells me that he's back to his original thought and he wants us to be ""best friends"" because of the circumstances. He says he loves me, that he wants to be with me, that he likes being my boyfriendand I like being his boyfriend too, and we still say ""I love you"" to each other and still make kiss-y gestures toward each other. But today he broke up with me again (I had to kind of *force* him to break up with me because he didn't know how to articulate what he wanted), and he said that he might realize that he's wrong and come back to me. I know that he's wrong and I know him well enough to think that he'll realize eventually, but it hurts to hold out on that and all my friends and family say not to wait and to just move on, and that if I *clamor* for him then it will not allow him to process independently whether he wants to be with me or not. He also says that if he manages to get a job back in our statewhich he's trying to do, but it's gonna be hard and there are no guarantees since he doesn't want to compromise on the type of job he getsthat he's open to rekindling things. But again, this is me being hopeful. And we don't know what job he'll get or whereand he could get a job in as little as a month or even up until the fall. It hurts because he says he loves me so much and if the circumstances were different, he'd be my boyfriend. It also hurts because it's just so out of the blue. It hurts because he doesn't *want* to try and because he instead wants to try *not* being together to see if that ""feels better"" for himI get that he has a right to that, but it shatters my heart because his reasons don't make sense (if he wants us to be together, he'll *try* and then we ***will*** be together). I've come to accept that if we're meant to be, he'll realize eventually that he's wrong but it hurts to know that I can't wait. I've also come to accept that I can't control (1) his thoughts (2) his career and (3) if he chooses to move on, and that I can only control what I do for myself and how I move on. I want him so desperately to get a job near me but it might not happen and that hurts to think about, too. It feels like there's a damper or an extended period to this. I think he's being stupid and stubborn and it hurts. It feels like all the things that made him the best boyfriend in the world (fairness of judgment, commitment to his own integrity) have become a nightmare. It also hurts because I *know* he loves me and he tells me he loves me when we talk but he won't *let* himself love me because being my boyfriend doesn't feel right. My heart has shattered and he's crying because he knows he hurts me and he never intended for that. I've forgiven him. But what do I do? Will he get back with me?"

The first one was horrible and it took me a long time to get over. My current one is nasty in its own way (yay cheating) but Im bouncing back a lot quicker than I anticipated. Its been a month and Im fully functional again. I still think about him a lot but Ive kept up my gym routine, have been eating 3 meals a day, have been working, and just getting stuff done overall. The main difference between the two? Friends! With the first one I felt really isolated and i didnt want to talk to anybody about the issues I had so the pain dragged on longer than it should have. This time I was able to admit some vulnerability and I talked a lot of my friends about what happened, most of them listened and offered advice and were overall supportive. The first week I had a friend sleep over twice because i didnt wanna be alone. Im still going through it a little bit but i know I can talk to my friends if I need to. If any of you guys are struggling, I suggest just reaching out to a friend. It also helps a lot with no contact."

160,vulnerability,BreakUps,Just a little help?,3,bh8oid,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/bh8oid/just_a_little_help/,2019-04-25 23:33:07,"Hi Reddit! I normally wouldn't post, but this is such a moment of vulnerability for me - and this community seems so strong and supportive, I figured I might need your help. Background: Its been a month since my girlfriend of a year and half officially left me. She is a wonderful, smart, driven woman who decided due to significant specific job stress and future prospects (in healthcare) that she really needed and wanted to put in the 110 hour weeks and couldn't force the same investment into our relationship. I do not bemoan her that. I do regret that I felt committed to a true partnership, one of shared burdens, and feel helpless that she felt marginalized due to her time spent on other things that were exciting to her and too specific to share with me. I do regret that as she narrowed her circle, she decided to exclude me, especially given that I increasingly supported and gave her space to commit to career. I hardly aim to victimize a woman for prioritizing her career - but I do feel jilted. She had mentioned that I was a wonderful partner, but that she simply couldn't muster the care as things became more and more exciting and pressured at work. Additionally, I suspect that she became close with people in her professional circles who could be more available to her increasingly narrow set of cares. To feel replaced emotionally by people who could write career recommendations for her and physically by creepy dudes in bars has been a very difficult thing. Question: I spent 18 months caring deeply for this person who had not been as invested as I was. Things ended because she wanted to recede into herself. When I went to pick up my stuff about 10 days after the breakup, she asked that we stay close - I replied that I didn't know what would be possible, that SHE had left ME and I didn't know. She seemed to want to talk about how I felt - I was much too raw for a real conversation. Subsequent small texts about other items to be picked up or thrown away felt perfunctory - having been coached by friends and family, I shut down, got to the facts. She said ""anything else I could say wouldn't be appropriate via text."" Now, its been two weeks of complete radio silence. I deeply care for her and am worried that she is working too hard, taking no time for herself. I worry that she thinks I'm very angry at her, rather than sad. I'm sure there's a little bit of jealousy at her perceived ability to move along and my festering in care. I know I was dumped, but I regret shutting down and not talking about my emotions when she prompted me. And now I have all of this unsolicited concern, but cannot share it with her. What should I do? Am I just hanging on to the idea of a partnership? Is this some bizarre version of not realizing things are over? Which signal should I respond to - the dumping or the desire for me to be around? I have a deep desire to be a good person here regardless of partnership status - am I being manipulated here? If I know that, does it matter? &amp;#x200B; \*I apologize for the ramble. This has been one of the most difficult things I've gone through - and am pulling into the homestretch of sadness, I just wanted to solicit some advice from the crowd on this issue. Thank you in advance. I love you very much"
161,vulnerability,BreakUps,A little bit of hope,5,birpj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/birpj0/a_little_bit_of_hope/,2019-04-30 02:46:57,"A couple of weeks later after the other post, I made and I'm already feeling a LOT better. I've come to realize that if someone doesn't fight for you, you shouldn't fight for them. They do not deserve you or your love! I lost my self to try to love someone who couldn't even say it back, but I don't hate him. I pity him, because people like him don't know how to show vulnerability or to love deeply and passionately as we do. And this hurts, a lot but that is the small price we have to pay for all those great emotions during it. I now know that I did everything in my power to save that relationship, sacrificed my own happiness for the sake of it and dropped my standards to hell. But this pain has made me grow and learn that I shouldn't have to depend on other people in order to be happy. The greatest happiness someone can experience comes from the inside of the person. I've made progress and my mind is now clearer than it was in the relationship. I've been working out hard and feel healthier than ever. Now I'm nowhere close to wanting to start dating again because my brain is not ready and I know that if I do the opposite I'll end up hurting myself again or worse someone else. People are right, after all, IT DOES GET BETTER, whether you believe it or not. Everything happens for a reason. I've been getting a lot closer to friends and opening up more. I've met new people that I find really cool and having new experiences with them. We've also arranged a trip to Spain and I'm really excited about. My biggest fear was to be left alone, and the fear of rejection was killing me inside. But with baby steps, I finally reached out to people who helped me a lot. I got the closure I was afraid I would never get and I finally started loving myself more and more, day after day. I've decided that it's time to close this chapter and move to another one and never look back. I wish I had this mindset back then, but in order for me to be here I had to go through horrible mental and physical pain, daily panic attacks, deep sadness and emptiness which later progressed to numbness, anger, and hatred towards the person I loved most (and I still do) and now finally peace. I'm sure there will be times that I'll fall into that hole of shit again but  feel I know how to deal with it. Have a nice day :)"

It seems hes the only partner Ive had, and while my inexperience does play somewhat of a part, I am afraid of forming close relationships with another person again. I long for closeness and companionship, but I end up pushing other people away due to this irrational fear. I dont understand the origins or beginnings of my issues, but I do understand the underlying reason is a fear of vulnerability. So how can one be more comfortable with sharing their true self and expressing their desires/wants?"

I felt a connection with him I hadn't really felt for anyone before, and because I was going into this after finally loving myself, being alone, and enjoying it, I thought I was going into something healthy. I remember at the beginning constantly thinking of Andy from the Office saying that he wished there was a way of knowing you were in the good times, and I thought those, those were the good times. I appreciated every day we spent together, felt safe in the times we were apart, laughed and smiled and loved. A few months in I started noticing red flags. I was away traveling and could only communicate with him via Facebook. I'd made a point of not checking his social media prior to that because I didn't want to be one of those partners that cyber stalked, but once I was on it I saw he had made a post about needing a roommate (something he hadn't mentioned to me) and a girl replied saying she'd move in, but that he'd have to deal with her walking around in get underwear. I clicked on her profile and he had commented on all the pictures I could see of her, talking about her 'nice tits' including a particularly sleazy remark the night we'd said we loved each other. We spoke about it once I got back and he explained it was just old habits, and reassured me he'd stop. A few months down the road it continued. He followed hundreds of underwear models on Instagram and they made sexualized remarks to each other. Same with coworkers and girls in the city. He'd stare at women as they passed him on the street. When I presented this as a problem he said ""you have no idea how many of the hot coworkers I could be fucking at my work"". I broke up with him on the spot and went home. A few days later he contacted me and said he couldn't believe that was his reaction. He deleted all the girls on his Instagram and stupidly we got back together. Over the next year he stopped having sex with me. Sex is hugely important to me and he refused to address it. He had me convinced I was overreacting about sex and girls and that this was my fault for being jealous - having been cheated on or gaslighted in all my previous relationships I thought maybe it was. I started therapy, and hypnotherapy for my jealousy issues and we moved in together. Around new years another red flag took place. He until this point refused to clear his laptop history, even though I thought it was making his computer slow. We were watching a movie late one night, and he wanted to go watch something else in the living room. He wanted to stop the movie and take his laptop, and I told him to just use mine. After a huge fight he conceded and cleared his history. Now I get it I don't want people to see all the stupid shit I look up, or the random porn I watch, but when I confronted him about it he blew up, told me to fuck off and left the apartment. Like many of our arguments I was convinced that it was an overreaction, I mean I deleted my history, why should I care if he deleted his. A few weeks later my opportunity arose. He left his laptop open and his password up. I snooped his Instagram. There was one message from a girl asking him to come visit her again, or would his girlfriend not let him? So much more came out from there, he'd been sexting dozens of women including these ""hot coworkers "" over the course of our relationship. I moved out but it took me just under two months to find a place. Once moved out I had a reaction to the stress of the cheating (as well as the stress of a family cancer diagnosis, the move, getting a new job after 10 years, and being back in school) and a fist sized patch of my hair fell out. I cried for a week, and like a hero he came back into my life. He swore he'd always love me, never meant to hurt me, and would be with me while I was struggling. I was vulnerable, and that vulnerability made me blind. A few months later we moved in together and it really did seem as though he was making positive changes. He wasn't checking out women, deleted social media, would reassure me and even showed me his phone when I was having trouble believing him. After a short blissful period his mood began to change, he started losing his shit on me almost every day. His temper was blowing up, he'd throw things, break them, slam doors, say horrible things, until one day it all culminated. Our usual mornings included us getting up at 6:45 and him using the bathroom while I made a smoothie for us and fed the cats. Then he got to sit the and watch cartoons or fights while I got ready. Then we'd leave for work, it was the winter so I'd usually brush off the car while it was heating up. He liked to stop for coffee before I'd drive him to work, they were pretty slow so sometimes I'd get him to work at 8:02. He was pissed that I was making him late and said I needed to start getting up earlier. I tried to flip it, he worked at a restaurant if there was a line at the coffee shop he could make a coffee at work, or he could brush off the car to save time. I'd love it if someone got up made me breakfast, drove me for coffee, and then dropped me off at work. He started screaming and told me to stop the car, screamed at me to fuck off and gave me the finger as I drove away. When I got to work he'd sent me a text saying we needed to break up, I agreed, and a few weeks later I moved out. It was always me moving, he refused to, thought for some reason it was easier for me because I had a car. I could see nothing was changing so I requested a month break in even talking. Within a week he'd texted me saying he was having a break down, and wanted to get back together. He honestly couldn't understand why I didn't want to. He texted periodically and I tried to coach him on his stress. A month later his mom passed away, having lost my older brother in a similar circumstance a few years ago, I was upset and went to be a support for him. He was struggling and didn't have any friends (I met no one from his life in the 2 years we were together, and he hung out with my friends 4 times, he even hit on one of my friends on my birthday). We slept together on one particularly emotional night, and despite taking plan B I got pregnant. We discussed what to do, and given the loss of his mom - he told me the experience changed him, he saw what mattered, started counseling etc and my Dad being sick with cancer, we thought we could do this. I was skeptical and was making a back up plan to do it alone if needed, but as the weeks went on he'd convinced me he was all in and trying. He had a financial plan, was happy, supportive. We decided to tell my family, he shared in this excitment, encouraging me to do it, as he had no one to share the news with. Four days later he called me crying. He had fucked up again. I found out that right after I was back in his life - had planned a celebration of life for his mother because he didn't want to go back home for the funeral, while bringing him dinners every night - he convinced me to take one night to myself ""because I'd been doing so much for him"" and he downloaded Tinder and fucked some girl. I believe he only confessed because it was the night before my mandatory STD test and he wanted to confess before I found out. He blamed it on grief, and even tried to say it was because I'd said to get back out there when we'd first broken up. I felt horribly taken advantage of, and though it was technically not cheating he'd used me for care, and support. I was regrieving the suicide of my brother, the loss of someone I had at one point considered a mother in law, and though we weren't technically together, I thought we were connecting over something I hadn't connected with anyone on before. We cried together, reminisced. I planned a beautiful day for him, taking him to the province over where he and his mom had roadtriped. We did all of her favorite things, and I made him dinner that honoured her, and he accepted it all saying he loved me. I was devastated. I decided then and there that I wanted no link to him and couldn't share custody of a baby, or have him in my life any longer. I decided to get an abortion, a difficult decision but what I felt was best, he agreed. The week leading up to it my mother called or texted me every night trying to get me to keep the baby. She had her friends and family messaging me congratulation messages in an attempt to guilt me into reconsidering. I got a medical abortion yesterday. It was horrible. I had a fever, vomited blood and had trouble staying lucid. Not everyone experiences pain, but I was genuinely scared for my life and concerned I was having a reaction, I called a friend to come over and she stayed with me for 6 hours to ensure five fever didn't get worse and that nothing went wrong. I couldn't stand without shaking or feeling like I was going to vomit and had trouble breathing. I'm struggling and guess I just needed to get this out somewhere. Thanks for reading sorry for the novel. TL:DR ex cheated constantly, got pregnant after his mom passed away, found out he was still being sleazy."

Instead of letting your own guard down you proceed to tell me that I should be able to take our son alone to get vaccinated and that I waited till the last minute to get his passport papers in order even though we still have a week to go for hand in date. Nothing went wrong everything is ok yet you still find it necessary in a moment of vulnerability to make me feel worse. I walked away baffled angry at myself for trying to make things peaceful. Even if you might not think so Im extremely appreciative of everything you have done for us and this life you have tried to give us. I aimed too high and thats my fault and now I will pay the price. I wanted Julian at that particular school because I was traumatized at mine growing up but I should not have projected my past traumas on to him. He will be fine wherever he goes. We cant ignore the fact that we are not compatible anymore. Our personalities go in opposite directions. When I need affection you give me the opposite and vice a versa - I assume. I have tried opening up to you, asking you to be more vulnerable with me, tried to open up our sex life but it stopped at my feeble attempts. I dont even know if you even need my affection but I do know that I have needed yours. But you have been unable. I have to be true to myself and our son."

She had a new apartment and was gone within 2 weeks. 2 DAMN WEEKS. We were together for 4 years and she was my first everything but kiss. I was going to propose to her next year, but c'est la vie. She has said she wants to remain friends, this isn't goodbye, and she would maybe like to try again in the future. As time goes on though, I don't know if any of that is true. I still love her but she ""loves me but isn't in love with me anymore."" To me it feels like she just threw me away for her new job. Though I would say a lot of the fault for the split lies within myself. My emotional maturity was severely lacking (picture boy and girl on the playground type love). I poked and poked until she had enough. Anyways I have been trapped in a limbo for two months as I have waited to move out of the house we lived in for near 2.5 years, and this Sunday I can finally leave the endless loops of memories that play like movies haunting my every turn in that house. I am going to miss the hell out of it but my god do I need to get out of there. It feels like a new chapter but one I wasn't ready to start, almost as if the author got tired of the plot and just offed my favorite character. I am looking forward to this and my continued growth, I have taken a long look in the mirror and identified many flaws I need to work on and have begun therapy to help me deal with the grief of the loss as well as to work on my emotional maturity. Vulnerability is a scary thing but something I now know is not a sign of weakness. Emotions are not a sign of weakness. I have a tremendous amount of growing to do and the next big step comes Sunday. I will always love her, but I have to learn to love myself before I can hope for anything else. Sorry for the rant. I hope everyone out there is finding their happiness one step at a time. Stay strong and move forward, we will retake our lives."
166,vulnerability,BreakUps,Still communicating with ex-boyfriend...unsure how to interpret his messages,2,b2snq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/b2snq9/still_communicating_with_exboyfriendunsure_how_to/,2019-03-19 15:04:09,"I apologize in advance for the extremely long post. I've got a lot built up here so I already know it's going to be a long one. I (24F) met someone (29M) online right before New Year's Eve 2018. We hit it off right away, and a week later we met in real life. We live in the same town and could bond over many of the same experiences and interests, and I began to feel my attachment to him grow right away. The first three weeks (including the week we texted before actually meeting) were amazing. I saw him several times a week, and he made me feel so great...blah blah blah, cue all the cliches. A few weeks after we met, I began to notice we'd text less and less frequently (we'd been talking nearly all day in the previous weeks). It would take him sometimes up to three hours to respond to my texts and his responses were short and generic. Now, I knew not to expect the paragraph responses I'd grown accustomed to in the beginning, but I could tell something wasn't quite right. From then on, until the end of February, he grew increasingly distant. Sometimes I'd only see him for a couple hours on a Saturday night and barely heard from him through the week. It was like he just completely checked out. On February 28th I received a text from him. He apologized for being so distant and told me I did nothing wrong, that he was going through a lot and in a very bad mindset right now and needed to work on his mental health before he could even consider a relationship. This text really didn't come as a surprise to me. I knew that earlier in 2018 his ex-girlfriend had broken up with him and basically left him with nothing because she kicked him out of their house and kept his belongings. I knew he struggled with severe depression, anxiety and insomnia, which was made worse by family issues and having trouble finding a job. None of this mattered to me, as I accepted him as he was. I knew he was a very closed off person and struggled to be vulnerable with me because of trust issues from his previous relationship. As far as attachment styles go, I am polar opposite. I tend to fall under the ""anxious"" type of attachment and find I constantly need reassurance from a partner. I don't struggle with vulnerability in the same way. I tend to ""throw everything"" at a potential partner very prematurely in the hope of establishing a connection with them. I wanted him to be able to open up to me so badly while we were together, though I know I probably pushed the issue too far at times. Anyway, I spoke with him on the phone after he sent the text to break up with me. I asked him if he thought there could ever be a chance for us to get back together and his response was ""I don't know, maybe"". He told me he wouldn't ghost me and he didn't. Two days later he texted me, and we texted back and forth every day. Until today. I have not been initiating our conversations every day like I did when we were together. In that time, I've had a very difficult time understanding his intentions. He still jokes around with me and teases me about little things like my driving habits. At one point I changed my Facebook profile picture and he texted me to tell me I looked pretty in it. He's mentioned in passing the possibility of hanging out in the future, but it is very brief. Like ""hey we'll have to do \[whatever activity\] together someday"". I feel like we've actually been talking more SINCE we broke up. For the most part, he seems to take a more active role with texting than he used to. He texts back sooner too. I've spoken on the phone once with him since the breakup (he asked me to) and he sounded so excited to talk to me - just like in the beginning. We don't discuss sex at all, he has been very careful to avoid that. Because I've initiated our conversation during the past two days, today I thought it would be a good idea to let him contact me instead. He didn't. I know from his Facebook posts that he was busy tonight but I can see that he's been online. I thought he would text me. I tend to overthink things to a disastrous degree. Even minor things send my paranoia skyrocketing, like the fact that his Facebook friend count recently increased by one person. I am SO paranoid that he's talking to another girl and will start dating someone soon. I just don't know how to read him. I know he will contact me if he truly wants to talk to me and if not then it isn't worth my time. I just don't know how to do this anymore. I knew I was in love with him on our second date and I am terrified of seeing him with someone else. Last year I got out of a four-year long relationship and it was just sad. It was a cakewalk compared to this. I am so unbelievably heartbroken right now and just want him back in my life 100%. I don't know what I'm hoping to gain by posting this. Support, maybe. It's so hard not to hold out hope that we'll get back together someday. I know it'll work out if it's meant to be, even if he does end up dating someone else. TL;DR: Ex-boyfriend of two months broke up with me because he wants to work on personal issues/baggage before committing to any relationship. Meanwhile, we've been texting nearly daily and I am unsure how to read his intentions. I am terrified of him meeting/dating someone else."
167,vulnerability,BreakUps,Today I am angry.,5,b474am,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/b474am/today_i_am_angry/,2019-03-23 03:27:08,"Long rant incoming. Thank you for this space to share my experience. Growing up, anger was the only acceptable emotion. Other ""negative"" emotions: sad, scared, vulnerable, sensitive... were bad words. Emotions to be ashamed of. Emotions that leave you open to being made fun of. My now-ex was not raised that way. He is gentle, sensitive, stabile, and (I thought) safe. We were together for four years and I didn't realize that these were good qualities. I kept my emotions in and resented his ability to not judge and hate everyone around him. In December, he told me he wasn't sure about us. He said I was emotionally abusive to him, and I needed to change or he would have to leave. Boy did I step up to the plate. I started going to meetings. I found a therapist (after dozens of hours of searching). I began going to a psychiatrist and started medication with all kinds of side effects. I read books upon books and started removing myself from isolation. I tried making friends. And I found it EASY to be kind to him. I stopped trying to control him. I recognized my wrongs and did everything I could to never act that way again. I was killing it! He seemed so proud of me. He acted so supportive. He told me it was okay to be vulnerable, it was okay to be scared, it was okay to cry. That I was safe. That I could feel my emotions and show my emotions and I'd be okay. But he still wasn't sure about us. And I had spent three months waiting for him to decide. A few weeks ago a lightbulb went off -- I don't need to wait for him, to put my life on hold... for someone who might not be there for me. So I told him I was going to move out. We decided it was the right decision for both of us--to create some space. Lord knows the tiny apartment wasn't doing our relationship any favors. I overcompensated and found a three bedroom. (It's fucking awesome, but expensive!) I moved out within a week. The night before the move, he said ""I think we should break up."" I said ""okay."" We cried. The next day he helped me move. Is this what being broken up feels like? Everything was the same as it was. The next day, same thing... broken up but acting the same. After a few days of this, I figured I was never going to heal, and went ""no contact."" It was... really fucking hard. A week after the breakup, we met to exchange some things that had been left/accidentally came with me. As I walked up to the door, I wondered what it would be like. I told myself to be strong, not cry. Is he sad too? Does he miss me? What will-- He opened the door: ""Heyyy! How's it going?!"" With a big smile and I LOST it. I fell onto the couch sobbing. Once I gained my composure, he told me he hasn't been sad because he's been ""getting back to his baseline."" He's been doing all his hobbies like playing music, reading, video games... whatever. Meanwhile, I'm starting at a new apartment from scratch. Paying more than 2x my old rent, starting a new (longer) commute, still working 8:30-5:30, fighting with Verizon to get service (they sent a tech to the old address and couldn't change the service call), trying to find salt at the Indian grocery stores, needing to buy trash cans and a shower curtain... fuck you and your ""baseline,"" I can't get my new mattress up the stairs! Meanwhile he has the gall to tell me ""Let's revisit this towards the end of the month. I've been thinking about how it might not be easy to meet someone else with your good qualities."" Damn right you won't. I allowed you to let the cockroach LIVING IN OUR BATHROOM live, even though I'm allergic to them, because you thought it was cute. Any other woman would laugh her ass off, call you crazy, and leave. Meanwhile, he says he think the ""emotional distance"" we've been keeping (low contact) is healthy for him. Great, good for you. I tried to keep it together, but I wasn't feeling angry yet. I missed him. He was there for me when I started to work on myself, to deal with my past and my feelings, and when I really started to do the work... he abandoned me. I felt so alone and so helpless. On Wednesday I broke. I texted him. I said I'm not doing well. He asked if it's an emergency. I said no... He said let's keep the emotional distance. I said sorry. He said ""No harm done! :)"" Fuck. That. I am done. I am over it. He betrayed me. He gave up on me when I needed him the most, after promising me he'd be there for me. Because of him, I turned away from anger in favor of compassion, vulnerability, and all those ""gentle emotions."" Today I am angry. And it feels good. Finally I feel in control. He's going to dangle that carrot in front of me, saying ""maybe we can get back together."" Well maybe I don't want to! I am sorry I hurt him in the past. But that's no excuse for the way he's treating me now. We made a commitment to work through things like this. He told me he loved me and wanted to get married and have kids. I thought I'd found ""the one."" He's got some real growing up to do too. I deserve better than someone who kicks me when I'm down, even inadvertently. I don't need to change for anyone else but myself. I'm going to start living my best life without him. I can't wait for him to meet some other girls (he's never been in a long term relationship before!) and realize what he lost by leaving me. It might take a few years, but he's going to regret it. And I won't even be laughing, because I won't care at all anymore. But boy does it feel good to be angry right now."

I am not sure how effective in mending ones heart these methods actually are. Some of these seem to be installed into our heads by the massive break up industry that is feasting on someones state of emotional vulnerability. So what do you think? Which things that are traditionally presented within the every-girl-moving-on-pack make you cringe and smell of exploitative emotional manipulation? "
169,vulnerability,BreakUps,A Frusturated last love letter. I hope you receive this.,3,b4bu1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/b4bu1n/a_frusturated_last_love_letter_i_hope_you_receive/,2019-03-23 10:06:13,"Thesis statement: I've always and will always love and be in love with you. The date as I write this is 03/13/19 and the time is 4:25am in the morning. To you, Im sorry for strangling you with my true love. Im sorry when I love you unconditionally even after you wanted me to stay away and move on. Im sorry if my care appeared as pestering. Im sorry if my love appeared as torture. Im sorry if not moving on appeared as my weakness. Im sorry if not letting you go, appeared as stubbornness. Im sorry if I have ever made you fear by showing my vulnerability. Im sorry if I have ever made you freak out by showing my endless love Im sorry if everything appeared to you as Whiny. Im sorry if everyone misled you that I whined when I was probably trying to be understood. Im sorry if my intentions of wanting to be understood appeared as clingy. Im really sorry. It was all because I truly love you unconditionally. Even after you broke my heart a million times, those million pieces still love you to the truest if its senses. Because that is what love is all about. UNCONDITIONAL You never heal completely from breaking up with your true love especially if you still love them and they were the one who initiated the breakup and left. You will only learn to live with that pain with time. The heart always wants what it wants. The problem is to silence the mind. When someone wants you, almost nothing can deter them. They will find every reason to be with you, in spite of possibly red flags. Now when they no longer want you, they will again find every reason why its not gonna work outbecause they dont want to work it out and its more convenient for them at the time. I'm sorry. I can't share the intimate moments we had together and pretend that nothing happened between us. The concept of time won't heal, and the concept of soulmates and finding the right ones do not exist. I am doing this for the same respect for myself. I loved you with all of my heart and soul. Nonetheless, the silence and indifference between us does not heal anything. Nor does getting away from you. So I wouldn't mind keeping in touch. Overall, it would be wrong to call each other friends. It isn't human to act cold and be indifferent towards what we had together. The social concept to pretend and wear a mask. To think that it would be okay to support the one you love and go through the pain, watching them fade, it doesn't heal the wounds. I know too much of you to only consider you as a friend. I can't dream moments of being with you or being haunted with the thoughts of my mind at night and just say you're my friend. It isn't fair to me. I can't let you deny my emotions and let you defend yourself and other interests. I truly love you. And I already am hurt. Again, only mature people know what they want. And if you only wanted to be my friend, then you would respect my boundaries. I unfollowed you not to see your profile. Then you made it public. As Matt puts it. I don't have time to waste on petty behavior. Nor do I have to care about the choices you make and the mistakes you make any longer. You can hold onto my mistakes. But I'm moving on from yours and I wish you the best. I just hope one day you can see this message as a whole and understand the love and in love you've moved on from. From your secrets and hiding of other people, truly, I wouldn't want to befriend someone like you. You're kind hearted but as a person you need to grow. It is wrong for you to confess on how much you love your family and yet lie to them at face value and be unmoved from the sacrifices and time commitment they gave. And it would be the same way you treat me now. I'm thankful for you being in my life. You increased my knowledge in pain. And taught me that no matter how much you love a person, someone can still treat you before a person. That maturity is knowing what you want. That it means to accept the choices you make. That the grass is greener and the grass is grass. You will have your fair share of mistakes. Words are nothing more but words. Loyalty is what one should strive for. That I can learn to love and give love and know love. That love isn't more than just a feeling of intensity or hormones. It's committing and fighting and opening yourself to vunerability. No matter if you forgot the events we spent together or the mistakes we both made. I don't. As an honest reflection. Your memory is not accurate, and even then, I would be concerned with your compulsive habits and the consequences it would make on you. Watching you contradict what you say, it is painful. Take this as wisdom. Because even I don't admit I'm an adult, but Magellan, you're not an adult. You're far from it. If you spend time being out till 9pm-11pm and you're demanding freedom or longer curfew hours. That's called being entitled. If you complain about scholarship money and money for University but will spend money on a vacation over the summer. You're not thinking of the future. And if you can't differentiate being confident with your own body with compensation for how you look. You're wrongly misguided. As Matt puts it: All I wanted to teach you was inner-peace. Because if you can't accept the struggle or the evaluation of what I gave you. I'm sorry that these words hurt. But it's an honest review. I wouldn't want to lie to you and let you crash and burn. If you can't enjoy the smallest things in life and don't realize your privilege, down the road you might do more ""soul-searching"" and find yourself empty. Happiness doesn't come from the activities you do. It doesn't come from the people you hangout with. It doesn't come from the people you date. It comes from you. Inside of you. You can say you're wired to be a different person. But truth is, that is only another excuse. I've moved so much that even Matt gets it. Athens gets it. That I want some stability in my life. I can enjoy sitting in a library with you and still be happy. You can break my heart and be cruel to me, or delusional and say that you gave me the opportunity to grow up. No Magellen, you didn't. You gave me the opportunity to be in pain, and I took it for you and I used it to grow up. What you said to me that day. ""That now take this opportunity to fix your relationships."" That is egotistical. That's a superior complex. You didn't give me shit. It doesn't compare. And I don't want to compare but truth is. It's not the same amount. I don't even have to tell you and you know I love you. And you can trust that love because I never lied nor cheated you. And when you felt I did. I did my best. I returned to you. And you didn't have to tell me. I made the limitations to seeing Tiffany naturally. I stopped contact with Cait. I stopped mentioning Jessica for some time. But you? You couldn't handle the problem alone. You fell in love with me, and the tension rose once more. And you fell in love with someone else over time it's natural. But then you had to lie to me, and ask me for advice, on what YOU SHOULD DO. Then you potrayed it as ""G, I sacrificed this for you"" no, Magellan If you loved me, it wouldn't be seen as a sacrifice. You would naturally know what to do. I did. I always thought about you first over the useless desires. I'm sorry I was insecure with you. That I wasn't whole with you in mind early in the relationship. I hurt you deeply. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, that my depression and my frusturation became more present. I was becoming more unhappy with how you saw yourself as a person and the energy it costed me. The people it costed me. I was unhappy. But Believe me when I wanted to fight for you. When I say I truly love you. That my love isn't just a chemical reaction in my brain. I'm sorry but I really loved you. I'm sorry that the conflict between our families were on and off. I tried to tell you these things. I did my best to be there and love you. Even when I wanted to leave I fought for you. And did my best to spark. The time at the lab. I needed space because I was committing and concerning myself with someone who promised to putting me to a priority, no longer was doing what they were saying. Call me immature for calling out people and their flaws. But I'm calling myself out in mine too. I wanted you to see that being late for work is not okay. That academic cockiness is insecurity. I was insecure of myself. I was bitter towards people who lied and didn't put in the effort. The world wasn't fair. But now, I finally accept. The world is balanced. Because down the line, those same people, are going to have to deal with life. With their bosses. With social expectations and the freedom they have, it's no longer going to be available. Even if you think it's a mistake. That does not erase the history that has happened. Nor would it even be a justified claim. You're right when you said that I'm the type of person you have to date after 4 years. Teachers say I have a lot of wisdom. Athens says I have a lot of wisdom. You say I have a lot of wisdom. Matt says I have a lot of wisdom. Your grandma, my family, etc. My dad said any girl who would marry me would be tremendously lucky. And I can see that now. It is your loss and it may be even so, mine. But your loss is and will be more greater. I may have lost and left a bit of me with you. But you can always see that it's love and it's wisdom. But you lost yourself, with or without me. You can say that time passes and we cool down. Passion does not die. Love does not die. Pain does not die. Only love can save us. But yet, you love the superficial things. By doing so, you were not able to love me fully. Anywho says that the relationship is broken and they can't revive it. That's not true. I agree we need time to separate. I need the time to focus academically. And you need the time and space to grow up. You don't prove me that you changed. You don't tell me that you changed. You just show it naturally. And what you were doing, even now. It wasn't right. Even Steve says that I should be positive and it seemed like I was overly committed to this. He was right. I realized today, I have a support system. It's with Steve, it's with Matt (Matt admits to being obnoxious and immature with what he says. He acknowledges as compulsion. But the fact he wanted to hear me express myself and understood every piece of advice I gave you. He's more mature than you think. But I digress) it's with Helena, it's with Abigail, it's with Roshie, Aron, Sebby. People who know what I did was right. Even when it was the time I cared about you. I really did. As both your ""friend"" and ex. I can't fathom telling you things and you not listening. I can talk about the party and how thankful you listened to me. And how the night before you were already putting in your desires before your partners. Before your parents. I thought I needed therapy. But no, I just needed someone to understand how much I gave to you. But Magellan sweetie. You need therapy. Smoking, drinking, doing drugs, those are bad apples. Lying and keeping secrets are traits of bad apples. And you can't even see it with the people you hangout with. You can say that it doesn't directly impact me. But the same way you saw my depression. It was killing you. Life is about living, yes? Going through hell and still smiling, yes? Then let me remind you, it isn't about the things you accomplished. Anyone can take things slow. Matthew understands that. Athena too. I don't need to work when I'm in highschool, or should be expected to drive. Those experiences aren't actually real life experiences. You can get your drivers and still crash. You can be great academically but fail as a person. Failing in practical stuff, failing in love, and relationships. My brother's first job wasn't in retail. It was a statistic analysis for a company. My sister got her driver's the same age. But continued practicing and wasn't eager to drink or drive. She did those things naturally. Life is slow. You want success? Take things slow. You think that you aren't using your parents' money, but Magellan, you're in retail. You're borrowing you're families money. And you're going to use or have used some of it. It doesn't make you independent for refusing help. It makes you stubborn. Mind you, there is healthy independence. Me taking a job, not because I need money, but I need to learn how to be independent once I'm in uni, when my parents are gone. That's healthy. That's natural. Me needing to drive because I need to. Not because I want to. That's healthy. Even you talk to Arnav, who is so sheltered. I was expecting you realized the discrepancy between you and us. Despite having strict and controlling parents. Look at our impulsive actions that we did. Compare your life mistakes with ours. Which one is more grave? Why do we have a better understanding of people's fuck ups. Why can I still be comfortable being alone? Because of who I am. I moved a lot. I learned a lot. I loved someone and I loved again. You can say you're an emotionally need person and you're touchy. No Magellan. You're weak. You're right, I have changed. I can handle my loneliness. I don't have to please any one. Validate myself on the internet. I've been following what the book said. And you? Again. You're 18 year old me, reminds me of a 7 year old me. That's why I undermine you as a child. You went through a lot too. And I can see you focused on being independent. But not emotionally independent. I'm not closing the doors, I'm not giving myself the faith to believe in you. But I will say. If you find yourself loving me and falling in love with me. Then, I will test if you're worthy for that love, in years time. I will wait for you, and at the same time improve myself. But meanwhile, I'll be moving on. I appreciate you wishing me happiness. But it's a bit ironic when the person who once was your happiness causes you pain and wishes you to be happy. I'm going through another sleepless night. And you can rob many more from me. And yes you broke up with me. But yet, the respect I have from people and I gave to you. Really shows, my patience and understanding, my commitment to you, wasn't in vain. Because people can see. And I know you're rolling your eyes, because I said Matt says I sound old. Many teachers have said I sound old. Many young adults would agree with what I'm saying to you before and what I'm saying to you now. But if you continue to roll your eyes. You're never going to see the message. And my final message to you, for now. It's ironic. Because the message hasn't changed. I've been saying to you like I always have. It's because you never understood my side. You always misinterpreted my love. As something whiny, insecure, demanding. But you're wrong. So fuck your G's, D's, Z's and any guy who wants to pursue you for a selfish and unloving reason. Because I wouldn't want you to be manipulated and fall into false promises. Trust me, they hurt. I loved you for you, Magellan. The kind and energetic person. The potential you had and you have on being a great person. A strong woman like you who learned to love your sisters and be obedient to your unkind mother (sometimes). I loved the desire to fall in love. The fact that you listened to me and ventilated to me about your problems. I loved helping you. I loved you thanking me. I loved when you looked back at every moment and felt how much I cared for you. I loved when you fought for me as hard back then. I love you despite breaking my heart and toying with me. I loved watching you be in your journey to rediscovery. (But you need to seriously understand yourself.) I loved how you respected my family and me. I loved how much you wanted to give and the excitement that came from you. The adventurous side. The virtue of unconditional giving. I loved every moment we spent. From just sitting at the fields at ND to the rec room. To eating in downtown. From the time we spent at Nosehill. From the time we watched a movie. I loved how you wanted to share those little moments together. Even the thought to get rings. I loved watched the innocent and loving girlfriend, love me. I loved the little cinnamon, and the Lavamug codes. The thought of keeping a folder and picture of us. You sending me an email. You being an adult and admitting to your mistakes. It showed me growth and still genuine you. The times you supported me. Thank you. I love you as a person. And I love your physical body, the way it is. You never needed make up. Nor did you have to work out. You never needed to dress too much for me. You were enough in those senses. But as a person. I can't love someone who puts themselves before me. And isn't willing to reciprocate my love. I won't stop loving you. I won't stop doing the things that I would do for you, like making cards and advising you. I will wait but I will not expect. That's the difference. You are my ex, and I don't regret having you. But I wished that one day you will come to terms with how I feel. Love, G P.S If I could add on to my letter I would mention how you gave me the respect of a 12 year old. You shared my private information and would screenshot our arguments meanwhile withholding the context of the things you said/did prior to those incidents. And how you expect me to be the bigger person and say that I'm harassing you, that's fucked up. Also slightly modified the names because privacy. Still respectful and mature to give you some privacy. :) "

I hate the mean spirited, spiteful person I have become because you broke my heart. I know that it was for the best that we ended things, and that really I have no reason to hate you, but I just do right now. I hate that you act like everything is fine, I hate that you can laugh with your friends, I hate that you ignore me even though I act the same way. I hate how only a few weeks ago you said you loved me, and in a day it was over. Everything I poured into you, all the love and support I gave you, all the confidence I helped you find in yourself. Was that all I was to you? An ego stroke? You finally got someone who actually loved you, unlike your toxic mess of your last relationship. I hate how much I loved you and how quickly that love is turning to hate within me. I want to take every piece of vulnerability that you gave me and throw it at you like a spear. I want to take all the self esteem you built off of my love and tear it to spreads. I want to do what your ex did to you. I want to take your biggest insecurities and use them to hurt you. Because you hurt me more than I've ever been hurt before, and you act like everything is fine! Like your life is better without me, like everything we had meant nothing, and I was just a stupid child for letting myself fall in love. I want to use your vulnerabilities against you because then it would prove that I meant something to you, that we aren't just strangers like you're pretending we are. I know I cant give into these feelings. That when the anger is over I'll remember how good you were to me up to the very end. How you cried when we finally ended things because you knew it was right but you didn't want to say goodbye. I know that if I do any of the things my anger wants me to I will just feel worse and regret it immediately. I'm better than your ex, I loved you more than she ever did, and I refuse to ruin your memories of our good times by becoming vindictive. But God dammit I just want you to hurt as much as I do right now. I love you, but fuck you. -sincerely, the anger stage."

You didn't care, you turned every drop of vulnerability I wasted on you into a venomous guilt trip. When you left me you told me it ""real talk dude, it's way to early for you to expect me to be your rock"". My rock, you treated me like a platonic enemy who annoys the shit out of you any time we weren't in the same room. You're a coward, you're petulant, you possess all the depth of an empty puddle. Every time you ever claimed you loved me was just a twist of the knife which I gave you the benefit of the doubt and believed you hadn't stuck in me. You're vicious, but in the most passive way I can imagine, it's really quite impressive how your use of stonewalling coupled with words that claim the opposite can sting so badly. The abused really does become the abuser. You will deserve the pain you get when you find someone who you feel for like I felt for you and they sideline you and minimize you the way you did to me. There won't be enough winged eyeliner and reuben ""sangwiches"" or memes in the world to comfort you, and then maybe you'll see what you did. I hope someone starves you the way you starved me some day, and I hope hope you come crawling back so I can string you along the way you did to me. Nothing would bring me more joy."

This is not a guess, we've talked about it, she sees a therapist etc... Things started to get serious and she ran. Everything about the way she broke up with me and the way she came to that decision was cowardly and more painful for me than it had to be. I'm torn. I'm super angry at her, but I don't know if she's an asshole or if she did the best she could, but reacted the way she did due to some deep seeded issues. She's always had a good heart - unless I'm wrong about that and she's finally showing me her true colors. It sucks because the way I think about her and the way I want to treat her, after we both have some time, highly depends on this, and it's hard to get closure in my own mind when I don't know if she just didn't care or if she struggled and did what she could but wasn't able to be mature and take my feelings into consideration."
174,vulnerability,BreakUps,"You cannot love too much, you can only love the wrong person",1,apw5wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/apw5wa/you_cannot_love_too_much_you_can_only_love_the/,2019-02-13 05:01:13,"A transcript of Miles Carter's wise words in his video ""too sensitive"" that everyone should bare in mind: &amp;#x200B; Its rare that people will admit to hurting you. Instead, they will frame you as being wrong, convincing themselves that you are toxic in order to alleviate their own guilt. And if you have been kind to them, having little to pull from, they will have no option but to turn your better qualities against you. Your passion will be newly regarded as *overwhelming*. Your concern will be *possessiveness*. Your kindness will be *naivety* and your love will be *too much* but in regard to emotion, **there is no such thing as too much**. You cannot love too much, you can only **love the wrong person**. The more in tune you are with your emotions is the more human you will be. We werent given feelings to hide them away and numb ourselves. **We were made to feel**. Its how we interact with everything around us. Its how we remind ourselves were alive. So I resent the idea of being too sensitive. Because in a world continually growing colder, people will try to rob you of your warmth. But we need vulnerability. We need people who embrace their own feelings and recognize the weight of them, so we can begin to see validity in the feelings of others. I resent the idea that I need to change, to harden myself in order to survive in this world. Maybe the world is what needs changing. We try to convince ourselves that our minds set precedence over the things we feel, as if we can turn off our emotions function off logic alone - we always lose. Because **we are not machines, we are human beings**. And what sets us apart from an assortment of codes and numbers, is our ability to find balance between logic and intuition. So I will not change. I will be too sensitive. And because **you cant find it within yourself to appreciate me, doesnt mean Ive lost my worth**. &amp;#x200B; [URL"

I was the one who gave up because our love is forbidden (were gay). I realized I will not be able to give him the love he wants because Im so scared. I wasnt able to introduce him to my friends which made him sad. So yeah I dumped him for his own happiness. But I didnt told him that was the reason. I told him that I want to live a normal life. Its really hard. I distracted myself by focusing on my career and playing games. I eventually forgot about him. I was doing fine. Until lately. We had a reunion with our circle of friends (he was there also). I got really drunk and sleepy. Then suddenly, he went to my bed and hugged me. Thats when it all came back to me. I bursted into tears. We talked and had a closure. I told him I lied about how I want to live a normal life and he said he is very proud of me for being brave and showing my vulnerability. I hugged and kissed him. However, he mentioned that things are different now. He is dating someone else. And I felt so bad on what I did so I went away and slept. We ended up being friends after it. Im happy about it because I was able to see him atleast. But I was wrong. Recently, he invited us to a party. And after it he told us he will be sleeping together with his special someone and I got really sad and cried myself to tears. I dont know why I still have these emotions. Its been 3 years already so why am I jealous. I took a break from social media (thats why Im here) so I can help myself to move on. However Im still lost and hurting. How can I really move on with this? I love him so much. "

178,vulnerability,BreakUps,Lessons Learned from a Breakup,89,avfjtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/avfjtw/lessons_learned_from_a_breakup/,2019-02-28 03:50:35,"Well as a late-20's guy who recently was ghosted, then dumped as I failed to ""win"" my sort-of-ex back, I've created a list of things I've learned through my 10,000,000 hours of over-thinking (also through the 10 relationship books I've now read and over 100 hours of podcasts.) Situation is that a woman was deeply into me and I couldn't maintain that feeling from her over 3 months due to doing literally everything wrong that you could possibly do. God bless her for sticking around that long... Not sure if this is appropriate for this thread but I hope it helps some guy/girl out there in a relationship or recently getting out of one. Please keep in mind this comes from someone who has never been in a serious relationship before (of more than 2 months), had severe commitment issues, an intense lack of vulnerability, and used to be an anxious person, as well as depressed due to other life factors. Much of this is common sense and hence why I am so crushed at my inability to react well. This is not meant to make anyone feel bad, but to simply to learn from a super perfectionist man that is beating himself up on the reg. Sometimes WE were the issue and need to accept the role WE played. It's a bit repetitive, just enjoy. 1. Dont let outside influences cloud your emotions or desires. Commit early, even if you are unsure! You only regret the chances you did not take - Soulmates do not find each-other, they are created through time &amp; dedication.. 1. Group expectations (such as your friends, clubs you are in, parents) dont meet and shouldnt meet your own desires. Don't let your friends tell you that he/she doesn't have XYZ qualities and is not good enough. Perfection is impossible, unattainable and imperfection is so much more special. External values of the social stream DO NOT MATCH YOURS. No matter the person. 2. Be there.. when someone reaches out with a non loving response aka a cry for help. If they say I feel bad or I have been crying, don't just text - call them up ASAP, make a time to meet and LISTEN. Send a few puppy GIFs too. 3. Dont react.. with a non loving response. Help the person prioritise their emotions and ask how they feel and what could change when they are down, but most importantly JUST LISTEN. OFFER YOUR EAR AND A LOVING TOUCH. 1. ""So you feel Depressed because of XYZ, but is that true that it impacts ABC in your life? How about we do something fun to get your mind off of this"" 4. Surprises - a date, a gift, a phone call, etc. Anything. To show you care and to build something stronger than physical connection. 5. Follow through.. on passing by comments. Hey we should go do Salsa sometime, hey we should go play bocce, let's make a pizza. Well get that in the iCal and BOOK IT. 6. Dont count the hours for texting.. EVER... just be there when you need to be there and when there is time. NO GAMES. 7. Call more often or send voice notes.. be personal and show your personality. Texting sucks and you cannot show personality. Call at least once a week, no matter how close or far you both live. 8. Have an opinion and share it, dont be switching your political, personal views to appease. Being a strong willed person is attractive. Opposite wills can still work and necessary for a relationship. 9. Communicate how you want to communicate (use extra yyyys, double/ triple text, send that eggplant emoji, whatever), be a lover, and fail often due to your nurtured adolescence and if the expectation is different then ask how-to-improve. SAY UP FRONT - ""hey I havent done this dating thing often"" or ""I tend to seem distant but I like you and I want to be here for you, just tell me when something bothers you in the slightest."" 10. Think critically about their problems - ask WHAT he/shes feeling, WHY it Feels wrong, HOW to help. Dont tell him/her how to feel (aka saying to look on the bright side), dont tell him/her its wrong to feel that way, and dont ask him/her to help him/herself. BE THERE. LISTEN. RESPOND. HUG. KISS. 11. Take photos / make memories to remember. 12. Invite him/her to meet your friends, family, goldfish whatever so he/she sees youre interested. Usually 1-2 months after starting. 13. Ask questions when asked a question - QUALITY QUESTIONS - WHO / WHAT / WHEN / WHERE / WHY - ASK QUESTIONS - DONT BE A MIRROR ON THE WALL. 14. LISTEN and ASK for details when a story is shared or a situation is mentioned. GIVE MORE DETAILS when you share. Get a photo, ask for detail! LOOK for details in the photo! 15. SHARE a situation youre in daily, and why its funny or why they should be there. Maybe the loo roll is out, maybe you have mis-matching socks, maybe you just had your barmitzvah - whatever, share it. 16. If you cannot meet due to an illness, why not still give some time and deliver some love in the form of food or a small gift. Go to his/her flat. Bring soup, a teddy, a stripper, whatever just BE THERE. 17. Ask HOW ARE YOU / HOW WAS YOUR DAY / HOW ARE YOU FEELING - 3 words mean so much. EVERY SINGLE DAY. 18. GET mini cheap GIFTS LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT. 19. Text more than twice a day, hell however much you want. WHEN YOU FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL NO COUNTING. 20. Dont be afraid to fall in LOVE. When you feel you miss them, say it! 21. Say what you feel when you feel it - ""I like you, I feel anxious, I feel anger, I feel XYZ because of ABC and I wish EFG."" 22. Send a voice note if you cannot text. Send a photo. Send pigeon-mail. We are so technologically bombarded that we forget the way we chat on Instagram comments are not how we should text. 23. Say they are beautiful, gorgeous, stunning, drop dead, one in a million - compliment always, always, daily, daily, daily. DON'T FILTER YOURSELF. 24. Be more conscientious - PLAN AHEAD, less spontaneity overall - because it breeds insecurity in a relationship. plan for 1 week ahead, hell even 1 or 2 month ahead. Get that shit in the calendar when its mentioned on the date. 25. Seeing someone more than once a week is NORMAL. See them when and where and how often you want, if they don't want to meet you, then they aren't into you. 26. Is he/she feeling sick / stressed / overworked / overwhelmed ? Tell them to take a night off, find him/her and cook for them, give a massage, whatever. 27. Terms of endearment - notice them and use them - honey, sweetie, babe, pudding, sweet thing, peach pie, sugar lips. If one person says it, always return it. 28. Conflict resolution - BE OPEN TO FIGHTING AND ACTUALLY OPENING CONFLICT. If you sense an issue, bring it up. Don't let things simmer. No text for a few days, then ask what is up. 29. TAKE TIME for non-sexual things - Go to movie, go get a coffee, get a cooking class, workout, go for a walk. NEVER STOP DOING THE LITTLE THINGS you would do with normal friends. 30. Emotional bidding will make or break from relationship- Taken from ""a better man podcast"" People will share details, photos, stories, concerns about their lives looking for people to feel their emotions. Listen, respond and react, without just saying ""yeah, that house looks cool"" or ""wow that meal is tasty"" Say ""WE AND US"" - ""We should build a house like that someday, what's your favorite style house?"" ""Wow that meal is tasty, how about we try to cook that ourselves sometime next week"" 31. Taken from David Chapman's 5 Love Languages, these are 5 ways to show love overall through your actions to the person you adore. Many times we don't acknowledge people need to be shown affection in different ways to feel wanted and fulfilled. Men and Women, different cultures, want these things in a different way. If you want Different then BE Different in these categories. 1. Love language - words of affirmation (compliments, encouragements, humble requests). Send that morning/ night text, say hey beautiful, great work keeping focused on your life, or hey, I appreciate your expertise in XYZ, so can you help with my issue on ABC. 2. Love language - quality time (attentive quality talk at quality locations) - don't just have sex in your room and call it a date. Go on a bike ride, go axe-throwing, seashell collecting, it doesn't matter. 3. Love language - gifts (item or yourself) - get little things to show you remembered what they like. Remember these from conversations and write in your phone. Bring chocolates from a trip. Dress up your weiner in a bowtie, it doesn't matter, just that you attempted to surprise them. 4. Love language - acts of service - Do things like pick up the post, bring them food during lunch, anything. 5. Love language - physical touch (sex, holding hands, massage) - this is a given but extends past sex. Hand holding IN PUBLIC, eye-contact, etc. 32. Read his/her favourite book - you'll get to know who they are a bit better We are so used to accepting others rejection as a rejection of our prime self, but after losing my own sense of self, I realise I had plenty opportunities to save what I would call my first ever love.. but I never showed my true colors as I was so worried about being hurt. I'll never get the chance to show her how I've changed and I'm doing my best to look at this as the single grandest lesson in vulnerability. Sometimes the timing really isn't right - people are ready at different times, sometimes the words you could have said wouldn't have fixed things but at least if you put your emotions on the table in the first place, there could have been a chance, but moving forwards... the only way we can grow in our relationships and build LASTING connections is by being PRESENT, in the HERE, in the NOW. No past, no future. React &amp; Respond Confidently, Calmly. It takes two WHOLE people to make a relationship, that means two confident persons to build a third, beautiful thing. Fix your life, get your job, career, finances in order BEFORE you start dating OR at least start working on it while you see that special person. Appreciate things when they come because they could be gone soon &amp; always remember, we are human, we all make mistakes. &amp;#x200B; \---- sincerely, a very regretful dude. &amp;#x200B; P.S. For anyone going through something like me. Consider DAILY meditation, journalling, podcasts, and reading actual relationship books so you learn from this (once you stop sobbing, of course.) Remember to never spend a night alone, exhaust your contacts list until you speak to everyone from your city, across to micronesia."

It doesnt matter what I would have said to you, you would have never seen it any other way besides your own, in which you were the victim and I was the cruel, evil monster who was just out to break your heart, like you began to believe since the minute our exclusive relationship began. But I bet you still never imagined Id be the one to be done with you, especially after all of your conditioning. Id spent so much time being the bigger person while you played dirty that this time around, it felt good to be as low as you, just once. Tell me why you worked so hard to get me under you. The last few months before Id met you Id become so much more happy and independent. I was in a good job I loved, I was actively hanging out with friends, experiencing new things, and my dating life was out of this world. You were just a stop along the way, and quick one night stand. But that turned into friends with benefits, and then your sweet nothings and adorations made me believe that an exclusive relationship was a good idea. Literally two weeks after you told me you loved me for the first time, you told me we couldnt be exclusive anymore. Me saying that I loved you back was all the confirmation that you needed to know that you had me. But you retreated, saying that I cant be exclusive with you and except your lies at the same time. What lies? Oh, you believed without justifiable evidence that I was cheating and/or having an emotional affair with your roommate. If you believe this so strongly, I challenged you to break up with me, but you couldnt. You werent done draining me yet. I could never figure out how to love you. Whenever Id step back to let you heal from whatever it was that was plaguing you, youd love bomb me. Tell me how much you missed me, how much you thought about me and wanted to see me. When I came back in, like a moth to a flame, you burned me. I was the ocean reaching towards you with my waves and you stepped back, like a childish game, never letting your feet get wet. You asked for space, said I was suffocating you, told me not to text you for a couple days. Yet when I wouldnt answer your Snapchats for a few minutes or hours, youd demand I answer them. Youd call me two and three times demanding where I was and for photo proof I was where I said I was. Even with proof you never believed it. When I wasnt in your vicinity, you were were overbearing, and when I was, you were still policing me. You didnt want me to have any of my body exposed around your roommates. If they looked at me sexually, that would be my fault. This brought out a jealousy rage in your I could never understand. I only realized now that I was the codependent in our relationship. You piece by piece built me up to feel really good. You told me how pretty I was. You told me that I was perfect and that you adored all of my flaws. My gap teeth, acne scarred skin and my kinky hair, things Id always been teased for, was sexy.You loved my writing and inflated my ego to the point where it would take only a pinprick to deflate me. And thats what you did. Suddenly the compliments stopped. You never told me how pretty I was anymore. You ignored the things I did to appease you. You commented on my mannerisms and told me I was acting weird. You told me that people watching was promiscuous and wrong. You hinted that I should delete a smutty story I wrote even though only weeks ago you were gushing about it, telling me that I should get it published. You tried to get me to break relationships with friends by claiming they werent healthy without evidence or proof. Everything I did, it was wrong. I had to tiptoe around you to not wake the monster. Bit by bit I became under your control. The last night we were together, it was rock bottom. You threatened to break up with me if I didnt show you my phone. Id been trying to have power and control, but you stripped it from me. I relented and wondered why I was so weak. What was it that you were giving me? Nothing really. Certainly not emotional support. You accused me of being negative when only a month ago Id gotten my car towed, became behind on my expenses, had to quit the job I loved the most, and had a man I thought loved me tell me that he didnt as well as stop taking college classes. Of course I was negative. I was hurting. Especially considering the last time I tried to lean on your for emotional support, you told me I was failing on purpose because I just liked the drama. I clammed up. I couldnt depend on your for anything because as soon as I tried, you stepped back. Told me I was choking you. But you wanted my vulnerability as well, right, remember? You guilted me for not wanting to open up to you, saying you couldnt be serious with a girl who hid all of her problems. But once I let you in, you let me down. It was only when I told you how cold you were that you softened. You came out of the toilet and said, youre right. I do blame everything on you. Its because Im insecure about dating. I think you saw how close I was to leaving you behind and wanted to show me some weakness. You werent done draining me, still. I didnt feel pity for you though. Id endured weeks of being your little punching bag. Your doormat. The mouse to your cat. Something in my heart became hard and solid. But still Id tried once more at justifying your behavior towards me. I blamed it on your Adderall use. I figured your morbid jealousy was a side effect from it. When I pointed this out, you exploded on me. You accused me yet again of being petty and trying to bring you down. You accused me of trying to be superior to you. No, I just wanted you to start treating me better. I believed in us and thought that if you knew what was making you hurt me, youd stop and allow yourself to love me. Boy was I wrong. I told you I couldnt be with you. When I called to check on you the day after, you sounded so nonchalant. You still believed that me wanting better treatment was me being condescending. You accused me of being manipulative. I hung up the call in your face. I blocked you on everything. The river of love I had for you dried up so fast. Sure, I could have talked it out like an adult, but when have you acted like an adult in our relationship? I went down a rabbit hole and found books and research about couples like us. Where one is a narcissist and the other is codependent. Im Not going to blame the entire thing on you. I should have had a spine I could have ended it sooner, but I was desperate for the attention you supplied me with at the beginning of the relationship. Anyone could have told me that wasnt coming again. You knew it wasnt coming, but I was fueling your ego, which you loved, being as insecure as me. You kept me around. The second I told you that I was done, you were done as well. I was dead to you, and your tone all but told me that. Then thats when it hit me. You never loved me. Maybe I still have to grieve, but I dont miss you. The idea of you disgust me. Im so happy I know what it was that we were and what I can do now to prevent it from ever happening again. Im going to work on my codependency. Im going to learn about setting boundaries and regaining my independence in relationships. I dont know or care what youre going to do, but I fear the next girl you get your hands on. Were both addicts, really. I was addicted to you, and you were addicted to the attention I gave you. Now that Im gone, youre going to go find a new supplier. But this time, the idea of you being with someone else doesnt hurt me. This tunnel is dark, but theres a light at the end. Im not afraid this time around of my own emotions. Im going to keep walking. This isnt the end of me. Honestly, you gave me the best advice I could have ever received. You gave me the advice I used to leave you. Stop making choices youre just going to complain about later. Thanks for that. "

The short version of the story is: she met me while still ""seeing' her ex but claims they weren't. We were on for a couple months then off for a week to a month, then back on, and so on. She saw me when it was convenient for her (mostly) and would pull away or shut down when I showed vulnerability or tried to get closer to her, the funny thing is that despite her saying that she's never felt so close to someone I felt pretty alienated/ignored. Along with this weird purgatory that I found myself in I noticed: communication was generally poor, she would go silent for days or weeks at a time, disappearing on surprise vacations with her ex or other dudes, any talk regarding bettering the relationship via better communication or moving things forward were shut down or ignored, and anything I pointed out of the aforementioned things were made my problem. On the emotional side of things it was mostly a happy-go-lucky time punctuated with moments of deep anger/depression or sudden bursting into tears on both our parts. I have to admit I don't have a track record of having lengthy relationships but this seemed unreasonably turbulent. The times she would say she was having a bad day or needed some emotional support it felt like a monumental task to ""just talk about it"". I'm not shy when it comes to speaking my mind or admitting my feelings so dealing with someone who was the polar opposite was frustrating to say the least. I can't say I've met anyone more frustrating to deal with on this level than my mother. Maybe there's something to be said for that. What triggered a swift closing of the door on this relationship was a sudden outburst of ""Stop wasting my time!"" from me after yet another breakdown in communication between us. She pretty much vanished for months until I saw her coming around again in our usual hang-out spots. She of course acts like nothing happened and greets me with a cheerful ""Hi!"". She still stares at me and shows open body language towards me (if that means anything?) when we cross paths. I needed to write this out really to get the ideas out of my head, it felt cathartic. I'm honestly still confused and this person that I now view as one big nebulous question mark as I realize I barely know this person or their motivations and I'm unsettled at the idea of opening that door again."
181,vulnerability,BreakUps,DPDR From the Breakup; Help?,1,aynu7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/aynu7d/dpdr_from_the_breakup_help/,2019-03-08 19:11:33,"Hey y'all. So I was broken up with in May of last year (2018). It had come after roughly three and a half months of intense intimacy and raw openness and honesty and vulnerability. It was on a level I had never experienced before (and I'm a serial dater), and wanted to experience forevermore. I really thought I was going to marry this man, in due time. And he made me think---and acted as such SO explicitly---that he felt the same way. The ending of the relationship took me out of reality because everything I had allowed myself to feel, all the safety and comfort I took in knowing that he wasn't going anywhere, was revealed to be a lie. As a result I felt detached from reality, like I couldn't reconcile that a lie had been my genuine reality for an entire semester. I buried the **moment** of the trauma *(the traumatic, climactic line I asked him to say if it was really true: ""I don't love you, I never loved you, and I can't ever see myself loving you."" he said it.)* underground in a hole and piled dirt on top of it with every passing day. Basically I tried to reconstruct a new outlook of my personal reality, because his unchanging presence had become so central to it. And it felt so fake for so long. And even to this day, to this very moment right now, actually, after I just finished listening to a podcast about a Chabad Rabbi's 10 year experience of sexual assault, I still feel waves of realization of the magnitude of his lie. And when that realization hits, however small, my reconstructed reality crumbles a little. &gt;*Example: the breakup happened right before the summer, so when we returned to school in september i drove to his off-campus house to return a shirt of his. he exited the house with a roommate as soon as i pulled up and began to walk away. i said, ""i have your shirt. can i return it?"" he took it and went inside without a word. i said, ""is this it?"" he said, ""you've given me no reason to think you can have a civil conversation."" i said, ""what the fuck? i gave you your space all summer."" he said, ""responding to old texts? that's pathetic."" (in the 2 weeks or so after the breakup I had sent him screenshots of all his most loving, visceral text messages, like a crazy person). his roommate stood on the sidewalk silently the whole time. flash-forward four months later, i see the friend at a party. i said hey to be friendly. i asked, ""do you still live with him at that off-campus house?"" he said, ""yeah, didn't i see you there the other night?"" i said, ""what? the other night? you mean at the beginning of the semester?"" and he said, ""yeah,"" in the same voice that you'd say, ""haha yeah good times man."" then he left the room. i was taken aback that he referred to that awful, embarrassing, heart-breaking encounter so nonchalantly.* **BASICALLY:** Put the sadness about the breakup itself aside for a second------I'm hella fucking embarrassed about how enthusiastically, naively, and vulnerably I believed his lies. I'm embarrassed that I believed him even though I had absolutely no way of knowing that it was a lie. I'm embarrassed about all the arguments I had with my family about the relationship, which they didn't welcome warmly for other unrelated reasons. I feel vulnerable about how much I opened up to him, like being stripped naked in front of a stranger. How do I recover from this sense of a broken reality? How do I reconcile my new present with his lies?"

It was August then, when the air was still thick with promise and trust, and Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"" brought us together, would later be our anthem. You mentioned fate and I felt it mid-May, when our souls slow-danced briefly as I threw my arms around your neck, like we knew each other all along because we cared with reckless, childish innocence, didn't know it until our realizations collided like two cars ardently rushing, not meaning to hurt the other. On crowded sidewalks of spring my face colored from the heat of your eyes. I couldn't escape your warmth and I still can't because I feel you in my sleep lying next to me, clasping my hand so we'd never part. I wish we'd lain like that when we met, instead of rushing flames to strip my body and burn the last remnants of what I thought love should be. I thought I said no, thought the implication was clear, but you couldn't see through lust's haze, mistook fear and discomfort with nervousness, and your crooked teeth barred my tongue from giving what sweetness I saved all my years for you, took it for granted as you kissed my neck the way feral animals find food in scarce winters -- with furious hunger rushed by uncertainty of the next time. My reticent heart still feels foolish for risking great vulnerability in your cavalier hands. **II.** Growing up wasn't supposed to feel empty, make you leave your body to cope as it happens to you. I thought it was passion, told myself so while covering the red and purple you left me, but it was self-serving, systematic, the way you herded me in and closed your bedroom's slaughterhouse door. I thought love was a deep knowing that life changed and shaped you to fit someone so perfectly, made you content like coming home after places you'd rather forget. I thought I was the hearth, but you warmed yourself with thoughts of burnt out flames and I grew cold. You said they left like smoke after fleeting fireworks, but their afterglow you basked in took my light and singed me, scorched the earth so nothing could grow to fruition. We didn't know you'd leave gaping wounds love couldn't mend, that the past of yours and ours would kill any good moment they touched. My heart broke into pieces of flint and I searched the pile for any fragments of tender times to desperately dash them against each other, strike sparks and set fire, like maybe I could weld this together into something whole again and love you painlessly; but an embittering rain fell when I saw you watched me wither and stitch myself into something smaller after your idealized times, still sharp in your mind, tore me apart. You could've saved us, quickly quieted my thoughts and smothered embers of doubt with truth's entirety; but pride hollowed your mouth to fill with excuses, blame, and lies, filled me with distrust, instead -- and that weighs heavier in my heart than your words themselves. No wonder forgiveness slowly limped along and died before reaching you. **III.** I once believed I wasted the best parts of myself, was emptied by others' callous carelessness; but a week with you I felt something, like each kiss mended hairline cracks the first day brought, like my mouth on your skin and hands on your body didn't know they were searching until I pulled away and swore I found what tasted like the rest of my life on your lips, swore I glimpsed your aged eyes looking at me like I was still the last and only to matter enough for a smile from you. We whispered ""I love you"" and they'll stay in the crooks of our necks for years, but your earnest hands could never lift what you likened an uphill boulder but was more like a cross because we were thick as thieves and died on that hill. On opposite sides of love we shouted our grievances until we speared our sides and spilled every reason this could still work, resurrected and repeated until there was more mercy in leaving each other nailed to a splintered dream that died as we bowed our heads and walked away saying it's finished. **IV.** You told me, ""It's like you never left"" after weekends together, and I know you didn't mean your apartment. I want to say, *""Honey, come home.* *I love you.* *I've left the lights of my heart on for you.""* I still close my eyes with the obscene hope that maybe if my lids could hold tighter than even we did my tears could blur the pain and love you gave into lasting forgiveness for future's sake. Loving in effigy is my worst fear, too, but we can't continue as broken horses yolked on a carousel spinning too erratically for us to stomach. &amp;#x200B; **V.** &amp;#x200B; This bridge turned to ash but underneath we're still kissing until we pull away with the admission that we gave more to a fire that changed us to cinder as we ran on empty.

He came into my life like a breath of fresh air. He consoled me, catered to me, touched a apart of me that I had buried a year ago. I swore I'd never love again or let anyone near my heart. I had all my guards up. I am that girl who doesn't give anyone a chance. Guys don't scare me. But he insisted in the pursuit. That he was gonna prove me wrong that not all guys were assholes. I was blocking everything as much as i could but my shield finally melted...cus i am human...and i let myself dream again... He'd pinch my cheek and embrace me as if he could protect me somehow. He would say and do sweet things. Our Chemistry was electric as were our sweet kisses. He was respectful and never pushed my boundaries. I would look into his eyes and believe that i saw someone i could trust. We'd sing songs together and laugh with one another. He'd call me on his break at work to see how my day was. He was gorgeous, intelligent, hard working, family oriented, out going, charming, good dancer, the guy next door i guess you could say... In reality he is this monster who took advantage of my vulnerability. He played my heart strings like a violin and had me envisioning a future together. He would send me all kinds of lovey dovey songs that i absolutely loved. Send me selfies every morning with his charming grin on his face. He'd let me know that he had dreamt of me last night. Just the other day he sent me a video of a rainbow with one of our favorite songs playing in the background. He would check in on me all the time. He was one of the sweetest monsters i ever met and I can't fucking believe it. I cant fucking believe i fell for the whole fucking thing. its horrible. IT hurts me to my core. I want to recoil inside myself and disappear for a while. I am in utter disbelief. It was all for the chase...it was all just to get into my pants. to persuade me into letting him get close to me and let my guard down...and it worked... I am left as a shell of myself, with a broken dream, an aching heart...and a violent hate towards this manipulative piece of shit. I really can't believe a guy is capable of sucha thing. Ladies, even with all the right actions....he can still be a monster....who can steal your heart in the night without you seeing it coming and walk away from you like it's no body's business. Do as much as you can to protect your sacred heart. It's your jewel, you're fire. I will let Karma set him Free. Kudos to the broken hearted....."

I know that was good advice and, but I couldn't take it. After a month of being a part and not seeing each other, we had to do it. There was so much left unsaid. This was a short (10 months) but passionate relationship. There was talk of a future with marriage, family, lives together. It all came apart, however. I won't rehash the story of our relationship, but despite the love we have for each other, it was healthier a part from one another. That being said, I had to see her to get the closure I needed. It seems she did as well. I went over to her place last night. We sat and talked. Talked about where things went wrong, how we could have been better for each other. We discussed how we couldn't meet each others wants or needs, that we both loved each other how we wanted to give live but not how the other wanted to receive it. We reminisced too. We spoke about the good times and laughed. I kissed her. She kissed me back. We sat on the couch for hours in one another's arms. We kissed, we cried, and we hugged and said one of the hardest goodbyes of our lives. Although this was one of the most romantically tragic events of my life, I feel so much better. What I saw in her last night was sadness, remorse, brokenness. She was vulnerable. Vulnerability was something she struggled with in our relationship. Although it finally came at the end of our relationship, it felt really good to see her in that state. Not a state of sadness, but one of real true love. I'm happy that our relationship was one of love. Despite us not working out, we left ourselves in a better position than we were 3 weeks ago after a sudden break up. I feel like I received closure. I'm happier knowing this hasn't been a breeze for her and I feel better knowing we both have love in our hearts for one another. "

Whether it's navigating my highly stressful job, living in a place where traffic and the cost of living is outrageous, dealing with health issues of my own and a recent death in my family or just bad luck (car totaled by uninsured driver, personal items stolen and vandalized), the hits just seem to keep coming and coming. Over the past few months, my long-term boyfriend has been going through a lot of anger and depression. We've been arguing a lot, as he has his own issues and finds it difficult to handle those as well as mine. To make matters worse, we are in our late 20s/early 30s and there is pressure to move in together, settle down and start a family. It is clear that neither of us are in a place to even discuss the future but the peer pressure and comments from other people certainly do not help. We had a huge fight this weekend and he basically told me that we should consider breaking up. I fought tooth and nail against this because as difficult as the relationship has been, it's been one of the few consistent things in my life and I'm really terrified to think how I'd be able to handle everything else going on without my ""rock."" Despite his flaws, I care about him deeply. What we agreed to is not a breakup but something of a break--a time period to focus not on being boyfriend and girlfriend but on being comfortable with ourselves first. I told him that it was unfair of me to pressure him into a commitment. We have a close friend that gave into his girlfriend's demands for marriage and now they have a baby and are completely and utterly miserable with each other. Neither of us wants to ""bitch"" the other one into seeing the world their way. But at the same time, my boyfriend does not promise that things will work out. He tells me that if our relationship is going to survive, it needs to between two independent people with their own sense of self-worth, and not done because one person is desperate and the other is trying to avoid hurting them. We are still in communication and he has been very supportive. The anger and depression has lessened but he also seems a little removed, as if he is trying to see me as a friend instead of a lover right now. It's all a little scary but at the same time, the anger and depression was just as scary if not worse. As bad as things were recently, I just feel terrified. I find myself breaking down at work and crying in my car for relief. The thought of losing him is so hard to comprehend and yet I do not want to show too much vulnerability, as it will probably signal to him that I am needy, which will push him away further. It is just so difficult to pick yourself up sometimes. &amp;#x200B;"
187,vulnerability,BreakUps,How do I give up hope?,1,a5hgxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a5hgxn/how_do_i_give_up_hope/,2018-12-12 22:51:54,"It's been a month and a half since we broke up. Over three weeks since she moved out, which is when it really hit me - that this is really happening, and letting her just leave is a massive mistake. Since then we've had little contact, but she agreed to meet up and talk two weeks ago. Wherein I told her how much of a mistake I made, where I went wrong, and that I really think things could work if she gave it another chance. That's really minimizing what was a 6 hour conversation, which was so emotional and honest and vulnerable on both of our parts. She left it open-ended, saying she needed to think about it. I felt that there was definite hope for reconciliation, while being honest with myself that there is a very probable chance that it will be a no, or that I may just never hear from her again. I gave her space and waited to hear from her, but there was almost nothing but silence for over two weeks. I was simultaneously holding onto the relationship while accepting that it was probably over. The waiting and the anxiety and the over-thinking over this time was becoming too much to bear; it was seriously disrupting my life. So yesterday I reached out. I started with a casual, light conversation - just catching up and joking around. After a few hours of that going well, I asked her to meet up to talk about working things out and she agreed. It seemed like it was going so well, but perhaps it was wishful thinking. I told her how I felt with complete honesty and vulnerability and how much I've been discovering about myself lately, and to just consider giving it another shot, starting from scratch and taking it slow. She seemed receptive, and I felt a wave of relief. The night continued, we spent a few hours talking and laughing and having fun, and it was just nice. Like old friends catching up, and I felt so content with her there. But as the night was coming to an end, I pushed a little too hard for an answer. I knew it wasn't right to put her on the spot, that I should have left our time be what it was and given her more time and space to think, but I knew I just couldn't wait around on a ""maybe"" any longer. And my worst fears were realized as she told me ""I don't think we can give it another chance."" I asked her if she was certain, and she looked me in the eyes and said ""I'm certain."" You could have seen the heartbreak on my face from miles away. I felt devastated, but at the same time, I finally had some sort of closure. I no longer could have hope - I heard it from her directly. And the hope was holding me back from moving on, or at least starting the process. But it's been 7 or 8 hours since I left her new place, and I've laying in bed all night without a second of sleep. And I still have this feeling of hope that I can't shake. That maybe she isn't ready right now, that she wants time to be single and independent and work on things and discover herself. And that maybe I'll hear from her again and she'll have a change of heart - be it a few weeks, a few months, or even years down the road. I know that I can't hold onto this hope if I want to move on, yet I can't stop myself from feeling this way. I just don't want my future to not include her, but I don't think I would ever be able to be ""friends"". I just feel too strongly about her, and would always be wanting something more. How do I give up this hope? Thanks for reading if you made it this far. I didn't intend for this to be so long, but the writing ended up being cathartic, and I needed something to help fill the time that this lack of sleep is giving me. TL;DR - Desperately want ex back since breakup, and gave myself false hope in talking to her about making things right. She finally told me that there was ""no chance at all"", and yet I'm still holding on to lingering hope that she may come back, even if it's a long time down the line. I feel like I can't move on until I give up all hope."

TL:DR, I need to make a decision and stick with it and need help seeing the forest through the trees. I was doing ""ok""... I have a friend who's an ex, who I've put on a pedestal. We dated decades ago, she cheated, we broke up and went our separate ways. She contacted me again after a decade apart, with no contact in those 10 years, out of the blue. She was married, it was a bad relationship and it felt like the old saying, that if you let someone go, and they come back, it was meant to be. She put everything out there, made herself vulnerable and it was magic, initially. It felt like we always belonged, so we made every effort to be together. It was too fast, very messy and it broke us even more in the end. So, we broke up again. She was cheating on me then too. She re-married afterwards and that relationship was (technically, still is) bad also. We stayed friends. I know that she can be toxic to people she gets close to. She's an amazing person, except the people that get too close. She can be extremely passive-aggressive and it's difficult to be exposed to that for too long. For instance, I spent a full day making her a birthday gift I thought she'd be over the moon about. She criticized it, said it wasn't what she expected and said I didn't do it right. That pissed me off and we had a big fight, to the point I was sleeping on the couch that night. I went to the bathroom, came back to my relegated place on the couch, and sitting on my pillow was the gift I gave her. It stung even more. It felt to me that she gave it back, and my mind assumed she didn't want it. Ouch. I reacted and reacted WAY over the top. I tore it to pieces and threw it in the bedroom. All of the thought and effort that went into it, disintegrated in seconds. That turned the original fight into an even more catastrophic situation. In the end, she said she ""gave it back to me so I could do it correctly"". I ended up apologizing for my apparent blunder, slept on the couch with my tail between my legs, because I gave everything away the second I reacted and ripped it apart. That is one example of how things worked in our relationship. She did/said something that upset me, I reacted and ended up being the bad guy no matter what. We could no longer discuss the original reason I was mad, it was only about the fact I reacted. Please, don't get me wrong. I am taking responsibility for my reaction. I've apologized numerous times and spent years in therapy working on how I react to things. I understand now, that everyone has the right to feel whatever they feel, be mad, happy, sad, whatever. I also understand though, that your feelings don't give you permission to react however you want, and giving someone else control over your actions through your emotions is damaging to everyone around you, including yourself. I also understand that some people are extremely adapt at manipulating the context of a situation to maintain they are never at fault. So, here I am. We've kept in contact and maintain a semblance of a relationship. It's off and on again to some extent, between our individual life choices and commitments, we really don't fit together right now outside of brief moments. We have something in those moments that I couldn't explain if I tried, but it's very important to me. It's just that they aren't enough to be whole. It's ""what we have"", as she likes to say. She has something relatively big coming up, on top of normal life and the stress of all that, it's probably a lot for her. I'm not in a place I can really help, outside of letting her vent, so I'm mostly on the outside looking in. She says that, maybe, if things get more stable, we might have a future together. My emotional mind sits between feeling like the ""just in case"" guy to acknowledging the big change in her life that's easily overwhelming for her. She won't commit to anything beyond, ""we'll see"". Today, she sent a text asking how Christmas went. I responded that it was good and asked about hers. She vented about things going on, including ending a friendship with someone else. I tried to be consoling, said I missed her. No message returned about missing me, just how she was going to ""make lemonade"" during her current breakup with her friend. It hurt. Initially, it felt nice that she took the time to inquire about what's going on with me, turned it into how she's struggling and dismissed my expression of missing her all at once. I left it with, ""have fun"". Just now, she sent me a picture of her having fun as I'm typing this. I'm old. I'm too old to be thinking this way, part of me knows that we belong together, for so many reasons. Her sending me a picture is her way of saying what she struggles to say, and I get that, but I also know I shouldn't be this mixed up about it. Part of me thinks I'm an idiot, that our past is so full of messy and chaotic, that with anyone else would have made me slam the door shut and never look back. It's literally been her for over 20 years, holding a candle for someone that has hurt me so much, but has loved me more than anyone else seems to know how to. I don't understand it and all the therapy has taught me that I can't control anyone but myself. I've believed in one thing in my entire life, and that's that this one person, when she's in a moment of vulnerability, is the most amazing person I've ever met. Those moments are similar to the movie, The Notebook. It's hard to get to that place, everyone around me says I need to stop, but I'll be there next weekend for a tiny chance of finding her through all her emotional defenses that were built from necessity. Her past is horrible, and I understand that better than anyone I know about, but sometimes I even question that, because she's also capable of lies and manipulation to get what she wants. I imagine her reading this, though I know she wouldn't be on this forum. She would be mad and hold it against me for putting it out there, probably tell me how I'm wrong about my assessment of the situation and add it to the list of, I'm still not stable enough to move forward. I understand that it's a risk, but my mental health deserves a release, for me, even if it's selfish. I need to be able to put myself out there, to be heard, even if nobody reads this wall of text. I'm a walking contradiction, a puppy on a leash, and probably gave up on any chance for a ""normal"" life. I want to walk away and seek a real relationship, but I don't want to miss a fight, in the rain, when she actually lets down her guard long enough to show me the person I know. It's so amazing, but those moments are so rare and hard to find and I think if I found out that she ever gave that to someone else, I would end it this very second because my almost entire adult life would be a lie. I've asked her, in those tiny windows of vulnerability, and she's assured me they are mine alone, but I question that when my emotions get the best of me, like right now. Please help. If just to acknowledge that I exist, in the real world and this prayer for a way out or way back in is even possible. "

I wrote to her that I realized my mistakes and realize how I have to prioritize my own life first, mostly career wise and also self improvement, but I also told her that I wanted her to be by my side on this journey, saying how I'll be able to handle it and I'm changing not for her, but for myself because I know it'll be good for me. I told her that I did like her for her, and although this is true, I came to the harsh uncomfortable reality that I merely liked the feeling of her, the feeling of intimacy, closeness, because I haven't had something like this in over 4 years. &amp;#x200B; I've been dissatisfied with myself for the past few years and I can't depend on someone else to satisfy me. It has to be internally, from within. I was lying to myself, always have been. If I have self-worth, self-love, someone will be able to see it in my confidence, but until she comes along I must work on myself. No ridiculously self-induced insecurities. I've been putting on a front of my confidence, but in reality, it's just a cover-up for my insecurities and dissatisfaction. &amp;#x200B; And so I ended things by being selfish and thinking about myself. I have the fundamental problem of compromising, and in the long run that's not healthy at all. I've always put a SO before me. Part of me regrets my decision, yes, but I know it's temporary and it'll pass. In the long run this is going to be amazing for my self-discovery because now I can do me. I do realize the mistakes that I made and yeah, it was largely my fault. If I could go back in time to change it though, maybe I would...but probably not. I wouldn't have realized these underlying issues that I have that'll translate to other relationships. Everything happens for a reason and I'll learn from this and it serves me to not only treat whoever comes next better, but especially treat myself better, more fairly. &amp;#x200B; See the thing is, she liked my vulnerability, but in a relationship, for both sexes but more so applies to females, (the following words are not my own words but from @Spearhartt, @misch\_mash and @BeetsBy\_Schrute on this post [URL from r/AskMen) they may not say it outright, but they have no true desire to hear or deal with your problems or mental illnesses. In male friendships, we rarely confide in each other about deep things. I have been lucky enough to have great guy friends who I go to with almost every problem, but it's different. A guy-girl friendship has a different dynamic, that's why girls talk about everything with each other. When you don't have a female support group like myself, a SO becomes an outlet because they feel they can be safe by being vulnerable with them, but girls don't like that. They like a guy who can handle himself and their confidence may be high in the beginning of the relationship, but as they progress and become more comfortable with each other, he expresses his mental issues and become dependent on them for confiding. ""The second the relationship becomes something besides platonic, the confiding becomes platonic."" Women in relationships want a man who solves his own problems, usually that means having female friends or good bros. ""It's not the truth that breaks relationships, it's the hard pivot. The boyfriend quickly goes from not having problems, to having lots of problems."" ""With men, they often give no indication that something is bothering them - so when you find out that they are deeply upset or hurt by something and have been sometime - you feel shocked and you find yourself quetioning your entire relationship. You find yourself wondering if you really know this man you love at all, and given that they've hidden something so important, what else have they hidden."" &amp;#x200B; TDLR; I showed my insecurities, my mental health issues to my girl, became super unattractive but I repeatedly did it. She felt pressure for handling my emotions when I couldn't handle my own, and I realized I'm not ready to handle someone else when I can't even handle myself. Have a good friend support group, both male and female. You can't look for satisfaction elsewhere if you're dissatisfied with yourself. You can't offer security if you are insecure yourself. Work on yourself first, love yourself. "

Our energy was unmatchable. We could speak to each other without using words. We just werent ready. The stars aligned when we met. I looked into your eyes and saw the rest of my life. We were seemingly forced out of each others live because the time just wasnt right. Our breakup was the hardest moment of my life. I learned that ignorance is bliss when I faced the most agonizing pain Id ever felt. It just felt so unfair. You gave me the world. I was your world. You were mine. You are mine. I spent days checking my phone constantly. Waiting for a text from you that we could keep trying despite our families differences. I would love to hear your voice right now or feel your touch but my fear of vulnerability holds me back. Everything reminds me of you. Each time I saw you, I thought I could never be happier, until the next. Theres not a single thing I dislike about you. Your hands were so gentle and caring. You were my safe place. There is no doubt in my mind you will love me eternally. I know that now is not our time. I would give anything to change that. You are my first thought when I wake up and the last when I sleep. Most nights you even live in my dreams. Im heartbroken and I know that you are too but we really tried, my baby. We tried so hard. Maybe some day we will meet again. Maybe we were just another tragic love story. "

I spend all my energy fighting a one-sided battle by myself. I try to reach you. I bottle up my emotions, and I don't react to being disrespected. I hold back my feelings so you don't feel uncomfortable. I do everything i can think of to try to make things good for you, but i'm not a mind reader, and you don't give me anything. Except, sometimes you do. You touch me, or you reflect on a good memory, or we share a genuine laugh together that only we could share. You text me about nothing and i know it's just because you miss me. It's really all i ever wanted. It's inconsistent though, and it makes me a basket case who over-analyzes everything. I don't know why you care for me, and i don't know why you stop. I don't know anything, except that i want to make things better. I have no information on how to do it though. I'm not angry, i'm not resentful. I am tremendously disappointed though. I re-read all of our emails, then deleted them. We were so fucking into each other in a whole new way. You were vulnerable, i was strong. You became my best friend. Then it flipped. You withdrew, and it's never been the same since. I know you meant everything you said to me. I don't know what stops it from translating to reality, but i know you can't control it. I truly think so highly of you. I honestly believe you just have problems, which is why i wanted us to go to therapy together. I tried to create a safe space for you, but I was willing to sacrifice mine. It sounds cliche, but I do believe there's nothing we couldn't overcome together. We're not together though. It's just me, trying to fix a two person problem. My dedication to you, to us, has cost me greatly. My career has suffered, probably irreparably. People close to me have watched me sacrifice my self respect, and become a shell of the person they knew. They've worried about me. They've sat through my denials, my defending of you, my praising of you. Thousands of dollars I've spent on therapy, plus vices i rely on to see me through. I've lost so many days, depressed, anxious, whatever. You never asked for my devotion. You never asked me to give your texts a special tone to alert me. I was waiting for you to start a new job so i could deliver you flowers on your first day. I had a second Christmas present for you. I wanted to be a bigger part of your life, and meet the other people who were important to you. I was just always thinking about you. You didn't ask for that. You never really asked me for anything. It's just who i am. It's how i show my love. I get excited and run to the door to see you because that's just how I feel. Sometimes you showed me the same. Don't think i have forgotten anything you did for me. It's what makes this so damn difficult. I have realized there's nothing wrong with the way I love someone. Wanting to speak to them everyday and see them frequently is right. Being excited about another person is joyful, and nothing to be ashamed of. You can't be who i need you to be, but i hope so much that you can be for someone else. I couldn't be what you need either, but there is someone out there who can. Someone who will excite you the way you do me. You deserve it babe. You deserve to be loved deeply, and give love deeply. You like to put yourself down and beat yourself up, but you shouldn't doubt for one second that you deserve the world. I just need to start looking out for myself. I know you want what's best for me. Unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be having you in my life. I've learned so much about myself thanks to you. I've become in touch with my emotions, i've become a kinder and more empathetic person. Now i'm learning that sometimes letting go is so much harder than holding on. Sometimes it's ok to give up on someone. I can't keep reaching for someone who doesn't reach back. This isn't good-bye forever. How could it be? I will be checking up on you, just as you have with me. I will never forget you, or some of the happiest moments in my life. I will never forget your smell, laugh, (your accent ) and your beautiful vulnerability. I fell for you in a way i didn't think possible. I don't regret any of it, even if it sounds like i should. I don't, Anggi. I gave everything for someone i believed in. That's something i can be proud of. You are my world. The first thing on my mind when i wake up, and the last before i fall asleep. It will be a very long time before that changes. I will always feel connected to you. You are not replacable, so I won't even try. PS I love you. PPS You saved my life you know."

Body: My ego tells me ""walk tall, and don't look back,"" but my heart reminds me that life is pretty short. I valued our connection once. Maybe we can reconcile one day. \-Tardigrade The context: I really loved my partner. I mean, obviously. Would anybody be here if they didn't? And, *because of course it did*, the way our breakup played out really hurt. It was probably inevitable because our most significant problem was our ability to communicate effectively in the relationship. But it all came to a head prematurely when my partner had to move three hours away, and suddenly, communication was all we had. I couldn't reach him by phone, so I started initiating the breakup over text, and he basically ghosted me after the first line. It took me two weeks to accept that he was just... gone. To this day, I'm not 100% sure if he understood that I was ending it, or if it's something he just DID - after 2+ years of being together. And that uncertainty broke me. I didn't know how to deal with it. I repressed it, and all my pain and sadness fermented into an angry mixture. But after two months of silence, he dropped a few crumbs and I took the bait. He started messaging me once or twice a week (which was all I really wanted in the first place, right?) and it eventually culminated into a request to meet for coffee. And he finally lowered his fucking guard and said that he missed me, that he thought about me every day, and that he didn't want to drift far, far apart, etc etc. And I blew it up in his face. I told him that I was hurt, and that he left me to figure out for myself that it was over. I told him that I had loved him with everything I had, and that I was angry with myself for letting him drag me through so much of his personal bullshit, just to leave me at the end feeling like *nothing*. Not even worth a goodbye. So after that... he typed up his last bit: Describing his experience of our last few weeks, and how hard things were, and that he wanted me to stay strong for him, but that I was visibly sad every time he saw me. He told me when he read that first line of my break up monologue - ""I'm done, X"" - that he decided he was, too. And he finally said that for the past few months, he was still hoping we'd, I dunno; *magically reconnect through happenstance or our mutual acquaintances?* \- but that there was now so much miscommunication and negative feelings, that he wasn't sure if there was anything to salvage... which, he noted, probably wasn't even something I wanted. I wrote back, ""I needed to hear that."" And then... I told him that I didn't hate him, and that I was sorry things didn't work out. I had been falling apart. And I *had* been falling apart. Because when he moved away, it was like... he died, or something. He didn't answer my texts, he ignored most of my calls, and he never made time. None of this was a new problem; we'd fought about it before. But now, he was three hours away - so if really wanted his attention, I couldn't just go to his house on a whim. I *needed* him to be accessible to me. And he wasn't. Moving away didn't change anything. I was sad every time I came to visit, because he was breaking my heart. One tiny fracture at a time. So, yeah. Of course we broke up. And I shouldn't waste any more of my time and energy on this neglectful, inconsiderate, motherfucking asshole. But... *fuck*, you guys. I loved him. What more can I say? He doesn't get to have my heart anymore. Never again. I've spent the past 3-4 months since his failed reconciliation, working through my emotions and letting the anger burn away. I've learned lessons from my pain: I will never date an alcoholic again. I will never date a person who says ""I'm bad at relationships"" again. But I hate the way things ended. I hate that he finally worked up the courage to ask me for a connection, and that I lashed out at him in his moment of vulnerability. If we \*are\* the kind of ex-partners that are able to reconcile and have a connection later on in life, I feel like it's all on me now: He's a coward; he's so bad at initiating anything, and I'm the one who sabotaged his one attempt. The ball is almost definitely in my court now. :-( I may not send it for a while, though. Or at all. I should probably just let this thing die."

God was the beginning so amazing. I felt so wonderful. I went places I had never gone and I saw things I never saw, I felt things I never felt. The sex. O M G the sex was amazing. Then Valentines Day came and i split the holiday between X and my grandma (her husband died before I was born so every year I spend some time with her) and that was not okay. That night I got cheated on, twice. I received a call from a jail and went to pick up N forgave and worked through it. Still not knowing what I signed up for. As time went on it got worse. Soon it was April and I had brought X breakfast to find another woman in the bed, N cried and apologized over and over, I was told that because I wasnt affectionate enough and always had my daughter (from a previous relationship where her father is completely absent now) that I didnt give enough of my alone time to the relationship. So I decided to fix what was wrong with me and forgive, for that same night, my phone rang and it was the other girl telling me they were together yet again. To my vulnerability I decided to believe that X just was trying to moderate a bad situation. My daughters father contacted me for the first time in months wanting to see his child and I allowed it but I felt so shameful that I kept it a secret, X found out and flipped out and used that as their reason for more cheating lies &amp; hidden agendas. Again I personalized it as my fault. Soon my friends were leaving One by one. X hated one of my friends and didnt allow me to talk to her, but I chose to in secret anyway. I just told myself if X was going to always lie about everything even silly things and get caught then Im still going to follow my heart. The lies got worse the games got worse. I dropped 40 pounds and a depression hit worse than ever. I was in the phone when X didnt want me on the phone and X attacked me. I got my things and left and it started a week long fight. During that time, My daughters grandmother ( on the absent parent side) has passed I decided to go to the wake in secret because I felt it was the right thing to do. After that wake I found out X knew every move I made every where I went everything I did everyone I saw that whole week. The wake was considered cheating and I was tortured every day as it was a excuse to torment me, but this time I couldnt do it anymore, I decided to end it. X was not happy and contacted my 2 best friends and told them I said horrible things about them. Anytime X went through my phone and read any conversation it was twisted and made it seem as if I was talking bad. This made my friends mad and they turned on me very fast and told X everything. Every little detail about my daughters father. Every detail about my friend I wasnt supposed to have. And now Im here. Friendless. Loveless. Alone. With no one. X still calls once a day to tell me how horrible I am and if I try to stick up for myself I get hung up on. I feel so numb. Its hard for me because, X is really playing the self pity card right now. Depressed. Miserable. Posting the saddest things my heart is breaking thinking about it, but then I think, how could X go and take my friends with me with lies that were told to do exactly what they did, for me to loose what I care about most. How could someone be so sad and hurt, but have done this to me? "

If she fucks you on the second or third date she wants to come across as not easy and wants to have a relationship with you. If she hasnt fucked you by fourth date you are a PLAN B/ALTERNATE OPTION MOVE ON Read 48 laws of power Shoot the arrow then paint the target around it and youll always get a bullseye The mistake is believing that trust, kinship, and affection are unconditional and that the feral nature is subdued to the point of being inconsequential Personality, Character, and Family is everything in picking women Between 23 and 36 prime age across sexes Mens SMV peaks at 30 and can continue to grow until 36! Mens value burns slow and long Women peak at 23 from 24-30 they are approaching the wall Speak without speaking NEVER overtly tell a woman anything Let her reach her own conclusions Stay AWAY from DAMAGED GOODS The ONLY time you can show a woman weakness is when your parents or close family passes OPTIONAL Women NEED to be told NO!

We fell in love and unlike anytime before, we both admitted within a month how we felt. I used to joke that people would right sad love stories about us - because I was already fearful that it would end just because how this woman made me feel. I never felt so vulnerable and she admitted the same. Soon we found out the extent of our vulnerability. She was afraid to tell anyone if anything was wrong and I was afraid of abandonment. We both had our traumas. The issues arose when I started experiencing some intense anxiety when she would be in a ""bad mood"" and she would try to tell me not to worry about it. But while she was at a 4, I kept trying to bring her back to a level 10 instead of just being present with her. In those moments, I would push her to the edge because I just kept acting like an anxious fool instead of listening. She needed time to heal and I didn't let her until she told me she was going to be silent for a day or two and I understood then that I went too far. We worked things out, came back together, and it was like being aflame all over again. But I couldn't change. I remember laying in bed with her when I admitted, for the 100th time, that I was afraid of losing her and she got really upset, more than ever before. I remember her asking me when I would stop worrying about that, because she was still right there. She asked me when I would realize that I was a full person too? I told her that I felt whole when I was with her. Those were nice words, but they only glanced over the bigger issue. One day my anxiety took off after we had an incredible two days together. Nothing was wrong, it was the best anniversary we had. But I remember freaking out about nothing and sitting by the sidewalk and sending her text after anxiety-fueled text about how I hoped everything was okay. She broke up with me the next day. She told me that she loved me, but that she realized she had to walk away from this. That I needed to be a whole person and that I couldn't change while she was with me. I kept telling her to give me a year, to give me a month - but I had been saying I would change for months already. The last thing she said in that moment was, ""I love you. I'm sorry. Goodbye."" I had never been so devastated in my life. I still won't forget how I broke down in front of a BMW parking lot shortly after - I had to call my best friend to get me. But something was different this time. I've had bad breakups before with women I knew I loved, but this time, despite how horrendous this felt, I knew that I couldn't let this happen again. I had to change. In the first week I start seeing a therapist (I researched and saw two at first and decided on one that fit best for me between the two). By the next week, I started doing spoken word poetry - something that I had been fearful of doing for years. And by the week after that, I was doing interviews for jobs in my degree - looking for an OUT of my old retail job. 3 weeks after we broke up, we agreed to talk. I asked for her back. We got back together all for 10 minutes until she ran away again. She told me that night that she couldn't decide whether to take me back or never talk to me again. She asked what my advice was. And though it was cheesy, I told her that even if it takes time, to follow her heart. She blocked me after that. I wouldn't hear from her until 3 months later. By that time I had done a lot. I tackled my deepest insecurities inside and outside of therapy. I acknowledged the things that were wrong in my relationship, not just for her, but for me as well - we both had our problems. At the same time, however, I had a responsibility to myself. I wanted to be in control of my life In 3 months, I was hired as a specialist in my preferred field with my preferred population, I quit my old retail job, I started learning fire spinning (just because), I got reconnected to my old dojo (a 5 year old goal of mine), lost 20 pounds, started learning a new language, actually created and maintained a budget, and traveled (something I always thought I was too poor to do). I had learned to love the person I had become. I felt whole. A few weeks into this process and there was a sudden shift in my outlook. I still remember the day I went outside getting ready for work, it was gray and hazy out like it was about to rain. But everything looked so vivid. Colors were more intense. I had lived with anxiety and depression my entire life and I never remember seeing days like this. Suddenly the world seemed in stark contrast. I remember only being able to see a ""tunnel"" of my world, whereas the rest of it just seemed like gray static. I cried on my way to work. I felt like I could trust the world and I never remembered a time where that was possible. And at the end of it all, I still knew one thing: I still wanted her back. 3 months after I had last seen her, I dropped off a present for her birthday at her doorstep. That night, she sent me a text telling me she was touched. We chatted for a little bit that night before we wished each other a good night. A month later, after returning from a trip, I reached out again. I asked her if she wanted to see a movie with me and see if we could catch up. She agreed. That night, all I wanted to do was make her smile, make her laugh, and I did. That night, unexpectedly, she came up to me and invited me to hold her. And I did. And we kissed. She cried, which was unusual because before, she would never let me see her cry. She asked me if it would be easy to catch up after 4 months. I told her probably not but that I wanted to and that I was ready to. She told me she wasn't sure if she was ready, that she wasn't sure if she could try. I told her if she needed more time, I would give that to her. She said thank you and kissed my nose before we shared one final kiss. I reached out two days after, because I thought we were at least on talking terms and wanted to see if she wanted to grab a drink. No answer. Halloween passed. Thanksgiving just passed - I sent her a message wishing her a Happy Thanksgiving. I haven't heard from her in two months. And I just feel... Heavy. Still strong. But heavy. After two months, today, I finally gave myself permission to just feel everything all over again. I still don't want to give up, but I know I'm not ready to reach out to her yet again. Because I know that the last time I decide to reach out will be my last, because I can't do this. I have to forgive myself and know that the best relationship I ever had was something I needed to lose in order to realize I had to take control of my life. I started out with changing FOR her, but by around month two, I realized I was actually doing it for myself. I just still wanted her to be a part of it. Sorry, I think I lost track of what the point of this was. I guess what I really have to say is this: Sometimes you lose the person you love because they were there to show you something, give you a message, to carry you onward so you could be better. For me, I saw a fire in her that I was attracted to. She made me recognize my own flame and I realized I wanted to embrace it. When you're without the other person, put all of your focus in finding yourself or creating yourself. Do things with purpose. Though it's not necessary for all relationships, it really is important to love yourself fully. &amp;#x200B; Today I'm whole. The sadness I feel is a very real sadness, but it's not one that makes me feel like I can't live without her. I just miss her is all. TLDR: Met the love of my life last year. Had an incredible relationship but my anxiety issues became too intense. She left because I wasn't able to get them in control despite how much time, comfort, etc. I changed because of it and feel like I love myself now despite still missing her."
203,vulnerability,BreakUps,"I (26M) emotionally cheated on my ex girlfriend (23F). We broke up. Please help, how to move foward?",1,a196h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/a196h7/i_26m_emotionally_cheated_on_my_ex_girlfriend_23f/,2018-11-29 05:58:41,"Hi all. I apologize for so much text, its a bit long. I have been redditing for many years but this is the first time posting here. Let me preface by saying I have literally read every single post regarding infidelity on this sub and others. I have a bit of obsessive-compulsive tendencies so I have thoroughly gone through much material. However, I am so distraught that I feel that I need to get insight from my people who are not friends, family, psychologists, etc. Hence, I express my vulnerability to you all. Forgive me for the lack of coherency, I am a native English speaker but have not spoken English now for many years. The story: I met Barabara on Tinder 5 months ago. Immediately we hit it off. The first day we met we slept together in a passionate furor. A day later, we got together again. She is beautiful and together with similar interests (especially of politics, which is very important to me), we began to have an intense relationship. I finally felt that I found someone who could engage intellectually and politically with me the way I always wanted. The complicated part was the distance. She lives in a city 1.5 hours from me and recently moved to another part of the city that is 3.5 hours from me. The relationship began well, lots of passion, deep conversations into the night and satisfying interactions. However, fissures began to arise. For one, her sleeping schedule is quite erratic; her going to sleep at 5 or 6 in the morning and sleeping for 4-6 hours is normal and fine whereas I usually go to sleep at 11 and sleep 8 hours due to my work schedule. She was fairly upset at this and I struggled to try to accommodate her schedule. At one point, we had a direct talk about this and it appeared we might have solved it but it was certainly a pending issue. On the other hand, whether it was the distance or not, she was quite demanding and difficult to be with you. When I asked to formally be girlfriend and boyfriend, she even warned me saying Just so you know, I am a fighter. I didnt really know what that could mean because I never saw that side of her. Well I soon learned what that meant. Concerning the communication, a constant stream of communication was an a priori for her to feel valued. Of course I want to communicate, but with my job and schedule I couldnt always keep up. Its to say that there were times when I would see a message but couldnt answer, she would see I was online, and if I didnt answer within seconds she would delete the message and say I was ignoring her or that I wasnt actually interested. Also, when we talked by phone, the conversations would always be hours long, which is fine because I like talking to her but it put a strain on me because I have very little time to do things (cook, clean, basic things). Also, there were moments were she would act quite meanly and cruelly. Many times she would hang up on me and I would scream to myself in frustration of how she treated me. I felt like she reacted to things I said in a manipulating way, or at the very least, in a way that I had no intention of acting. For example, I was working on an essay that I sent to her for her corrections. I knew she was busy so I didnt want to pressure her into revising it so I sent it to another friend who is doing masters in the subject area. When she found out I did that, I said that I value her (ex gf) revision but also I wanted the suggestions from my friend who is an expert in the subject area doing a masters. She took offense to this, as if my friend doing the masters is somehow superior than her. She screamed at me accusing me of insulting her intelligence, that she goes to the best university in the county, etc. It was that day where she threw my stuff out of her apartment (I was just staying the night) and it was a really ugly move. Later, we calmed down and had a serious talk about whether we could continue together. We decided to continue to try. The infidelity: Before everything, I accept all of my actions and the consequences. I know what I did was shitty and dont use anything previously mentioned as a justification, more as a context in that the relationship was never perfect. However, what transpired is different than what I have seen or read. Basically Fernanda added me on facebook one day, a person I never knew but she saw me in my office and wanted to know me. So we began talking. It began friendly enough, just asking about one another. Then we started talking about life, plans, goals, and exchanging compliments to one another. It was never sexual or even implicitly sexually. I can best describe it as overly friendly and flirty. But I was playing it as a single person, never saying that I was in a relationship and inviting her to hangout one time. I even said that I cook well and invited her one day to try. The ugly part was that in one of my trips to see my ex girlfriend, I said I was going to such city for a meeting. That was a blatant lie. Why did I say that? Well, I believe it was an ego trip, looking for validation and satisfaction where I was not getting from my ex girlfriend. The things is, is that I never planned on physically cheating or sexually-emotionally cheating on my ex girlfriend. I am confident this was never going to transpire as this series of events is almost identical to what happened in a previous relationship: A girl adds me on facebook, we begin to talk, it gets flirty, i go as far as to her house to meet her and. NOTHING HAPPENS! We are friends to this day. But of course, if a partner sees this conversation they will not think as such. The conversations with Fernanda consisted in a few messages every few days over 3-4 weeks. The revelation: Three weeks ago, I left my ex girlfriends apartment to look for the food we had just ordered. When I got back, she asked me who Fernanda was (seeing messages on my phone I left on the bed). I said just a friend. I said read the messages. It was then that I really realized that the way we were talking was fucked up, that I was like playing both sides. My ex girlfriend was destroyed. I felt destroyed. I apologized repeatedly. She cried the whole night. I cried. I stayed for another day trying to comfort her. She was inconsolable. She broke up with me. She told me I ruined it. I left at 6 in the morning Sunday. She messaged me on Tuesday (2 days later) and we began to slowly talk. It looked as if things were getting better. But then the following Tuesday, I had a mental breakdown. The first of its kind in my life. Basically she told me that her friend saw me on Tinder. I said yes, I installed it. But I lied and said that I installed it because she said she wanted to see other people (which is true she said that, but not the reason I installed Tinder). I installed it a day or two after we broke up, which I do not see as inherently bad. Everyone has different processes and for me, the impact of big events hits me a few days after, never immediately. But that bad part was that I lied. And she caught me in that lie. She called me a liar, a terrible person, that she hopes no one ever loves me again. I broke down. And this was after I said I was going through an internal process to better myself as a person. This was true, but it wasnt until that Tuesday where , for the first time, I had a complete questioning of myself. I entered a state of deep depersonalization where everything I thought of myself was under question. All of this went beyond my ex girlfriend; it was a deep, painful introspection of me as a persona and why I lie, why I hurt her, etc. I have never broke down like that before. I cried, I screamed, I grabbed a knife from the kitchen and thought I would actually do something to myself. I didnt go to work the next day. That Friday, for the first time in my life, I somewhat tried to kill myself (I say somewhat because I drank a good amount of vodka and Xanax but not enough to kill myself but certainly not caring). I told my mom and that broke her. Even my dad reached out to me. I have never been so vulnerable. I cry every day. I have fits of rage of everyday. Everyone says I look different, asking me what is wrong. I just say I am tired. This is going on everyday for more than 3 weeks now. Since then, I have been going to a psychologist and psychiatrist (now with three prescribed medicines), along with confiding in friends and family. But I am so incredibly distraught. I am suicidal. I cant focus in work, I fear I may lose my job. All I have is repeat thoughts in my head of how I can end it, the tortuous repetitive thoughts that I am not with her, that I lost a person I considered marrying, having children with, travelling, etc. I feel that my only escape may very well be death because living is tortuous in itself. And why? Because I do love this person, her character, intelligence, beauty, and I fear I may never find a person like her. Especially in regards to politics. She is the revolutionary I always wanted to be with. I really do fear I may never find a person like her. Now im left wondering what to do? She has made it clear that she does not want to be with anyone (as in formally) and that she is over me. She told me before even, she gets over her relationships in a matter of days. She actually told me she is sleeping with someone else (4 days after we broke up) and that they have had more and better sex than we ever had. She later apologized for saying that. I, on the other hand, took 4 years to get over my first girlfriend. I want to win her back, every week I send her something: letters, chocolate, flowers. She appreciates the gestures but is firm that she cant offer me anything more than friendship. She says she doesnt see me in the same way. It breaks my heart. We used to be so passionate and intimate. And now she wants nothing to do with me, doesnt even message me. When we talk, its cordial, she says she loves and values me as a person. But thats it. I suppose it has to do with control as well, wanting that another person can love you, act a certain way when they do not want to. And now? Well, my question to you all, is what is your advice on how to proceed. I see it as having two options: 1) Keep trying to win her back through efforts to show the real remorse, change and love I have for her. However, this has never been reciprocated. And it could be quite dangerous to my mental health. I saw a picture of her on Instagram yesterday and lost it again. The other option is to move on definitively: Delete her from all social media and recognize the relationship is gone and may never come back. But I cant help but want to have her. But that is not what she wants. My friends and family that I have consulted have largely said they believe her reaction was a little too much and a solution might be possible, whereas her friends call me a bastard. But her personal code of respect is hers and hers alone and this type of acting is crossing a line. And I respect that. But that means the death of our relationship. And well, now she is happy, living life, going out, having sex, etc. whereas I am depressed/suicidal, medicated, sleeping all the time, risking losing my job, and just a mess in general. In cases such as these, I often see the advice Learn from this and try better next time. Is that really where I am at? Thoughts? Advice? Thank you dearly from my heart. TL;DR I emotionally cheated on my now ex girlfriend. I love her dearly and would like to win her back. This seems quite improbable and my mental health is really taking a toll. Advice on how to proceed? Is it possible to win her back? Or should I just definitively move on? And if so, how? (I have repetitive thoughts 24/7 of us)."

My first love was my dad. My dad broke my heart before anyone else had a chance to. And its not because he abandoned me, or abused me, or lied to me; its because he died. One of the most important people were supposed to spend our youth beside just left me. He never got to see me learn how to ride a bike or drive a car, he never got to show me how to change a tire, he never got to meet any of the boys I brought home to meet the family, he never got to see me walk across the stage on my graduation days, he never got to tell me his life story. He left me before I had a chance to take in all that was going on around me, and before I had a chance to tell him how much he truly meant to me. The last memory I have engrained in my memory of my father is his lifeless body laying in his hospice bed in the middle of our family room; his lips a shade of blue I will never forget and his hands placed so delicately upon the sheets. I wish so badly that I could go back to the days leading up to his death, and just tell him how much I loved him. I am forever regretful that I never told him while I had the chance. My second love was you. You broke my heart in ways I never imagined were possible. Trying to put all of my feelings and thoughts into words has never been such a challenge. You were the stars, the moon, my whole world. Now, you are nothing but a stranger again. You were my rock, the person that made me feel so incredibly whole on even my worst of days. You were the one I went to when I had good news, when happiness beamed through me like a child on Christmas morning. I dont know what happened. I dont know what I ever did for it to end like this. My heart, soul and entire body aches as I think back to what we were and the beautiful moments we shared. All of the past heartbreaks were merely an exaggeration. This is what a real heartbreak feels like. I cant eat, I cant drink, I cant sleep, I can barely even move. The pain I feel in my heart is becoming unbearable, and the thought of having to live without your love is tearing me apart. However, what I have come to realize, is that there is absolutely no use in being with someone who does not want to be with you. There is no such thing as the right person, but the wrong time because no matter the situation, the right person will make it work for you and with you. The right person will want to be with you regardless of the circumstances that have been presented. And that person is out there for me. My third love will come to me. It could be a year from now or it could be a decade from now, and they could easily come when I am least expecting it. And that person will treat me the way I deserve. They will love me on my darkest of days and without condition. They will not undermine my feelings and they will not be afraid to think of a future with me. They will welcome my love with open arms because I have so much love to give. I am worthy of all the love in the world, and one day, I will be given that. I look forward to that day. Its okay to cry and grieve and be a mess, and thats something Ive learned throughout this breakup. We, as humans, should never suppress our feelings because our feelings are there for a reason; to be felt. And when were done grieving and processing these feelings, despite how long it takes, then we have to get back up and begin the healing process. And before we know it, the pain we once felt so deeply in our hearts will fade and we will be left with nothing but memories and a better understanding. A better understanding of vulnerability, and how crucial it is we open ourselves up to all the feelings that come with the traumatic experience of a breakup. I am not okay right now, and I admit that. What I do know, however, is that Im going to be okay and Im going to break away from this aching pain. This pain will pass. I dont know how long its going to take, and I dont know how easy its going to be, but soon enough, I will be okay. We are all going to be okay."
207,vulnerability,BreakUps,A Letter to my Ungrateful Ex,1,9q52sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9q52sx/a_letter_to_my_ungrateful_ex/,2018-10-22 03:55:44,"I won't send this letter to him, since I've gone no contact. But I want to post it here nonetheless for support, and in the hopes that someone else might benefit from it. Brief background: Met him in grad school, fell madly in love, and later developed PTSD as a result of previous domestic abuse. He couldn't cope with my symptoms, despite the fact that I was making tremendous progress, and so he unilaterally decided one day to get a U-Haul and move out, leaving me alone in the apartment that was now barren of furniture. I am originally from Cali, but decided to stay in rural, bumfuck upstate NY (I hate it) after I graduated to be with him. I even took a job here to stay with him while he finished up his last year in grad school. After he moved out, he told me that he wanted to ""remain friends,"" because he realized that the PTSD was the real deal breaker, and that it wasn't my fault. I forgave him for moving out, and I've been improving tremendously since he left me, working on self-love, remaining calm, challenging my negativity. I single-handedly cured myself of my PTSD (there are no therapists around my area that accept my insurance, and I have no friends out here... I'm from the other part of the country). I thought we were beginning getting close again, like close enough to commit to each other again. Last week, he came over and fucked me, twice. This week, he got angry when I asked to cuddle when he came over, telling me that ""I was moving too fast"" and that I needed to ""respect his boundaries."" He told me that he regrets having sex with me, which was a major blow to my self-esteem. He then grabbed his keys and ran out the door in a fit, unwilling to talk, and hasn't contacted me since. I fucking hate him so much, and I vow from this day going forward to challenge all of the love that I once harbored for him. He's not worth it. I imagined writing the following letter to him if he ever contacted me again (of course, I won't send this to him...it was purely for cathartic purposes). Wtf do you want? Why are you contacting me? Haven't you hurt me enough? No? You still want to hurt me more by dragging me along in your stupid cycle of confusion, self-pity, and weakness? Fuck outta here. I have goals and dreams for my life. I'm going to be an accomplished scholar very soon. I'm going to be an excellent college professor. I'm going to have an amazing relationship with someone else, because the only silver lining my time with you showed me is how to love unconditionally. You weren't the right recipient of that love though, thankfully. Living with you for the rest of my life would have entailed non-stop begging for intimacy, vulnerability, closeness, and trust. You aren't the one for me. That realization liberates me, so leave me the fuck alone. I showed you what a strong, powerful, badass woman that I am, and you balked at my awesomeness, because you couldn't match my energy. I gave you love, encouragement, positivity, advice, and even the chance to get your finances on track by mooching off my salary. Tell me another woman that you know that would have done that for you, you ungrateful piece of shit. You sucked all of my good vibes into your black hole of a heart, never returning them, never supporting me through my infinitely harder struggles (you're a privileged white boy, I'm a working class Arab whose partner deserted them in the middle of nowhere while they were suffering from PTSD). I've emerged victorious, you've remained the same emotionally unavailable, self-pitying fucktard that you were when I met you. I should have known better than to give my all to a man who could leave me when I was at my worst. I should have seen the red flags that you would be unable to commit to the blindingly positive light of positivity and passion that I emit. You're a creature of the darkness-- a monster who likes to withdraw into their cave of emotional unavailability, stupidity, weakness. You're stupid as fuck, below me and my level of emotional maturity. To continue to chose a trash like you would be throwing myself away too. I don't know if you'll ever regret losing me, but I also don't care if you never realize what a fucktard you are. I know the truth about you, even if you are too much of a coward to see it yourself. And that is all that I ned to move on from your stupid ass. I don't need reconciliation, an apology, a promise to ""try harder,"" or any of that bullshit. All I need is fucking time and self-love to recover from throwing myself at an idiot like you who sucks peoples' positive energy and love and returns their efforts by spitting in their face. You are not even that cute to begin with, everything about you is average. For all I know, you will never find someone as amazing as me. But, because you are so average (and worse than average when it comes to communicating about emotions-- you're appallingly STUPID), I know that my true love is still out there. You were a stepping stone to get to a higher place, that's all. Your ungratefulness showed me what a god damn pathetic COWARD you are. You don't know how to fight for what you love, or for those who love you. You'd rather stomp away like a two-year-old. You're emotionally undeveloped, as evidenced by the fact that you can't return love, you engage in self-destructive habits to deal with your negative emotions, and you hurt those trying to help you. Those are all immediately deal-breakers. Someone as unique, strong, and powerful as myself can't be brought down with you. I won't let you bring me down to your own pointless self-hatred and depression. I won't succumb to hating myself. No, I hate YOU! I hate you for being an indecisive brat who can't make up their mind. I have you for being nothing but a human black hole who sucks up people's positivity, I hate you for being a coward and not fighting for love, I hate you for being weak as fuck, I hate you for blaming this on me (""you're moving too fast, and I feel compelled to go along."" DUDE, YOU FUCKED ME!!!!) because you have the emotional intelligence of a toddler and can't take responsibility for yourself. I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! I HATE YOU! YES, I REALLY FUCKING HATE YOU! Get the fuck out of my life, stop sucking my energy, stop inflicting me with the same self-doubt that you are unable to get out of, stop bringing me down with you! I'm amazing, one-of-a-kind, badass, and you're a nobody who can't even accomplish the most basic act of returning love to those who love you unconditionally, despite all of the suffering that you've put them through. I know my worth, and I deserve happiness! Go cry to mommy and daddy so they can mail you another box of ""comfort food"" in the mail, you fucking bourgeois swine. "
208,vulnerability,BreakUps,the truth is..,1,9qlum0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9qlum0/the_truth_is/,2018-10-23 16:12:21,"when the reality of life hits, it smacks you in the face. Its in the pit in your stomach. Its when you hear a song and you can feel the lingering out of the words, and sounds. Your world stops and you begin to breathe very slow, hard, deep.. blindly losing yourself in the frolic of your own thoughts. Suddenly your back, and your eye begin to water. You begin to feel human again, but powerless. no matter what you do, you can never bring anyone back. You cant change their mind, perception, or time. Youre here. It is the now. Its the feeling of selflessly sharing your soul/heart/mind/ideas/feelings to someone.. to who now, doesnt care. It hurts, and as dramatic as it seems.. it feels like forever. After a while you realize theres nothing you can do. Where do you go from there? Im not sure. Its a grey area, I felt it was only right to share my feelings of confidence but also, vulnerability with you all. Im in no way perfect. Im in no way doing the correct way of healing. Im doing what I feel is good for my soul. As we all should. I wrote a post earlier today, when I first started my day about how great I was feeling. And I spent most of my day feeling very good. My job interview went fantastic, and I got a call back for another interview. Im beyond stoked. Though, behind that stoke is a sadness lurking under the surface. I tried denying it all day, but the truth is. My feelings are hurt. Im hurting because I saw some photos and heard some information I probably shouldnt have. I allowed myself to be weak, but thats ok. It hasnt been a month since we broke up, but my ex is already seeming to be dating someone new as I mentioned. I care, because. I am upset at myself for spending so much time caring to be someone who I was not.. for someone who would not take the time to fully understand the real me. I know thats a long sentence.. but if you read it slowly and carefully.. it will make sense. Signs are a key to your happiness. For any of you reading this now, please realize this deeply. Now, I am wiser because of this situation. I am sad, yes. It has come to my attention when I think about why I am hurt, and what I could have done to prevent it. I should have focused on keys signs. People will always, always, always, tell you how they feel about you even if they dont show it. When words feel meaningless, pay attention to action. How they act when you cry. How compassionate they are your needs, ideas. Even the way they react when you show them your favorite song. My hurt could have been easily prevented.. if I had paid attention to MY feelings. Dont deny your feelings of sadness, cry. Let it out. Even if its a few tears. I have a lot of growing to work through, but slowly Ill figure it out. Im only 22, anyway. Youll be ok too &lt;3 "
209,vulnerability,BreakUps,It's Been A Year,1,9qs0bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9qs0bn/its_been_a_year/,2018-10-24 06:02:19,"Hey guys, I just wanted to stop and make a post about my break-up experience briefly. It's been a year. I had another account, but I deleted it. I would come to this sub all the time and submit these heartbreaking posts. All the feedback I've received from the redditors of BreakUps and Ex No Contact has helped me tremendously in my journey to leaving a toxic relationship. You have no idea how much I appreciate the support and guidance I received from all of you. Knowing that you guys were going through a similar experience like me just helped me push forward. My break up was hard, I didn't want to leave, but I knew I had to. It was unfixable. The damage was permanent. I couldn't prolong the inevitable anymore and I needed support more than ever. That's how I found this subreddit and you guys were there listening to me drone on and on. I'm so grateful for the advice and comments. It truly helped me to become what I am today. Breakups are so dramatized in television that it really pisses me off. It doesn't show the ugly side of the meltdowns, working through you're own personal insecurities, etc. It's a hellish, agonizing ride. Break-ups are tough, but it caused me to re-evaluate myself and re-adjust for my next partner. Ive learned a lot with my former relationship and I used to regret it, but I dont anymore because it taught me a lot of valuable things. Things that I would not have learned had it been for this experience. For me, going through this break-up has caused me to be more open and honest with my feelings. I've never used to be that way. Vulnerability is scary but Ive learned that when you are vulnerable to other people, they reciprocate and are vulnerable as well. Its a beautiful thing. It's ok to cry, it's ok to continue posting/commenting/talking about your past relationship. Don't let anybody make you feel bad about what you're feeling. Grieving is a process, but you will come out stronger and vigilant. I talked about my break-up so much and I was thankful enough to have the support of a few close friends and this subreddit to listen to my issues. I used to think that what I was feeling would last forever. What you're feeling right now is temporary. It will pass. As for any of you that are curious, I do not speak to my ex and I never will. I haven't since we broke up. Like I said, if you know that a relationship should end, you need to end it and cut off communication. I have been on a few dates, but nothing came out of it and that's ok. I'm really enjoying this time to myself and I know that when the time is right, it will happen. I don't want to push it. I just want to end this again by saying how great this subreddit is and how supportive you all are. Thanks for everything. I wish you nothing but happiness. You deserve it. Much love. "
210,vulnerability,BreakUps,Ive been done.,1,9sdxbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9sdxbm/ive_been_done/,2018-10-30 02:11:08,"Its been 3 years. But it still haunts me to this day. You peeled me raw - and not in the good way, as if vulnerability was what you needed from me. No, you peeled, absolutely tore and ripped apart everything of myself: my confidence, my self-worth, my foundations, my religion, and my family. You ripped me apart and expected me to crawl back to you for help. I remember how I would spend most evenings in the beginning of our relationship just being couples at your place, and how Id walk back to mine at 3am. And how my roommates would give you a hard time for not walking me home. And how you said that wasnt fair, that they shouldnt tell you stuff like that. I remember how you told me I wasnt allowed to say that I was hurt. I remember how you called me over to your place a good month out of the breakup, only to yell at me and then feel me up against the side wall of your apartment. And how I said Im on my period and you pulled away disgustedly. The fact that I even went hurts me. I remember how you said I was so fucking tight. And I also remember how you couldnt accept what I believed in, what my life was built on top of (my religion). I remember it all. And yet I dont feel that spark of depression that had invaded my whole life for a year after. Im lucky it was only a year, but that was a hard time for me. I woke up late purposely just to make the day seem shorter. I trembled when I entered my apartment alone. You made my world flip and tore everything of me. It took a while to rebuild myself again. But when I look back at the things that have built me up for the best for me, this was the starting point to who Ive become today. Dont ever, ever. Treat girls like you did me. Do not ever, ever tell them to never feel or that their mother raised them wrong. Dont you dare question their fathers way of raising them. Dont brainwash them that they are wrong existences. Ive been done w this period of my life. You are nothing short of terrible, at least in this time. Maybe youve changed. But regardless, stalking me on LinkedIn and attempting to re-follow me on Instagram is just petty. Get away from me."

Despite the hurt, thank you. I hope youre okay, and I hope through all of the pain youre a happier and better person. We got to a deep fucking level, but I hope were better people because of that.

213,vulnerability,BreakUps,Ego and the 4-year-old,1,9vjd7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9vjd7q/ego_and_the_4yearold/,2018-11-09 21:28:57,"This is just a short story. Writing it helped me move on. If you're reading this, and I hope you find peace too. \*This is not a bid for reconciliation.\* I was just a 4-year-old when I lost my parents at an amusement park. I didn't know the ride would drop me off on the wrong side. I was maybe 4 feet tall, wandering through a massive crowd of people, crying my eyes out, until a young couple found me and took me to security. When my parents eventually found me, I went to hug them. But the first thing they did was scream anger and hatred at me. Smacking my head from behind, throwing garbage at me, pulling me by my clothes until they ripped, kicking and shoving me to the ground. They told me I was retarded, sarcastically saying they should've just left a dumb kid like me behind. They pulled over on our drive back home, yelled at me to get out and they drove away, telling me to go live on my own. I remember it like it was yesterday. \*This is not a bid for your pity.\* I've been doing so much reading since our break up, and I've learned quite a bit. And you know all about my dorky ability to learn all kinds of random stuff I'm passionate about. Developmental psychology teaches us that our attachment habits are formed in early childhood, ages 0 - 5, and can have a huge impact on relationships in adulthood. That story from when I was 4 is just one of many traumas I had to endure. Between getting savagely beaten in the car ride home after a soccer game because I didn't run fast enough, having to hold a piano bench full of textbooks over my head for 10 minutes because I made a homework mistake, being locked in a broom closet for hours, unable to go to the bathroom or sit, being told I would die in there... I experienced all of this before my 8th birthday. I had severe attachment trauma, and I was highly anxious, manic depressive and suicidal. I remember hiding in my closet, fastening a plastic bag over my head to try and suffocate. I would test the pain of cutting myself with a kitchen knife. I banged my head against the wall, punched myself, and pulled out my hair. I told myself, ""You are the worst son ever to be born. Why don't you just kill yourself. Why do you make your parents hate you. What's wrong with you?"" I was 8 years old. I won't go further, but this is the tip of the iceberg. There's so much you don't know about me. My future and potential was robbed from me. My life didn't actually begin until I was 19. \*This is not an explanation or an excuse.\* I learned to navigate in society learning every lesson the hard way until I was around 20 - getting into trouble with everyone and everything. Honestly, I'm lucky I don't have a criminal record. I ended up sabotaging all my close relationships, always feeling insecure and inadequate. I had no self-esteem, no self-worth. No sense of love, no happiness. The only thing that kept me alive was my ego and its naturally self-preserving quality. It was the only thing that wasn't broken about me. It was developed by yours truly, as a kind of proxy for my parents. But one day, by pure luck, I found self-esteem when I made my first sale at a sketchy door-to-door sales job. It was sublime. Such began a long process of salvation, rebuilding myself, piece by piece, over the past 6 years. Baby, I'm sure you've met my ""Ego"". \*This is not some underdog story.\* Ego is my best friend and my greatest enemy. He's highly motivated, disagreeable and protective. He's the muscle behind my biggest wins. He guides my work ethic and my ability to focus and create. Landed me in a highly competitive industry despite all odds and pushed me to shed 80 lbs over 5 years. He has a high standard of quality, and he adheres to it strictly. He's aggressive and crass. He commands respect and admiration from others, and he loves the validation he gets from telling a good story. He tells his stories in interviews, over a beer with his friends, and on top of it all, he even learned how to tell stories humbly, with class. But the Ego behind it is one giant beast. Probably the most disarming quality about him is how he effortlessly tells everyone about his victories, but could ironically never find the courage to repeat those same stories to himself. Imagine your classic American war hero with Don Draper-esque PTSD. \*This is not meant to provoke you.\* He never told himself these amazing tales of his wins because the validation he was getting externally felt like enough. He never felt the need to love himself, because why? He seemed to get along just fine without it his whole life, without ever hearing it from his parents. On the outside, it looks like strength, but inside... It's weakness. My whole life I've been conditioned to believe that my vulnerability is associated to my traumas, and that vulnerability is a sign of weakness. My whole life, my big, strong Ego has been a bodyguard for the 4-year-old me, wandering through that amusement park. All that 4-year-old wanted in his whole life was to feel secure and to feel loved. But that 4-year-old never had a chance to truly experience it because anyone that made me feel too vulnerable always, always, always... got an ass-whooping from Ego. The 4-year-old made friends eventually, but Ego always kept them at arms length. The 4-year-old was starving for deeper connection, desperate for love, jumping from one relationship to the next. And that's what you see when you see my ""big heart"" or ""compassion"" - that's 4-year-old me, sharing all of his love in the hopes that he might someday get some love back. An emotional Instagram meme account. Psychology calls it the ""Anxious Attachment Style"". \*This is not an emotional plea.\* With my first ex, her 4-year-old self was smart and kept her distance from my 4-year-old self. She met Ego a few times and was scared shitless. Yes, our relationship was stable, and it lasted for almost 5 years, but it wasn't meaningful or deep. It ended peacefully, death by natural causes. Both our 4-year-olds got bored of each other, but stayed, because why not? We weren't fighting. Psychology calls this the ""Fantasy Bond"". With my second ex, her 4-year-old princess ran about, flirting and touching and kissing everything that moved. Eventually, my 4-year-old thought she had cooties and didn't want to play with her anymore. Ego found it hilarious. Psychology calls this ""Narcissism"". With my last ex, she had a 4-year-old that was abandoned by her father and grew up with an emotionally abusive mother. She had her own tough-guy Ego bodyguard and jesus. Our fights were biblical. Both of our 4-year-olds were pulling each other's hair the whole time. She was the opposite of me, in the worst way possible. Psychology calls this ""Avoidant Attachment Style"" \*This is not meant to stir up old feelings.\* Your 4-year-old was the first person ever who genuinely, truly want to play with my 4-year-old. You see, my 4-year-old was so happy when he met you, and just wanted so badly to play. He listened to Etta James, over and over, ""At last, my love has come along. My lonely days are over, and life was like a song."" But alas, Ego was lurking. Waiting in the bushes for the slightest sign of danger. Jumpy and paranoid like a mall-cop who just got his tazer license. Main stage, your 4-year-old started sharing her candy, little by little, with my 4-year-old. My 4-year-old had been waiting for you his whole life, starving for 26 years. She saw that my 4-year-old had some pretty awesome toys, but was shy asking me to share. But my 4-year-old just wanted to share everythinggg. It was his first real play date ever and he was exciteddd. Every once in a while, Ego would pop up and throw a hissy fit. Like the time at the airport, after the run, the time you were cleaning your room, or the time you went to take care of a roommate. My Ego attacked your 4-year-old over innocent mistakes, seeing them as a threat to my 4-year-old's vulnerability. And often, your Ego got defensive of her 4-year-old, and rightfully so. But then I saw something I've never witnessed before in my entire adult life until I met you. I saw your 4-year-old tell your Ego to calm down. And your Ego listened. Then, they both smiled at my Ego and said, ""It's going to be okay."" What is this sorcery? Psychology calls it ""Secure Attachment Style"". \*This is not meant to guilt trip you.\* 2 weeks leading up to that fateful weekend, my Ego spent the whole time getting his shit kicked in by all the other Egos at his office. They were smarter, stronger, faster... meaner. My 4-year-old spent 2 straight weeks, 10-12 hours a day, trembling behind a bruised Ego valiantly taking all the punches. All the other 4-year-olds were way cooler than him and it reminded him of high school. My 4-year-old was afraid my Ego might die, and then there would be no one to protect him. So he closed off, shut down, and isolated himself. And every time he tried or needed to interact, he would be thrown back into the safe space he built for himself and Ego. But your 4-year-old walked my 4-year-old to work every morning, and kissed him goodbye, wishing him a good day. And when my 4-year-old came home each day, he was just so happy and relieved to finally see his best friend. Every day that passed, their bond grew so much stronger than the day before. They would play like it was nobody's business. They even played in a forest one time. Meanwhile, your Ego would be sleeping, trusting that your 4-year-old was alright. During this time, my Ego was getting some much needed rest, but always slept with one eye open. You see, his situation was dire - he had internal bleeding and needed urgent medical care. A real EAP emergency. Ignoring the warning signs, he said, ""Meh. Help is for pussies."" My Ego had never taken a vacation day over his 9 years of service as a bodyguard, and he just really needed to gtfo. And ptfo. Take a ride to candy land and just disappear for 3 days. Of course, he was too ashamed to admit that he would take my 4-year-old on such a dangerous trip. My 4-year-old thought, ""Well, if Ego needs this, I'll go with him."" \*This is not a manipulation tactic.\* A week prior, your 4-year-old gifted my 4-year-old her favorite toy, and my 4-year-old was bewildered. He'd never seen such a shiny, pretty toy in his life. And on Friday, right before the weekend, my 4-year-old gave your 4-year-old his favorite toy, and your 4-year-old was moved to tears. We said, ""I love you"" to each other, and they were both pretty darn amazing toys. They fit perfectly together, like two pieces of a puzzle. They trusted each other with it. Our kids were fascinated with each other's toys like never before. And then my Ego and my 4-year-old took a camping trip together. Ego injected a powerful sedative into my 4-year-old, and he went under. Then, my Ego spent the entire weekend drinking himself stupid. Ego knew he should've gone to the hospital and get some help, but he's always been a tough guy. He neglected himself, and the 4-year-old he was meant to protect. And when they came back, they saw you were sick and both my Ego and my 4-year-old were concerned, yet clueless. But your 4-year-old... What a remarkable child. She saw something on Monday that scared her so badly, but she made a deal with her Ego to keep it quiet for my 4-year-olds sake. Your 4-year-old must've really liked playing with our toy. But on Wednesday, your 4-year-old couldn't take the fear anymore and both your Ego and your 4-year-old stood, side by side, and said gently, with love and tenderness, ""I want to keep playing with you. Do you want to keep playing with me?"" \*This is not meant to be romantic.\* My 4-year-old jumped up and tried to scream ""YES!"" But this was code RED for Ego in the danger department. He'd been training for this moment his whole life. He started getting flashbacks from his days in 'Nam. He remembered how his 4-year-old had been hurt by his parents, and his instincts kicked into overdrive. His 4-year-old was going crazy, so he locked that child behind a secure door. He knew he shouldn't have trusted anyone. ""TRAITORS!"", he yelled, advancing forward to attack. My 4-year-old crying and screaming ""STOP! Be careful of our toy!"" But Ego couldn't hear. He was never the careful type. He stepped on the precious toy our 4-year-olds used to play with, and it cracked. But to Ego it was just a toy. Trivial compared to protecting his 4-year-old from danger. Over the next 5 days that followed, while there were moments our 4-year-olds tried to play together, our favorite toy was cracked. It didn't feel right. Both our 4-year-olds were sad, and wondered if it could ever be the same again. \*This is not meant to cause you even more pain.\* Then on Sunday, your Ego and 4-year-old had to go tend to a roommate emergency. And to be honest, my 4-year-old was just sad that our toy was cracked. He started to cry, so Ego got up, out of reflex, burdened by his PTSD, broken and unbalanced from his camping trip. He stumbled, and didn't see where he was stepping, and broke our toy into a thousand pieces. The best toy ever. Both of our 4-year-olds' hearts stopped, a moment frozen in time. Both of our Egos stopped as the gravity of my mistakes hit all 4 of us, all at once. Your Ego and 4-year-old cried, and went home to discuss. My 4-year-old screamed at Ego. ""I DON'T NEED YOU ANYMORE. I HATE YOU. HOW COULD YOU?"" My Ego did not know how to react. 3 days passed, and my 4-year-old couldn't bear to face what he felt was coming. So Ego stepped in, ""Can't we keep playing?"" and, ""Can't we get this toy fixed?"" were not good enough reasons to keep playing with a broken toy. In this moment, he knew, he screwed up. And then... the best friend my 4-year-old ever had said goodbye to him, and hung up on the count of 3, 2... 1. \*This is not meant to justify anything.\* My 4-year-old screamed and cried like Ego never seen before. He was hurting worse than the time he was abandoned at the amusement park, worse than being abandoned on that highway 22 years ago. It hurt so much more because my 4-year-old knew that he was loved properly this time. Even Ego was just starting to get used to the idea of his female counterpart. Both our 4-year-olds had the best toy in the world, and Ego broke it. Over the next 6 days, my 4-year-old could neither eat nor sleep. My Ego could not get over the guilt and slipped into a coma. All of my friends' 4-year-olds came to comfort my 4-year-old, and he felt a little better. But at the end of each day, and at the start of each morning, he missed his best friend so, so much. He missed kissing her goodnight. He missed how she walked him to work each day. He missed his rock, his angel, the love of his life. He thought they would spend the rest of their lives together with their favorite toy. It was impossible to accept because she was true. She was kind, funny, playful, real and amazing in every way and stupid Ego got in the way. He didn't want Ego to protect him anymore. \*This is not meant to instill false hope.\* On day 7, Ego woke up to my 4-year-old desperately trying to see how the old toy once used to fit together. Trying to piece the broken pieces together, fruitlessly trying to make sense of it all. ""Stop, kid. You're embarrassing yourself,"" he said. My 4-year-old snapped, ""I'll never forgive you."" ""I'm sorry, kid. I've failed you as a bodyguard. I don't think I could ever forgive myself."" Ego replied. ""All I wanted was to love and be loved,"" my 4-year-old whispered, ""and I had finally found it."" Ego's voice shook as he spoke, ""Kid, I just didn't want to see you get hurt like last time. The last time you loved, your parents broke you, remember? You had no choice, remember?"" My 4-year-old stood up, brushed the dust off, bravely looked straight into Ego's eyes and said, ""But I'm not broken. I'm still here."" And behold, for the first time in their lives, the two of them had their first conversation. ""Come on, Ego. Let's face that memory together."" said the 4-year-old, embracing his cathartic courage. So they went back to the amusement park, with the help of a registered clinical time-machine. Ego saw my parents trying to hurt me, and his reflexes fired up. My 4-year-old said ""Stop. Just let it happen."" Ego reluctantly backed off, flinching at the thought of the hand striking his little boy. But the blow mysteriously never landed. Psychology calls it ""Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy"". My 4-year-old said, ""Remember how my best friend's pair used to act? Like they were in-sync, communicating with each other, listening to each other. Wanna try that, Ego?"" ""Yeah kid, let's try that. Talk to me. Tell me what you need."" Psychology calls it ""Mindfulness training"". Then they went to get massages. The royal deluxe-luxury spa treatment. All this work gets tiring, doesn't it? Plus it feels pretty damn good. Psychology calls it ""Meditation"". But sometimes baby, these two miss you. So, very, very, much that it feels like an earthquake is happening. But then they hold hands and chant, ""This too shall pass."" They hold each other tightly. And sometimes, in that embrace, they feel a security in each other that they've never known before. And once the earthquake passes, they smile at each other. Psychology calls it ""Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"". I thought my life began when I was 19. But in reality, it began 12 days and 1 hour ago. For the first time in their lives, they're learning to appreciate each other. My 4-year-old is learning to appreciate Ego, to be grateful of all the wins and his bodyguard services. And my Ego is learning to trust, to give my 4-year-old the freedom to play on this scary playground we call Earth. On good days, I hear my 4-year-old say, ""Thanks for protecting me, Ego. But I'm a big kid now"". And I hear Ego reply, ""Meh. Kid's gonna be alright."" \*This is not meant to rekindle.\* My 4-year-old and Ego are only starting to get to know each other. They've got a long way to go before they can trust each other the same way I saw your Ego trust your 4-year-old. Baby, it was you who put them on this path to learn about each other, love each other, and heal each other, and for that I will be eternally grateful. But that's not everything! My friends have some things they want to share: ""Ego here. The kid went to the office alone on Friday while I was in a coma. And it was uncanny. He just started saying 'hi' to everyone like a freakin weirdo. And the weirdest part? Everyone smiled and said 'hi' back. Now he's going for lunch and coffee and shit. Making my job a goddamn nightmare... Just kidding... Kinda."" Baby, it was you who helped me see my coworkers in a whole new light! Without Ego, I opened up and shared with my coworkers about the hard time I was going through, and when they saw my 4-year-old, they let their Egos down and showed me so much kindness and support. I see them now, as individuals with their own stories and virtues. Actually, I see everyone, even strangers this way now and it's inexplicably enlightening. I see the world and each individual's own hidden 4-year-olds and Egos. This perspective might not have been possible without you. ""Kid here. My little brother and I talked about our parents the day after my best friend (that's you!) said goodbye. Then we flew to LA and spoke to them. We told our Egos to sit still and trust us, and it was the hardest thing we ever did. We told our parents that we were scared, but that all we want to do is forgive them and love them. Then the craaaaziest thing happened. Their 4-year-olds came out to play. They're really shy though. I never thought that they might have their own 4-year-olds too, who just wanted to be loved. We just shared our first candy with each other."" And baby... For this last gift, with all my words, I can't even begin to express my gratitude. I tricked myself into thinking I forgave them, but I never truly did. My Ego only covered it up with all my accomplishments - I ignored my wounds, and they were festering. I never forgave my past because I never confronted it. I buried my trauma, and it always kept coming back to haunt me when I'm at my most vulnerable in the form of my Ego. But baby, you gave me the gift of helping my family heal. After 26 years. You once said that I taught you how to love... but in reality, it was you who taught me how to love. And for that... I will always and forever, love you. The most amazing woman I ever met gave me the most amazing gift I ever received - a chance to become my best self. Thank you so much for being born, baby. Thank you so much for coming into my life when you did. Thank you so much for giving me your best, for trusting me, for believing in me, for inspiring me. Thank you so much for teaching me the most valuable lessons I'll ever learn in my life. Thank you so much for loving me, and for showing me how to love myself. For showing me how to love the right way. Thank you so much, and goodbye. ""Dear Universe, I just wanna say thank you... for sending me my rock, my guardian angel."" Sincerely and Gratefully, Your Sweet Tony"

I was a rebound.,3,9fwni4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/9fwni4/it_was_true_i_was_a_rebound/,2018-09-15 08:54:18,"I owe all my friends the biggest I told you so. Well, I just had my first breakup. I am 24yo/m dating a 24yo/m of whom I met on tinder. Ill spare the details but essentially, I found out over the course of two months that he had just broken up with his fianc of about 3 and a half years. His fianc cheated on him so he came running to me via a dating app. Our relationship was more than rocky. He could never commit fully because he still loved his ex. He reassured me that he would eventually get over it and asked for me to stay with him. Eventually I tried to break up with him on 6 different occasions and he kept pulling me back in with promises of never giving up because he always gets what he wants. He would call me 40 times in a row and verbally berate and abuse me into being in a relationship with him. Well, things got weird. He started not wanting to see me (we lived about an hour and a half away) to the point that we hadnt seen each other for a month during our two month relationship. We had sex during the first couple of weeks but it completely disappeared after and he wouldnt even go in the bathroom while I was in there. He told me though that he had an epiphany moment. He found out his ex moved in with another guy. For this reason, he told me I should stay with him now more than ever. Things started improving but soon started to careen off a cliff. He started saying that he was giving up on me and that he was too depressed to have a relationship both of which he promised would never happen. I let it go and we were done officially. Well, I made a mistake and got drunk a few days later. I decided to call him. He told me that he had been lying for about two weeks and that his ex had messaged him and they were back together. The wedding is back on too. He admitted to using me as a rebound and told me that he wouldnt let me break up with him because he is the one who breaks up, not the other way around. I was crushed and my trust was broken. Ive tried pursing 5 other guys none of which have been in an admitted relationship with me but have used me until I was no longer needed. My trust is broken and I am so discouraged. It took me forever to find my first relationship and I am soooo tired of using dating apps. Its hard to meet people in person when youre gay and in the university atmosphere Im in, even the guys in clubs tend to lean more toward hookups. I also run into the problem of physical attraction since Im somewhat overweight. This self esteem issue breeds vulnerability of which these past 6 guys must have taken advantage of. I just want to love someone who love me back equally. Additionally, I want someone who has the intention of loving me and not breaking my trust. I I need to vent so thats why I put this here. After 6 guys who have done this to me, do I have any hope left? "

If I unblock you now, I risk vulnerability and greater heartache than before, for the pain of not having you in my lonely life haunts me when I put that wall up, when I try to rid myself of these demons, so they never hurt you or anyone again.

I've been active on this sub and exnocontact for one and a half months now, and it seems that every other day I find a post so similar to my situation that either I or my ex could have written it. Hell, even tho I know my ex doesn't use reddit, sometimes the post is SO familiar that I'll go and look up the post history of the OP. It seems to me that a lot of people and relationships and breakups are really similar. I honestly don't know whether I love that thought or dread it. On one hand, I see so many of you beautiful people, so much raw emotion, vulnerability and love ready to be given to others. On the other, I read so many stories of people treating others like nothing, disregarding their feelings and just being complete assholes. I've been both through my time. I've been the dumper once, many years ago. I was the ex who wrecked another person emotionally, I was insensitive, I sent breadcrumbs and all of that. And I know it destroyed her for a long time. For at least a couple of years. But I've also been the dumpee. More than once. Now more than ever. I was so messed up for the first month. This was the second partner who cheated on me and it felt like something broke inside of me. Now I don't know whether to put my trust in people again, trust that I'll find someone who's worthy of me and whom I'm worthy of or to just give up and stop hoping that people will change. I'm just ranting at this point, but I just caught myself realising that people and relationships are really similar even though every situation is different. And I can't figure out why that scares me."

I want to write him an email and lay him out for how he used me and never loved me and et cetera.....but I know better. It wont solve anything. He will probably ignore it since he had long since devalued me and was well into discard before I pulled the plug. And at the very worst, it will just wake the dead. In the past, his silence and disconnect lasted just long enough for me to start emailing rage or tears or begging or indicating Im emotionally falling apart in some way. This caused him to rise up and start tearing me to shreds and reducing me to nothing and taking back control. And that is what I sure as hell DO NOT want anymore is to play into that abusive, controlling, beaten to a pulp emotionally drama game that was his contribution to our life together. Its so awful because Im grieving the fact that I was far from perfect but my love was true and unconditional and I was real and honest despite whatever shortcomings I had. And this was all one sided. Im having to face the fact that the fucker never reciprocated or loved me at all bc he is literally psychologically incapable. Bitter, bitter, bitter pills. [insert every manner of profanity here] And Im committing to walking through this misery because jumping into another relationship to avoid it will without a doubt just draw in another narc bc they sense pain and vulnerability on a woman like a shark senses blood in the water. This too shall pass, I know. It may pass like a kidney stone but it. Will. Pass. "

On medicine, on doctors. When I was a child, I always looked up to them. As for people who do the most meaningful work on the planet. Where are we up to them? Now I look different, because I understand how everything works. There are hundreds of ways to sell a placebo or simply waste your precious time with meaningless diagnostics and therapies. This is my case. She says that making money on hypochondriacs is okay. She seems doesn't understand. They steal her time too, through me. We hold hands, but I feel like we are separated by thousands of kilometers. We're in a cold bar that pretends to be cozy. We're sitting nearby. She is young, beautiful and contented and I'm trying my best to depict the craving for life on my face. I understand that I can't take it. My health is getting worse, I'm depressed. My mind running laps through fog. We are urban neurotics, united in alliances of joint pleasures. Our relationship is a symbiosis of talking about partnership, feminism, equality, which stick out of archaic role models. I have a paranoia that I am a victim of my authority. She often respond me with my statements, which means that we have a father's daughter relationship diagnosed. The professional situation expert would have wrapped the entire complexity of the situation in a compact formula like: If you truly love, then.... After all, everything is actually very simple and fits in one sentence.I need to know what I'm doing, but I don't. I'm older, but this is my first time in this location. Monsters roam here, and you will surely die a couple of times before you figure out how to play. Three weeks later, I communicate with an American girl on Reddit. She cannot understand why the guy in depression left her. Now she's depressed. This means there is at least one person who has gone through the same thing as me. I feel relief. At the same time I feel sorry for her, she thinks that her lover does not love her, but he most likely does not care about the whole feminine gender at this moment. I am sharing my experience. Clause 1. Clause 2, 3. Post-factum everything is simple. I give an analogy about the cut leg. It is better to cut off the leg yourself and ride a wheelchair than to remain without a leg deep in the forest. I write that these are fundamental issues of trust and deep vulnerability, which we wrap up in I dont want to be a burden. I remember film Passengers, where the hero acted extremely selfishly, but they were waiting for a happy end. Inversion. Difficult decisions - klondike for screenwriters. I feel like a character of ""Saws"". Should I cut my leg or not? She wants attention, she wants me to kiss her. And I am a endorphin candies machine, which is filled with barberry. It puts pressure on me, saying that I dont want it and go inside. She goes to the toilet. Probably crying. Returns, sits opposite, waits. I'm leading. She sits and waits, what will happen next, apparently something suspects. We order dinner. I begin to mumble about the fact that I am a burden for her and I cant do this anymore. I voice my emotions, sort out the strings, it bears me. She reads me. Reacts. In favor of a compromise. I feel that there is no going back. My fears and doubts crystallize at this moment, I say that we must part. The brain rebels, this is a counter-evolution! I lay plans for God, he will be disappointed. I already feel that I am inside the photo, which will be imprinted in my mind. She pretends that she understands me, as if we speak words. The time for words is over. We are burning. I want to hide. Her ego is broken. I say template words of support. She stops me, for her it is humiliating. Then she wishes me recovery. I curl, this is a sore subject, for a person already a stranger. I share my feelings with her, but she is already somewhere far away, she starts a protective mechanism. I understand it hurts. And at the same time I wonder: young, beautiful, healthy, and I am a shit that cant handle it. How can this hurt her ego? And she doesnt understand how can I be so cold. They brought dinner. My stomach twists, she doesn't touch food. People love each other, but the world is harder. I am trying to convey the maximum meanings in two minutes. What for? You either go here or there. Thoughts are confused. She asks to leave. We go to the Lower Shaft st., we walk, nothing has changed from the outside. We are great. Smart. Adaptive. It took only twenty minutes, and we are strangers. We think that we know how our bodies will react, and we are trying to get ahead of the injury. A good plan, but it never works. I'm going after her. I do not know what to add. I am responsible for the eight-dimensional solution. Do I need to say something? What can I say, what did not said in a year? It seems to me that I said all the possible combinations of phrases, but she still thinks that all of this to hurt her. Word combinatorics. She requests me to hug her. She thinks that it will give something, I think it will be easier for me not to touch her. This is not how it works. She stops me, we call a taxi. We think that our chemistry lives inside communication. After all, we first say the words, and then we sleep with each other. Deeply traumatic fact that everything is exactly the opposite. Our communication lives inside chemistry. I share this with a friend. Every parting - I am faced with this fact, your anti-sex destroys everything that you have erected. A friend is relaxed, without too much pathos, says, your model of the world will always live with her. Nothing supernatural, but the phrase with a long needle pierces my depressive brain and frees me from jealousy and a feeling of incompleteness. Words of wisdom. I am relieved, and I turn to whining about doctors and Ukrainian medicine. It seems today I will fall asleep."

We met each other while at school in New York. After graduating we lived together for about 1.5 years. This past Christmas she bought us tickets to see Hamilton on our anniversary, then two weeks later she asked me to move out at once and not to ask any further questions about it. I would ask her regularly if she was happy with our relationship. She would always tell me she was. I would ask if there was anyway I could improve myself as a boyfriend. She said I was imperfectly perfect. Then all at once I had the rug pulled out from under me, no warning signs. She said she had been unhappy for months and was lying to me every time I asked if she was happy. Without giving me time to process she wanted me out of her life forever. I asked what she wanted out of a relationship, if there was anything to fix. She said there was nothing to fix. A couple months prior I confessed to her that I had been struggling with depression. She was the first person I ever told. I thought I could trust her because she had been on anti-depressants for years. I had only ever wanted to be there for her when she had a panic attack or needed comforting. The night she broke up with me she told me she felt like she had to walk on eggshells around me ever since I confessed to her. I would never throw her vulnerability back into her face like that. I felt betrayed. I didnt want to escalate the situation so I did what she asked. Her mom bought us the condo (she comes from money) so I had no choice but to move out, leaving all my belongings with her until I could find time to rent a moving truck. When I came back to move out she wasnt there but had pushed all my belongings into a corner without asking me first, including a brand new TV which now has a scratch down the side. She later told me she was just doing me a favour by helping me move out. I paid for half the furniture she insisted on keeping so she wrote me a check for it. I felt like she was just flaunting her familys wealth every step of this process. I moved back in with my parents. Im still there today because I cant afford my own place. I found out a couple months later that she was posting pics of her with my best friend (M21). His girlfriend broke up with him two weeks before mine broke up with me. Now theyre proudly declaring their love on instagram. I went from sad to angry very quickly, especially since the last time I talked to him he was offering emotional support in the wake of the breakup. I tried to take the high road every step of the way but I feel like Ive just been walked on. I was only ever truthful and I feel like Ive been taken advantage of. It was the longest relationship Ive ever been a part of. I never even had a date in high school or in college for my first degree. I put all my eggs in this basket and she ended up talking to me like wed only known each other for a couple months. Ive been seeing someone else (F35) casually the past couple months, I recently turned 26 as well. But most of my thoughts are still on my ex and I just get angry and sad all the time. I feel drained, like I have no more love left to give or I dont want to be taken advantage of again. How can I trust someone else? How do I cope with feeling angry all the time with no way to express it? How can I tell when Im ready to move on?"

I recently found out the guy I was completely head over heels for was just using me until his ex gave him the time of day. I feel like my vulnerability was peeled back and the only purpose I served to him was to be a warm blanket until she would return. I found out when she messaged me and told me they hung out after months and months of her ignoring him. She doesnt even want to be with him. So, I finally realized it was an endless cycle of emotional immaturity and playing games with these two. When I came into the picture, he didnt see that because in his head: I had to be her. I couldnt be this person who wasnt going to play games, I didnt do xyz cause I did it abc. He even told me, Im sorry, its just different with her. It hurt me so much to read it, but now that two days have passed by, I see its because hes broken. He didnt heal, didnt change, he didnt gather his own pieces. He became the very person who hurt him and doesnt even see how because of this hes in a cycle he wont escape. Im extremely saddened that he couldnt see what I would have given him and that hes in this much pain to not let go. For some reason I asked that we spend some time apart and he agreed. So Im going to leave him alone. Because I want him to heal, to remember the person he was before his ex clouded his mind, to want to be better. As for me? Im going to forgive him. I understand why he did what he did. However, this does not mean my forgiveness will equate to me forgetting. To me, when there is pain there has to be meaning and what this means is that he is not ready for a relationship. So, For all of you getting ready to date someone serious and youre not over your ex or still pining over them: Just dont. You hurt and hinder your progress and you also hurt the person involved. "

We just became stagnant. And when things lie still, everything comes bubbling up. Real future talk. Trying to timeline each milestone or event to come. Four years of planning and growing together and evolving and trying and basing our whole relationship off the fact that relationships were work and then somehow we are now working each other to the ground. Crying in each others arms as we feel each other understanding and feeling nothing but empathy for one another. My heart is literally shattered because i love this man or the idea of this man or the hope of this man will be and he is crying in a way that I feel so In love with a vulnerability that I lust after as he realizes that he cant marry potential. That the me that he stares into the eyes of is just the potential of who he might want to marry who he may someday just really be able to wholeheartedly love bc she fulfilled her potential and then the sad understanding that I might just not live up to my potential and the stark new idea that maybe we loved the idea of each other. We had chemistry, once. High school sweethearts. We also had good puns and a love for late nights watching the office eating ice cream. Cookie dough for me and mint for him. Chemistry aside, the most we had to power our Prius relationship was time! I say prius bc we ran smoothly and even if we hit a bump we were safe and cautious and wouldnt fall apart also we were pretty efficient saved money and regenerative breaking! Every time we had a feeling we might stop we just recharged up with some feel good snacks and movies and kisses. Thanks for coming up to see me by way of train. Sorry we talked and hugged and kissed and somehow got into our feelings and state of being and somehow talked our ways into a mutual heartbreak. Sorry that our relationship has evolved into something new. But maybe sorry will turn into its a good thing someday but for today as I drop you off at our friends house because there are no more trains and no more late night snuggles it will be sorry because Im sorry we were almost perfect.

223,vulnerability,BreakUps,Missing you today,1,8zdf3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8zdf3u/missing_you_today/,2018-07-17 04:28:41,"All weekend I was in a bummed-out mood. All I could think about was how I will never feel your touch ever again. I will never feel your hands ever again. I will never feel your lips ever again. I will never be intimate with you ever again. I do not know if you think of me that way or if you have already moved on. I imagine you are doing great right now and have not thought about us and what great thing that we had. I am sure that you have moved on and are being happy  and in a way I cannot be mad about that. I am only sad because I wanted to be a part of your happiness, but it quickly showed that you wanted to be alone and have no part of me. That is why I left. Why should I make somebody feel as if they must be here with me, when in reality they did not want to be? I think that you loved me, but you werent in love with me leading up to this. I can honestly say that I never felt that way. I have always loved you and I can still say that I am in love with you. But at the same time, I hate you. I can still feel those feelings of anger when you would always put me in second place. Hindsight is 20/20 and I remember all those times you made me feel like a fool. You told me you would never give upyet you did. You told me you would never replace me with anybodyyet you did. You would always tell me how I was the best thing to ever come across your pathyet you gave up so easily. You told me we could get through anything togetheryet we are here now. I honestly ask myself why didnt you have the balls to let me go, and give me a false sense of hope. I can honestly say that I remember our good times, as much as I work to erase them from my memory. I am haunted by your shadows and your touch. I try my best to erase your face from my mind, and while I can forget sometimes, I will never forget your love. But I will never forget how you made me feel towards the end. I admit that I have my faults and said some stupid things, but I never once put anybody elses needs above yours. I worked so hard in school to build a future for us. Sacrificing time with you to study long hours and work extra hours in the office. I was so excited to come back home this summer. To get that time back with you. I can remember racing back home to see you, just to see that you changed and that your heart was no longer there for me. I reached out to you several days after our breakup, just to see how you were and if we could rekindle our 2 year long relationship. Instead, I see that you are happy with him, living guilt free. I immediately regretted sending you that text of vulnerability, that moment of my heart, which you supposedly cared about. And for that, I wish I had never met you. I love you, but I also hate you. "
224,vulnerability,BreakUps,Have you ever considered a personal mission statement?,5,91cmod,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/91cmod/have_you_ever_considered_a_personal_mission/,2018-07-24 10:33:33,"Hey, /r/breakups! Thought I'd break away from the usual rabble to offer some advice I was given from a mentor. This dude is one of my favorite people on this planet, successful, and just an all-around good dude. I was surprised to learn, however, that when asked about his ""5 year plan"" he mentioned he didn't have one. At 41, this guy is kicking ass in entrepreneurship and social enterprise with a loving family. Of course deals with daily hardships but he told me that, rather than a 5 year plan, he lives by a daily mission statement. This threw me off because I feel like we hear all the time how we should have our 5 year plan set in mind. I also get the question, and love asking, where do you see yourself in 5 years? I think it's okay to think about the future, but sometimes thinking about the future too much may plague us with anxiety and distract from the future, so I offer a different perspective for you today. Take it or leave it, but I will share my personal mission statement that I've crafted since we had that conversation. It's taken from some talks and a song you may find familiar... I read it ever so often to re-align and remind myself of what's important. ""I am worthy of love and belonging. Validation comes from within. I will go through life with a sense of courage - the courage to be imperfect, and to tell the story of who I am with my whole heart - to accept the uncertainty of life and the universe. I will practice compassion and be kind to myself - and only then can I be kind to others. I will practice connection as a result of authenticity and let go of what I think others think I should be. I will fully embrace vulnerability - what makes me vulnerable makes me beautiful. I will say I love you first. I will do things with no guarantees. I will breathe through waiting and be patient in life, even though things may not work out. This is fundamental. The way to live is with vulnerability, and to stop controlling and predicting. I cant selectively numb emotions - I must experience sadness and happiness; grief and gratitude. I will let myself be seen deeply, love with my whole heart - even though theres no guarantee, and practice gratitude and joy in the moments of terror - feeling vulnerable means Im feeling alive. I believe that I am enough. I will just be. From the darkest experiences in my life, I will forge meaning, build identity, and share my joy with the rest of the world. And I will be a fortress for others to come when they experience darkness."""

It wasn't a very long relationship (less than a year), but I haven't felt an attachment/ partnership with someone for a few years, and he was the first. He also came into my life right after after a heartbreaking incident I had with my ex from a 9 year relationship that left me shattered and heavily depressed. I fully own up to the fact that it's my issue that I continue to think about him and haven't been able to fully severe the attachment. I do believe I have attachment issues that make me feel this way, and that I am not happy with any other area of my life, and so my heart is yearning for that connection. Acknowledged, and slowly trying to work on these things. We broke up because I couldn't trust him - which I communicated so that we can work on it, but he did not put in any effort. I eventually found enough evidence so that he admitted to cheating. To what extent, I guess I will never know for sure, since I don't trust what he tells me. What I do trust is that it hurt him for us to break up, at least for a while. I witnessed the evidence of heartbreak, anger, depression, etc. from him that can't be faked. He had mentioned many times that he wanted children with me, wanted to marry me, wanted me to move in with him. Way too fast, which worried me.. I felt like it wasn't about me, but about him. He's joked that he wanted to trap my ass by putting a baby in me.. One of the reasons (of many) why I couldn't trust him was because I couldn't fully connect with him. It was like trying to dig deeper but only to hit concrete a few feet down. Something felt off, not genuine, when he told me he loved me. I broke up with him after I confronted him about the cheating. We kept in contact for 3 more months after that (mainly just me voicing my anger, how much I miss him, my jumbled emotions, etc), and I haven't talked to him for over a month now. After the BU, he mentioned having had watched Bene Brown's vulnerability TED talk, and having to work on vulnerability. I just watched it again, and connecting all the dots I think I've realized why he had cheated on me when he claims he was happy with me and wanted to marry me. He was unable to be vulnerable because of shame. He didn't think he was good enough and I think he put up such a front when he was pursuing me that he realized he can't keep up the facade. He told me his insecurities - a few exes have cheated on him in the past, and have told him some hurtful things when they broke up. I think it hurt him a lot. He had fears about fertility, not being in good shape, the size of his penis, etc. He enjoyed admiration of people - this is something he told me directly. Like I said, he wanted things like a house, children, a dog, etc., but was in pretty deep consumer debt in a very expensive city where he spends 50% of his income on rent. For most parts, I can see it. During our relationship he focused on a lot on himself, wasn't happy with his work, and had big dreams for his future, without any clear or concrete plan to make it happen. He kept talking about these dreams, and it unnerved me; I am a realist, and have been a responsible person most of my life. It didn't sit well with me that he seemed to have lofty goals about career and money but had no idea how to get there, and did not seem motivated to begin. When he found out how much money I earned (70% more than him), he was very driven in applying to jobs, and kept saying how he was very underpaid and should be paid at least 30% more than what he was getting paid.. I think he realized that during his lovebombing in the beginning the relationship, he put up too much of a front, and as time went on, he wasn't able to keep it up. He was expecting me to exit the relationship and so he was preparing for it by falling back on his exes, and fooling around with random women he meets (he is a good looking guy so girls tend to fall for him easily). The thing is, he wasn't far from the truth. As our relationship progressed, I started seeing more and more things that made me feel like we weren't compatible as life partners. I am ashamed of this, but I swiped on dating apps in the relationship, and even went out for a coffee with a doctor while we were together. It was just a friendly conversation, no flirting or contact or anything, but I am not proud of it. Watching the video and understanding the thing about his inability to be vulnerable made me tear up. The thing is, yeah, there was a lot of fronting and lovebombing and rebounding, insecurities and doubt, but I really cared about him. I was attached and he was my best friend and partner. My anger has since dissipated after 6 months and honestly I'm the type to give a lot to support my partner, as long as he's authentic about his feelings and being open with asking for help (showing vulnerability). I understand that it's been 6 months and he's likely moved on, and I don't expect anything from him at this point. I guess I'm writing this just to get it off my chest. I thought about writing him a letter after watching the video, but what's the point? Life is strange beans."

But now that outlet, this individual I've made so many memories with in such a short amount of time, has cut ties. I must admit towards the end we were having minor issues that weren't being resolved, and with me graduating college and not being in her life as often it would've been difficult to balence parts of our lives. At the same time, over time I recogized she looked out for herself more. She would look out for me, but not necessarily ""us,"" in terms of nurturing the relationship. I'll admit I had my issues that would come into play, but more of the growing apart was on her end whether she realizes it or not. I'm not trying to play the blame game, but she was typically occupied in her own bubble. Even when things were fantastic in the relationship when I'd bring up aspects of our future together (very general relationship topics such as keeping in touch and where we're going) she would typically say ""we'll figure that out when we cross that bridge."" While she loved me I feel she wasn't thinking about us, which slowly diminished how she felt without her realizing it for a bit. Her parents even thought she should've treated me better, but instead of addressing this issue at the time when she asked if I agreed with them, I just joked about it to avoid confrontation as I didn't see too much of a problem at the time. That was a small moment but I feel that could've possibly helped our relationship if it truly snowballed with the help of that issue over time. But the past is the past. If anything I learned about honesty in a relationship from that. Again, I did have my own issues but at least I felt I was open about those in the relationship. Despite all of this, it still hurts since she was my first love. The day after the breakup friends drove an hour up to visit ne and take me out to dinner, which it feels great to have an amazing support system. Afterwards we went back to my place to burn some gifts and etc. I got from my ex in my firepit. NOT OUT OF ANGER. I knew I couldn't keep anything on me. It was a way to let go. I deleted all her pictures and messages with her I had as well. The healing process is still moving slowly though. I'm out of college and unemployed in the same town I've lived all my life, and currently she is currently in a new city for the summer with an internship undoubtably propelling her in her career. I'm simply in a rut and that's my biggest issue I feel at the moment... I just want the pain and memories to go away.

How odd. So quickly you became a stranger. And now I sit here, and Im recalling your face, your scent, your arms, and I still can do that vividly. I hang on to it, because I feel like soon all that is left of my memory of you will start to blur. I already forgot how soft and affectionate your voice could be sometimes. I still remember the look though. I dont think Ill ever forget it. When you loved me. There was so much tenderness in you. I do recognize that you were mirroring me. I taught you this tenderness, this quiet, adoring vulnerability. I know I can find it somewhere else. But now I sit here, and when Im starting to get feelings that I once had for you for someone else, I cant help but be afraid that its you Im looking for. As if the old you, my lover, my sweetest everything, escaped your body and hid in someone else. Am I following this lead? Am I looking for who you once were in someone else? I guess its not a coincidence that he resembles you. But in many ways, he doesnt. Maybe Im merely trying to fill in the gaping hole that you ripped in my stomach when you left. But why? Its so easy to ignore it. I hardly ever cry anymore. Sometimes I can even forget about you. Its just when I really sit and think about it, it all comes back. Go. Go away. I dont need you here anymore. I dont want you here anymore. Please leave. Let me rebuild my sanity. I guess its more so that I miss being held by someone than being held by you. "

I couldnt imagine my eating disorder being able to get any worse than it had been. Surely I had gotten to the bottom with that, so I didnt understand what could possibly be my rock bottom if I hadnt already hit it. It turns out that hitting my actual rock bottom wasnt about the food directly, it was not about the frequency of binging and purging like I thought. It was about how my unhealthy relationship with food made me make poor choices that resulted in losing you, the incredible man and relationship I very much cherished, wanted and loved. Before hitting that rock bottom, I was trying to recover for you, for us. You said that wasnt enough, and I knew you were right. I didnt know where or how to find the drive inside of myself to do the hard work for me until I landed at rock bottom having lost you. It was in that despair that I realized I was not willing to let this ever happen again. **Ever**. My eating disorder has robbed me of **so much** in my life, but this was the loss that crossed the line of truly unacceptable. We had a great, happy, beautiful relationship that I valued so very much, and my eating disorder destroyed it. I was the happiest I had ever been and I lost it because I had never truly had it in me to fight for the quality of my life and do the work of recovery years ago like I let you believe I had. Losing you as a consequence of my eating disorder has lit fury and fire under my feet to do whatever it takes to fully recover so never again will I be in this place. I hope to experience Big Love again someday, only this time fully showing up authentically and transparently, without **any** secrets. In at last becoming truly willing, as I started taking complete and full responsibility for myself- no more excuses or self-victimizing of any kind, I have been able to start really shifting the destructive thinking patterns/behaviors. I have started having real success in letting go of the addict behaviors in favor of something more effective in getting the life I really want. The more success I am having in that, the more willing I have become, and it's become a rewarding feedback loop of positive momentum. But I had to first be willing and desperate enough to take the risk in doing things completely differently than I ever had, despite the overwhelming fears. I had always been more attached to my addiction than I could get myself to be to the hope that things could ever actually be different. I was never ready to make that blind leap of faith until I landed in the raw and painful place of **NEVER AGAIN**. I will never be the same. I am turning my life around and I am never going back. I **will** have a meaningful life full of love, joy, integrity, and peace. I hope that in recognizing my dedication, drive, and real efforts in making lasting changes you will be open to giving us another chance, in time. I would like the oppprtunity to love you from a healthy, balanced place of true self exposure and vulnerability, of **want** vs. **need**, and showing up for you with all of me as you always deserved. If you are unable to be open to that, I will be sad, but okay. I will accept and respect your needs, and wish you well on your continued path. And, I will forever look back on our relationship with immense gratitude for being the stepping stone in getting me to the place where I was finally willing to do everything it takes to get well, for **me**. You have been my greatest love, and also my rock bottom. You were my turning point, and that is the greatest gift anyone could have ever given me. For that, I send you my deepest thanks, for always. Be well. All my love, D"

I know nobody can know this for sure, but guesses and insight would mean a lot. This is long. I'm sorry. I started seeing this man late 2016. It was a strange time in both of our lives: I (24f)was in my last year of uni + set on attending law school on the other side of the country, while he (33m) was juggling a series of women and about to move out of town for work. Basically, we weren't looking for anything serious from one another. Despite this, within 5 minutes of meeting him I felt like I had known him my entire life. There was this complete and immediate trust. The first time I stayed over he left me alone with a key to his apartment and I'm pretty sure he's the only person I've ever actually been myself with. The first few months were intense (and the sex was insane) but things got rough quick. He would cancel dates last minute, sometimes take days to text back and would go from enthused to indifferent about seeing me. This took a toll on my self esteem and I became wildly self destructive. I told him that we shouldn't see each other anymore because I was falling for him and he was clearly not that into me. I thought that was that, but we reconnected a month later. He told me that whether we're friends or lovers, we should be in each other's lives. So we agreed to be friends, he moved away for work and we quickly began sleeping together again. At this point things were kind of great. He made an effort, never blew me off and despite the distance we managed to see each other regularly. We'd take turns visiting + playing house and he was the most supportive partner I've ever had. We'd fall asleep reading in bed, had some golden in-jokes and never let each other forget that the world was beautiful. Cute shit. When things were good, we made each other really happy. That said, we had serious issues. He was uncomfortable with the debt I'd have upon finishing law school. He didn't like that I wanted to go to school far away. We were both sleeping with other people and I found myself getting really jealous. He really wants kids, and I won't be able to manage that for a long time. And so just after I graduated, he ended things. I found myself broke, unemployed, on the fence about law school and wanting a real relationship. He told me he's looking for someone to settle down with, and that I need to grow up and figure out what I'm doing with my life. He was right, but I was devastated. That night we said we loved each other while sober and fully conscious for the first time. About a month later we really tried platonic. With the exception of one drunken evening, we actually managed to keep our hands off each other. Things got awkward and nostalgic. Immediately after breaking up I applied to schools across the country, which really bothered him. Meanwhile I hated not getting the same attention from him that I used to. This continued for months until I get a late night drunk text from him telling me to meet him at a nearby bar. I show up, we get hammered and he takes me outside to talk. He tells me to ghost the new guy I've been seeing. We talk about baby names, what our different futures look like and how you know you should spend your life with someone (though I don't know why we even had these conversations given we were never in a relationship). I tell him that I love him, that being friends makes me sad and wish him the best for his future. We both go home with other people and the next morning he leaves for vacation with another other girl. His friend later tells me that he loves me, but can't marry me. Now we haven't spoken in 3 months. I've since accepted an offer from my first choice school, started dating someone who doesn't make me insane and am finally taking care of myself. But I still think of him every day. I recently reached out to apologize for everything and see if he wanted to catch up before I have to move. He ignored my text and its kinda killing me. I don't want to be with him anymore, but I also don't want to never see him again. I just had to get past that part of our relationship before I could be friends. Now I just feel like he never cared. And maybe he didn't. And I have no idea how to reconcile that without being terrified to fall in love again. I don't think I can ever trust anyone with that kind of vulnerability ever again. TL;DR Was on/off with this guy for a year and we ended on messy terms. Haven't spoken for months and our lives are now in different places so I ask if he wants to be friends/catch up. He never responded. Does this mean he never loved me? "

It's been exactly a year since we broke up. We were together for three years almost to the day. I moved from Georgia up to Michigan with him for his career. He decided two years later that he wasn't in love with me anymore. Literally wanted to die. Could not figure out how to continue my life, whether to go back home to Georgia, whether to stay in Michigan. I stayed and started an LLC for my photography and now have a clientele base and roots here. I met someone. Started dating him a few weeks ago, almost exactly a year after me and my ex broke up. He's so different...communicates his feelings, asks me questions, genuinely wants to know about my childhood, my family...small things that I never realized I was missing out on with my ex, someone whom I never saw cry, never asked me personal or emotional questions, often avoided them. Anyway, saw the ex yesterday, got to genuinely catch up on life--our families, our jobs, our friends. Looked eachother in the eyes and I saw that we still cared about eachother but not in that way. It was the first time I had looked at him and not wanted to cry. It was the first time I looked at him and felt happiness since the break-up. He is living the life he thought I was preventing him from--three hockey teams, three frisbee teams, well over 40 hour work week--he's miserable. No one to talk to. Says dating is hard, he can't connect with anyone. I got to tell him I have a boyfriend. It felt so nice, I didn't think I'd get here. A year is probably a short time frame to bounce back and I may have a day down the road where I do want to cry about the past and that's okay. I just want you to know that seeing him yesterday--I didn't NOT love him anymore. I just saw myself in him, my past in him, and felt a bittersweet kind of love. Not a longing, romantic love. I saw him and remembered the me without inhibitions and my vulnerability. I saw his rigid cheekbones and remembered how I would rub them with my thumb when I cradled his head in my hands. Seeing him conjured up loving feelings about myself, not necessarily about him as a person, just the type of person I'm capable of being again for someone else. It's a weird but warm feeling."
235,vulnerability,BreakUps,Thoughts,3,8igwpt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8igwpt/thoughts/,2018-05-11 04:06:02,"I wish we could have talked about what you felt was wrong before it was unbearable for you. I think we both were struggling to compensate for previous codependent relationships by being extra independent. For you, this meant behaving like you were single but having the significantOther property filled by me. But there was no balance with you doing your own thing and prioritizing our relationship. For me, this was an awakening to realizing I don't want complete independence. I want interdependence. To be our own person, but still have intimacy, vulnerability, and things that are just ours. To show up to parties as a couple, go our own ways sometimes, but be each other's rocks. To strengthen each other. It wasn't like that. I gave you more value and priority in my life than you gave me in yours. This made me jealous, a crying mess when I felt like I had to compete for your attention. You would text friends when you were with me, but you weren't texting me when you were with them. At parties, I was largely ignored. When you asked for space, it meant no contact from me, but you could get your emotional fix from other places. I couldn't rely on you, but you could rely on me. I started to feel like a trophy. Something you glance at for an ego stroke, but you weren't willing to polish. When you broke up with me, it was the first time we were having this conversation. I thought that my jealousy was my own problem, a result of my anxiety and insecurities. What I didn't realize was that I had been so accomodating that I hadn't vouched for my own needs. I wonder what would have been different had I attempted to say, ""Hey, why can't we act more like a couple?"" To maybe define what being a couple meant to both of us, a definition that would work for us. You came to this conversation with your mind made up. There was no discussion. It was over. And I want to accept that I deserve someone willing to show up and work on what isn't working. It just feels like we didn't really have a shot. You booked it, didn't want something serious. You'd rather have nothing than fight for the really beautiful moments that we had. This is the closest I've ever come to what I think heartbreak is. And I know it'll take time. It hurts, but I know someday I won't care anymore. I just wish we could have talked."
236,vulnerability,BreakUps,The gift that keeps on giving...,1,8isp3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8isp3a/the_gift_that_keeps_on_giving/,2018-05-12 11:01:00," Thanks for reading, but this is going to be a long one. In an effort to quell my own heart-break, I've been coming on this subreddit for the past few months(The split occurred a little over 3 months ago) . Not to post a thread, mind you, but to offer advice. Vicarious healing. For some unknown reason, the past couple of weeks have been brutal for me. It was a 4 year relationship I knew had run it's course. On my end, the romantic love wasn't there anymore. I still cared deeply about her. This was part of the reason it didn't end sooner. I couldn't bear to see her in pain. There were times I tried to break it off, but her sobbing tore me to absolute shreds. My heart would break with hers. Every time I would take it back and tell her, ""It's okay sweetheart... I wont abandon you. We'll work on things. Let's try just ONE more time."" You know what they say, make-up sex is the best sex. Over and over again I tried to convince myself that I could fall back in love with her. ""For the love of God, why can't I love her?!?!? She's too sensitive, I CAN'T let her be alone! She might hurt herself!"" A little of our history; the start of the relationship was catalyzed by drugs. I knew were the drugs were, she wanted them. I was a seasoned veteran. Done every drug under the sun. She was a newbie. One night, after getting some pot, we hooked up. A recent break-up had left me lonely. She seemed a bit immature for me, but vulnerability got the best of me. Drugs were a constant bother for us. While I was high, romance came easy. When I wasn't, the thought would cross my mind, ""What the hell are you doing with her, man?"" It came to a point where I felt a need to grow up. A new job at a law firm forced me to get clean. She however, had no willpower. No willpower, and a terrible liar. Doing drugs behind my back. Now, realizing I'm not blameless in her addiction, I offered to pay for her to go through medical detox and rehab. She was in college, so she felt there was no time for her to do something like that. The, ""I'll quit when things settle down"" mentality. I would tell her, ""Look, a college degree is nothing if you're a drug addict. Take a semester off and detox. No reason not to."" Pressure from her parents to finish college kept her from taking my advice. Now, on to the meat and potatoes. My best friend(an ex of mind, actually) came up to me one day in tears. Apparently, my girlfriend had bragged to her about cheating on me with our old drug dealer. Confronting her about this lead to a break-up. The day after, following a frantic desperate phone call from her, in my usual cowardly fashion, I took her back. ""I forgive you. We'll work on it, ONE MORE TIME."" Things actually went more or less well for about 2 months. She had tapered herself down from painkillers. I was very proud of her. It seemed as though she was in a good place. For the first time ever we were both sober(so I thought). She suggested one day, out of the blue, that we break up. A little nervousness crept into me about going into the single world, but I remained optimistic. I told her I thought it would be good for both of us. We both wanted to remain friends. As the conversation went on, she told me that she had been doing herion every day for the past 3 weeks. I told her to please go to rehab. Still, she was resistant to the idea. My credit card bill came in the next day. In the 3 days she had my credit card, she spent over $100 dollars on gas. I went and got the credit card, gave her a good scolding too. I knew it was to drive her drug buddies all over the place, she probably was trading gas for drugs too, as she couldn't pull out money. I got a wild hair up my ass and went through her phone. If she's going to steal money from me, I want to see exactly what she's doing with it. Now it became clear why she was so content with a break up. She had been fucking her herion dealer for about a month. Even though my feelings for her had faded, jealousy got to me. I walk up to her, stick the phone in her face, incriminating texts open. Then I tell her, ""You know what, you've done it again. You betrayed me again. I'm going to tell your parents you're a smack head.""(They pay for her college, so this would be bad news for her) She proceeds to tell me, ""Go ahead, I already told them you're a drug addict liar. They wont believe you."" I pull out her wallet, go where I knew she kept her drugs, pull her bag of newly purchased herion out, and proceed to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet. The entire walk down the hallway she is slapping me over the head, HITTING me with her class ring that she had turned around to her palm yelling, ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY LIFE, I FUCKING HATE YOU!"" I pour it out, she starts punching me. I tell her I'm going to call the police if she doesn't stop. I drive home, suddenly jealously in love with her again... heartbroken. I realize I'm rambling. I'll come to a close now. I saw in her in a different light that night. No pity, no remorse. Dead inside. She doesn't care that I'm hurt by her cheating on me. She wants to fuck boys and do drugs. That's all she gives a shit about. ""How can someone that you cared about so much, be so evil to you?"" HOW? You lead her on for 4 years, got her ON drugs, got yourself OFF of drugs, and pushed her into the arms of a herion dealer! She felt the distance, THAT'S WHY SHE KEPT CHEATING ON YOU! The dealer she was fucking around on me with the first time was just into pot, nothing serious. I should've left her then. No, I should've left her the first time the thought crossed my mind. At that point, I was her only way to get drugs, she didn't know anyone. She would've been forced to get sober. She is now 3 months into a relationship with this new guy. Still high as a kite all the time, last I heard. I know her better than anyone. She hasn't the will power to quit, not on her own. I should be locked up for assisted suicide. I've indirectly murdered this girl. The rest of her life will be addiction. Reading back on what I just wrote, it seems like it grew more poorly written the further I went. Seems disjointed. For that, dear reader, I apologize, I'm just upset. What I did to that girl was evil. I deserve every ounce of misery this break up has given me. Thank you for sticking through this. You don't need to give me a pat on the back and tell me it's okay, I just wanted get this off my chest. Take it from me, do what you know in your heart is right, as soon as you can. Have a lovely evening. "
237,vulnerability,BreakUps,As the person who ended it #2,1,8j2s5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8j2s5w/as_the_person_who_ended_it_2/,2018-05-13 19:37:36,"N.B: I've decided to document the process I go through as an individual who ended their first long term relationship. This is post #2. It feels like it's been longer than a week since I last wrote about this. Much longer. Time seems to oscillate between heavily dragging the fibres of my being along, to evading me when I need it the most I read this article about how, conceptually, time is shaped by an object's mass. So the way we use it as a constant to measure the passage of our day to day lives is questionable. Yesterday I sat on my bed and willed that there was a way I could bend time, perhaps I could end this feeling then. I have my last exam on Tuesday. My favourite module. But I can't bring myself to care. I am bathed in numbness. Briefly I emerge when I get a random text from the guy I like, or good song plays. Briefly I possess clarity. But then I sink back down into an uncaring, empty state. I am tired, Y. I have nothing left. I think back to the girl who got full marks in her modules. Who regularly proved her worth. Where is she now? I can't recognise her in this feeling, but somewhere she's buried inside. Perhaps I am tired of having to prove myself. To myself. Perhaps I am tired of meeting my own lofty expectations. I went to my second counselling session a few days ago. She asked me all of the usual questions. I blinked away any tears before they spilled over. I told her I couldn't do this anymore, year on year, this pattern I always lovingly returned to. I mentioned my discomfort in people focusing on me, and how I couldn't be ~myself~ with new people. We talked about a recent failed friendship. She wondered whether my relationships failed because I gave too much of myself to them. That I put in so much work without expecting anything in return. About how I felt like a burden when I unloaded my stresses onto my friends. And later on, a jarring insight. ""Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you try to make yourself small. That you stop yourself from being vulnerable with people, at the expense of it spilling into other areas of your life."" Do I hide, because it's comfortable? I wondered to myself. Of course I did. I'd been doing that my entire life. It's probably why I'm here spilling my heart out on Reddit. I told her about you. The length of our relationship. She asked if I felt like I hid my vulnerability from you. With certainty, I tell her no. You were my safe place. She asks why I ended it, if you were the only person in the world I could truly be myself with. A person who knew me, wholly, demons and all. I told her that we felt platonic for a long time. We didn't connect over the same things and I always kept my passions to myself. Eventually I had nothing left to give. I wonder if you're seeing her too. You mentioned you were getting help, and she recommended I see another person. I've committed to moving out now. I'll have to give you your stuff before I go. New romantic potential is exhausting. I don't know what to make of H. Some days the notion of never meeting him seems simpler. At least that way I wouldn't give a fuck. We still talk - we have been for a month since our first date, despite him knowing I'm too busy to meet with exams. I can't shake the feeling that nothing will come of this. That we'll meet, I'll withdraw into myself, and we'll part ways with you wondering why the girl who was so sassy over text was so tight smiled in person. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not enough. Which I know is ridiculous. We're both human, by default we're flawed. And aesthetic values are nothing more than a social construct. I still don't know what you expect from this. Whether you plan on fucking me then leaving. Or perhaps you're equally as confused as I am. Everyone has their demons after all. In any case, the uncertainty gets to me. I know that I can't spend the next date questioning your motives. I can't spend it trying to come across as someone. I know I must simply trust you enough to be myself completely with. If you don't like that, that's not a reflection of me, but of what you're looking for. And that's completely fine."
238,vulnerability,BreakUps,Caught totally off-guard. Dumped right after a big trip.,1,856diz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/856diz/caught_totally_offguard_dumped_right_after_a_big/,2018-03-18 07:16:43,"Posting from a throwaway because I'm a public figure. A little about myself - I am a 26 year old veteran and athlete that has come into the national spotlight through para sports and activism. I am a decorated combat veteran that was severely injured about five years ago. I had a long and difficult recovery, but have made strides. I am proud of where I am, but the suddenness of my girlfriend ending and how it ended has me pretty shaken. I am pursuing my education, started a veteran's organization to help other vets do the same and have gotten national press for my efforts. I have met with members of parliament on several occasions, played a part in the national Remembrance Day ceremony, speak at schools frequently and on a board for disabled veterans. My former regiment has named a trophy after me, and I have received a promotion and award from the head of my country's military in a large, publicized ceremony. However, I still make a corporal's pay ($50k in garrison - $100k overseas). I don't mind as I have my education paid for and want to decompress after the experiences I went through in the service. In addition, after being unable to walk I motivated myself to drive through physio therapy and beyond, taking up two sports. I devote most of my time to training, being on 2 varsity university teams, 2 competitive teams, and the national para team. Last summer I won a national title in sprinting. In addition to this I taught myself a language, and instrument and to dance. The media loves a good veteran story so I have received quite a bit of national press in TV, Radio, Newspapers and the like. I don't like the attention personally, but it gives me a platform to help other vets. The focus of my interviews is always to thank the people who helped me and to draw attention to veterans that often go ignored. My attitude has always been that I shouldn't have to sprint national times to raise awareness of issues facing vets, but things are what they are. For the entirety of last summer I was training for an international para competition for injured veterans. This is a fairly well known one, supported by a member of the British Royal Family. I was selected for my national team the previous November, and devoted my life to training. I spent a significant chunk of my disability award of coaching and personal training, and put in 4-6 hours a day. I do not drink alcohol when I train, I eat a clean diet, and I go to bed early. This somewhat limited my personal life, although I was able to pick up women very easily essentially whenever I wanted either through Tinder/Bumble, or chatting with them in class/at the training venues. I met a 27 year old woman in August. I was a speaker and athlete at the Army Run, and she is an amateur runner. She is an intelligence officer who also is the editor of an award-winning local blog. Between these two jobs she makes $80k. She also is involved in one of my sports at a recreational level, as well as dragon boat, a running club, an instagram club, and runs the social media accounts for our city's (1M, national capital) tourism and a few other things. She is often paid for her photo submissions. She owns a very nice house that she bought when she was only 25. When we met, because of our shared passion for sport we immediately hit it off. She initially struck me as a bit of a braggart. Coming from the combat arms, I prefer quiet professionalism but in my experience women in their mid twenties who are starting to make ""real"" money like to show off their accomplishments. I was impressed by her hustle, but noticed she was spending most of her time working or doing her various activities. I like alpha women, but I came from a military family that prioritised achievement above all else and I find it a little discomforting. She also carried her (very expensive) camera with her at nearly all times, and many of our dates felt like photos ops. As I said, I begrudgingly tolerate media because of my public life, but in my personal life I like to just unwind. She Instagram'd almost every single meal we had, often rearranging drinks, menus etc. for the shot. Whether we were going for a fall walk, to a museum of whatever, she was taking and posting photos across all kinds of media. I have had to create social media at the instance of a military Public Affairs Officer, and its all public. I gave my girlfriend the password to my twitter account and she was pretty eager to run it. In September, I went into competition and she was head over heels about me. She posted and took many great photos of me, DVR'd the competition to get shots of me, found every single news article, tv interview, radio that I did during competition. Everything, she seemed to be all-in. When I came back I decided to commit to her. I don't think I'd ever felt a woman to be this into me. Attracted, sure but she was as I said involved in every aspect of my ""story"". I thought that most women were only superficially interested, either in my athletic body, achievements, or publicity and that she was different. It was that thought process that guided me towards a LTR. She insisted we film an audition video for the Amazing Race. They were focusing on wounded warriors and first responders. I didnt want to, but she was crazy about it. We submitted and I went back to my regular life but she was crushed when we didnt get it. I really felt like she was over the moon for me. After competition I went back to school, continued my work, and recovered from exhaustion and training injuries. I felt the post-competition crash they warn you about in training camp. On top of that of course are my physical and psychological injuries. I began to bring my meds over to her place, and slept with headphones in because of the tinnitus and flashbacks. At this point I also received my discharge date. This was incredibly hard for me as I have given years of my life to the military, as well as the physical cost. I received many job offers, admissions to schools and so-on but I was trying to have a semblance of stability. I didnt want to move because I thought we could really build something. I turned down a union apprenticeship so I would stay in the same city. I was pretty depressed between December-January, but rallied. An Army buddy and I decided to put ourselves through a special forces PT plan, just like we were back in battalion. I started to feel like my old self again, and while depressed that my career was over, felt good about where I was in life. My attitude was that my life wasn't where it would be if I wasn't hurt, but I had achieved a lot more than anyone expected in my recovery, and was helping other vets who had it worse. By February she had met my parents on several occasions, and I had met her father - a telecom executive (60s)- and brother (Early 30s M) - a silicon valley programmer. They were both very impressive but I felt like I built rapport with them. Over the holidays my girlfriend excitedly showed me to her family on facetime, sent them newspapers and magazines that featured me, and her family began to follow me on social media. I got the feeling as I said that this was a goal and achievement oriented family, but as I mentioned I feel like I've done enough for my country and myself that I can take the time to get my head right as I go through a major life change. In this time she got a major promotion and moved to a different department of the government, still in intelligence but at the level where she briefs ministers and the prime minister. I was very proud of her for this, although I am not a careerist. I was always happy as a private, and even becoming a corporal for me was not a big deal. I feel like my decorations say more about me than my rank. I should also mention that we had been having less sex after her promotion. My girlfriend often got tickets and promotions because of her social media activity, and she won an all-expenses paid trip to a city across the country for a major sporting event. This included airfare, a fancy hotel, VIP tickets, meals at fancy restaurants etc. About two weeks before we went, she told me she had convinced these people to also include her mother (late 50s F) and sister (22F), who would fly out from the other coast to meet us there. I felt like this was a big relationship hallmark (our second big trip together and meeting the rest of her family) and looked forward to it. I was a little concerned because the trip included a helicopter ride and I hadn't been in a helo since my deployment, and it would be my first airplane trip since flying overseas as well. Having said that, I talked to my friends, my shrink etc. and decided to make the effort both to face these triggers and to tell her about them. When we were at the airport I told her that after our time together I wanted her to be a bigger part of my life, and that would mean knowing things I do not like to talk about. I told her some details about my deployment, injury and PTSD and thanked her for being so supportive. She seemed distant and even disinterested during this conversation. In previous relationships, or even telling my friends and family these stories, people usually cry so her muted response was a surprise to me. I had a hard time reading her reaction. Once we arrived I met her mom and sister. At first things seemed to go pretty well. However her mother immediately began to rub me the wrong way. She was a grown woman and also spent most of her time on twitter, instagram, taking photos of every activity, and so on. She was also a braggart, and was very happy with the ""swag"" we were provided with. Each of us received a $200 gift card for a major shopping centre, but the mother took them all and gave them to my girlfriend saying ""coming with her on the trip is a reward enough"". My jean's inseam had torn at the airport and I mentioned that I could probably use a new pair and got a withering glance from both women. Her mother also did my least favorite thing, as a veteran. Within 20-30 minutes of meeting her she was asking specific questions about my deployments, injuries, ptsd, combat, if I had killed anyone etc. I usually get these questions for elementary age schoolchildren but even high school students typically know better. Her attitude and style of questioning also bothered me. It felt like I was being judged and found unworthy. She also threw her other daughter under the bus by casually disclosing information about her mental health, seemingly to justify why she hadn't achieved as much as the other two children. I felt very bad to this other daughter and related to her. In one instance the mother was talking about how she had won $15k from a contest and lavishly spent it on my LTR and her brother. I saw a look come across the younger daughter's face and asked what she had got. She said ""nothing"". The mother insisted that she had, but the younger daughter quietly and pleadingly maintained that she hadn't. The mother just causally said ""oh well I'll get you those boots you want at the mall."" As I said I felt a sympathy for her. I've often felt like a bit of a loser over the past few years, but have had my confidence built up through success. Still I feel a lot of sympathy towards people who feel like they aren't enough. The way the mother talked to the youngest daughter made my skin crawl. The itinerary of this trip was exhausting and both the other daughter and I went to bed early each night. I don't drink both because of medication and because I have seen many vets with PTSD go down that path. The first night my girlfriend and her mother went to a fancy bar to drink and talk and my girlfriend came back several hours later. We didn't have sex for the duration of our trip which struck me as odd because on previous trips we had had fantastic sex. I also got the sense from things her mother said that my girlfriend was sharing details about me I'd rather not get out, and she made many negative comments. She would say things like ""Oh my daughter makes so much money because she works hard"" and commented on how she was the top of her class in high school and university and had to carry less intelligent classmates in group work. This kind of talk was often interposed with pointed questions about what I would do next with my life, next career and so on. As the weekend wore on her mother was increasingly disrespectful, dismissive and outright rude to me. On one occasion I asked if I could spend time with my girlfriend and she said ""oh no I won't let you separate us"". My girlfriend also grew even more distant, to the point where we were hardly talking. All the while her and her mother are having a great time, taking photos of everything and so on. I went for several long runs and to the gym to keep up my training and cool my head and my absence went unremarked and maybe unnoticed. Finally at the airport after I said goodbye to her family and stood with our luggage at the gate, she stood with her mother and talked for 10-15 minutes often looking over in my direction. It made me feel uneasy. She didn't say much to me after that, including the flight home. We just ubered to her house and went to sleep. In the morning she insisted I go off to class and said she was having brunch with friends (she had taken the day off). Again, it seemed like she was trying to get rid of me. When we flew back I talked to my friend's and shrink about this and they suggested I talk to my girlfriend. Between our return and Tuesday the only text I had gotten from her was to arrange afternoon coffee before her run club. This was an immediate red flag for me. I can't really explain why but between what and when the plan was, I felt a kind of suspicion. Of course I was also planning on talking to her at this point because my friends and therapist insisted that how her mom talked to me was totally unacceptable, that Im not a loser, that I am worthy and that my partner should not allow anyone to talk about me like that. She didn't kiss me as a greeting and our conversation was stilted. She suggested we go for a walk (it was -10 c) I decided to just speak my mind. I said I had a problem with how her mother behaved, that I know my life isn't where I would like it to be, but I'm proud of my service, even if it has meant that I don't make a great salary, that I had tried to let her in on these feelings and that at this point if she wanted to be a part of my life she had to know about the consequences and pain behind the fame and accolades. She said she had wanted to talk to me and said she felt that things weren't working out. She said that we had different priorities (she specifically mentioned time and money), she said that she was bothered that she was doing things alone that she'd rather do with her boyfriend, a few other things like that. It felt, rehearsed? I pressed and said that all of those things could be worked on if she had been willing to communicate. I said that I am willing to work on these things, but I had the sense that she was justifying checking out. She agreed that she had, and said that her reason was ""we are at different places in life"". That really burns. It's not like I'm a scrub, a deadbeat or a stoner. I bled for my country, nearly died and have spent every day of the past few years healing and helping other veterans. I have gone from paralysis to winning national athletic titles. She said she had already been thinking about this before the trip. I asked why even bring me? I told her that I had spent weeks in therapy to get on an airplane again, let alone a helicopter. She said ""if I had known I would have asked someone else to come."" I was hurt. I really felt like I was willing to put the work in but if things weren't just-so with her, she was indifferent. I held frame the whole time, and really did feel like it was a Seinfeldian break-up, you know shake hands and move on. However, as we were leaving she said ""I'm looking forward to reading about you in (National Newspaper)"". The story will run next week, but I had been interviewed and photographed the previous few weeks. It was very hard to have the focus on me specifically and not on sport, but opening up to the reporter helped me open up more in therapy and to my girlfriend. She often brought up this story in the last few weeks, as it is a major feature in a national newspaper, but I kept telling her it made me uncomfortable and that I am only doing it to further other vets. I don't celebrate fame, and I certainly don't seek it out. Anyway, after she said that I felt a revulsion I have never felt before. It was like in one shining moment I went from loving to loathing someone. I said ""If there is one thing you learn about me from reading a newspaper than this has been a waste of my time. I am not my medals, I am not my athletic awards, I am not the trophy named after me, I am not any of those things. I am not TV, or Radio, or Twitter about me, I am not press, I am not commendations. I had a hard time opening up to that reporter but the hardest thing I've ever had to do, the thing that meant far more to me was opening up to you one-on-one."" She started crying and sobbing, said she had to go, and that was that. I haven't contacted her since. I'm just left wondering, what the hell happened?! My friends insist she only saw me as a famous athlete and was only attracted to the fame and glory. I feel such a deep sense of loss and betrayal. It's hard for me to balance the public and private aspects of my life, and even harder for me to open up and show vulnerability. I feel like an idiot most of all.I let her in and I wasn't good enough for her or her mother. I have worked hard to be where I am today, hell I nearly died! To have that discarded as not enough makes me feel like I'll never be good enough, or at least never be the person people think I am. It makes me resentful of sports and media for building me up just to be torn down in my personal life. tldr: My ex-girlfriend is a high achieving woman who lives her life through media. I am a wounded warrior who is still putting the pieces of my life together. We met at the peak of a media circus around me, and it seems like she fell for the story not the man. Once I started to let her in she abruptly left me. "

He said I had no plans for the future (not true) and that I lead an unsafe lifestyle (kind of true, I do sex work and he worries. He gave me an ultimatum to quit or break up, and that is not really reasonable.) I want to mail him back his key with a note about how I'd be willing to try and work it out with couples therapy. It sounds dramatic, but I will always love him. I am like not even convinced that this is over because it just seems unbelievable. We've both behaved poorly.

It all started because she was my Bestfriend and being together was so natural. So perfect. We even made a Bestfriend pact to get together at 27 if we werent dating other people at the time. Got it tattooed on our arms. We would talk all the time and I think that what made our relationship so real was that we were so vulnerable with each other. We trusted each other. It felt too natural for it to be fake. One thing to notice is that she has always been a loner. She has always been alone, so me coming was almost like a breathe of fresh air, like something she hadnt had but knew she wanted you know? And vice verse with her. We had our ups and downs, highs and lows, but we both knew we loved each other. We both knew we wanted to be together and we both knew we would end up together. But the one day I messed up. She broke up with me. That wasnt the part thats hurting because she can do that. We can work on being better. We can fight and get back together, but this time was different. We broke up, and she didnt speak to me. She didnt call me, she didnt text me, she didnt anything. Then she told me she was with another guy. We went out on two dates and she said she feels nothing now. Nothing at all. I tried to convince her theyre still there and shes repressing them, but shes convinced. She says she doesnt love me anymore. I want to take time from her but I know shes not happy (about something) from texting her yesterday. I was going to meet up with her later today to talk to her about it, and hope that she remembers that this is what made her fall for me in the first place. The vulnerability we both have never been able to feel before. I honestly want to know if this is a bad idea. Should I just forget her? Is it time? Its hard just not to talk to your Bestfriend, but it hurts so much I will I have to. I just need help. I cry myself to sleep every night because I know I am exactly who she needs, but I was afraid to let my walls down for her because of what girls have done in the past to me. Please help. Anyone. Im lost and I have no way to find direction. "
241,vulnerability,BreakUps,Depressed ex back on tinder??,3,8brtea,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/8brtea/depressed_ex_back_on_tinder/,2018-04-13 03:08:55,"My ex [21/m] and I [19/f] broke up about a month ago. His reasoning was that he was really sorry, but he felt like he couldn't cope with a relationship right now and needed time to recover from his depression alone, although there is a possibility we may get back together when he recovers, but doesn't want to commit to it just yet as he doesn't know what he wants. We were together a year and a half, but I honestly felt like he was my soulmate. I don't say that lightly, but I've never felt so sure about another human being in all my life. We were very happy, but around mid-Jan, his depression came back in full force and he began withdrawing from me and projecting the behaviours of his emotionally abusive ex onto me. We attempted to take breaks for about 3 weeks, but eventually he decided he just couldn't handle the stress of a relationship on top of the emotional problems he is dealing with, and his confusion about how he felt towards me. I suspect a lot of it has to do with fear of vulnerability caused by the abuse his ex subjected him to. He is taking medication and due to start therapy in a few weeks. I know from a mutual friend that he has said that he misses me a lot and is still turning it over in his mind whether he made the right decision leaving. We hadn't spoken in two weeks, until today when I noticed he'd updated his tinder profile. I called him and asked what the heck was up with that, seeing as his reasoning for ending our relationship was ""I need to be alone while I get therapy/meds and figure myself out"". He was really apologetic and explained that he wasn't actually looking for a relationship, more that he didn't take tinder seriously and just saw it as a fun way to make friends. He assured me that he isn't flirting with anyone else or planning to meet up with anyone, but also that it wouldn't be fair on me to give a definite answer about whether we will get back together or not just yet. Although I do want us to get back together, I didn't say anything about missing him or wanting him to delete tinder, b/c I don't want to come off desperate or controlling, but I did mention that I wasn't using tinder to look for a relationship either, more just to talk to new people, and that I had declined a date with someone already. I don't know whether or not to trust him. He isn't the type to do casual hookups, even before he met me he had had tinder for 5 months and only met up with two people, one was me and the other was some girl who was visiting London for a day and wanted a tour guide. He has also earnestly apologised for the way he treated me during the breakup, and mentioned that although his depression may have influenced it, it's not an excuse for how he acted. He told me 3 weeks ago that he thought it was a case of right-person-wrong-time and if we were meant to be, fate would bring us back together. We ended up having a really nice 20 minute chat about various things, cartoons, a recent scandal with a mutual favourite band, an essay I'm writing, we even made jokes about break up memes we had wanted to send each other, until I eventually hung up saying I needed to get back to work. He told me he had wanted to message me to see how I was doing a few times, and seemed happy to talk to me, like his old self. He also didn't seem keen to end the conversation - all the other times we'd talked since the break up, he had been the one to cut it short, but when I initially tried to end the convo, he pulled me back in and we talked for a further ten minutes. I wished him luck with his dissertation if I didn't see him before he handed it in, and he said ""Oh no, we'll definitely see each other before then"" What the heck do I make of this? Is he breadcrumbing just to keep me interested? He did say that he wanted us to be friends after we broke up, but that's not really my style. I wish exe's well and cut them off. Do you reckon there is any hope that we will get back together?"
242,vulnerability,BreakUps,how soon is too soon?,2,801j8m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/801j8m/how_soon_is_too_soon/,2018-02-25 13:24:38,"i recently got out of a 3 year long relationship that had major rocky moments, yet ended basically amicably (it was around xmas, it was devastating, of course, and though no breakup is without things we wish we hadn't said or heard, there was no fighting and we both recognized it was over). i am only 2.5 months out of that relationship now. i am in therapy, and have realized in therapy since my relationship just how bad of an affect those 'rocky moments' had on my foundational trust in the relationship, and for how long. i've flirted around the idea of this not being the right relationship for me for at least the last year of the relationship, and me and my ex have had huge fights that had led to us questioning our compatibility openly perhaps 6 months before we finally broke up. a few months to the end of the relationship my eye was wandering because the affection between us had left. i miss being able to talk to her and miss the beginning of our relationship when it was still new and fun and loving enough that i could overlook the unhealthy parts, but because we had grown so far apart physically and emotionally, some of those things aren't fully there to miss anymore. basically, i've been grieving the end of this relationship for a while but didn't have the stones to tell myself or end it myself, then she ended it and i didn't really disagree with the idea, in spite of how painful it was. i started using dating apps very soon after the breakup. it is a distraction and intentional ego booster. my self esteem has been wrecked, and getting little alerts that people 'like' you is a superficial and fun way to feel good about yourself, not meant to be serious at all. i started chatting with some people, tried going out on some dates. again as a distraction, but also with the specific intent to maybe make some friends with benefits, basically looking to date but not to be a boyfriend to anyone. (me and my ex had maybe six sexual encounters over the last year of the relationship, the last of which crossed a line, and frankly i missed and wanted positive, healthy sex.) i am not sad every day about my recent breakup anymore. i am no longer mad every day like i used to be when i was stuck in the unhealthy relationship. and so i happen to be a in a good mood and a good date, and once i got over the daily grind of those awful emotions, i started having dates that were fun. a couple have ended in sex and further dates, just what i was looking for. i was upfront the whole way about my sexual and relationship past, what i was looking for, what i could give and what i couldn't. i am 100% open to the limits and boundaries of the people who agree to see me, because they agree to and understand my own limitations. i don't really believe in fucking around with the truth in dating, and so these dates that ended in sex have come with the understanding that there was no commitment involved. so far it has been fun, but one of my 'dates' is a problem because i am genuinely starting to like her. i'm moving in that direction much, much faster than i would ideally think should happen, or think is 'normal'. we have immediately clicked in a way that had nothing to do with what i was looking to get out of this online dating. she is incredibly smart and we can talk easily about anything and everything. she is my physical type, completely. she is successful, funny, open-minded, honest, weird, all things i look for and value in my past and future friends and relationships. i am feeling very guilty about this, because it is so soon after my recent breakup, and skeptical of it because of my current increased vulnerability. but it is undeniable that if i weren't in this position of being so recently out a of breakup and i met this person, this connection would still be there. although i feel limited in the short term, a lot of our values and long term goals are aligned, and the feeling and attraction is mutual. to summarize: i ended a three year long relationship just two and half months ago. i started online dating in an openly non-committed way because i am lonely and want to help heal my ego and libido (find friends with benefits). i am clicking with one of these dates in an unexpected way. is it okay for me to be pursuing this person if we keep up the open communication and take our time before reaching a committed point? or am i rebounding from my relationship and using the current situation as a distraction and escape? is it possible both things are going on?"
243,vulnerability,BreakUps,The Letter Hell Never Read,8,823fx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/823fx0/the_letter_hell_never_read/,2018-03-05 15:42:09,"C, To me, the most devilishly lovely space is the discourse colony of new loversto include occasional exaggeration spouted in the hope of impressing the other. Despite it, I hope you know that I was not lying when I told you that over the 13 year course of silence and life between us, I never stopped thinking about you. I remember the day you messaged me well. I will admit that up to that point, I would occasionally lurk to see what you had been up to. Even Ashley remembered your name when I told her I had been talking to you again. Sometimes I don't remember everything I divulge to my best friend, but her inflections were enough to indicate that whatever I had indeed went beyond ""a friend from high school."" I have lived life enough to know that random messages from the opposite sex don't come without their own intentions. And I was right. And I was surprised. And I was unprepared. And I was afraid. And I was thrilled. Some things defy rationalization. At one point during our bliss we spouted words like ""connection."" It was enough for me. I just wish, more than anything in the world, that it had been for you. I kept trying to pry it from you, but you never wanted to explain why you had put up the ""No Trespassing"" sign on yourself. You just told me to stay away from you. That all you wanted was a physical relationship that would render a mutual good time at best and an individual ego boost at worst. However, it was easy to dismiss when a week later you told me you were falling in love with me. And in your moments of vulnerability, you continued to use the word. It was enough for me. I took these weak moments as those to surpass all others. And I realized that I reciprocated. And perhaps therein lies my foolishness. Don't get me wrong. I was also hesitant at its quickness and your declaration. Before you came to your senses, I was Googling ""Signs You're a Rebound."" But when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags are just flags. But just as easily as one word can send you into an ecstatic whirlwind, so too can one destroy you. When your friend suggested that I was ""just a rebound,"" you agreed, admitted it to me immediately, and then our conversations and eventually our connection waned. What hurts is that, since I had no chance to defend myself against the word, to present the suggestion that I was at least worth a shot, it was up to you to. And you didn't. Sometimes life doesn't time itself well. Sometimes you have to take a risk. Sometimes you're not ready. Sometimes bad things happen at the worst time. Sometimes, so do good things. And what hurts is that I was not worth the risk to you. Because you so were to me. But beyond all that, what kills me is that I never had a chance to show myself to you. You got previews: tragically, previews of my small margins. On one end, there was the disgusting timidity that only comes with the perfect combination of excitement and newness and first impressions. My shyness sometimes gave way to awkward grins and giggles in place of conversation, as well as my bizarre eating habits in front of you, like tearing random bits off pizza slices and taking only a handful of bites from the best pad thai in town. On the other end, there were my emotional outbursts that came from your leaving as quickly as you came, from not wanting to give me a chance, from the shock of the feelings of humiliation and of being used and feeling like I was just a distraction and something to brag about and rub in her face anyway. (I apologize again.) But neither of these are the real me. In the middle and in the majority is the person you supposedly did fall in love with. Someone who thought you were incredible. Someone who fell in love with your perspective of the world: specifically, of humans and nature and art. Someone who learned so much from you in our brief time together. Someone who adored your sense of adventure and your thirst for knowledge and life. Someone who just wants you to know, I never opened up to someone as quickly and easily. Someone who lost sleep and appetite frequently at the notion of sharing myself, my life, and the fruits of my successes up to this point with you. Someone who dreamt of even more conversations at all hours of the night, of quiet days indulging in our own hobbies next to another, of weekend vacations and lovemaking and me actually eating with gusto in front of you for once. Of learning how you take your coffee. Of watching you paint. Of getting drunk and of fighting and of getting over fights. Someone whose daydreams of such were both lovely and messy. I wanted so badly to, over time, show you both my true loveliness and my true messiness. I am sorry for horrendous timing. I am sorry that I was not enough to trump it. But please know, to me, you always were. You are special. I hope you one day find the life and the people who help you realize that. I have nothing more to say. L I need to purge myself of him, but I want to release this at least once. Thank you for listening. "
244,vulnerability,BreakUps,"I broke up, ripped my own heart out",6,7rrfx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7rrfx2/i_broke_up_ripped_my_own_heart_out/,2018-01-21 03:44:57,"A few months ago, I broke up with an exceptionally beautiful and endearing girl other men dream of being with, it was a relationship of 4 years. My mother was devastated, cried for a week, she hoped that we would marry some day. My father was confused, accused me of not having loved her. My sister seems to have a somewhat wrong understanding of why I did it, but at least she supports me. I am still not sure why I did it, why I ripped my own goddamn heart out of my chest. At least my girlfriend had a slight understanding, and that's what counts. We were in our early twenties when we first met. I spotted her in university and immediately knew I needed to get to know her. Months passed, and I saw her on a bike on the streets. I took all my courage to approach her, started to ask her things about an upcoming exam. Apparently I wasn't being a creep, we got together four months after that, I was happy. But I felt like there was a demon in the back of my head from the beginning of the relationship. The sex was underwhelming. I only ever had sex once before, it was a short romance, and that was better by far. I was dissatisfied, but I loved her personality so much, that I sucked it up. Now, one thing you need to know to understand this story, is that my psychological state is somewhat fragile. I'm not a nutjob, but I am somewhat psychologically vulnerable. The first months of my relationship, this vulnerability unfolded. I started developing obsessive thoughts I felt I could not controll, they scared the hell out of me, made my stomach turn inside out. These thoughts were tailored to the situation. 'You don't like the sex too much? Well maybe it's 'cause you're a latent homosexual and you don't actually like women?' This type of thought didn't stop, I thought this everyday hours on end. I was miserable. It didn't even make any sense, I was constantly in love with girls during school. But these obsessive thoughts didn't have to make sense. I underwent cognitive behavioral therapy, I learned to deal with my obsessive thoughts. It helped a lot, but it came back in other forms. For instance, I got scared that I might get attracted to other girls, and that that would undermine the relationship I had. I could perfectly see that this type of thinking makes no sense, but that is why the problem was (or still is) a psychological disorder. My mental problem was hard on the both of us, but we stayed together and saw it through. I got way better, I got control of my obsessive thoughts. But still, there was something in the back of my head. This was not the life that I wanted. I had a girlfriend I loved, and who seemed to love me even more. But the burning passion was what I missed. I think it's absence was what caused me pain, what caused me to lose it in the first place. So, after 4 years of the relationship, I broke up. Shortly after, I moved into a small town in the middle of nowhere, started a new job. I am truly lonely. I miss her a lot. I feel guilty for ending it all. I phrased the reason for the breakup in this way: I feel like I am lacking experiences to have a lasting relationship. I think it contains the essential truth without causing excessive pain to her. She said I don't need to feel guilty, she is not angry. She sure was sad. So was I. We both cried during the breakup. I didn't want to do it but felt like I had to. I'm lonely, I miss her, but I also want to experience new stories. I know that this is somewhat of a euphemism for ""I want to screw more"". It makes me feel like a bad person. My biggest fear now is that I grow old alone, that I made the wrong choice. I wish I wasn't this weak. Thank you very much for reading."

It's taken me until now to realise this, but it took them showing their true colours now when they attempted to be friends with me to see that they could not apologise for their mistakes because of how insecure they feel about themselves. And this isn't means to feel sorry for them, they're responsible for all their choices, including how they treat you. If they take their problems out on you, it's not on you to fix their problems. And if they never apologise for their actions, then fuck them (not literally). If you can apologise and they can't, then you're the bigger person. If you're the person who can show vulnerability and they can't, you're the bigger person. If you're feeling bad about feeling hurt and they just seem cold and uninterested, don't worry, because you're the bigger person. You're the person who's not afraid to show that you care whilst they just hide behind all their insecurities. If you can change and they can't, you're the bigger person. Be with a person who brings out the best in you, not the worst."

I hate nighttime, and I hate the weekends. Because everyone is out doing something, and I feel so alone at times. I rarely see my friends because they're busy, my family is busy, it's rough. At night, my thoughts come crashing no matter how much I try to avoid it. I've begun to cry less unless I am triggered by a memory from reading or watching something. When I go out, I do it alone. I hike alone, go to bars alone, go to libraries alone.. it's nice, but, it's always nice to experience those things with someone. For a year, it was with you. I've been feeling the best I have in months. My work, my therapy, healing, journaling... it's going slowly. But, what I am afraid of is when I see you, how will I feel? Will I feel like I am staring at someone I once knew? Or, will I be staring at someone I still long? Can't go out and flirt without feeling some sort of guilt. Talking to guys, talking to guys that aren't you. I hate feeling hot and cold, one moment feeling adamant that my life will be better without you, but, I don't know if that's true. Tired of having dreams about you, waking up to think it through, and realize it wasn't real. Sometimes I see you coming towards me, but what you're saying isn't audible. You can't even leave me alone even in my sleep. Our love, was so real. The first time we went out after work, there was already a connection. Felt like that was our first date. The person whom I thought would never do me wrong, would never hurt me, did all of those things in the end. I don't know, if the person I knew, was truly like that only because things got rough, or it's because he was depressed. We barely fought, for the first 8 months. Even when we did, we talked it through and got over it. The depression really changed us... and it makes me so sad. I changed. But I made the effort to pull us through, to the best of my capabilities. Did you notice them? Did you notice? I was with you, because everything made sense. I'm not saying this out of comfort, because I never longed for anyone like you. I could easily get any guy, that's how I survived before you, moved on from one to the next, party away my sorrows until you saved me. But I don't seem to want anyone, despite coming across opportunities. You were the other missing piece of me. I sometimes stared at you and thought, ""how is this real, that I came across someone like him... like me?"". I would stop listening to what you were saying, and just in awe and grateful that you were sent my way. Your looks, your sharpness, your creativity, your vulnerability, your humbleness, your passions, your determination, our cultural backgrounds, our values and morals, our goals, our thoughts, our political beliefs, religious views, our interests, and our positive support for each other.. like no other. We're such weird people, and I am glad, I never had to hide anything from you besides that little bit of hood in me. You let me be me. For the first time. I never felt like I had to be someone who I wasn't, to make you happy. Our personalities matched because I will always need a calm and soothing partner. And you'll want someone who's blunt and ""hyphy"". The mean things we've said to each other and did to each other, we were so sad.. and we weren't even ourselves. I felt like that was so unfair. Like we were robbed of that relationship. I can't even tell you how I am doing. Can't tell you that my dog is getting bloodwork done this friday, and it scares me. Can't tell you the support I've been receiving. Can't tell you how better I've been doing, and my therapist sees that I am lifting from my depression. Can't tell you how beautiful the sunsets have been, and how my hikes and walks have been therapeutic. I love watching hockey for the Olympics, can't talk to you about that either. I had a random thought the other night. You ran away at the challenges with me. What if I were to have our kid, and I developed depression, would you run away from that too? And leave me hanging? I saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I applied it to us. If we were to take away memories of the other person after an angry fight, how would it be? I guess our minds can forget, but our hearts don't. I am scared that I am lying to myself, that I am doing perfectly fine without you in my life. "

I'm sooo glad you're having fun and you're having the time of your life, all I ever wanted was for you to be happy. It sucks because I wish I could have given you that or more importantly, that I could have been a part of that happiness. M said I did make you happy at some point and you did want to date me and I wish you still felt that same way. I'm starting to hate that past tense word though. ""Did"". Past tense, I DID make you happy I am told and you DID want to date me, if only that DIDnt change. K, I really miss you. And as I type this I really wish it was the summer again. God it was so much fun. It's winter now, and I'm cold, and I wish you were here to hug me. The sad irony about all of this is that we mutually broke up and you practically broke my heart and the only person who can actually fix it, is you, how pitiful. I'm supposed to be moving on. It's only been a week, jeez. I always thought of myself as someone who was strong,emotionally stable ,and confident. I thought wrong. You moved me. It was only 3 months of our seemingly never ending lives so why does it hurt so much? You actually reciprocated and i am so thankful for that. That someone as gorgeous, radiantly beautiful inside and outside, kind, and persistent can find a way to actually kiss ME back. I miss you so much dude. Why don't you miss me? People say that I'll move on and that maybe this was for the best but fuck those people, I don't want to move on. Who really does tbh? We had something, (at least I think we DID) it was there, I know that the pieces once fit because I saw them fall apart (hehe FIT) im pretty sure we both felt it so why couldn't you have been so kindly persistent about us? Did you really forgot about all those times? That quick? You didn't want to make more memories? Better ones too? It seemed like you left the relationship a long time ago and that I was left trying to catch up. The day I asked you if we were becoming distant and you agreed and you saw my point of view AND decided to work on it, I did not want to leave your side that night. It made me feel appreciated. Like you cared. Like you were actually there. Thank you for working on it, I DID notice. That night You also told me you would never want to intentionally make me feel bad, and I believed you, I ate it right up. K, you knew what you were doing when you stopped replying, leaving me unseen, and stopped communicating. You knew exactly how that would make me feel and you knew exactly how I did feel when you were doing all of that - yet you still did it. That hurts so much. You intentionally hurt me. I thought this was a rough patch, that it's something most couples might go through, I thought we were one of them, and that we'd make it out one piece. When you were becoming distant, I asked everyone who I thought could help me for advice. I didn't know how to bring it up to you without sounding clingy or possessive but it was seriously bothering me. I had even thought about leaving you at some point because you had become so dismissive, neglectful, and distant but you shouldn't be held accountable, the timing was wrong. Villains of circumstance . It wasn't like it was your fault right? You were just busy no? Everyone asked me how long before you crossed and were done with pledging, I always told them ""soon"", and ""by the first week of December"", after that, we would be good, is what i thought. It was mid November at the time. They all told me to relax, that it would be over soon, and to just wait. And so I waited. One thing that I had noticed though was that as I waited, and the more space and distance that was placed between us, it oddly made me feel closer to you. The excitement and anticipation was palpable. I dreamed and romanticized of you coming back. I day dreamed about the dates we'd go on and the laughs that we'd share, the butts of dogs we'd look at and the warm cuddles in my room on a Saturday night. Even NOW I romanticize them. I missed you man, I really did and it tore my heart in half as I watched you vanish before me. It broke my already 2 piece heart into 4ths and then into smithereens seeing you purposely ignoring me. I waited for you , and I really feel as if you hung me out to dry. You could have ended it sooner and maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. That was the biggest blow I received from all of this. Another sad irony about this shit I got myself into is that you never really spoke about us as 1, ""us/we"" , a unit. I don't ever recall that when we were together and the sad irony is, you only spoke about US when we broke up. ""WE became distant"". ""WE stopped communicating"" ""WE grew apart"". K, I don't think there is a we in that, I think that was all you. I think I did a decent job as a boyfriend, mediocre at best, and yes I do know I should have DEFINITELY asked you if you were upset when you clearly were and shouldn't have put my headphones on. I'm so sorry for that. I truly am but how was I supposed to know? It seemed like You closed yourself off. It seemed better to not talk about it because it seemed like YOU didn't want to talk about it. No communication. I didn't know what you wanted. from what I hear from everybody else is that I didn't do anything wrong. So why do you say ""we"" K? I stayed right where you left me back in early November, I never budged or complained. As far as I'm aware of, I complied all the way and maybe that's partially my fault. I should have fought harder for you. Looking back now, maybe that's what I did wrong, I didn't try hard enough. You stopped talking to me. You stopped communicating. You became distant. You grew apart. All I wanted was for you to be happy and I thought giving you the space was something that would make you feel less stressed out during your pledging process, I didn't think it was going to be our downfall. I didn't want you to be pressured or forced into all of this, I wanted you to genuinely want me. I guess I fucked it up by trying to get serious and giving it a label, but had we not given it a label maybe we would have broken up sooner? I feel as if the label gave us some sort of security, maybe even stability- that your position in my life was that of my ""girlfriend"" and my position in your life was that Of a ""boyfriend"". It was the cuddling, kissing and all dat good stuff that came with the package, your personality was the whole package. Everything else was just little perks that came with being called ""K's boyfriend"". I wasn't asking you to marry me. I wasn't asking you to commit your whole entire life to me right then and there. I wasn't giving you an ultimatum, me or the sorority. I just wanted you to stay with me, it didn't have to be forever and part of me knew it wasn't going to be forever but certainly I did not think it would've JUST 3 months. I expected that the REAL reason we'd break up was because after two years of dating, my time in KBCC was up so we mutually agreed to end it because I decided to dorm in my dream college upstate and you couldn't bear being in long distance relationship with someone who wanted to see almost every other day. I literally thought that was the way things were gonna go down. Not that we would grow apart. Not that their would be a schism between us, not that we'd sit on complete opposite ends of a train cart as if there was no history between us, not that we'd intentionally avoid each other's gaze even though we were less than 3 feet away. even as you leave I can still remember how Perfect my hand fit on the curve of your hip, how your lips taste, the softness of your skin, the high pitched voice you'd get sometimes while laughing, your wittiness, how incredibly smart you are- your warmth. I remember it all. I expected so much more from this, maybe I expected too much. ""Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any sense of compassion, between supposed lovers"" - Tool What would have been so different if you stayed with me? What? you wanted to flirt with other guys and get super wasted without having to be tied up to a ball and chain? You wanted to go to parties and look nice without me telling you what to wear and how to look? You didn't want to consistently talk every single day? You wanted your own separate life from the relationship? I wouldn't have minded any of these things (except the flirting with other dudes ofc) and we could have spoken about it if you had chosen to. What pressures come with a relationship K cause I had no idea that there were any pressures? Loyalty? Trust? The ability to share with someone else? Openness? Vulnerability? Love??? At this point I feel like I'm blaming you and I don't mean that, honestly. All of those things I mentioned might be what wanna do, you're best years of your life start now no? Isn't that what you told me. the heart wants what the hearts wants, And I will not blame you for how you feel, I would have appreciated your honesty instead of you telling me you ""aren't ready for a relationship"" Though. I later hear from everybody else that you just want to enjoy being single. Yes it would have hurt a little more if I knew you just didn't want to be with me because you wanted to be young, single and free but it would have been the truth nonetheless. I ended up being your boyfriend K but most importantly we started off as friends, so you didn't atleast have the respect for me as a friend to tell me how you actually felt and give me the truth? Everybody wants to feel free and youthful and have fun but who says that nobody can be like that ina relationship? I now think I'm not worth it. worth the fight. worth the truth. I now think I am not fun, exciting and just not good enough. Not good enough for You. Was it your intention to make me feel this way? This wasn't meant to be so long but I'm using this as a way to vent out because it almost seems like I'm ACTUALLY talking to you and that you're right there waiting for my reply. How morbid tho that it seems as if I'm writing to you as if you died and are no longer with us. But honestly, In a weird way, I AM grieving and mourning the loss and death of something. the loss of a relationship. I mourn, I grieve over the fact that from here on out, we are done. As soon as December ends, it'll be 2018, and the memory of Alex will live in the year 2017, because if there's anything that learned in the short amount of time that I was with you is that, you don't seem to cling onto the past and you certainly do not care for it. If the time comes, where you've decided you want to settle down and commit to someone and you haven't found some guy in a frat who totally meets your standards. Don't forget about me. Even if we don't reconcile, don't forget about me.Think about what we had and maybe, maybe reconsider it again, who knows, time does heal all wounds but you've rightfully earned a soft spot in my heart. And if given the opportunity I would totally want to get back together, not to build up from where we left off but instead start all over, maybe by that time our crazy college years are seemingly over, and we can bond over that and get to know each other all over again. Although I know the reality of the situation is that you won't think about me anymore, it won't matter if I'm your friend or not, and you'll find someone who is not me, and quite frankly, better than me in your eyes, I do hope that that person you choose to get Intimate with appreciates you like I did. Maybe they'll appreciate you even better, I sure hope so, you deserve it. You deserve it all. I have a lot more to say but so far I'm starting to feel some sense of closure from all this. On august 18th, 4 months ago today, I confessed my feelings to you in a very long essay, and from then on, it was history. I wanted to keep the tradition up a little bit by sending it today Dec 18th in a very VERY long essay, I'm sorry for this message to be longest message out there but this is everything I felt, feel and will fill for the days, weeks, and maybe months to come. I sure hope not. I don't expect you to read it all because honestly, who would? If anything I think I want you to have this as a weird and totally bogus attempt of a reminder (not the best way to be remind you tbh) that you are indeed an amazing person capable of everything imaginable and conceivable, capable of elevating the punkest of all rockers only to bring him down and leave him vulnerable with just the gaze of your brown eyes or an adorable giggle or even a dull sigh. You stupid, dumb, wonderful, kind, mesmerizing, big teeth, freckled, beautiful loser. Please don't ever hesitate to message me or hit me up, regardless of what it is, it would be absolutely lovely to hear from you again and maybe even see you. I sure do miss our hangouts with the rest of the herpes gang. And if we ever see each other in public pls don't treat me like Chris C or Kevin. Please. I don't think I deserve that, we were good friends before all this, let us atleast remember that. The breakup wasn't bad as at all, I just took it badly. I'm sorry. And as I wake up this month and the next month and so on - I am awoken with the realization that you will not be a part of my day, and this thought keeps me up at night. This isn't supposed to make you feel bad, I just want to let you know that you should never ever doubt that no one likes you or that everyone hates you or that you won't find someone (let's face it tho, you will) or that I never ever cared about you, because it is the opposite. Can you tell how much of a hold you have on me? I don't hate you, your presence is missed and it will always be welcomed. I heard it takes 21 days to form a new habit and I had a habit of making you a part of my day for over 100 days. It's time to quit cold turkey. You remind of peoples drug addictions stories. One thing that comes with quitting a drug is this heavy weight on your chest to desperately go back to the thing that gets you high, unfortunately, I no longer have my supply of K so I'm going through heavy symptoms of withdrawal. It feels like I need to sneeze but it just won't come out. It's painful. I want you to know that I care about you, I truly do and always will not matter how much time passes between us, you gave me sooooo much. Feelings, memories, and even items that I can't bare too even look at rn. I am not angry with you. I do NOT blame you. Once again everything said in this message is what I feel and they are all things that I'm trying to understand and things that you hopefully understand too. I really wish our time together wasn't that short and I wish I can rewind the clock so it wouldn't end like this. I know you don't feel the same anymore, I know you don't miss me, I know you're happy, and I know you've already moved on, I just wish I was as strong as you and I didn't get attached. I'm REALLY sorry for making this sooooo long but as I keep re-reading and editing this, I keep finding new things to say to you but all I can really say is that I miss you K, I miss you so much. Please do keep in contact. I know there's that unspoken rule between exes where they no longer have to keep each other involved in one another's lives but I message here and there wouldn't hurt. Nonetheless, Enjoy the holidays K and I wish you nothing but the absolute best for the years to come. I hope you have a prosperous, eventful, and fun 2018. I do expect to see you soon, when and where I do not know, but I'll be looking forward to it. The letter I gave you was given the same envelope you gave to me on my birthday, 4 months ago so it comes back full circle and that letter is just the tip of the iceberg, as you can see, there's more to it than a one page letter written in chicken scratch. Although it was mutual, it feels like you've honestly left me, but with that also said you've also left me absolutely amazing memories that I will never ever forget. I sure hope you don't forget as well. With all my love and best regards, officially, the coolest guy you used to know - Alex "
248,vulnerability,BreakUps,Even more cowardly than him telling you he is leaving for someone else...,3,7kwdwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7kwdwe/even_more_cowardly_than_him_telling_you_he_is/,2017-12-20 08:24:06,"He (30M) left me(27F) 2 months ago. The month leading up to the breakup he started analyzing me and was critical of everything I said and did. We dated for about 7 months and everything was amazing until the last month. We'd talk everyday, he was a gentleman and made me feel loved. [TLDR at end of post.] When things started going downhill I thought the change in attitude was due to the honeymoon period ending and the increased distance between us I attributed to a stressful work-related priority he was in the midst of. It started to be clear he didn't want to actually be there when we spent time together. He pretty much ran away from me when he'd leave my house. I'm a sensitive and highly intuitive person, and I knew he was on his way out. To avoid being a self-fulfilling prophecy, I made sure this wasn't all in my head. He really did stop looking me in the eyes, and tightened his lips when I'd kiss him, never complimented me and stopped talking about anything in the future. I tried being extra nice but it didn't help. I was sad and gave up. I never brought my concerns up to him because I thought it'd just add more doubt and make me seem insecure. Instead I began to subconsciously display unattractive behavior (moodiness, smoking, less feminine,etc.). I felt unloved for reasons I didn't understand so to protect my ego I acted unattractive to now justify why he didn't want to be with me. I didn't realize there was someone else and that was the problem, so I created a problem. He eventually didn't reach out for days so I called and said that it needed to change. Another 3 days went by and nothing changed. I was confused and tried calling but no answer so I sent upset text messages (who wouldn't?) calling him an a**hole, called him out on ghosting, and expressed my hurt. He ignored me for another week, I called a few times and never acted crazy, so I somberly showed up at his home to ask what happened. He was cold and I could see in his eyes he checked out. He callously said the upset texts I sent were the reason why he is done talking me. At first I didn't believe it and begged for the truth. He Stuck to insisting it was the text as the cause of all this and I eventually started to believe I overreacted and forget that I was totally neglected for weeks prior to this. Every day since he left me, I beat myself up and literally hated myself for ruining a good thing. I started to truly believe I was insecure and needy and therefore deserved to be abandoned. I'm my own harshest critic and no one could punish me more than myself. During the first week of NC I saw something online that gave me a gut feeling he was already with this other girl but I brushed it off thinking I was paranoid. I continued to rack my brain and replayed every moment looking for clues as to what I did wrong. I knew that the text messages were not the real reason. After 45 days of NC and being a wreck thinking that I was the bad person - I sent an apology text and asked for a second chance. He didn't reply. A few days later i wasn't even looking for it, but had clear proof that he was dating the girl I had a gut feeling about. No questions asked. He literally set up a new relationship with her before exiting his relationship with me. He used me for the time being and then hopped to the next lily pad when it came around. Only a coward couldn't even admit there was someone else. I don't believe he didn't tell me the truth to protect me because of his pretty much ghosting behavior tells me he had no regard for my feelings. Only until I demanded an explanation did he give me a lame excuse (no one is going to sleep with me for that long and take my time to just side step out of my life without a word). Instead he too advantage of my vulnerability and grasped at straws for any excuse to give me and left me sitting here to think this entire time I was a bad person who messed everything up. I learned such a lesson on being nice to myself and I will NEVER beat myself up over somebody else ever again. No wonder I was feeling insecure and needy - he was dividing his energy between two women so of course my needs weren't being met. As a matter of fact, I am not a needy and insecure woman whatsoever. I am usually a very low maintenance girlfriend and could stand to require more attention in future relationships. And his criticisms and analytical looks that made me insecure was him deciding whether he should leave me for her. I finally have the answers I so desperately needed to accept it and move on. Now I don't have to think about it anymore. Before I was obsessing trying to figure out what really happened. I'm happier than ever. I have so much closure now. As painful as it was to discover he left me for someone else, I feel the best I have in months! I'm finally free from filling in unanswered gaps with self-blame. He is a double coward - 1. Exploring other relationships outside of ours and 2. Not owning up to his cowardly behavior in 1 and instead started neglecting me for an easier way out. He knew his wrongdoing and to relieve his conscience (I do believe he has one) and cope with his guilt, he had to pin me as the one out of line once I demanded an explanation for the neglect. He knows I loved him and believe him telling me I'm wrong wrong and it boggles my mind he would be so cruel to let me walk through life blaming myself. How messed would my next relationship have been if I continued to think I deserved the way he treated me and the way he left me? I'm still disappointed that the relationship ended because when things were good they were good. But better yet, now I'm ready to open up my heart again and can start this next relationship with restored confidence that I am a good person and didn't do anything wrong enough to deserve such a sorry ending. For those told that they are being left for someone else, at least appreciate the honesty in them giving you the answers up front - you are already halfway there in coping. I already feel a ton better. TDLR: he dumped me over something petty. I hated myself and believed I was the cause of the break up. Then found out he looked for something to dump me for so that he could guiltlessly enter a new relationship he had already started with someone else behind my back. I learned to never beat myself up for someone else's cowardly actions. "

Up until recently, we had been talking about plans for getting engaged etc., so this came as quite a shock for me. I've been struggling to process everything over the last few days, and somebody recommended I write down exactly how I feel right now. It'd be great to hear from anyone who has or is going through something similar. I feel like a huge piece of me has been ripped out and erased. I feel like my world is upside down. I feel like I had no voice, no say. I feel lost. I feel like I'm both numb to and sensing everything at the same time. I feel like she's hiding something from me or from herself. I feel like she may be right, that we're not ""compatible"", but I don't know what that means. I feel like my mind is playing on repeat. I feel like the love I gave wasn't recognized. I feel like she reset my life path. I feel broken. I feel like I could go back and fix it, but I wouldn't know what to change. I feel intentionally excluded from the decision. I feel like it's not quite over, but I know it is. I feel like her decision wasn't made at a time when she could think it through. I feel grateful for the friends that rushed to help. I feel like my unconditional love wasn't good enough. I feel like I don't know what she was looking for. I feel like I needed to be everything for her and failed. I feel like all I have are questions and no answers. I feel like she flipped a switch to turn off compassion for me. I feel like my vulnerability wasn't reciprocated. I feel exposed. I feel scared. I feel hurt. I feel like I need to move on, but I don't know where to go. I feel caught off guard. I feel like an old favorite toy that's no longer wanted. I feel confused how she's so sure but ""can't explain"". I feel overwhelmed at the prospect of facing this change. I feel unable to process for lack of understanding. I feel like there's no avenue for closure. I feel devastated by the thought of never seeing her again. I feel I need space, but I am afraid of what that means. I feel the need for clarity. I feel indebted for the ways she helped me grow. I feel like I want to hold on to the shared memories, but I don't know how I can. I feel like it ended all wrong, but there was no other way. "
250,vulnerability,BreakUps,Broke up with my girlfriend of 5+ years less than 2 months ago.,1,7o9cxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7o9cxv/broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_5_years_less_than/,2018-01-05 17:21:12,"Just some back story. Been dating my ex (feels so wrong to say that) since she was 15 and I was 16. We are currently 21 and 22. She was my first and only love. The only person that I have ever been with. When we started dating I had many friends, I had a good life. I had her. As the years passed I fell blind to the way I prioritized my time. I spoke less to others and more to her. All I had in the end was her and my family. Post-break up I realize I have no actual friends since ive lacked all communication with the ones I did have. She way my only friend and now im pushing her away too. Everything I did, every thought I had, it was always about her. The first two years we spoke about everything and anything. Whenever we weren't around each other, we would write essays. She lived two hours away but every weekend we would do the travel to each other. No longer was I a single person, she became part of who I am. We grew together from children to adults. I could be myself around her...but only to a certain degree. I made mistakes as a teenager that other teenagers would do such as compliment or flirt with other people without intentions of anything happening. Nothing ever did happen. This whole relationship, even after its ended my lips haven't even come close to touching another womans. 3 years in, i'm forced to keep a promise. To not make other female friends. I would apply for jobs, and she would get upset since it grows the chance of me meeting new people (women) to talk to. She checks my phone, she checks all of my emails and accounts. I get angry and accuse her of trust issues. We fight. It's a process im all too familiar with. My ex tells me that if I have nothing to hide then I have nothing to worry about. But it isnt about worrying, its about the feeling of not being trusted. It was unhealthy, but I still put up with it because I truly love her. 2017 was probably the worst year we've ever had. With her own issues involving finance, family and housing she would come to me and cry about it. I would be there in the start, but all of a sudden, it started to become white noise after constantly hearing it all over and over again. I would push her away, I wouldnt be there. I can see my part and where I went wrong. She would then go to another guy (that i knew she was talking to, which i told her to be careful around) that would comfort her in my place. One night he kissed her, I wasnt there but she says she didnt return the kiss and said to him that she wanted me instead. I made her feel at her lowest and this guy took advantage of her vulnerability. I blame myself, but I also blame her. I broke up with her, but not just because of that reason. These are the biggest ones I thought about for a few weeks; That whole scenario was wrong. She shouldnt have gone to another guy for comfort, why not one of her girlfriends?* The hypocracy. Tells me I cant speak to other girls, yet does the opposite I may have had commitment issues. I would hide it with the excuse that I wanted to be financially stable before moving out. She was ready. The biggest reason I ended this relationship was because deep down, I know that I will regret doing it later when my youth is all gone and I feel regrets about not living life. I want to travel, discover myself, see what else is out there when all I know is her and I. What if there is someone out there that shares my hobbies and doesn't watch over my shoulder like a hawk and puts controlling rules on me? What if there is someone better fit? POST BREAK-UP We still message each other. Every single day. My brain tells me that I broke up for a reason but my heart tells me to give this another chance. She tells me that her door is still open as long as I dont move on. I feel the same way, but I feel like even if she did move on and if there was a glimmer of hope, I would want to take her back. I regret breaking up with her as I type. As this whole text post is my heart taking control. She is the one I go to when I want to speak about my day, my best friend and my soul mate. Was my decision wrong? Ive been trying to occupy my thoughts. I started going to the gym a month ago and bought a guitar 3 weeks ago (been playing the guitar daily and going to gym twice a week). I am going through the application stages of a new job that will send me to another state for half a year. Which I hope I get as it would be a good life-changing experience. My day can be going great, like a solid 10/10 day but then all it takes is 1 song, or 1 name, just 1 reminder of her, and I will feel broken inside. I get scared that I wont find anyone as beautiful, as kind, as generous or feel connected to as much as I have her. There are only two reasons I wrote this post. 1. To just drain out all of the bottled up feelings that I dont think I could express to anyone else in person and, 2. I just want to know if anyone here, or if anybody here knows of someone that has been in a similar situation. Sorry for the long post and thankyou if anyone responds."
251,vulnerability,BreakUps,Meeting with ex tonite,1,7gm8rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7gm8rg/meeting_with_ex_tonite/,2017-12-01 00:14:56,"Good afternoon guys. Im going to try to be as detailed yet concise as I can be especially since every minute is gut wrenching to me. I was dating my girl for almost 2 years(Im 28 shes 23). At first we started just as random hookups and things escalated. At first I didnt take her very seriously because we were just fooling around, plus my family is adamant about me being with a girl who is also middle eastern (which I personally dont care about). The last time i was in a relationship (maybe 5 years ago) things didnt go over so well and I had a really hard time and slipped into a really bad place in my life. I thought I was doing the right thing by breaking up with her after I began to have feeligns for her, however I never told her how I really felt and why I was beginning to drift away (late texts and sometimes i didnt even reply). Almost 2 months passed and I missed her every day but thought I could be a big boy about this, but I cannot escape this feeling of missing her. We were apart since mid September and started talking again last week. I kinda had enough and said I needed to get something off my chest so we met up and I explained to her why I was behaving the way I was, I explained the cultural boundries and how I was afraid of my family's reception of her-- which after a ton of thinking, is more manageable than I expected. Im sure if i was steadfast about keeping her they would accept it (I mean they have to right?). I was absolutely transparent and honest and just really genuine- we spoke for a few hours and she was just shocked. Eventually she told me she was hooking up with someone and that just kinda broke me. I was already pretty heartbroken but the thought of someone else kissing her or taking care of her or hugging her even makes my guts twist. Later that night she texted me and told me she loved me, and made it a point to emphasize that she had sad that after having some time to settle down and that she didnt just say that because I had finally told her. After this next encounter on the next day things have been off. Im having a myriad of conflicting emotions and intentions and thoughts and its really diminishing from me. We met once after and had a good time, but then after that she has made it a point to leave me on read, or answer later or not even reply at all. This really hurts me and I get upset and say something a bit passive aggressive and I feel like I drive her away more. At one point she said she needed time but I wasnt sure if she wanted me away or close. Ive told her a few times since that I love her and she hasnt replied in kind whatsoever. When I called to try to talk to her she sounded like she wasnt having it- she was just passive and kidna dismissive and when I asked about plans she said she would let me know(Ive been rejected before I know what this means)-- so I asked her if she was even happy tlaking to me again or if it upset her or what exactly my status is with her (mind u almost 1 week after our talk)-- and she just said ""it doesnt matter, if u wanna talk then talk if u dont wana talk then dont"" so I replied kinda of upset and told her to just call me back when it will matter and if she wants to see me. I recognize that at this point it would probably be best for my integrity to stay out of the picture and if its meant to be then she'll come back etc etc- but im just really unsettled. Am I gonna sit here and pretend im not waiting for her to reach out or that im not grabbing my phone everytime it buzzes in hopes shes reaching out? Am i supposed to wait for a rejection or is it clear already? Am I waiting for her to come back and then ahve to deal with the personal hurdle that she was involved with someone else already? Am I to just start moving on and forgetting her until maybe she contacts me after 2-3 weeks or whatever? Im just really conflicted and lost, and to her I let her go so easy and she didnt care how I felt about the whole family thing. 2 days ago I texted her letting her know how I feel again, what im prepared to do and that if she wants me to fight for her Ill do whatever I have to and if she doesnt want me to just let me go. Yesterday we got into a bit of an argument and i was honestly just overwhelmed and breaking down and tried to speak with her and she just didnt care. I dont know if shes acting like this because i hurt her before or if she genuinely doesnt. We are supposed to meet again tonite to talk but im having really mixed feelings about what to expect. I almost want to pour my whole heart and intentions out to her, but on the other hand i feel like i shouldnt concede any more vulnerability. She still goes out with the other guy since we spoke so im not sure if thats a clear indication or if shes trying to make up her mind or what exactly. Anyone have any advice or insight?"
252,vulnerability,BreakUps,A year ago...it's been a YEAR.,9,771l4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/771l4x/a_year_agoits_been_a_year/,2017-10-18 07:56:51," I knew the date was approaching. Your birthday is October 15th, which means that October 17th was right around the corner. Last year- in September- things changed. I knew things weren't perfect, we'd spent 2016 fighting a lot. Something that neither of us like. You were angry with me because I needed to stay in San Francisco for one more year while you finished grad school in NYC. We were both sexually frustrated, both horny males and the facetime/whatsapp sex wasn't working as well. We both strayed, we both admitted it. The encounters meant nothing as our emotional loyalty was pure. Each time we'd see each other, the miles fell away, the fighting and the disappointment became nothing and there was just your bright smile, your dark eyes, the 3 little dimples under your left eye that I always called ""my constellation"". But in September, you met another. He was just like you. He even *looks* like you. You have the same hobbies, interests, music tastes, political opinions. You are the same age, have similar backgrounds, neither of you has a family, you are both adventurous, party animals, drinkers, smokers. I am older, laid-back, introverted. On our 5 year anniversary, you mentioned him for the first time- your new ""friend"". One month later, on October 17th, we would have dinner. October was terrible between us. Something was wrong. I'd flown back to NYC twice to try and make things work, to try and understand what happened- and all I could feel was distance. For 5 years I had known you as the warm, open, smiling sarcastic jackass that secretly showed me his vulnerability. I was the only that had seen you cry. I remember after your mother finally passed and you were stunned and in shock. You were cool headed and logical- it wasn't until 2am that night in the hotel that you collapsed in my arms. I cried with you- because in the 4 years we'd been together, and in the 37 years I'd walked this Earth, I've never seen someone I love in so much grief. October 17th....We had dinner at an Indian place. I was still hopeful that I could somehow ""fix"" this. Conversation was strained and awkward. You snapped at me when I brought up that things still felt distant. Snapped at me. You!? Always so friendly, so agreeable, cursing under your breath: How many *fu***** times do we have to talk about this stupid relationship? Finally you said your piece. ""I think we need a break. I have to finish grad school. My mom's one year anniversary is in a few weeks and I haven't even started to deal with that. I have to finish my documentary, I just need some time and space away from this. From Us. It feels like all we do is fight."" Your words hurt, but they were right. I- so stable, your rock and anchor, was in complete emotional disarray and you couldn't handle it. We are exact opposites. ""How Long?"" ""I don't know...let's say 2 months?- Let's meet in January...I'll have graduated by then"" ""WHAT?! Joseph! Thanksgiving? Christmas?"" ""We weren't going to spend them together anyway, I'm going to see my family- but we can text on those days?"" ""Are you sure about this?"" ""Yes- I'm sure....but I'm scared. I don't want you to move on, I know I can't ask you not to...I know we will end up back together...but for now, I think it's best that we just stop speaking for awhile"" I drove you home. We were silent. I had to pull over when I broke down crying. I hadn't cried like that in years- I think I knew, deep down, I already knew the truth. We hugged goodbye- you told me you loved me and we kissed. You said to look at the bright side, that we'd have so many things to catch up on in January. I waited until you walked inside your house, you never looked back. I remember those first few days...thinking to myself 100, 200, 1000 times ""it's been 2 days since we spoke. 2 days, 2 days, 2 days""- then it was 3. Then it was 8. Then it was 14. Each day was torture. It felt like part of my heart had been ripped out. With us being on different coasts, I was used to not seeing you, I was used to my phone and my ipad being the methods of communication with you. A few times I almost texted you, sure this was all some mistake. Slowly the time passed- I made it to November. Thanksgiving came and went, I looked at my phone, sure I'd hear from you. I didn't. Same with December. I cried on Christmas in secret, not wanting my family to know how devastated I was, lost in the memories of our last 5 christmases. I didn't hear from you. You finished grad school and got your Masters degree. I should've been there, I never heard from you. January 1st came, and I resolved to stop being so sad. I learned my mistakes and saw all the issues we had in our relationship, where I was selfish and not supportive. I saw it from your eyes and stopped feeling sorry for myself. I texted you to ask when we could meet. You wrote back all excited- I told you I was coming to NYC in February and could we meet live? You said ""of course!! I'm so excited to learn what you've been up to! Text me the week before you get here and we can finalize plans!"" On one side, it was such a nice reesponse, it was so great to see your number on my messages again- on the other...it seems so distant...we hadn't spoken in months, we were in love for 5 years...why not talk until I get there? I am not masochistic. We blocked each other on Social Media- it was your suggestion to ensure we didn't ""slip and get tempted"" - I never looked once. 4 days before we met though, my friend, who didn't know we had broken up and who you were still friends with texted me to ask ""what happened?"" You had updated your FB account. You were in a relationship now. It was the guy from Canada. Your ""new friend"". I pretended to not know. We met live. You were distant and angry. You didn't want to meet live. I insisted. You texted me on your way to the hotel. ""Ok, I just need to be honest here. I don't want to walk in a situation where you make some sort of plea to get back together. I am with Chris now, it is serious, and I couldn't be happier."" We met live and it was horrible. We were both drunk. We yelled at each other. Neither of us ever do that, but there we were, yelling at each other. 45 minutes later and you left- before you closed the door, you looked back ""I'm sorry Daniel....I'm just not where you are. I wish you all the happiness of the world."" I spent the next few months picking up the broken pieces. I was so angry at first- why not just tell me from the start that this was about your feelings for another guy??? Why tell me it was a ""break"" and lead me on for 4 months? I decided to open a new account and checked your FB, huge mistake, starting from the VERY week we ""went on break""- the two of you were tagging each other, taking pictures of each other at concerts, restaurants- 2 months after meeting and you were in Disney World together. In January you went to London together, then Mexico. Pictures from the week after we met showed that you went to Las Vegas together, and even worse, he had already met your family- one horrible picture where he is holding the hand of your niece while your brother has his arm around him. My heart felt like it was ripped apart. I couldn't fathom ever being ""okay"" again. I put myself back together slowly. So slowly. So many tears. So many days lost in reflection and sadness, yet always moving forward. I resigned from my company, sold my car and my apartment and went to South America for 3 months. It was there I found myself, I reclaimed who I was. I was strong. I am a human. You are a human. I forgave us both on the southern tip of Argentina. Throwing the very first picture of us, the one taken at the Grand Canyon, into the ocean. With that, I let go of my guilt, of my pain and sorrow. I recognized I was still healing, it would take me awhile to get over it completely, but that I would be fine. I had finally begun separating you out of my life. I came back to NYC in July. I got a job with a company I love making a great salary. I have a host of new friends and started to lightly date someone. I've lost 45 lbs, I reconnected with old friends, started playing saxophone again. I am moving to Manhattan into an amazing 2 bedroom apartment in 2 weeks. I am excited for my new life. I still think of you- but its so faded, so muted. 4 days ago- I got the shock of my life. You had texted me. You saw an open position at the New York Times and knew I had a contact there. I told you I would help you and I would. I don't have an ounce of negativity towards you. I understand what happened and I forgave you. Within minutes, our old rapport kicked in and we both became curious about what the other had been up to. You are still with Chris. He still lives in Canada and is moving to the UK. I laugh as I think of the irony that for the last few years, your biggest complaint about ""us"" was the distance, and here I am 2 miles from you every day while you date someone who lives in another country, Your documentary failed, you had to move to a crappy neighborhood and you hate your job. I am recovering, I am almost there- I feel empathy at your unhappiness, yet don't at the same time. It's not my business, it's no longer my problem. I never thought I would survive- but I surprised myself. Yes I still miss you- I miss your laugh and your touch, but after a year, I've accepted that I will find someone else, that I will learn from my mistakes and find something beautiful- and that you will too.

253,vulnerability,BreakUps,to the one who broke me.,1,79ypza,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/79ypza/to_the_one_who_broke_me/,2017-11-01 07:45:03,"Ive been thinking about it and I didnt want things to turn out the way it did. What i discovered that day hurt me beyond belief. I know you were asking for space, or rather a break. And all i wanted was to have a word with you before i let you go do you. to clear things up, because reading those words started to hurt me. It would of meant the world to me if you just gave me a moment to tell you how much i love you and will give you what you need to better yourself. thats all i asked for, just 5 minutes of your time. because the last phone call we had ended pretty badly with you angry at me for trying to talk about where we stood in the relationship. but you refused. you rejected my calls and told me you were going to call me a certain day, and i waited but you never called. I didnt know what you really wanted anymore, so i blocked you on everything to keep myself from stalking you, because i found myself looking at your profile every 5 minutes. I didnt want to lose you, so i took extreme measures to keep myself from bothering you and thinking too much of little things like hiding your relationship status. thats why i fucking hate facebook. i honestly dont even know why i deleted you off snapchat cause i never use it. i could of just deleted the app. but i guess i would still find myself re downloading it and looking at your stories. I turned off your phone for the mere fact that i didnt feel comfortable paying for someone who never gave me a clear understanding on what your definition of a break meant. yes you told me it was space for you to 'heal'. but you were talking to me with disdain, never responding to me when i told you that I love you. At that point i was panicking, coming into a realization that maybe you just didnt want to be with me anymore. A break to me meant that you were ready to break up, or sleep with someone else without it being considered cheating. Either way, hearing from the person that you love so much say that they want a break is painful. Two days later after i had disconnected the phone you break up with me through email. but the night before you sent it i had regretted my decision to cut your phone off so i turned it back on. You said you respected my decision to cut ties. But it was you who didnt want to talk to me. You said you didnt care if i blocked you or cut your phone off. You didnt notice it was back on. i wasnt buying what you were telling me. I couldnt believe it. just like that you asked me to be the bigger person and send you your things and asking me to send you money for your doctor. The way you wrote that email, it seemed as if you really didnt care. throwing away our relationship casually as if it wasnt shit. I replied to you the second i saw your email. i kept it short telling you i only blocked you to keep myself from bothering you, and telling you i had no peace since all of this snowballed out of control. I didnt hear back from you. When i got that email, it didnt surprise me as much. If anything it seemed a bit expected. Yes i was starting to hurt more because I didnt want things to end between you and me . especially not the way you broke up with me. through fucking email. I remembered one day when i cleaned my room while you were visiting your family, i found your old phone. I turned it on that day and found out your facebook was logged in after all that time not being used. I wasnt tempted to look through it, after all i trusted you and I believe in not meddling in other people's private things. But you went through my texts one day on my old phone, and even tried making a problem out of a conversation i had with christian months ago. I was a little mad about it, but i forgave you for it. but since then i gave myself i pass. If i ever felt like something felt very off, i'd look through your old phone. I didnt think id ever do that though, i wasn't waiting for the opportunity. But that day when you broke up with me felt very off. And so i turned on your phone once more. I couldnt believe what id seen. In the 2 days after i turned your phone off you went ahead and had sex all weekend with the person you once told me was a ""gay"" friend. only 3 weeks since you went away back to your family. After we had made up from a huge fight. talking about our future plans together and come in stronger for 2018. I broke down. You bragged to your friend about how he was beautiful and how many condoms you guy ran through. telling the son of a bitch himself that you hoped you didnt suck the life out of him. The pictures in my head with the things you were saying are traumatizing. I didnt think you were capable of such things. And to add salt to the wounds i come to find you were having a laugh at my expense. showing your friends screenshots of our texts of me basically pleading to talk to you. Saying how you had to put your foot down on me. You had no problem showing my vulnerability to your friends. all the while insulting me, for cutting off your phone and blocking you. Laughing at me for thinking i reactivated your phone because you sent me the email and calling me a cunt. showing your friends our personal matters, leaving off information and making yourself seem like you were dealing with an oppressor. the oppressor being me. you said you werent worried about how i felt anymore to someone else. all the people you tried getting validation from dont even know who i am. I dont understand why you couldnt talk about the issues you were complaining about to me instead. I also saw you were confessing your love to someone you never even met in person. The irony of me even bringing that up, seeing as we met online and shared our feelings. but atleast i made the effort to come and meet you over 700 miles away to a place ive never been before. And then that's when I also found out you had actually replied to my response to your email. I didn't receive it but you showed your mom a screenshot of what you had to say. ""I love you too but this isn't working out."" How coild you throw that word around like that to me? Honestly, i think if i hadn't disconnected your phone i wouldnt even find out about what you were doing and saying since you resorted to facebook to contact your friends. I was angry. infuriated beyond belief. Without hesitation i destroyed everything you had asked me for in your email. The email i wrote back to you about the things ive done for you, telling you how i fucking hate you, was probably the most tame things ive could of said to you at the moment. A week later i get a text from a number i dont even know. ""I miss your touch"". why would you do this to me? why would you go ahead and keep playing with me like that? i feel like a fool for unblocking you on facebook, thinking maybe you had something to say to me. but you ended up blocking me instead. I know i wasnt the perfect boyfriend. I wish i could of done things differently. I wish things didnt turn our like this. Maybe you were already checking out while you were still with me. But the way you ended things has left me a broken man. A month has already passed since the breakup, and i feel devastated. I hate the fact that i still miss you and love you so much. I hate to think that i would never be able to speak with you again. I hate that i want to speak with you again. I hate the fact that your birthday is in a week. I hate that all this is happening during the holidays. I fucking hate you."
254,vulnerability,BreakUps,"After a year of on/off post breakup, and finally a month of no contact, I still have no control or clarity over my emotions. Am I doing the right thing?",1,7bv0ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7bv0ig/after_a_year_of_onoff_post_breakup_and_finally_a/,2017-11-10 04:58:52,"We (now 27M/27F) met at my new job two years ago. It was a very intense, raw kind of love. The most intense and real Id ever experienced. We had some trust issues but nothing that wasnt fixable. Neither of us had ever felt that way about another person before. It was deep and passionate. It was pure ecstasy. She ended it a year ago. I had moved 2 hours away after I left the company for a better position, and we saw each other every weekend. After several months out of the blue she decided that she had lost herself and her independence in the relationship, that commitment wasnt what we wanted. That the idea of vulnerability and the work that being in a relationship entailed was too much for her. NC for a month and then I reached out. Cue a year of toxic on and off. I was alone in a new city and had lost the love of my life. I couldnt let her go. She was still my whole world. I would drive back to bring her flowers, I would drop everything at the chance of seeing her again, Id constantly reach out. But she played hot and cold while she enjoyed the single life. Meanwhile I endured the worst depression Id ever experienced. I moved back to our city this June for another, better job. She said she couldnt promise me anything. She said that she thought something was wrong with her, that everyone talks about finding the right person and how that holds zero appeal to her. How she doesnt want a relationship. She eventually agreed to try dating again but it wasnt the same. She wasnt invested while I poured my entire soul into it. She only wanted to see each other once or twice a week. I wasnt a priority. It hurt so badly. We broke up again while she was on a euro trip she had planned while were initially broken up, because of her acting sketchy and distant. After returning she continued to keep me at an arms length away, torturing me. All I wanted was a healthy shot at being together again. I initiated hard NC almost a month ago, the longest weve gone without speaking. Her last text was: Youve become such an amazing guy its actually kind of wild. Youre going to make someone very happy someday. I hope one day you understand why Ive kept you at a distance and avoided hanging out. I know she doesnt want to be with me, shes said it enough. But this pain is too much. I struggle every day with not reaching out as I feel that Im letting someone go that just is afraid of love. That I can show her that the ideal version of us is attainable. I cant get her out of my head, my dreams, not even when Im at work. Shes been haunting me for a year and I cant take it anymore. Ive been taking steps to work on myself and improve my life but nothings working. Im in the best shape of my life. I work for an amazing company. Ive been seeing a therapist. I have no issues meeting other women but it just never clicks. I simply cant shake this ghost that hovers over me every second of the day. I am obsessing over someone that doesnt deserve in any way to be on this pedestal I placed them on. Whats wrong with me? Can anyone offer advice on how I should proceed? I need to take back control of my life once and for all. I just dont know how. The only solution seems to be giving it one finally shot. But deep inside I know its not the way forward. "
255,vulnerability,BreakUps,I've learned some valuable lessons over the last month.,1,7c1mmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/7c1mmo/ive_learned_some_valuable_lessons_over_the_last/,2017-11-11 02:07:08,"Hey all. Here's my story: started hooking up April 2016, became official Sep/Oct 2016. Been w her through her senior thesis and LSAT. She has serious anxiety and depression and was on Lexapro that fall semester. I was there for her and emotionally open. Communication and vulnerability between us was on point and trusting. We graduate in May - I move back to LI, She moves back to Jersey. I help her move into her NYC apartment in August. Unfortunately my summer was spent studying for the LSAT and job searching. Our convos begin to dwindle late July. You felt the air die during dinner convos. I begin to get distant and complacent, but the complacency was due to my stress at home. I stop being so emotionally open to her too. She breaks up on October 7 bc of the lack of emotional support. During the BU, She complains that whenever she tried to bring up problems in our relationship (about 2x), the next day I just forget about it. Our communication between each other became difficult - we always had something on our minds but our anxieties and trust issues from past trauma inhibited us. I begin to realize after starting therapy 3 weeks ago that I dissociate. This started happening after moving back into a home that has caused me psychological/emotional/physical trauma growing up. My old self prior to moving out to college began to resurface. I really wanted to reconciliate with her but it was too hard. I had to change. She initiated NC which lasted from 10/10-10/26. I broke NC bc I answered her snap story blackout and told her of my possible PTSD. No contact since but it's sad that our mental issues tore us apart. Apparently she saw me at our homecoming 11/4 and her mood completely changed. She felt a type of way, my friend told me. Tbh it felt good bc I was on her mind. It was a spiteful feeling though. Me on he other hand was having a blast even though I was anxious of seeing her. The chemistry was there between us; there was no hatred or animosity. Although she wanted me to be more sincere, interested, and open to her this summer, I felt the same way about her. We're actually so similar because she has family trauma and violence, but our capacity to deal with that and ourselves during the summer wasn't there. The most valuable thing I have gotten from this is that both partners need to be explicit about their wants and needs. I'm still recovering even though I'm hopeful that we can share something together in the future. So far I've been interviewing at firms in the city and am very hopeful on moving out there once I land a position. That prospect has been keeping me excited and happy. Meditation has been very helpful as well. I'm hopeful for my 20's. If we do end up together, it can only be done if we both change. I just wanted to offer up my story for everyone else out there. NC has been so helpful. It alleviates the pain and helps with self growth and self love. Therapy is a continuing process but I love it. Try to find a therapist that you're compatible with. Though we haven't blocked/unfollowed each other on socials, I'm still trying to live my best life, with or without her. "
256,vulnerability,BreakUps,We had a nice ride but it's over and you wanted to get off.,4,70v9ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/70v9ru/we_had_a_nice_ride_but_its_over_and_you_wanted_to/,2017-09-19 00:16:50,"I woke up today and everything feels like nothing. Not numb. Not aching just nothing. I want to say everything tastes like ash but honestly I taste nothing. I'm lucky to be in a lovely country like Belgium but I feel so little. If everything wasn't so lovely I would feel more alone then I do now. I'm forcing myself to eat. I'm drinking wine to cope. Right now I'm drinking a Malbec. A wine we talked about on our first date. Overly sentimental for me to choose this wine. Ironic the time I decided to be emotional and vulnerable is when I'm writing this to you. I'm thinking over about what I did wrong. How was I so blind and maybe I'm too closed off? I was scared to open up and in a way glad I didn't if you were going to drop me while I was gone. Should I have cancelled my trip? Was I that awful you had to wait till you were strong enough to leave me? Did I have my boundaries too strong you felt fruitless to share your woes with me? Maybe I was too cold? Maybe I should have been on my best behavior instead of being just me in the beginning. I keep asking myself how was I not good enough. How I wasn't worth the wait? I only had 72 hours left and I'd be back home. Instead I'm alone. Distracting myself and trying not to bother people while I sob on the street in the puddle of my own loathing. I'm not mad at you. Not even in the slightest. I know I'm hurt. My eyes won't stop crying but I'm not mad. Break ups are selfish event. You choose to make a definitive choice to cut me off and to protect yourself. You had demons I knew you didn't share. I had some too and thought maybe I should wait longer. If I shared too early and you'd leave me I'd be alone again. In my own darkness, in my own void. Instead of being mad at you I hate myself. I hate that I failed again. That I was basically told I'm not enough. I'm not angry, I'm hurt and my thoughts are wild but I'm not in physical pain like you. At first I was shocked. Then I was offended. Was my presence that terrible that being with me caused physical pain? I knew we were different in ways but I didn't think we were at opposite ends of our ideologies. Your break up text was quite confusing. Was being with me making you feel inferior? Did you really think you were holding my back? Or maybe you really just believe me when I said who I am single had different needs then the person I was in a couple? Did you think I was a liar? Someone so forthright and unabashed in my actions not being forward with you? Maybe you thought I was gross. I can't blame you for feeling that if you did but I'm still sad over it. I regret not calling you out when you offered a hall pass. I thought ""maybe he's offering it as a sign of vulnerability. That he wants to end it now instead of later. If I call him out maybe he'll be offended."" I wouldn't know. I'm not entire sure if I want to know. Maybe your answer is my worst fear. The true is you found someone better. Maybe you saw the flaws in our relationship I decided to look past. Maybe we didn't communicate as well as we or I thought we did. Maybe I'm full of shit now. It sounds like I'm having a pity party. Every so often I think maybe you're running away. You didn't choose to talk to me about your feelings. You just alluded to the nightmares you barley gave details too. Maybe it's because I said I'm scared to bare the weight again. That I wouldn't be able to do it. Emotionally incapable? I wish you'd had talked about it. I thought taking it slow was the right thing to do. I rushed in so many of my other relationships. I wanted to see if I did differently would I be less hurt. That was my selfishness. To be cornered into abandoning someone again because I wasn't strong enough. So you saw that that's why we're not compatible. That's why you choose to be in the worst mental and physical pain you can be in to cut me out. I can't be mad. I don't know how to be mad right now. It could be because I did always thought you'd never be first for you. I thought I was being negative but maybe I didn't want to admit it as the months went on. Did it drag for you? I'm not trying to guilt you. I hope you'll keep improving and get better health wise. We had a nice ride but the ride over and you had to get off. I don't expect a response. I'm content I sent it and got my muscle roller back. Honestly you could have burnt this and I'll never know. "

Every night around 8. We'd talk for awhile about everything. It was really pleasant to talk to someone who knew me so well. I helped her with some issues she was going through. She'd give me some insight as well. I even thought for a second. Maybe we can start over one day. Whatever I won't force it. I think deep down I wanted her back so bad. I'll admit I still love her. While she more or less discarded me. I believe she doesn't even love me anymore. I was joking with her today. Ended up joking about her coming to cook my favorite dish. She teased the idea then said lol ur not my bf so....That kinda hurt but ok.....She then tells me how horrible her day is and that she'll talk to me later. I call to cheer her up at our time. And it turns out I'm blocked. Tbh I feels little hurt. I've been lonely, feeling down, and working a lot. So I opened up to her again out of weakness and vulnerability. She showed me that no matter what she's still selfish. She'll never change. We're just not meant to be. Even as friends. This feeling sucks"
258,vulnerability,BreakUps,5 month hiatus,8,6zlswq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6zlswq/5_month_hiatus/,2017-09-12 19:02:20,"Okay, so.. I came on here almost 5 months ago when I first went through my break up. It sucked. It was the most difficult thing to deal with. I felt so alone. I felt really hurt and scared. I made excuses to be around my ex and keep in contact with him. I wasn't moving on, I wasn't getting anywhere, I was stuck. A lot of shit happened. I found out more about him than I ever knew after the break up, than what I knew when I was with him. The type of person he really is. Honestly, it feels like it's been a year. But, it's only been 5 months. Almost half a year. But, I officially cut him out of my life about 2 weeks ago. There has been absolute zero contact. No more late night phone calls of him drunk yelling at me. No more jealousy threats about me dating other guys. No more being taken advantage of sexually during my vulnerability. No more manipulation. No more abuse, mental, emotional or physical. It's finally done. And the only thing that I am unhappy with is that he wasn't the man I thought he was or wanted him to be. The good times are there in my head but the reality is so strongly right in front of my face. I truly could never go back with someone who doesn't love me. Not even to fill my void. It's not worth it. I'm actually happier on my own. Calmer. Relieved. And the best part is I get to be myself. I mean, it sucks that I can't find someone who loves me for me. But, that's okay. I'm not going to settle for anything less. I know my worth now. And, I have my ex to thank for that. Consider this lesson learned. "
259,vulnerability,BreakUps,"Got Led On- Hook, Line, and Sinker",1,6zt56v,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6zt56v/got_led_on_hook_line_and_sinker/,2017-09-13 17:49:40,"Hello Reddit! Here I am coming to you in desperation for advice, encouraging words, and anything else you may provide. This all happened tonight so it is still raw. *A LITTLE BACKGROUND* I just moved to a new part of the country a few months ago. I've been on tinder doing the dating thing. It's been E X H A U S T I N G- to say the least. The last couple months have been multi-week long flings, one night stands, or just bad dates. Dating recently had been like sticking jelly to a wall with a nail. That is, until I met Lolly. Part One: Lemme give you the details just because I think it'll be cathartic if I write them out. I met a girl named Lolly on Tinder. She was drop dead gorgeous and we hit it off better than I've hit it off with anybody on that app. We had a ton in common and it just felt like we had a super easy time talking to one another. We went on a date Saturday. It started by getting dinner. Everything was going just as I thought it would. We were laughing and having a great time. She seemed super into me And I reciprocated. I was finally like ""yeah!! This is actually a date that's working!! We're totally into each other!"" The whole time she was touching me and laughing at everything. After dinner we saw a movie. During the movie she started cuddling with me. Lolly even kissed me the cheek out of nowhere. My heart was literally fluttering because I was actually having a successful tinder date with a seemingly great girl. After the movie. We held hands and walked around town exchanging kisses. Part 2: I left the date extremely optimistic about my prospects. It was honestly the best feeling ever that night. I was so happy. We agreed to meet again on Tuesday. She would come to where I live and spend the night. ""Thrilled"" is an understatement tbh. Leading up to Tuesday she was sending me all sorts of texts like ""I can't stop thinking about you, Max!!"" Or ""Tuesday can't come fast enough!"" All of that really got my hopes up. She showed up Tuesday afternoon and we went on a walk around the lake here. Again, it was great. The conversation went smoothly and we both seemed to dig each other. We even stopped and made out for a bit. She told me she really liked me and wasn't used to feeling that way- especially after her last relationship. All of this really made me happy. We then went to dinner and I didn't notice a problem. Part 3 (this is when the going gets a bit tough): When we got back to my place we started walking back to my apartment from the parking lot. She stopped at her car however and said ""uh hey...I'm gonna go...I don't wanna spend the night tonight on second thought..."" I turned to her and was stunned. ""What?"" I asked. She responded with ""yeah I just have to get up early so maybe I shouldn't spend the night."" I just sighed and said ""okay we'll text me when you get home I guess..."" She then got in the car and drove off. I was D E V A S T A T E D to put it mildly. Did I talk too much? Was my taste in music too weird? Was our conversation too odd? Am I ugly?! No kiss or hug goodbye? Ouch!! I began analyzing every little thing that had transpired trying to figure out what I did wrong. I texted her and said ""hey if you're not attracted to me let me know. Text me when you can."" She responded three hours later with ""hi! I had so much fun with you! We should just be friends though. I don't want this going any further than that!"" Needless to say I was GOBSMACKED. I couldn't believe it!! What had happened?! What'd I do wrong?!? That was my best chance at actually meeting someone and having something special. I went from feeling like the luckiest and most contented person on the planet to the lowest scum ever. I even freaking cried. I haven't cried over a girl in so long. I kept rereading our conversation. It hurt so much because she was so fun and seemed so into it. I texted her back telling her I felt like shit and that I feel like what she did was kind of rud (it wasn't that rude but I was hurt okay?). I told her how hurt I was. I showed way too much vulnerability. She never responded and I know I've been ghosted. I just can't imagine what I said that was such a turn off for her. She seemed into every conversation I opened up to her about everything when she opened up to me. I showed too many of my cards. I laid it all out because I thought she was as well. Part 4: I haven't been able to sleep. I dozed off for ten minutes and woke up thinking it was all a nightmare. When reality sunk back in I felt worse than I had when I fell asleep. Now here I am. Writing a novel to you. I'm not gonna lie writing this all out was more for me than you. Idk how healthy it is to dwell but I just wanted to tell the whole story in all it's detail. It's really hard moving to a new part of the country and having no partner, supporter, or even just a lover. For some reason after how great the first date went I really had my hopes up. They were all crushed to pieces though. Usually I just shrug off dates that don't go well but this one...I just can't. Thanks for being an outlet Reddit. FYI: Yes, this is a crosspost from r/relationships"
260,vulnerability,BreakUps,"...I miss you, more than you could possibly know.",23,6lrqfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6lrqfq/i_miss_you_more_than_you_could_possibly_know/,2017-07-07 15:53:11,"Im not sure if you will ever read this, but on even the slightest chance that you do, I want to say that I miss you, more than you could possibly know. Not once did I think that you would completely walk out of my life. You always put me first and then one day you just decided that I wasn't important anymore. I would do anything for you, even if that meant dropping something else...I have and to this day still would. I guess it just amazes me how you phased me out of your life like you did. And Im not going to lie, it hurt. Not in a way where I just needed an Im sorry and a hug, but the kind of hurt that sticks with you and makes you wonder why you deserve to have someone you care about so much, drop you like you were absolutely nothing. But, I blame myself for this, not you. Life isn't supposed to be easy, it's supposed to be really really hard and I shouldn't have let a difficult patch prevent me from being with someone so amazing because life was hard. I cant forgive myself for that. Just like life, relationships are not easy, if they were, everything would be too simple. You cant have good things without the bad ones and I should have stepped back and taken a look at all of the incredible things that I was so fortunate to have, but instead, I panicked, lost everything, and often find myself saying what did I do!?. I am almost completely convinced that our sex life is why you gave up on us, which makes me feel horrible. I started experiencing sexual frustration less than a year ago and its awful. Ive gone through what it's like to craves someone's touch and to want to feel needed or wanted. I now know that this is how you must have felt all too often. Sex is a deep and powerful form of intimacy that bonds two people together like nothing else can. It brings couples closer to each other, its fun, and it feels good. You get this indescribable, energetic connection when you are having sex with your partner and its amazing. This is how I always felt with you. I now understand why sex is an important part of a healthy relationship, but what I dont understand is why you never initiated it when I didn't. This makes me think that you were under the impression I was no longer attracted to you, which I hate to think about...It actually makes me really sad. I hope that you didn't think, even for a second, that we were not having sex or being intimate because I was not attracted to you. That was never the case. You are so incredibly handsome and so fucking sexy. So what was the reason? I want to talk about it with you in person at some point. Im not proud of some of the things I have said or did to you...or things that I have not. You deserve so much and I wish more than anything that I was able to show you that. Even after all of this time, not a damn day goes by where I dont regret the decision to send you a text message about my feelings instead of talking to you in person about my concerns. I know that I've said this before and apologized for it, time and time again, but I just want you to know that I truly am still so incredibly sorry for what I did to you, for hurting you. I cant get over it. I'm sure by now you are wondering why you are reading something from me, again. Remember those sacrifices and compromises I told you I was ready to make? Well, Im still ready. I can no longer pretend that I dont care about you. Id rather put my all into you, despite everything we both have gone through, then put it into someone I dont actually care about, or love. E, you are not just someone I can give up on, so please dont give up on me, because Ill never give up on you. Ever since I started spending time with you, you reminded me of what it was like to feel, and it was terrifying, but with every passing moment I was with you, I let my guard down more and more until I had none left. I let myself be vulnerable to you and when I did I felt things that I didn't think were possible, I was shown a world that I didn't know existed, and was the happiest that I had ever been...so were you. One of my favorite memories is from a time at your moms house. You kept coming up with different ways to pick me up and flip me over, just because thats what we did, and after one of those attempts we both fell over and ended up on the floor laughing with the biggest smiles on our faces while literally on top of each other. Then there was a moment of silence. I looked deeply into your eyes while still on top of you, smiled, and then I leaned in and kissed you...this was the very moment I knew that I loved you. I had never felt more alive, ever in my life, than I had with you during something that probably lasted no more than a minute. I have fought many battles over the time we have been apart and most of them I've lost, but I did get the chance to conquer some of my own personal demons along the way. In fact, I really want to share what those were with you because I think youd like to hear them and because I know that they will make a difference in both of our lives. But, until you choose to take a leap of faith, stop being scared for even just a moment, and trust me, I'll wait, as patiently as I can, until you are ready. Just say the words im ready and Im there. I hope that one day you wake up and realize why I tried so hard to stay involved in your life and that you will find it somewhere in your heart to give me the chance to show you exactly how you deserve to be loved and cared for just like I gave you. Please, one day let me do that. I get that you are afraid of rejection and vulnerability, but if you let me, Ill love you at your worst. Ill love you when you dont like the person staring back at you in the mirror and Ill love you for any of your insecurities. Ill love you through any fight, breakdown, and every tear that you cant stand to shed because even at your worst, you are absolutely incredible and you are worth it. Ill love you for all of the things you are and all of the things you arent. Ill love you for all of your quirks, flaws, and bad habits because when I look at you I see perfection, I see the person that you inspire me to be. When I look at you I am happy to be alive. So, Ill love you through all of it, even through the moments where you don't love yourself. And if you let me, Ill love you like that forever. I won't let you down E, I promise. "

It was an intense long-distance relationship from the get-go, something I never thought I'd do, especially with someone as difficult as her, but that's how in love I was and it lasted a year. We talked every single day, and saw each other a good bit too. But to make matters worse, was being hurt and abandoned and still being made to feel like I was the bad guy, or like she was the victim. I had always felt like their was an imbalance - that I loved her way more than she loved me. That she was only keeping me around because she was lonely and was using me as a crutch as she had lots of personal problems. But she never really seemed interested in me - I never felt desired. Rarely even got a ""how was your day?"" She was so consumed with her own personal problems and in her own little world, her mind was always somewhere else and we always talked about her and her life. I tried to express this feeling to her before, but her response basically amounted to gas lighting. Regardless, I was so enamored with her as a person, I ignored how I was being treated. Eventually we broke up, because we were constantly fighting - or really she was always fighting. I couldn't understand why she was always so upset with me, the only way I could make sense of it is that she was tired of me and the distance and was just trying to sabotage things. We stayed friends for a short while, but again, I just felt like I was being used as an emotional crutch. She went from being a not-so good girlfriend, to just a shitty friend. The final straw was when she forgot my birthday (Our bdays are only 5 days apart). It sounds petty, but it confirmed my feelings of how unimportant I felt to her. So I went off on her and said some very ugly things to her, really just pent up frustration coming out. She said she'd never speak to me again, and in the handful of times I've cracked since then and tried to call or text her, even just to apologize,she hasn't answered. It really adds to the pain of being rejected and failing at something I worked so hard at, to know that she will never ever consider that she was wrong, never acknowledge that I may have been hurt by her, and how her perception of reality will always be entirely different - that I'm an evil person who got what he deserved.

He doesn't exist anymore. He's been replaced by someone who acts like having sex with me is a chore, who tells me my suicidal thoughts are invalid and that I'm just using them as a threat. Someone who is always late if he doesn't just stand me up completely, someone who gets annoyed at me for daring to show even a hint of negative emotion. You need time apart to 'sort yourself out'? Then actually sort yourself out. Sitting indoors all day playing on the xbox that I spent half of my first paycheck on is not sorting yourself out. It's the same thing you've been doing for years. Guess what, our relationship didn't deteriorate because you couldn't find a job, or because you don't have a lot of money. It deteroriated because you completely stopped putting any effort in. Relationships take work, but for you it just became a chore, didn't it? No one is perfect, I've had my own issues but I was a good girlfriend. I was loyal, always there for you, supported you through so much shit, helped you grow as a person. I was always planning nice things for us to do and buying you little surprise presents. I was understanding when you left your job. I was understanding when your sex drive went way down because you were depressed. I was a good partner. But you just took me for granted. You say you don't want to lose me from your life, you want to stay friends. But I'm not allowed to talk to you unless it's on YOUR terms. You'll call me at this time, you'll see me on this date. And if I even want to text you to say hi, I'm the worst person ever. What the fuck? I'm a person, not a fucking business deal. I don't know what friendship means to you but I don't think I want to be friends with someone who never speaks to me and places all these rules on me. You hurt me. You knew I'd been abused. You knew everything I'd been through. You were the first person I ever opened up to, I gave you everything, and you just took advantage of my vulnerability. But I'm fucking done. I'm tired of not eating and not sleeping and wasting my life away crying over a version of someone who doesn't exist anymore. There's someone better out there for me, and even if there's not, I'd rather be alone than be with someone who makes me feel like I'm nothing."

If you truly loved each other (and committed no transgressions, e.g. cheating, abuse, etc.) but still got dumped, then there was a good reason. Reflect, and take responsibility for your part in it. Challenge your ingrained beliefs about what it TRULY means to be in a relationship, what communication is, what intimacy is, what vulnerability is, what it means to trust someone, and so on. Take a look at your ""perfect"" childhood, your parents, religion, society, etc. Push back against what you think you know about the opposite sex (or same sex.) Go outside of your comfort zone. Put an end to bad habits. Be open to therapy. Set personal goals. Get to know yourself. Chances are you stopped questioning your ""truths"" long ago or never thought to do so. Go deeper than you have before and prepare to have your foundation rocked. Do not let yourself get comfortable again. You are going to spend the rest of your life reevaluating your axioms, but that is a good thing. If you have not said goodbye to your ex yet, let them know how appreciative you are, and don't be afraid to profess the ways they have improved you. If the love was real and not acrimonious, he/she will get it. (If they blame you completely for the breakup, then you are already ahead of this person in terms of betterment.) Then let go. It is unfortunate that sometimes it takes heartbreak to motivate change. But you have the power to reframe this painful experience into a positive one. Your path is unraveling. Do not waste this opportunity to grow."
264,vulnerability,BreakUps,Writing Your Way Through a Breakup | Helpful Tools,5,66pwge,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/66pwge/writing_your_way_through_a_breakup_helpful_tools/,2017-04-22 01:29:14,"I discovered writing as a way to deal with my breakup, and want to share this with others. I have always had an easy time with breakups, but not this one. I had taken a SHIT job I HATE after turning down stellar opportunities that would have required a move, because he needed to stay here for his job. I had solace in coming home to him and his support while taking time to find the right role in this city. I also loved him more than I ever have. We made amazing new memories together, and made a huge impact in our community. I'm used to having my career to fall back on, and having a bit of the ""upper hand"" in a breakup. Now I'm in a shit job renting my guest room on AirBnB, while he picks a nice apartment and his career shoots up thanks in part to sacrifices I still have to live with. So now I needed a new way to cope. Writing has helped. Especially when I question our decision, when the memories flood in and look so beautiful, I turn to the pages and pages. Here's what I wrote, in order: 1. Running list of items to address in therapy - This is where most of the other stuff started. I would list things I wanted to discuss in therapy. Writing them and some notes helped me prioritize and think through by seeing on paper. This was brainstorming. I ended up with some self-reflection on my faults, some pros/cons for getting back together, and a smorgasbord of other thoughts. 2. Analysis of major relationships - I did sheet for each of my four prior major BFs. I was trying to draw patterns of the good, the bad, and the ugly of the guys I picked and how I reacted to them. Being able to point a finger at myself at this point and say, ""Yea, they're assholes, but here is how you fucked up too,"" was major important. For each BF I did likes on the left, dislikes on the right, and a list of my ""Bad Reactions."" For example on ""Bad Reactions"" I noted on two BFs that I clammed up and would not be vulnerable. That led to thinking about what they did (harsh criticism and abusive remarks that left me feeling unsafe with them) and what I could have done better (tell them the effects of their actions, get into counseling with them, etc). 3. All the mean things my ex said - This became my go to when after a few weeks he started looking like a good option again. When the friends were pulling back and the nights alone in our old house started getting sad. For you this might not be about ""mean"" things, could be ""annoying"" things. Could be major differences. It's a blunt reminder of what you would face if you went back to your ex. I wrote it when my ex and I were trading logistical e-mails, and he slipped in a nasty comment in the same e-mail we were discussing how we will relate in our small community. My one thought of, ""Gee, that was mean,"" led to, ""Shit, he said a lot of mean stuff over our course,"" which led to the list, which actually led me to realize a). He would continue being nasty, and b). Why the fuck would I be friends with him if he had said X, Y, and Z?! This list holds you to important truths!!! It makes you accountable to yourself if you think about going back. 4. Refined comparison of relationships - I went back to my original four pages about the big relationships, and then thought more about what I had learned since then. I wrote three lists in the same format. On the left, the characteristic, on the right, a column for each of my four BFs in time oreder. I put a yes or no for each characteristic for each BF. It provides a powerful graphic to see your changes over time, and to help see your patterns with lovers). The three lists of characteristics I made were a). Characteristics of my BFs. This was anything that stood out about even one of them. However, that forces you to look at the other ones (three in my case) and say ""Oh yeah, the other three did that too."" This helps identify patterns that could be positive or negative. Ex: loved the outdoors, had a history of substance abuse, reciprocated romantic gestures. b). Relationship characteristics. Ex: started fast, quality of sex, had adventures together. c). My reactions. Ex: became jealous of his athleticism, gave him my vulnerability, lost trust. 5. The ""Get Back Together"" bargaining sheet. I think this could be dangerous, but, for me, it was critical to write down all the conditions I would have for him and I to get back together. This included things I expected him to ask of me. Ex: He has to apologize to my best friend for calling her ""vile"", and I have to let him lead a house project so I can be vulnerable. This really helped me see that it was unrealistic he can, in some cases should, make all the changes needed to be my BF. It also helped me identify key things i need to do before I try dating again. 6. Why we are not meant to be. So, I think this is the culmination of the end of the relationship. It really helps me now when I see him out and we exchange pleasantries, and I think, ""Maybe in time we will get together."" When he is so nice in front of others, and looking his best, and seems so tempting. I wrote a list of things that are reasons not to be together, including some of my characteristics I let come out in response to him. To the right of each one I made a continuum with me name on the left, ""both"" in the the middle, and his name on the right. For each thing I marked a spot on the scale indicating if the issues was mine, his, or both. For example, he was losing interest in athletics, but a key part of our relationship was athletics. I marked this as a ""both"" issue as he has every right to be less athletic, I have every right to want an athletic partner, so we share this. Whereas ""He gets hangry"" I marked as his problem because that's something he should control and it's just not OK (in my book). 7. What goes in my next personal ad. Two months out and a lot of writing and therapy later, I think the culmination of all this is moving forward. I've started thinking, based on my past relationships and where my life is going, about what I want next. I'm not thinking about the format - each dating site has their own and this list could just as well be for meeting in person and getting through those first few dates. Also, this is very reflexive of my personality (direct) and a desire at 35 to date efficiently (basically, let's not waste time if we know this is not going to work). It's about defining what you want and don't want, then you can apply this later. Thinking in terms of a personals ad just helps organize thoughts. Here are my sections a). The basics of me and you. What stands out about me that makes me attractive (Ex community bike team leader), what I am am looking for in a relationship (companionship and adventures), and what I want in a guy (athletic). No more than four sentences. You gotta force yourself to distill here. This is your ""elevator pitch."" b). Great stuff about me. c). What i am looking for. Super important to think about past mis-matches and say what you want! For example, my last BF would bitch if I wanted to go on a weekend alone with friends. Now, I do not need to say that, but I will say, ""I'm looking for a partner who is one of my best friends and is my rock, but also is cool with spending a night or two apart a week because we're not each other's entire world."" d). and e). What I do not want AND Disclosures. Look back at 2, 4, and 6. These should be short, but important. What were the undesirable things that consistently showed up in your lovers and your relationships, and what things about you (that are not changing) consistently blew it up with your lovers? You have to work these in. Whether in a personals ad or initial conversations. Some could even be positive or neutral things that just tend to cause issues. Some examples... - What I do not want: monogamy, kids, to stay in five night a week. - Disclosures: I am very close to my family and go home to visit every other month, I'm HIV+, for a gay man I'm a little conservative. This post got much longer than expected, but i want to share what helped me! "

Through time and actions in a process I still cannot describe how it starts or got started, I spend pages debunking this question to myself in a personal, moral and philosophical sense. In the end, I have an answer that disproves the question. Whenever the doubt rises again, I can read back on them. Hell I should make a book out of them. The thing is, this has been empowering to me, it helps against my own dangers of relapsing. I thought maybe this wisdom could be shared, could help others in the same way. The thing is, it's my perspective on the matter and it's also personal to me. Whilst I'm sure people here mean no harm I would like to know if it can be helpful to anyone if I posted or shared it and also would then like to hear the benefits for the recovery of others outweigh my fear of vulnerability for sharing it.

I felt that our communication was totally destroyed, i was putting myself on hold for someone that doesn't put me as their priority and neither one of us were doing little small things in relationships that still make them special. I couldn't take it anymore, we were talking in those days but it felt like we were states apart. I showed up at his apartment and took in how he reacted towards me he barely looked at me. Then b-lined to his room and started packing. I was on auto-pilot, shocked that I was going for it. His room felt empty, like there was no more love in it. I broke up with him, he asked me why. He didn't fight for us he helped me grab my things and pack up my car. The second I got home I felt like I made a huge mistake, crying my eyes out I felt like I broke my own heart. The next day he deleted me off of everything on social media. Everything. All of my pictures are gone. Nothing. 2 years just vanished. Wednesday I tried to talk to him, see if he wanted to talk about things and he didn't text me back. Sunday, I went home early from work because of an anxiety attack I've been dealing with from a breakup. Outside of my apartment step, is the rest of my stuff from his place. I was floored. I still had things of his but I would never leave them outside. I respected him. I hit a point after talking ABOUT him that I wanted to talk TO him. So I marched over there and made him talk to me, I didn't feel good about it afterwards it made me feel like he got the reaction that he wanted. He didn't look at me, his eyes were sad and glassy like he saw something die. He made low blow remarks at me. Didn't call me names. Said he felt like i vanished and I made my mind up when i walked through the door so how could he do anything about it. I expressed to him my vulnerability, me still wanting to be with him but we have to fix on our communication. He told me he was going to call me later that night, i knew he wasn't going to he was saying that to break away. But of course, I went home early from what I was doing and when he didn't call I felt like a fool. Monday, I woke up feeling oddly okay. Accepting that he doesn't want to be with me and talk. My mind felt numb as it was circulating with blame and guilt of hurting him. Feeling like I was deserving of this treatment. I grabbed the things that I had left of his and dropped them off at his house. I told him that I did so and he said thanks. We bought a dog together and I asked him if I can walk her one last time, I wasn't planning on weaseling myself into a conversation. He didn't call me last night, that said enough. I wanted to walk her one last time. He blew up on me. Claimed I was Fucking with his head, that nothing would change if we got back together. I don't know what makes me happy and it's not about him or the dog but about me. I cut people out left and right that I don't know what I want. You can't expect anything from anyone based on their potential to do something. It's based on their repetition and patterns of the reoccurring actions they make over and over again. He can't trust my tendency to act on a whim. He was using personal information against me. Issues that he saw me overcome. I defended myself by saying that he is wrong in someone's potential to look at themselves and see what they need to change for the sake of being better. But after awhile i told him I'm backing off and giving him space. We haven't spoken since Monday. I impulsively broke up with him because I was sad, lonely and angry at him. My impulses are triggered by my emotions. I was sad, lonely and angry because I was bottling up my feelings. I was doing that because we weren't talking. Which comes to communication. I feel so far down, i feel so fucking numb. I betrayed myself, I betrayed him and let him so fucking down. I should have talked to him before I did what I did now I can't go back. I let myself go and lost something that was great for me. Now he won't let me back in. I don't know how I will be able to recover from this."
267,vulnerability,BreakUps,Me (M35) and my girlfriend (F33) of 5 years broke up last night!,1,6a55u0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/6a55u0/me_m35_and_my_girlfriend_f33_of_5_years_broke_up/,2017-05-09 22:44:48,"I've posted on here before in regards to the stresses and conflicts I felt in our relationship, so I won't go over it again. Truth is we loved each other but we realized sometimes love isn't enough. Our jobs tore us a part. Crazy schedules and shitty bosses. There I was thinking it was controllable but now I sit here inconsolable. She knows me and I know her, we just got too comfortable. We didn't grow and our communication really started to break down. It culminated last night into one of those talks that turns to honesty and then reality, real quick. She said it ""I'm unhappy"" and I have been for a while, me just flabbergasted. I didn't know, why didn't she tell me? Why hold it in and let it spill into turmoil? Truth is I should have known, I should have taken a moment from my job and responsibilities just to ask. The problem was every time the question peaked my tongue she was gone, off to work at 4am. I would try to catch a breath and her the next day to find her off to work at 2 pm. We talked about career changes and love making but it just never happened, we became so complacent that we forgot our relationship. The irony of the whole matter is we love to work, just not on us. The pain is fresh, my heart beating flesh upon flesh. I see her honesty and vulnerability. She speaks of a destiny that doesn't include me and I detach. I digress trying to make sense of the mess but it's all so clear, she loves me and I love her. Truth be told;we are not in love, yet I love her completely. I'm in this place where I want to put all my being into changing the decision but if she's unhappy, is the answer division? I've been unhappy too, her schedule as a Pharmacy tech is brutal. 4am shifts leading into 2 pm shifts and every variation thereof without let up. Her boss is a terrible manager by all accounts, ruling the office with fear. It sucked the life out of her, it was and is killing her, it often brought a tear and a beer for me. I hurt for her but couldn't understand why she didn't seek change like we talked about. She persisted and it created distance. Our conversations sometimes so superficial barely enough energy to face reality. I began filling my time with suds and smoking. Struggling to stay up until 11pm for her to return, just hoping. Most days were just a blur of her shadow along the bedroom wall, off to heed the call. Then back home to fall into a slumber, most days we couldn't remember. I had learned to love a little bit of misery, missing her was enough for me. So supportive and loving, I thought the sinking ship was worth saving. She is an amazing woman, unwavering dedication and loyalty. There just isn't enough of her to go around, it breaks my hear to hear the sound. Don't get me wrong I'm broken too, the distance bred jealousy in my heart. ""Who were you texting, detail it from the start..."". I could feel the pull of needing reasons but season led onto season. We spent so much time together, we lived together, a first for both of us. There were days we felt the rush but short lived and often just enough. Breaking up is a process and life is a journey! It's best this way, the answer should be ""Yes"", surely? Why does my heart say one thing then turn around and lie to itself? I'm in disbelief and shock right now, thinking she won't be around. I love her and she loves me too but even the ocean waves can't resist the moon. Am I fighting a two headed beast with no weapons? Truth is I love her still! "

Despite it, I hope you know that I was not lying when I told you that over the 13 year course of silence and life between us, I never stopped thinking about you. I remember the day you messaged me well. I will admit that up to that point, I would occasionally lurk to see what you had been up to. Even Ashley remembered your name when I told her I had been talking to you again. Sometimes I don't remember everything I divulge to my best friend, but her inflections were enough to indicate that whatever I had indeed went beyond ""a friend from high school."" I have lived life enough to know that random messages from the opposite sex don't come without their own intentions. And I was right. And I was surprised. And I was unprepared. And I was afraid. And I was thrilled. Some things defy rationalization. At one point during our bliss we spouted words like ""connection."" It was enough for me. I just wish, more than anything in the world, that it had been for you. I kept trying to pry it from you, but you never wanted to explain why you had put up the ""No Trespassing"" sign on yourself. You just told me to stay away from you. That all you wanted was a physical relationship that would render a mutual good time at best and an individual ego boost at worst. However, it was easy to dismiss when a week later you told me you were falling in love with me. And in your moments of vulnerability, you continued to use the word. It was enough for me. I took these weak moments as those to surpass all others. And I realized that I reciprocated. And perhaps therein lies my foolishness that caused my heartbreak. Don't get me wrong. I was also hesitant at its quickness and your declaration. Before you came to your senses, I was Googling ""Signs You're a Rebound."" But when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags are just flags. And those glasses are hard to take off when you are feeling the literal highfor weeks on endof new love. But just as easily as one word can send you into an ecstatic whirlwind, so too can one destroy you. When your friend suggested that I was ""just a rebound,"" you agreed, admitted it to me immediately, and then our conversations and eventually our connection waned. What hurts is that, since I had no chance to defend myself against the word, to present the suggestion that I was at least worth a shot, it was up to you to. And you didn't. Sometimes life doesn't time itself well. Sometimes you have to take a risk. Sometimes you're not ready. Sometimes bad things happen at the worst time. Sometimes, so do good things. And what hurts is that I was not worth the risk to you. Because you so were to me. But beyond all that, what kills me is that I never had a chance to show myself to you. You got previews: tragically, previews of my small margins. On one end, there was the disgusting timidity that only comes with the perfect combination of excitement and newness and first impressions. My shyness sometimes gave way to awkward grins and giggles in place of conversation, as well as my bizarre eating habits in front of you, like tearing random bits off pizza slices and taking only a handful of bites from the best pad thai in town. (You always brought up your ex, even telling me she prefers the other Vietnamese place halfway through our meal. But I am not her and she is wrong.) On the other end, there were my emotional outbursts that came from your leaving as quickly as you came, from not wanting to give me a chance, from the shock of the feelings of humiliation and of being used and feeling like I was just something to brag about and rub in her face anyway. (I apologize again.) But neither of these are the real me. In the middle and in the majority is the person you supposedly did fall in love with. Someone who thinks you are incredible. Someone who fell in love with your perspective of the world: specifically, of humans and nature and art. Someone who learned so much from you in our brief time together. Someone who adored your sense of adventure and your thirst for knowledge and life. Someone who just wants you to know, I never opened up to someone as quickly and easily. Someone who lost sleep and appetite frequently at the notion of sharing myself, my life, and the fruits of my successes up to this point with you. Someone who dreamt of even more conversations at all hours of the night, of quiet days indulging in our own hobbies next to another, of weekend vacations and lovemaking and me actually eating with gusto in front of you for once. Of learning how you take your coffee. Of watching you paint. Of getting drunk and of fighting and of getting over fights. Someone whose daydreams of such were both lovely and messy. I wanted so badly to, over time, show you both my true loveliness and my true messiness. I am sorry for horrendous timing. I am sorry that I was not enough to trump it. But please know, to me, you always were. I have nothing more to say, other than maybe we just need 13 more years, L"
269,vulnerability,BreakUps,Just broke up with my gf,3,64wowe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/64wowe/just_broke_up_with_my_gf/,2017-04-12 17:18:34,"Honestly felt like posting to TIFU, but it's not really their area's material. Sure felt like I F'd up though. She loves me. I don't mean your puppy, Disney love, but your ""I want to marry you and be yours"" kind of love. She fell super hard for me (as many people told me she would), and we have only been dating for 4 months. She has liked/loved me for about 9-10 months now she claims. I am addicted to porn, dipping tobacco, have a heavy inclination toward selfishness and having my own time, bury my emotions and problems, and struggle to keep a fire of rage hidden away. (To clarify I have never even shouted at a girl, so do not worry about where this is going). Tonight she came by to see me. She has been down about not spending enough time with me (three evenings over the course of three weeks she says, I don't count). She has been depressed about our lack of connection emotionally and how I only flirt through sarcasm. We spend the first thirty minutes doing homework (college, both about to graduate). We then snuggle for a bit, make out, and then she asks things like ""How do you know you love me?"" and ""Why don't you spend more time with me?"" I cannot come up with answers that don't sidestep the truth. She has recently been mentioning that it is okay if I don't think I can do this. All I can do is sit in silence knowing that I want nothing more than my own life at this point in my life. At the same time I know the truth (as I believe it): life is better with others. Eventually I tell her I will have to put some thought into it. She sees right through it and starts weeping. I have no idea what to do. I can only stare in disbelief. Then she buries her face in my chest. I hold her. She tells me how sorry is. She tells me she is sorry for my wife and how she took what was hers (we haven't had sex, but we have been experimenting sexually. We both grew up with a Christian background.) All I can remember saying is that I wish I was in the same place as her, that I WANT what she has for me. I shed one tear. One solitary fucking tear. I haven't showed a single ounce of vulnerable emotion (though I have shared my past) with her. She has consistently desire my vulnerability. She kisses my forehead and leaves. I know she won't sleep tonight. I don't know if I will either. I know the truth. I am selfish. Yea, I can say ""I'm just not ready"", but what am I doing with my life?? I come home to Netflix, CODBO3, and fridge pizza. Why can't I do something real? Mostly rhetorical, these questions. I know what I should do. Don't throw away people. TL;DR broke up with great girl who loves me because I am selfish, left her in pieces and I know how stupid I am. "

He moved across the country for me. When we started dating, it was the first time I ever felt truly loved and appreciated by someone. We broke up a little over a week ago. What happened? Now that I've had some space to reflect, I realize that I wasn't quite the blameless victim of an emotionally unavailable partner I thought I was. I was so preoccupied with what I felt I wasn't getting from him, that I forgot to think about what I was giving him. I was overly critical. The first job he got when he moved to be with me was long hours and he was miserable. He quit very abruptly, and lied about his reasons to his co-workers. I lost some respect for him then, that he had to lie. But he was happier for a while. Then when he was unemployed for a long stretch of time, I lost more respect. I used to admire him, he helped me write the piece which ultimately got me into grad school. But then I felt like I became the smart graduate student, busy working on my own projects throughout the day, striving for my advanced degree, and coming home to my unemployed boyfriend playing video games and not helping out around the house. Instead of telling him I was concerned, I made little jabs at his self esteem. I didn't think about how he must have been feeling about himself at the time, how ineffective he must have felt, how depressed. I should have helped him up instead of kicking him while he was down. I've also been especially bitter and angry because of the political climate, and I would talk (maybe rant is the right word) about it often. He used to love that he thought I was smart, but recently he would just get annoyed and tell me to turn my brain off for once. At the time, I thought maybe it made him feel inadequate, like I had surpassed him when we used to be on more equal footing. Maybe it wasn't my intelligence as much as the vitriol. None of this makes me an enjoyable person to be around, I'm sure. I tried to think back to the times when were truly happy, and we didn't have some nameless cloud looming over us. I think those times were always back in our home state, back when we met, and when we went to visit our families over the holidays. Why? Why can't we be happy in the home we tried to make for ourselves? Over Christmas, we played hide-and-seek in his parents' unnecessarily large, empty house. It was childlike and silly, but I felt closer to him than I did in a long time. I think it was the lack of responsibility, a brief respite from the pressures of adult life, the same as we had in college when we met. I also think it was our social support systems. In our home-state, we both had large groups of friends we could spend time with. It took some of the pressure off of each other. It's hard starting over in a new state, and I have a tendency to depend on my significant other to fulfill my social needs in general. I put too much pressure on him to fulfill the role of my partner and my friend. He only has one other friend besides me here (who I think worked to break us up, to be honest, but that's another issue entirely.) I'm lucky in that quite a few of my friends from home live here now, but I should have encouraged him more to develop a life outside of our relationship. Which I think lends itself to the biggest issue: we're a classic anxious/avoidant pair. We're both insecure, but in opposite ways. I fear rejection, and desperately want someone to see me for who I am and love me for it. He fears intimacy, and is afraid of the vulnerability it comes with. He pulls away, and I try to bridge the gap, the more he pulls away, and the more I feel neglected and try to get closer. We were caught in a toxic cycle. And even though I *know* about attachment styles and knew to watch for when we were slipping into that pattern, once I start to feel neglected any conscious, strategic thought is overridden with an overwhelming desire for reassurance. He's coming to pick up what's left of his stuff today. I'll most likely be out of town, doing what I should have been doing this entire time -- nurturing friendships and support outside of the relationship. I miss him so much it hurts. I feel his absence throughout the apartment very viscerally, everything just seems so empty, and cold, and lonely. All I want is for him to tell me he's sorry, he loves me, he misses me, this is a mistake and we can work it out. He won't though. He's been so cold, so stoic. I haven't felt a hint of emotion from him. To be fair, I lashed out at him very cruelly, so I deserve it. But even though that's what my heart wants, my head knows that we both need time to learn how to be happy with ourselves. "
271,vulnerability,BreakUps,Party Hard - Advice from Andrew WK,40,5xj459,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5xj459/party_hard_advice_from_andrew_wk/,2017-03-05 07:59:00,"""Don't try to stop the pain. You should feel devastated. Your heart should feel shattered. That's how you can tell you were really in love, that you're really alive, and you're really a human being. It's also how you can tell that you really allowed yourself to be truly open and intimate with someone else. Many people can't handle the pain of really loving and caring about someone else, so they avoid intense relationships and the vulnerability that comes with them. You should take pride in the fact that you've been strong enough to be weak. The strongest people have the capacity to really let themselves feel. Sure, it hurts. But it's also how you got to experience all those wonderful feelings too. Don't let the pain trick you into closing your heart to the world and the future. And don't try and forget about her. Odds are you'll remember her for the rest of your life and think about her constantly, even years and years after you've recovered from this initial onslaught of painful emotion. When you're in a relationship with someone for a significant amount of time, they become part of you forever. You've exposed your soul to them, and whether you like it or not, they'll retain their place in the story of your life for the rest of your time here on earth. But you'll find that your memories and thoughts of them won't always be painful. They won't necessarily be enjoyable either. They'll just be thoughts. Like remembering a dream. Don't be afraid of your thoughts or your dreams or your nightmares. You can think about things without always having to feel emotions connected to the thoughts. It's over. Step forward into the next adventure that awaits. Have the courage to make a clean break. If you keep picking at the wound, it won't heal as effectively and will keep re-opening. Be done with this and keep moving. Most of all, stay strong. You will make it through this time. You will be stronger because of it. You will be OK again. In fact, you'll be better than ever. You will meet a woman that's the one. Probably when you least expect it. You will hurt and you will also feel excitement. Your attachment to the past will morph into curiosity about the future. Whatever you do, keep your heart open. Do not let this relationship be the end of your life. Let it be only the end of that time in your life. Now is the only time that matters. Your time with her wasn't wasted. Every moment is precious, even the moments that suck. Your party will continue. In fact, it's only just begun."" -Andrew WK (advice column; 6/11/2014) "
272,vulnerability,BreakUps,It's Still Painful,14,5oyjcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5oyjcv/its_still_painful/,2017-01-20 06:09:06,"We haven't talked since the Sunday after Thanksgiving. Its helped but the pain still comes back in waves sometimes. I miss you so much. I miss that we loved each other. We loved each other so deeply. Every time I think about it all I'm so incredibly saddened by how tragic it all was. We could have been so happy. We could have loved and supported each other in so many ways that we never were. Ways that were never given to us as children or even in adulthood. In a special way that only another hurting person can understand. I wanted to be so much for you. I wanted to be everything and give you everything. I wanted to give you everything you deserved but never got and more. I wanted to bring you happiness and joy and love and healing. And I know you wanted all those same things for me. And that's why it's so tragic. Because there was so much love and so much effort and so much vulnerability. Growth and pain that we'd never shared with anyone else. And not because of ourselves in who we truly are and who we want to be, but because of the damage and scars and wounds that we've sustained from how others have treated us, we won't ever work. That's why it's so tragic. It wasn't our fault. It wasn't because of us. If we didn't have our wounds that prevent us from being who we want to be - the instilled neuroticisms and PTSD-like reactions that are a result of how others have treated us - we could be together. We could provide each other those things we wanted. It's not our fault and I hate the universe for that. It's just heartbreaking. And even though I know I wouldn't want to be with you again because I know that our wounds clash and result in stress and pain, I still grieve for the loss of our love and the loss of you. I still miss our love and I miss you. The grief is like a steak piercing me in the middle of my chest and I just wish things could have been different. I frequently think about contacting you again. The longer I don't, the harder it is to not give in. At first it was just that I needed some space and you wanted it too. I was going to contact you to check in around Christmas. But I saw a photo you took and you seemed happy. I'm terrified of ruining that happiness for you by reminding you of my existence. I'm scared that I will only cause more pain. The thing that's the most effective in making this easier is the thought that you are happy, and hopefully happier, without me. Because that's all I want for you: to be happy and to be loved. You deserve those things. I may not love you romantically anymore, but I love you. I love you so much and want the best things imaginable for you. I'm so sorry for the pain we've been through together. I'm sorry I couldn't be the person you needed and I'm sorry my wounds required more than you're able to give. I hope someday the grief won't be so sharp that we can't see each other again and hug each other tightly. "

I have come to the full realization that there is no more room for excuses, or time needed apart for things between us to work out. It IS for the best, to diminish all hope that we will ever be together again, through thick and thin. 2.5 years of a relationship isn't too long comparing to a lifetime of regret - a regret of ""why didn't I end it sooner?"" I do regret that I let you back in my life a month ago. Or not, this time could be easier because my expectation was never high, perhaps in this time I can assure to myself that I had given us a try and it just doesn't work. I can't no longer relate to love songs written for heartbroken people who long for their love ones to come back. I've realized that there is nothing more I could have done to change the outcome. All the urge for you to return has gone to nothingness. I just want it to be gone now, so for once I can sleep in peace, spend my weekends doing things I love, instead of pounding IPAs alone and wiping off eyes full of tears. I remember being alone before I met you, I was content with life. Sure I was lonely, but I was never this lonely after this heartbreak. But then, I realize that someday I will meet someone who looks at me as a be-all and not as an option. Someone who accepts and cherish our differences. Someone who understands my vulnerability. And by then you will become a part of my history, I will look at this past and see it as a valuable life lesson. There is only so much left to be said but at the same time I can't yet put myself to hit that ""block"" button on my phone, even though it's something that can be easily undone. It is a test to myself, did I realize enough of evidence that there is no coming back to where we were, or do I need this virtual ""block"" feature to reinforce myself to stop communication with you? I am thinking out aloud. But I do realize it now, this is the end of us. Sun will rise tomorrow and I will be okay. "

I met up with a good friend and I was able to tell her what happened between us without being angry at you or the situation. Work wasn't busy and I had plenty of time to think about you, but I was able to spend a lot of time looking at funny memes and cute dog pictures. Although, there were many times when I thought: ""Oh this is a good meme to share with you, because this is so you/us."" out of a habit, it was only seconds after I realized that I can't do that anymore. I noticed that I don't feel that overwhelming sadness anymore, though. Two days ago I told you that I can't talk to you anymore if you can't decide whether if you can be with me or not. I just don't want to be strung along any longer, pretend things are fine as the way it was. I need to protect myself. You said you understand, and you will think about it. I haven't heard from you since, but I have a feeling that I know what your answer is. You might never give me an answer, or you might tell me that you've spent a long time thinking about it but you just can't be in a relationship with me. That is okay. I think I have passed the point where I am seeking for answers. I know it wasn't anyone's fault, shit happens. I still feel a little sad though. I haven't put away all the gifts you gave me. Maybe I will do that one day, for now, it is okay, they don't bother me much. I went to kickboxing class after work, it's the second time this week, and I plan to go for the third time as my trainer recommended 3 times a week. I joined the club two months ago, not long after our breakup. At the time, every self-help article advises exercise as a coping mechanism, me as a habitual problem-solver decided to give it a try, it turned out to be more than effective, it is super therapeutic. (*side note: for my broken hearted people who want to cope with a breakup, exercise is highly effective, I would definitely recommend you join a fitness club where you are forced to exercise with other people in a group setting, it will also make you feel better if you're surrounded by people). I watched a video about vulnerability and now I'm learning to embrace it in order to become someone who knows her worthiness. I'm learning to become a happier self, and this time I am doing it for myself. So today, I think I did pretty good."

It's been 6 days. I cant work, or speak or move for long before I remember something of you. I cant stop swinging between the immutable feeling that we are done, that there is nothing I could of done nor could ever do to have stopped you from leaving me and the feeling that I love you so much that I want you to burst through my office door and make love to me on the table and to tell me that we are worth the fear and the risk of hurt. The realisation that you were fearful-avoidant, that me telling you I loved you triggered so much fear and confusion in you that you had to push me away by trying to leave me, by cheating, by breaking promises. The realisation that even when you saw how much I loved you and that I was willing to work past that if you could work on your addictions, your avoidance of your own experience that you were not ready to do. Not ready for yourself and you would never have done that for me. Knowing you truly loved me, and that was never going to be enough. Knowing that both of us on our independent journeys to happiness and stability were too out of sync, that you need years and years of therapy to overcome your fear of intimacy and vulnerability, and I still have to work on my fear that my partner will never love me enough. I am much further down the road than you, but as far as Ive progressed is almost as far as you would need to come for us to ever have had a chance. I no longer neatly fit into the anxious-preoccupied category - so many of my behaviours and attitudes follow the pattern of secure attachment, and I saw that help you. I saw that shine in you. But you betrayed me, and that drove out those old patterns of anxious-preoccupation and you were never equipped to overcome the shame you infested our relationship with. I truly love who you are, I love your body, your face, your curious, sensitive mind. I love how subtly empathetic you are, and I loved that you did tune into me in a way I never experienced before. I know I did the same for you. I loved feeling your body melt into mine, I loved feeling your pleasure and rolling in that which you gave me. I loved the times you could love me, you could show your inner child knowingly or otherwise. I loved the little boy, lost and isolated and frightened. I wanted nothing more than to see him smile. I loved holding you as you cried, not because the tears were my aim, but the expression of your most heartfelt feelings were a blessing to you and a privilege to me. I wish you could have been less fearful, just enough to let me in consistently without major avoidance. I wish I could have stopped myself from being threatening and shaming when I got fearful. I wish you could have stayed and kept your promise to be in this, to love me unreservedly. I wish you hadnt left me, devastated and heartbroken. I wish you didnt hate yourself so much that you medicate with anything you can, from drugs to drink, to sex to gambling. I wish you werent so lonely and depressed. I wish I wasnt so lonely and depressed. But I am not half as lonely as I was, I have so many friends and people around me who have helped me and nurtured me. I need to nurture myself. I dont want to lose you, but I already have. I simultaneously want every good moment we had, and I want to let go and accept that this is done, because it is. You are everything I want, and you werent healed enough. Neither was I, though so much farther along than you. Why did the first person I ever love, want to marry, to share my forever with have to be so broken? "
276,vulnerability,BreakUps,"Long distance, incompatibilities of life views, disrespected, yet why does it still bother me?",3,5cg2db,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/5cg2db/long_distance_incompatibilities_of_life_views/,2016-11-12 05:34:45,"It's been a week since I was dumped. This might get long, but I want to use it as a place for reflection and making some hard observations. It can be tough to see your ex for the *real* person they are following a breakup. &amp;nbsp; We were close in some capacity for nearly 9 years - I asked her out as a teenager when I first met her only to be rebuffed. She came in and out of my life as a friend. Sometimes she needed a shoulder to cry on as her family life caused her pain, sometimes she just wanted a partner to ski or hike with. &amp;nbsp; She's moved back and forth from our hometown, and I told myself that I didn't want to get involved again. Her last serious relationship ended in 2013 with a crazy and abusive man I'd had the unfortunate experience of knowing. &amp;nbsp; We became close again near the start of 2015. I'd done a massive amount of growing up - I've been less insecure, more sure of what I want from my life, and more sure of my views of people. I've secured an extremely desirable job for those in my field after busting my ass for years in school. I'm in pretty good shape, not bad looking, and now I'm making well over 6 figures as a 27 year old. &amp;nbsp; She asked me out in the Summer of 2015. She no longer lived in our small city, but about a 4-5 hour trip across the state. I was originally hesitant - starting something as a LDR with an old flame? I could feel old attractions and emotions deep down, and decided to give it a try after much rumination. However, (and this is where the crux of our breakup occurred, I think) she soon revealed her different views on the dynamics of a relationship. More on that in a moment. &amp;nbsp; In the time we started seeing one another, she began identifying with greater interest as a feminist. I found her ability to voice her opinion in an intelligent manner attractive. However, as time wore on she began falling in with different friends who had much more 'aggressive' views of feminism (ie. I'm going to do what I want, if I hurt you it's not my fault.). I'd witnessed these friends act with degrees of carelessness in their own relationships and it set off some alarms in my mind. At this time one of her closest friends divorced her husband for reasons of incompatibility (Married very young, she wished she had dated other people before settling down). The whole vibe in her new circle of friends started to change, and her attentiveness to me cycled from wanting to talk all day and tell me sweet nothings about what a fantastic partner I was, to somewhat distant and unresponsive. &amp;nbsp; Back to her opinions of relationships. Before we'd started dating she had made one or two comments about the absurdity of traditional marriages and how they don't work. Even then it didn't feel good to hear, but I wrote it off. As things shaped up between us - she dropped a bit of a bomb on me during a late night walk together. Her friends whom I'd known and liked were in a non-traditional 'monogamish' relationship. Now her views on open relationships were evident, and I became internally quite upset. This is where I made my first mistake - I began to suppress my physical desires with her almost subconsciously - ""Is she going to not want a traditional relationship with me? How can I give myself completely to a partner who might hurt me"". Sex is extremely important to me, not just because I'm a man - but because of the complete surrender, vulnerability, and intimacy shared between partners. The thought of 'sharing' someone, not being sure where they were or what they were doing was torturous - and she hadn't even asked me for an open relationship. That would come. &amp;nbsp; We finally had the talk one night she came to visit me. She wanted me 'on lock' and asked me to be together officially, she wanted to be in a relationship with me and I was ecstatic. The next morning, while still in bed she asked me ""What are your thoughts on monogamy"" and I was GUTTED. My fears had come to fruition. I told her I could respect how it worked for some people - but it would never work for me as I desire stability and making (and being made) a priority of my partner. She seemed to accept my answer, smiled and kissed me. I thought it was over - but I was still worried. I found it so hard to give her attention with these thoughts in my head. The seeds were planted, and it became harder for me to simply surrender myself to her. It stressed me out when we had to part ways and I couldn't see or be with her. I trusted her, but I felt powerless. &amp;nbsp; Weeks later, after her being distant to me in text messages all day, she confronted me about being hurt by my distance. How she felt stuck without me there for her. How important sex is to her and if we only saw each other once every 10-15 days - she wasn't happy. I was hurt and defended myself. Eventually she calmed down and said ""I don't want to share you"" and that I was her man. She agreed we were making the choice to be together and that the future was bright. &amp;nbsp; Two weeks ago we spent an awesome few nights together at my place. We were close. I gave in and told her how great she made me feel, how much I cared for her, how much I wanted to show this love. I apologized for my behaviour. The elation carried in to the following days, but abruptly ended when she burst in to tears as I got to her apartment. She'd been unbelievably stressed from family, work, school for months - and it seemed to finally have taken its toll. She wouldn't tell me what was wrong, she said should couldn't explain it. I asked if it was me, and she said no. Eventually she calmed down, but she asked me to stop asking if she wanted to talk about it. &amp;nbsp; I returned home. Our phone calls and contact were still going on all day every day. She said she missed me. That I was her guy. Things weren't perfect between us - but she was crazy about me.. &amp;nbsp; Then one morning after a standoffish text, she just stopped talking to me. Almost 9 years of friendship. We've spoken at length every single day for nearly two years. In the first 24 hours of radio silence I knew something was very, very wrong. The silence stretched to nearly 4 days. I was beside myself with worry. Then it came - I was sitting in a large seminar of about 150 people for a presentation when my phone buzzed. She broke up with me by text. &amp;nbsp; ""I care about you very deeply, but I don't think I can make this work - my life is shaken and I can't give anything to anyone right now"". &amp;nbsp; I broke down and excused myself. The next 3 days are a blur of no sleep, furious anger and absolute sorrow. Her text was cowardly. It provided no information to me, it was cold. I have no idea what she means by being shaken. I'm insulted she never disclosed this turmoil. &amp;nbsp; I now can see how unhealthy many aspects of our relationship were. She clearly has some major issues. She seems to just check out emotionally when the going gets tough. Her views were not compatible with mine - no matter what she said. &amp;nbsp; I'm sad to say that I still want her. I still think about her and feel at fault. I want her to rue the day she dumped me - as shallow as that is to say. I've completely cut her out. I've deleted photos, texts, contact information and removed her from social media. &amp;nbsp; I'm picking up the pieces and not sure where to go. I didn't just lose a relationship, I lost a friend.. &amp;nbsp; This got really long.. but it was somewhat cathartic to write. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. "
277,vulnerability,BreakUps,"I'd normally talk to that person, but I left them, and now I don't know what to do.",10,55lu88,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/55lu88/id_normally_talk_to_that_person_but_i_left_them/,2016-10-03 14:20:40,"You guys know how it is, right? The one person you always turned to to talk out difficult things, things which were hurting you or bugging you or just plain pissing you off, who was always there with (usually) a joke and a cold beer, or a hug, or a tissue when things were really bad. You always felt better, talking to them, because you knew that they at least cared and were committed to listening and helping you feel better. And just the act of opening up to them helped, because it brought you a bit closer together, that shared experience of getting through something emotionally difficult and coming out the other side with a bit more understanding of how the other person worked. That willing vulnerability, exposed with the trust that they would do the right thing and would, most importantly, just be there to witness and listen to your pain even if they couldn't immediately assuage it. Except that now that very same reliance and trust has been turned inside out. It's no one's *fault*, really, even in the best of times. Relationships end, and everyone understands this, and both people do their best to move on amicably. No one cheated. There was no shouting, not that many tears, just a sad understanding that your lives are no longer going the same way. These things happen. You still love each other. They've still got some of your things which you packed in a box and gave them money to ship to you. The last day you were in the same city, they helped you carry things (all of your things, your whole life, because you still trusted them with your whole life) to the train station and held you as you cried and felt guilty and angry and sad, again, and told you they loved you, still, and would always love you, and it was okay, they understood, and don't cry, they'd be okay. You knew they wouldn't, you're not an *idiot*, but what could you do? You felt awful. You feel awful, for hurting them. You almost felt angry that they didn't do anything to deserve it, to make it easier to hurt them. But they'd never do that. They always deserved your trust, even at the end. Even after the end. They kissed your forehead and told you to get on the train, and walked the other way so that you wouldn't have to watch them go down the stairs and off the platform. You looked anyway, and didn't see them, and then wiped your tears away and got a book out and started the long process of trying to shove your pain angrily away because you caused this, and you did this, and this is your single bed now. Now it's three weeks later and you're an ocean away. You're moving on in all the ways that people say you're supposed to. You've got a new job and are making new friends and have gone to the gym and gone shopping and reconnected with old friends. You've been in touch with your ex but have kept it cordial and polite and how-are-you. You feel like you've wallpapered over a gaping hole and are starting to hang pictures on it. You sometimes wonder if other people can see it, too. Sometimes you wonder if you're an awful person for not being more of a mess. After all, it was six years together and they're still the same wonderful person, and they're hurting because of you, and you care, you do, but somehow you go about daily life as if you're totally fine. Does that make you fine? Does that make you a bad person? You're not sure, but what you do know is that you've opened and closed the Messenger tab upwards of 15 times today, you counted, but you didn't once send anything. Is that progress? It doesn't feel good, but it's something you're trying because everyone else says you should. * I don't know. That's just how I am today, and I don't know what to do. I've never done this before. I don't even have the refuge of being mad at them, because they did nothing wrong, and our relationship was good until the end. External factors and let's say geographic incompatibility drove us apart, but we still love each other even if we can't be together, and I don't know what to do."
278,cybersecurity,BreakUps,I (24F) lost both my best friend (24M) and boyfriend (22M) today and I can't cope,1,fvrbxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/fvrbxw/i_24f_lost_both_my_best_friend_24m_and_boyfriend/,2020-04-06 13:27:35,"This is a long post. A year ago, I went on [r/r4r](URL and posted that it had been a month since my break-up and that I was still struggling with obsessive thoughts, nostalgia, and fixation on the past and wanted someone to distract me and keep my mind off things. I added that being into movies would be a plus because thats a passion of mine. As a female redditor, I received dozens of messages: some genuine, others spam. After filtering through them, I ended up chatting with 5 strangers. For the following two months, April and May 2019, I continued to chat with these 5 strangers. Most of my conversations with them were sexual in nature with some discussions about movies. This is when I met my boyfriend. Elliot was my favorite stranger among the five. A final year Engineering student in West Virginia, Elliot had impeccable taste in movies (almost identical to mine) and a great sense of humor and compassion. We clicked instantly. By the end of May, we were full on fuck buddies  yes only virtually but it was very intense. He was fully aware that I was sexting others but it was all casual. Over time, our attachment grew beyond sex and we started developing feelings for each other. In June, I stopped sexting the other strangers and Elliot and I acknowledged the fact that we were romantic partners in a relationship. By July, we became strictly exclusive and ever since then weve been celebrating monthly anniversaries, which I know is very corny but I love celebrating with him, going on movie dates and gifting each other handmade stuff. It was special and we were completely in sync. I even told him that of all my partners, he makes me the happiest. My relationship with Elliot is not, however, without its imperfections. On day one when we first chatted, I disclosed my real name in exchange for his list of top 10 films. He had already shared his name but said hed never show his face. An understandable attitude since we had just met. After committing to each other, we continued sexting and chatting every day just like normal partners do, unfazed by the 7-hour difference between us. As a very open person, I share photos of my face and my entire body during these sexting sessions as well as throughout the day. We use Snapchat as our main platform, sending photos of our meals, clothes, and of course our bodies. From time to time, I ask about his face but he never shows it to me. He explained that back in high school his nudes were leaked and ever since then he became paranoid about cybersecurity, so he abstains from ever showing his face. Selfies sent from his side are always from the neck down. Even during our video chats on Skype, his camera is always positioned in a way so as not to reveal his face. But I completely understand and accept that and Im happy with the time and love we share. After all, the internet isnt a safe space and I dont want to trigger his paranoia in any way. I love him and I want our relationship to be a safe space. As the months went by, Elliot graduated and got a job and we celebrated one anniversary after another, always treasuring the special bond that we have. As corny as it may sound, we do sometimes finish each others sentences and at others can even utter what the other person is thinking. Yes, really. Its equally heart-warming and freaky. We enjoy bedside chats almost every night. We binge watch shows and go on movie marathons. It is a successful and smooth long distance relationship. Every other month we always reevaluate our relationship asking the other person if theres anything we need to work on or improve. It is a healthy and loving place. I love him. And he does too. Balancing this entire relationship while trying to maintain my friendship with my best friend, M, is definitely challenging. Not only do I always have to make decisions with regards to who I should watch movies with, but sometimes I can afford to spend emotional energy and time in one place only: I usually pick Elliot. I know this hurts M a lot because he has unreciprocated feelings for me. M and I fight a lot. Mostly about my lying patterns. I lie a lot to him because sometimes I can't stand to endure the fights or I don't want to be talking to him so I lie about going to sleep or being busy, etc. Elliot never fights, he always talks through anything we face calmly, patiently. Whereas M ends up nagging and cursing. Not to mention, when Im conversing with both, its a hassle switching apps on my phone between Elliot on Snapchat and M on Telegram. In a few days, Elliot and I will be celebrating our nine month anniversary. Nine terrific months. .\~. Rewind to yesterday. Im working on my laptop while texting both M and Elliot. I glance at the TV and theres a Dwayne Johnson movie playing so I text M: I hate his movies so much. Then I get a notification from Elliot on Snapchat so I switch to his chat and I read his text: Yeah those movies are trash. My heart starts beating so hard and loud, I feel its going to burst out of my chest. I couldnt believe my eyes and thought my phone was glitching so I restarted the applications and when I checked Elliots chat again, he had deleted his texts. I confronted and asked what were those deleted texts about and he said nothing. I told him thats not what I read. A heavy pause that lasted 10 seconds settled over me then I texted: Yeah. Then dropped my phone and ran to my bedroom and cried for an hour nonstop. It was M all along. That realization kept echoing in my mind over and over and I couldnt stop crying over everything. When I picked up my phone again, I found message and calls from M. I took a deep breath and immediately compartmentalized the situation. I responded to M while staying calm. He asked me over and over if I hated him, if I was angry, if I wanted to yell at him. I didnt. I rarely feel anger and I didnt feel it then. I felt sad, deeply sad and betrayed. But I kept my calm and continued our chat, listening to him explain himself. He said before I decide anything, hell write out his thoughts and asked me to wait until then, until Ive listened to everything he had to say. I said okay. I didnt mind giving him the time and space to do that. I continued my work. I had dinner and deleted my Snapchat account instantly to which he reacted: Please wait. Im not ready for that yet. But I deleted it anyways. I wont recount the entirety of what he sent but Ill summarize it as objectively as I can. * Because our friendship was at a bad place and he felt he was going to lose me, he started worrying. He stumbled on my reddit post and messaged me without knowing 100% it was me, although he did guess it was. All he wanted was to be there for me and comfort me, since I was locking him out as M. * He never intended for it to go this far and didnt think it would. Then when I said I loved him after a couple of months, his emotions got involved and it became very hard for him to tell me the truth. He always wanted to tell me but delayed it over and over. * He felt horrible for lying, for hiding everything. But our attachment grew, it was great being in love and caring for each other. This is what he wanted our relationship to be. Being on the same wavelength on so many levels, sharing physical and emotional intimacy, and enjoying our shared time together felt great. * Then he decided he would tell me when we eventually met. He feels horrible and admits its a horrific thing he did to hurt the one person he cares about the most. However he doesnt, and I quote, fully regret it. He says: It did give me the chance to love you how I would. And to feel what your love feels like. Which wouldnt have been possible before. * He said he would respect whatever I choose: to leave or not. He understands. I read his statement, we continued our rewatch of The Office  which Elliot and I started the night before  then he went to sleep. I stayed up till 9 AM, crying, going over everything, deleting all our messages on every platform as far back as I could. The next morning I felt like shit, so did he. My mind keeps swinging between sadness, disgust, betrayal, love, and helplessness. Suddenly being stripped of two people I deeply care for. Suddenly realizing everything was a lie. A whole year of lies, spun over and over. I decided I couldnt be chill about it anymore. I opened his statement and started adding comments on the side. I was going to send him my feedback, accept that as closure, then end it. I was done. I was upset and I let it out. Some of the comments I sent him: * I can't even begin to describe how violated I feel. How could you possibly respect yourself knowing you were sexting me as Elliot? For months and months, you had access to my body without my knowledge. No anxiety, panic, fear, and definitely not fucking ""love"", can drive or justify such behavior. I'm so ashamed and sad after everything that happened. * Looking back on all our fights about my lies, I should've known better. I should've realized that your certainty whenever you detected my lies was not in fact ""instinct"" or "" you knowing me so well."" I should've trusted my gut when I noticed you two had the same phone, you held it the same way, your bodies looked similar, you even shared a similar tone of voice, but I chose to let go of my paranoia and trust the feeling that my best fucking friend - no matter how bad our relationship was - could not possibly create another identity to trick me and use me like that. I was so fucking wrong. * You choosing to lie and deceive me doomed this entire relationship from the beginning. Whether I find out because you made a texting mistake or when we met does not matter, you lose the relationship in both cases. Out of all people, you - who preach about honesty and the grave consequences of lying - know that lies never end well. * Looking back on last week's conversation where we agreed to start a new friendship where honesty is the priority: you could've told me then. You could've told me during the countless times I asked you to share a secret when we cuddled in bed every night. You could've told me when I said I loved you. But you didn't. I found out because of a fucking glitch. * I'm not angry. Worse, I feel so sad that my love was wasted on you. You knew me. You knew how hard it was to leave my ex, to recover, to find someone I truly trusted, to start over, to love again. You knew all this and chose to use it for your self interest. I feel so betrayed and ashamed. You've drained me of everything: my time, my energy, my trust, my love. It's over. I also said Fuck you many times. After I sent him my comments, he went on to further explain himself some more. I understood his explanation. Then decided we need to stop talking and interacting. I asked to stop all communication until May 1st. We needed time to process and recover, if possible. It sucks that I lost both my best friend and my partner in one single day. My process so far has been a mix of grief and acceptance. Rationalizing the situation as much as I can. Maybe this is karma for everything I did to M in the past, lying and ignoring him and treating him badly, everything I did to my ex, cheating more than once then breaking his heart. Maybe it was a wake up call from the universe/God  maybe this is necessary for me to finally get my shit together and stop texting strangers. On the other hand, I put myself in Ms shoes and even though I am in no way justifying his actions, I understand the cause-and-effect chain of events that led to this moment and despite the mess and betrayal: we both love each other. Does that matter at all? Was it even real love if it was based on lies and half-truths? I dont know. But I miss them already. \*\*TL;DR;\*\* - I found out my best friend's been posing as my online boyfriend for a year and I'm heart broken. I don't know how to process or move on."
279,cybersecurity,BreakUps,Not sure if this qualifies for this group but I can't seem to post it anywhere else. AITA story about me and my former bestfriend,1,ew5mo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ew5mo0/not_sure_if_this_qualifies_for_this_group_but_i/,2020-01-31 00:43:08,"So a little background, I'm a 28 year old man and my former friend was a dude the same age. We grew up in Orange County, CA and started hanging out a little in middle school but became bros after we graduated high school and were trying to get our lives together. Years passed, I bounced around until I ended up moving to Idaho, he ended up living in a crowded three bedroom condo with four other people and three dogs close to my hometown. During my journey out of CA, I would pop in occasionally to go hang out at his place. There was a brief period we he seemed to be making progress as far as making moves toward a career and moving out of his gf's dad's house to move in with the three other friends and dogs in the condo. He was even engaged to his gf and I was his pick to be the best man. But then things took a turn for the worst when he hurt his back (again) and ended up on disability. Around the same time (chronology is a little fuzzy) his gf had been kicked out of the condo by the other friends for supposedly not pulling her weight and had to go stay with her mom. About a year later, gf gets kicked out of her mom's place and asks if she can stay with me. Looking back on it, I probably should've just said no but I was her bf's best friend and the chosen best man so I figured I had to do something to help their relationship. So she gets to my place and I tell my bestfriend about it and he actually got mad at her for not telling him that was she was coming up. About a month or so in, she tells me he was cheating on her with one of the roommates gf's(who was also one of the roommates). That out right pissed me off especially because I'd tried to talk to him multiple times about what he was going to do with their future, but he did little more than give me false promises that he was figuring something out. Six months later she left my place to live with a friend of hers back in Cali and at some point told my former bestfriend that she had told me about the affair he'd been having (She'd broken off the engagement at this point). I felt a bit awkward the next month or so, trying to figure out my next move. Then I hit him up on FB messanger, asking typical friend shit, neither one of us wanting to discuss the massive elephant in the room. A day or so after that, I decided to just come right out and end it, telling him that he needed to get his life together (He'd been on disability the whole time, grossly overweight years before his back injuries and had a degree in cybersecurity but wasn't even trying to pursue anything in the field) and telling him I wasn't his bestfriend anymore. TL:DR- Me and my former bestfriend were bros for years. Gets engaged and makes me best man. Injures his back and his fiance ends up having to live with me for a while. Fiance informs me he'd been cheating on her with roommates gf. Once she leaves and tells my former best friend I know about the affair, I decide to call him out on his bullshit and tell him he's not my bestfriend anymore. So, ladies and gentlebots of reddit, I pose this question to you. AITA?"
