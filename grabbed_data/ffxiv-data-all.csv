0,vulnerability,ffxiv,Summoner Change/Rework Suggestions,1,i6nfkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/i6nfkz/summoner_changerework_suggestions/,2020-08-10 03:39:35,"**Warning: This is going to be a long post, skip to the \*\*\*TL;DR\*\*\* if you don't care to read all of the explanation of my suggestions. Be sure to let me know what you want for the job as well.** With every expansion that passes, Summoner continues to get more and more isolated ability sequences that create, in my opinion, an unintuitive design. I know everybody has their own ideas of what to do with ""their"" job, so I want to see what everybody thinks about the job and what it needs or should get in the future. I'd also like to share a few of my own suggestions to streamline the class and make it more uniform in design. As a former frost mage and warlock in WoW, and a fan of the Summoner job in other Final Fantasy titles, I love the idea of the Summoner being the ""pet"" class, and unlike many others, I do not want to see this concept go away. However, I would like to see the Summoner move into a more phase oriented rotation, with the Egi Assault and Enkindle abilities becoming tied to a rotating ""Trance"" cycle and constant cycling of Egi. This lets Summoner stay mostly the same for story purposes, but opens up the gameplay for further enhancement. However, I'm well aware of the issues with pets and AI in general in FFXIV, and for that reason I'd like to see the Egi Assault and Enkindle abilities turn into instant abilities used by the player instead of the Egi itself, but only during this ""Trance"" phase upon summoning an Egi. For example, at the beginning of an encounter, I summon Ifrit-Egi, which gives an ""Inferno Trance"" buff, allowing my character to use Crimson Cyclone and Flaming Crush (a single target and an AoE, both are now instant abilities instead of spells and have 2 charges), as well as a utility ability (burn DoT for Ifrit, shield for Titan, and magic vulnerability for Garuda), or use Inferno to end the ""Inferno Trance"", similar to Deathflare ending Dreadwyrm Trance, but this would have a long cooldown and couldn't be used for every Egi phase. Then, I would rotate into Titan-Egi or Garuda-Egi and enter their respective ""Trances"" and use their abilities. Outside of these abilities and the new ""Trances"", pets can still remain as permanent summons and continue to use their normal attacks, and possibly add a new heavier attack they'll randomly use. A further change I'd like to see is the change of Demi-Bahamut into an immediate summon with Dreadwyrm Trance, just like Demi-Phoenix is with Firebird Trance. This would remove what I think is a redundant summon Bahamut button with Dreadwyrm Trance only needing to be used once now. As for future abilities, I'd still like to see the other 3 elemental Egis implemented, and with this new format, they'd work well and have a place in the new cycle. Perhaps to encourage rotating between all of the Egis, a new job gauge could be added similar to the new Astrologian cards, where you accumulate Primal energy upon a Trance ending, and depending on how many different ones you have, you deal more damage with Teraflare, a new ultimate attack replacing Deathflare that can only be used with 6 Primal energy and does more damage the more unique energies you have. So your goal is to rotate between all 6 Egi and then execute a super-powered Teraflare during your Bahamut phase. **\*\*\*TL;DR\*\*\***: With this new system, the goal would be to cycle through all 6 Egi, each with a 10 second Trance window to use their abilities and collect their Primal energy upon the Trance ending, then using Dreadwyrm Trance and summoning Demi-Bahamut would be more of a burn phase, changing Ruin III and Outbreak into stronger Bahamut themed versions, like Phoenix does, and costing significant MP and health to cast, ending with Teraflare which scales depending on accumulated Primal energy, then transition into Firebird Trance with Phoenix restoring health as he does now but also restoring MP, being the rebirth phase after the absolute destruction phase. In total, this would still be a long cycle as it is now, with 60 seconds to accumulate all 6 energy and 40 seconds for both Dreadwyrm Trance and Firebird Trance, making it a 1:40 cycle, so it could in theory be done multiple times per boss fight or major story boss. I know you other Summoner mains and players will have your own ideas for the job, and I'd like to see what others want. I know many want the pets gone, but I think it's what makes Summoner unique, and I think they can be kept around while still streamlining the job. Let me know what you think of my suggestions and comment your own."

2,vulnerability,ffxiv,Complete Alexander Savage Unsync Guide,1,i92tpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/i92tpq/complete_alexander_savage_unsync_guide/,2020-08-14 02:14:37,"I recently farmed all of the Alexander Savage Raids for Glam clothes and thought this would be helpful for others interested in Glams, Mounts or Minions! Hope it helps :D &amp;#x200B; **All of the guides were made with a Light Party of Level 80 in mind if not stated otherwise!** **Strategies and Mechanics are ignored as much as needed to focus on fast completion of duty.** **Everything is just my experience and described in the easiest way I could think of so everyone can have a try at these Raids.** **All corrections, be it for strategies or language are very welcome, Im sorry if this might not help every Party.** &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Fist of the Father (Savage) A1S General Strategy: Kill both Bosses around the same time, even minding that can be ignored if DPS is good. Tank: Tank both Bosses. Healer: Nearly no Healing needed, help with DPS. DPS: Kill Bosses around the same time. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Cuff of the Father (Savage) A2S General Strategy: Kill all the enemies, nothing more to it. Tank: Tank all Enemies close to each other for AoE skills. Healer: Some Group and Tank Healing needed, help with AoE Spells outside of it. DPS: Use AoE to kill enemy groups, ignore the Gobwalkers. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Arm of the Father (Savage) A3S General Strategy: Kill the Boss, possibly Adds and dont stand in Puddles or the edge of the arena. To avoid AoE overlap dont all stand together if you have a big Party. Tank: Tank Boss in the middle and facing away from group. Healer: Little Healing needed, help with DPS. DPS: DPS down everything you see. Add Phase can be skipped with enough Damage, or ignored if the Boss is almost dead. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Burden of the Father (Savage) A4S !!This is where the first mount drops, its the little Gear you get to roll for and is a guaranteed drop!! General Strategy: \-Kill each leg one after the other and the middle Boss in between/after the legs are down. \-Adds can be skipped with enough DPS. If they spawn you can either let the outer small ones run into the big middle one and explode them, thus permanently removing them from the map, which needs some shielding from the Healer or Tank and fast Healing. This is in my opinion preferable to letting them live and respawn constantly as they still need to be killed regularly because they give Debuffs that can wipe the Party. \-During the second leg two Party Members will be quarantined which as always can be skipped with enough DPS. The quarantined just have to kill the Add they are thrown to and they will be right back. \-During the fourth leg two people will be Debuffed from the attack Judgment Nisi, mostly the Healer and a DPS, one with a Blue and one with a Red Debuff. If those two meet there is a big boom and all close will die. These Debuffs go away on their own, just make sure the Party doesnt stand together and wait until they are gone before running around. \-When killing the middle Boss after all the legs are down eventually some fun looking electronics will spawn in the middle. Those will explode after some time, wiping the Party, ignore them and bring the Boss down before they get to do that. Tank: Decide which leg to kill first and lead the Party. Ignore mechanics where you move away from your current target like orbs and tethers, nothing can Damage the Party in a way that is substantial, instead keep dealing Damage. Healer: Some Group and Tank Healing needed, help with DPS when you can. Stand in the middle with some distance to your fellow group members for when the Judgment Nisi Debuffs come into play. If you decide to explode the Adds use a group Heal when they spawn so they will run to you in the middle, get ready to Heal and shield through the Damage from this. DPS: Just focus on DPS whatever part of the Boss the Tank indicates, Damaging other legs isnt useful as they will have full health again after one is defeated. At the end of the fight you might have to hurry to kill the Boss before the Adds explode. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Fist of the Son (Savage) A5S General Strategy: Kill Boss and Adds, all strategy can be ignored. Tank: Tank the Boss and the Adds. Healer: There will be Damage on the Tank and Group, depending on how fast the Boss goes down there might be Vulnerability Debuffs that need to be minded. DPS: Focus on the Boss and burn him down as quickly as possible. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Cuff of the Son (Savage) A6S General Strategy: -First Boss: Just burn down and avoid AoEs as necessary. \-Second Boss: Most time consuming Boss since he has an invulnerability Phase that cant be skipped as far as Im aware. During it you need to kill orbs with life bars and run into those without. Dont sweat missing a few, the Damage isnt deadly. \-Third Boss: Burn down, only mechanic to mind is the different floor heights. When you have a Purple Debuff stand on the low ground, when you have a Red Debuff stand on the higher ground. \-Fourth Boss: Just burn down and dont stack those AoEs and puddles. Tank: Tank each Boss as needed for the DPS to have easy access, be careful to use shields when you get Debuffed at the first Boss. Healer: Some Damage on the Tank and Party on all Bosses. Mostly just helping with DPS though. DPS: Burn down the Bosses and avoid standing in puddles. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Arm of the Son (Savage) A7S General Strategy: Burn down the Boss and whatever Adds appear. Only thing really deadly are the bombs. Those need to be spread, dont shy away from dragging them into the spikes and onto one of the outer platforms. If one Party Member is dragged away into prison they need to kill the Add there and can be ignored by the rest of the Party, except for the red colored jail where there is a padlock on the outside that has to be destroyed by those outside. Its up to you if you wanna free them or let them die to focus on the Boss! Tank: Tank the Boss and eventual Adds in the middle. Healer: There will be some Damage there, especially if people cheese the bombs and after getting out of jail. Its mostly still just helping with DPS though. DPS: Burn down the Boss and dont ignore Adds. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Burden of the Son (Savage) A8S !!No Mount here but a guaranteed Minion and maybe a Triple Triad Card!! General Strategy: This is by far the most difficult fight on unsync and I personally found it to be impossible with a small Party. 6 people are the minimum but its safer with 7 or 8, of which one is a Tank, one or two are Healer and the rest is DPS. \-First Phase is just burning the Boss down. \-Second Phase with the 4 Bosses from A6S has a kill order that should best be heeded or one of them might explode and reset the fight. The Order is North Boss (Blaster)  Middle Boss (Brawler) to 50%  East Boss (Swindler)  South Boss (Vortexter)  Middle Boss (Brawler) On unsync the Party might need to wait for the East and South Boss to spawn, dont go killing the Middle one during that. Also Orbs with Health Bars can be ignored. Pop the other Orbs if possible. \-Third Phase is just burning the Boss down again. \-Fourth Phase is chaos, there is nothing to attack here, just evading. To half handle, half cheese these mechanics we stacked our group against the southern wall, except for the Tank who pops the blue mine AoEs on the ground. Rest of the group avoids the beam from the middle and stays south, drops their markers there with some distance between them and the tethered people stand slightly North to the Add they are tethered to. There are also chakrams that spawn around the arena that will go straight over the arena and drag you with them dealing Damage, if you see them try to avoid them. All of this Damage can and must be Healed through. But after all this chaos the Vortexer Boss will spawn west and cast Ultraflash, which will kill you if you dont hide behind one of the LEGS of the still standing Boss in the middle. Additionally two people will have rings around them that shouldnt overlap. Have one stand behind the southern leg and one behind the northern, if possible have people stand in them to match the number of orbs in those circles. Fifth Phase is again burning down the Boss, however with a self induced enrage, since the Verdict mechanic and everything else around you will be ignored in favor of killing the Boss ASAP. This was easily done if people didnt die to the Ultraflash mechanic before. You have until the Boss finishes casting gavel later in the fight to kill him. Tank: Tank each of the Bosses and pop those blue AoE Mines during Chaos Phase. Healer: At first minimal Healing, then during Chaos Phase try to always top everyone off while still minding the mechanics around you, since you never know if someone might stumble into mines or get hit by more than the others. DPS: Mostly just minding mechanics while doing reasonable Damage. Step on the gas at the last Phase to burn the Boss down fast though. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Eyes of the Creator (Savage) A9S General Strategy: Back to simple, just burn down the Boss and hide behind rocks when they spawn. Tank: Tank the Boss facing away from the group and then help with Damage. Healer: Tank will need some Healing but mostly helping with Damage. DPS: Do DPS. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Breath of the Creator (Savage) A10S General Strategy: Your Party can ignore all mechanics and AoEs or follow them leisurely. Burning down the Boss, the Add at the other side of the platform and then back to the Boss until hes dead. Dont step on the buttons. During the Roller Add Phase run into other players after you have dropped a puddle to give them the Prey Debuff and everyone step back when the Adds cast is full since he will charge forward and kill you. Tank: Tank Boss in a way so Melee DPS can easily move around him without stepping on the Button. Healer: Some Healing necessary on both Tank and the Party depending on how much AoEs and Traps are avoided, slight Heal spike during the Roller Add Phase. DPS: Burn down Boss and Adds and dont stand in puddles or step on buttons. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Heart of the Creator (Savage) A11S General Strategy: The Mechanics you encounter here vary greatly depending on you Damage output and how big your Party is. In general keep focusing the Boss and switch to Adds if they spawn, you can ignore only the Lapis Lazuli in the later Phase. Jump on his back by USING the Open Ducts and the get ready for a one click Quick Time Event. If the Boss vanishes and you get numbered orbs over the Partys head Healers get ready to Esuna the Debuff you get when attacked from that as fast as possible. With just one Healer and a big Party prioritize your Esuna on Healer&gt;Tank&gt;DPS with Raise&gt;Other DPS Tank: Tank Boss stable and use your shield rotation if you get Vulnerability Debuffs. Healer: Damage can get quite intense with the Debuffs, especially in the later Phase. DPS: Since Damage can get high dont overlap AoE markers, otherwise focus on what else, Damage. &amp;#x200B; Alexander - The Soul of the Creator (Savage) A12S !!This is where the second Mount from this Raid drops and its a guaranteed drop!! General Strategy: Possible with a Light Party though I found a 5 Player Party to be most comfortable. \-Damage Alexander following mechanics to your leisure until Add Phase. \-Kill Adds quickly, during the last two Adds the Tank takes the one with the large circle around it, a DPS or Healer grabs the other one and they are spread until they dont overlap anymore and quickly kill them as well. \-Unlike A12N Tank LB3 isnt needed here with some shielding from the Tank or Healer. Top off afterwards. \-Immediately when Alexander reappears use DPS LB3 on him \-3 of the DPS will be marked with a purple Debuff, those must spread to the furthest sides of the Platform, one West, one South and one East. If you have only 3 DPS in your team they can be assigned set spots. Everyone else stacks North. \-Back to DPSing \-Get away from the small red dots on the ground, they expand and go off, giving you a Debuff that makes you hard to Heal. \-If you get a Blue Tether to another player go to the opposite sides of the platform, far away from each other. \-If you get a Red/Green Tether stand on top of each other. \-Ignore Time Gates as they appear and instead kill the Boss ASAP. Tank: Keep Alexander faced away from the Party. Tank the first set of Adds together and the third away from each other by grabbing one. Healer: There is still a fair amount of Healing, especially when someone gets a Debuff. Shield and Heal your Party after Add Phase so DPS can have the LB3. Help with Damage whenever you can. DPS: While before mechanics and AoEs could largely be ignored I urge you to avoid as much as possible here, ESPECIALLY the red dots on the ground that expand. When the Timegates open at the end of the fight you are on a timer, so step on the gas with DPS."
3,vulnerability,ffxiv,A Bro Guide to: Clearing Shiva (Unreal) like a Bro,1,id50b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/id50b8/a_bro_guide_to_clearing_shiva_unreal_like_a_bro/,2020-08-20 16:16:33,"Greetings bros, I am Brojel and a lot of people are trying to clear Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Unreal) at the moment, and I noticed a lot of bruh moments. So to save my fellow bros from bruh moments, I have decided to create this guide. **Chapter 1: Up to and including add phase** In this part of the fight, which I will refer to as Phase 1 from now on, Shiva will open by drawing a weapon. The weapon can either be sword or shield. Depending on the weapon drawn, one of two sets of mechanics will happen If she draws sword, the party will group up behind her, main tank bro will run into the party so Icebrand can be shared among everyone, then turn her back so she will Glacial Bash away from the party, dodge the glacial bash by going back to the party, and then face her outward, Whiteout will do nothing because everyone is in the donut. Pillars will randomly appear and knock people away, who can easily run back in, or it can be prevented using shields. The tank bro will randomly start gaining Blunt Vulnerability Up stacks up to 8, and Shiva will do Slashing damage If she draws staff, everybro will spread out and receive an area of effect(AoE) marker(Hailstorm) on themself and they will not clip each other like the bros they are. If necesary, discuss this with your bros before pulling. After this, Shiva will barrage the party with area of effect damage(Absolute Zero), and the party will group up behind Shiva while the healer bros will provide plenty of healing and mitigation to survive. Use of mitigation is recommended, and **making the healer bros' job easier is BRO!** Tank bro will semi-randomly gain Slashing Vulnerability Up stacks up to 8, and Shiva will do Blunt damage. After the weapon miniphase described above, Shiva will perform the first and only Icycle Impact of this. There will be two of 8 of the outer sections open, or it can simply be taken on the chest for the up time. This will give you a vulnerability up stack however, so make sure the healers are okay with you doing this. **Respecting the healers is BRO!** After this section Shiva will draw the other weapon. Tank bros will perform a tankswap by provoking and shirking respectively. **Not shirking during tank swaps is a bruh moment.** After the second weapon is drawn, Add phase will begin. Shiva will summon 4 adds at each intercardinal, halfway the radius of the circular arena. You must kill these adds within a certain time or the party will wipe, which is a major bruh moment. Shiva will also always grab a sword, so if the current tank tanking Shiva has Slashing Vulnerability Up stacks, a tankswap must be performed. Note that Shiva will go through the entire sword miniphase listed above, so turn her into the crowd to not die, then away from the crowd to not stun anyone. Whiteout has never mattered, and doesn't matter here either. After Glacial Bash the tank bro tanking Shiva can join the party in AoEing down the adds. This should result in enough aggro lead to not risk losing aggro to the other tank bro hitting her with AoE's after being provoked off while Shirk is on cooldown. After a certain time Shiva will become untargettable, then will freeze the party, unfreeze the party which does damage, if there's an add still alive this will kill everyone, and teleport to the person with the highest enmity's rough position. This person (which is hopefully a tank bro) will move to halfway the radius of the innermost circle pattern of the arena, and face Shiva towards the North. Chapter 2: Beyond add phase A pattern of 4 icycle circle with spawn, and the outer edge of the arena will from now on freeze anyone who moves into it into a block of ice, unable to do anything until the block of ice is destroyed. 4 Icycle markers will apear above either the cardinal or intercardinal directions. Every party bro will have a designated quarter of the arena to them and one other bro. To avoid confusion, Shiva must always face North during this mechanic. **Confusing your bros is a bruh move!** Next, Shiva will draw a weapon, and while in the process of drawing the weapon, the 4 markers will resolve. Depending on wether she draws Sword or Staff, the party must either stack in a group for Icebrand and then move into a pocket (or alternatively, just stack in a pocket), or split off into their \*designated\* pocket and move to either the inner or outer edge to avoid clipping each other with hail storms. After the 5 icycle markers resolve, everyone will stack behind Shiva. If the weapon was staff, be wary that the Absolute Zero attacks will get more and more brutal as the fight goes on, since Shiva gains a stacking Damage Up buff. Later on there is no such thing as overmitigating this. Please also beware that Shiva may cast Permafrost, which makes you slide quite far when moving in a certain direction at all, and that she will often start casting this during the resolving of other mechanics, trolling you into sliding into the wall or just into a position where you're useless. She will try to do this after every mechanic. The tell is a thick fog covering the arena, if you see this, be careful with when you move. After she is finished going through the motions with her weapon, there will be a set of Icycle circles spawning one after the other, starting in the center, and then in a spiral pattern one after the other. To avoid these, move to the circle position opposite on the mirror side of the 3rd to spawn, when taking the middle and 2nd one as mirror axis, as that will be the last one to strike. Move into the middle when it resolves, though do beware that Shiva will sometimes cast Permafrost before all circles are done resolving. Remember, she will try to troll you. Be aware. Optionally, you can just tank the vulnerability stacks. Consult with your healer before doing this, **Communicating with your healer is bro!** If you are tanking a vulnerability stack, tank Shiva toward the edge of the arena (use the safe pockets). It will make the next part easier on the party, at the cost of needing more healing. After the spiral pattern, Shiva will draw a bow and perform a roughly 210 cone called Glass Dance. Stand behind her or you will die. Following this, tank bro will move her to the edge, and the party will vacate her back. One bro will be designated for a heavy knockback, and this bro will move to the back, and perform their knockback immunity. If this bro is a tank bro, a tank immunity will also stop the knockback. This will be known as the ***Bro Strat*** for doing this, as it is the most bro way. Forcing the marker to the side is a major bruh move, as the marker can and will designate the same person consecutively, which would leave them frozen in ice. Following the knockback, Shiva will be moved to the edge of the inner ring pattern of the arena, and we go back to the start. **4 icycles, weapon, 5 icycles, spiral icycles, bow, repeat until enrage or death.** Chapter 3: Before the fight. While it may be strange to do the pre-fight talks at the end of the guide, it wouldn't be the weirdest thing Party Finder does, so here it is. Assign Quadrants according to the bro way( tanks in front, healers on each side, ranged in back) Discuss wether you're inner or outer with quadrant partner Try to discuss the first hailstorm adjustments with the party (in a standard party, there's 2 melee bros and 2 tank bros all wanting uptime) Discuss with your healer bros wether they are cool with you intentionally taking Vulnerability Up stacks or not. Remember to respect your healer bro. Eat your veggies. Do not go into a fight without eating your veggies ever. Mama cooked them for you bro. &amp;#x200B; Well this is the end of the guide bro. If any of you bros still have questions, or comments, please leave them below bro. Remember to always be a bro wherever you go, and have a nice bro day. Thank you for reading this."

Since I had all 17 combat jobs leveled to 80 already, I got all 17 Resistance Weapons within 2 weeks of the patch coming out. Because I had completed the weapons before Ishgard Restoration started I was trying to figure out what I should in the meantime. I figured that I would try to complete the one ARR Relic (Black Mage) I had started YEARS ago but stopped once I hit the Book phase. I spent the next week going through and completing the remainder of the Black Mage Relic. I was like That wasnt so bad. Lets go for the remaining 9. I would then spend the next week getting all nine up to the book phase. The book phase is where things started to slow down. It would take another month and a half for me to get through all nine jobs of the book phase. I had to stop farming the book phase for 2 weeks due to the fact that I ran out of leves for the levequests and had to wait for the leves to restock. I did spend those 2 weeks stocking up for the later stages but still it was definitely a grind. Still, after 3 months, I completed all 10 ARR relics. I had been stocking up over the years on SOME of the Heavensward Mats but never put in the time to go after them. Thankfully compared to the ARR Relics, Heavensward Relics are a much more laid-back grind compared to the dungeon grinding for the ARR Relics. Heavensward Relics rely more on Poetic farming than dungeon farming. So, you are limited in the number of things to do each day thus reduce the burden of grinding dungeons unsynced all day. It doesnt mean you cant grind dungeons all day, but it is not required. That and Heavensward Relics only require one round of Light farming, compared to one-and-a-half rounds of light farming for ARR Relics. This took me a month and a half after finishing the ARR Relics. Some tips for those who want to run either: Both:  If you are aiming for both and have the quest for both pick up both Morbid Motivation (from Brangwine in Revenants Toll \[21.9, 6.7\]) and Cut from a Different Cloth (from Angelet in Idyllshire \[7.9, 5.8\]) before you do your daily Duty Roulette: Level 50/60/70 Dungeons. Saves you a few Poetics a day. A Realm Reborn Relics: * During the book phase, you can pick up multiple leves ahead of time if you know which books you are going after. Typically I would grab up to 12 leves in one go (5 set of books; but several times there are a few duplicates so I would have to wait till I completed the leves before I can re-get the leve. * If you have a Grand Company Leve in both Mor Dhona and Central Highlands, you do not need to hand in either at their respected location. You can go to one and hand in both and they will both be counted. * Some fates only appear once an hour. \*starts glaring at The Big Bagoly Theory in Eastern Thanalan, Tower of Power in Central Highlands, and The Kings Justice in Western La Noscea\* * Light grinding can be made a LOT easier if you can find a dungeon that is in a bonus block. Every two hours (on the even hour in EST; odd hour in PST), a random dungeon or so will be marked as a bonus dungeon. I would tend to dungeon hop for the first 30 minutes or so trying to find a fast dungeon that maybe in a bonus block. I would go * Aurum Vale * Tam-Tara Deepcraft * Haukke Manor * Sastasha * Halatali (Hard) * Stone Vigil * If I did not find a bonus dungeon by then I would farm Aurum Vale (takes about 2  minutes each; rest are 3-4 minutes). * If you do not find a bonus block, it takes 42 runs. 21 runs if you have a bonus block. * You do NOT need to have the weapon equipped the entire dungeon. Only when killing the final boss. Heavensward * If you have any ARR relics done, you do not have to use that to hand in to skip the Crystal farming phase. I found this to be a fairly easy phase even though I was farming for all 11 missing relics. I had about a 25% chance to get a crystal per fate. To get all 11 jobs, took me about 8-10 hours of Fate farming. * For the Crystal part, you do not need to be in the job you have the quest for. Crystals will drop from any jobs as long as you have the quest. * The main thing with these relics is going be poetic farming. Particularly for Umbrites. You will need about 75 Umbrites total (approximately 5,625 Poetics). Whenever I was not spending Poetics on immediate things for ARR relics other more pressing items, I was purchasing Umbrites. * If you have a level 76+ Alchemist, I would STRONGLY suggest keeping an eye out for days when Rowenas House of Splendors has Cunning Craftsmans Syrup; ESPECIALLY when its starred. Non-star days gives up 270 Yellow Scrips. Star days gives up to 324 Yellow Scrips. You can convert 25 of those to Rowenas Token (Blue Scripts Scrip). 5 Rowenas Token (Blue Scripts Scrip) will give you 2 Crystal Sands. So, a relatively cheap way to get the Crystal Sands. * Just before the Light farming, you will need to run Sohm Al (Hard). A tip to tell your tanks (or if you ARE tanking). The first area of Sohm Al, you can tank mobs on top of the vents so that they can gain a Vulnerability Up debuff on the adds. I found most tanks are not aware of that mechanic. * For the Light farming phase it will take 21 runs of A9S to cap * There is a 5-10% chance that a A9S can become a Stalward instead of a Hardened proc. I had anywhere between 1 and 3 Stalward procs outside of a Stalward Block * Similar to ARR Light farming, there is a chance that you can get a Stalward Block where A9S will always give Stalward. Like ARR Light farming, this can happen on the even hour in EST (odd hour PST). If you get into A9S with this block active, you only need 16 runs to cap. * I would suggest if the A9S group you run with is going to do the trial phase right afterwards, try to have your 15 Pneumite acquired before-hand. You can get them either by Poetics (100 each) or by Grand Company Seals (4,000 each \[Captain Rank -&gt; Materials\]) I plan on taking it easy till 5.3. Join Hunt trains to cap on Nuts and to stock up on Yellow and White scrips. Now to figure out what to spend Poetics on. I have all jobs at 80 So I do not need it for gear. All of my Desynthesis Skills are level 460+ so I dont have any gear I can purchase to desynthesis to level off of. Only thing I can think of is level 70 crafting/gearing gear or at least the mats to make them. Just a cursory glance at the market board and none of the rest of the gear is selling that often."

Topic: Time Mage,1,ezimf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ezimf0/new_healer_job_discussion_topic_time_mage/,2020-02-06 10:22:52,"If the new healer is the time mage what would his abilities be and what would be his mechanic? The charge mechanic is a clock. It will build up time and using the charge would execute his more powerful abilities. And it would be a mixture of 25% and 50% usage. The time mage would be a regen type healer but has a much higher potency but shorter duration. Increasing the natural healing by speeding up time. He would also have either the ability to increase evasion or damage mitigation whichever is more consistent. Think of it as time warping, slowing attacks so they can be avoided. His dot would also be high potency with short duration. Think of it as rapid aging. And other game, time battle mages get the ability to cast ""float."" We could also have this ability and it will last for a short duration and it allows people to stand in AOEs without receiving damage. Also crossing prolonged AOE effects would also be negated. (Example being: stone vigil and the ice burn effect) Would this just be a gimmick? Possibly. But I can't think of any other use of the float spell. The time age could also have the ability to cast ""vulnerability down"" on a target. TLDR: time mage with buff and debuff abilities."

I couldn't really find much info about it, so i decided to write a post. I recently started gearing my Warrior up, and i've been hitting the Eden raids quite frequently. Titan, and his tank buster in particular, kinda raised a question since it applies a vulnerability debuff. I know that it's reasonable to assume that it's a sign to swap tanks, but do people actually do that? I've done Titan a bunch of times now, and each time i main tanked, it wasn't really taunted off of me, or the off tank didn't ask to throw some enmity his way. I've also tried off-tanking it, and again - the main didn't tell me to taunt it off of him. So i just want to be 100% sure. Is it expected of tanks to swap after the buster?"

I have only ever lived post-final-phase ONCE, and he killed me shortly afterward. I am a total loss as to how I can beat him, which is why I am here. Notes: 1) No I dont have a healer or caster class at lvl 80, and I'm not really interested in one. I have DRK at like lvl 65, I would rather avoid that if I can. 2) Is there anything at all I can buy/make and use that would negate suppuration stacks?

Drk seems to take the most damage, although the observation could have been poorly timed due to projection. I have noticed personally that with drk they receive a lot of magical shields, with magic vulnerability seeming redundant. Maybe timing the shields long-term can seem complicated because of the possible sensory overload of the cooldowns With healing mrd. They seem to have a periodic Regen that ticks about twice as long as my whm Regen, but it's substantial and have been the easiest to heal because I think mrd's are so fun to play that people have no problem mastering them Pld's are obvious. They have a shield and I vaguely remember them having a personal damage mitigating ability they can use. Average push for activation is about every other fight unless wall to wall pulling"

Yall - Im tired. I started so forgiving, but after so many mechanics and so little MP from all the rezzing I had to reprioritize.

I only wrote here what I understood in the fight. You may correct me or add supplementary info in the comments section. Ill also be making a video and image diagrams soon on my site!* # PHASE 1 **Ancient Double**  it just reminds you that hes on Extreme mode  **Shadow Spread**  2 consecutive conal attacks on everyone. Get near the boss and spread on separate clock phases to avoid clipping each other. Eat the 1st attack, then avoid the 2nd by sidestepping to a safe area **Bad Faith**  2 consecutive quadrant attacks on NE+SW or NW+SE and then vice versa. Avoid the 1st by going behind the sharp nails, and immediately run to the other side to avoid the 2nd **Ravenous Assault**  2x tankbuster with the 1st having a vulnerability debuff. Switch tanks on cast so off-tank can eat he 2nd hit without debuffs. Use cooldowns **Arcane Utterance + Control** * **Utterance**  summons 7 mirrors, one in each clock phase, that will fire straight lasers that goes through everything * **Control**  the mirrors will fire laser * **How to handle:** look for the clock phase with no mirror on it and run behind the mirror opposite to it. Since theres no mirror pointing at you, then no laser will fire at you **Broken Faith**  9 puddles will appear, 8 on the clock phases of the arenas edge, and 1 on the center. Blue AoE magic circles will begin falling down one by one. Just avoid them- advisable to go to puddles where a circle has recently exploded **Arcane Utterance**  one AoE orb will appear on each clock phase, except one. Run towards that safe spot to avoid the AoEs **Shadow Spread** # ADDS PHASE **Nabriales Shade**  DPS it down as you handle other mechanics **Tethers on all DPS**  will cause straight line AoE on where DPS are. Face them away from party **Meteors**  tanks must stand on meteor puddles as they go down and explode or else it will cause raid-wide AoE **AoE Circles on Tanks + Shareable AoE on everyone else**  tanks move away while everyone else stack together to share damage **Quake III**  raid-wide AoE. I think damage is relevant to Nabrialess HP so you must have reduced his HP or killed him by then **Igeyorhm &amp; Lahabrea**  tank them on opposite sides (E and W). DPS them down as you handle mechanics **Fire + Blizzard Sphere**  heavy raid-wide AoE **Dark Flame x2 + Dark Freeze x2**  4 shadows will position on NE NW SE SW then tether to players. 4 players will get one each. They stay near the shadow they are tethered to. Everyone else without a tether stay in the middle **Fire + Blizzard Sphere** **Fire IV / Blizzard IV**  tankbusters on their respective tanks **Universal Manipulation** **Combo** * **Universal Manipulation**  raid-wide AoE * **Team A:** 4 players will be debuffed by **Off Balance + Lightning + Death** * **Team B:** 4 players will be debuffed by **Circle + Shriek** * **Ancient Circle**  donut AoEs on Team B * **How to handle:** Team A must get hit by 1 circle. 3 from Team B move away and stack their 3 circles while the 4th member goes to the other side. Team A will stack at Team Bs 4th member to get hit by one circle * **Death Shriek**  petrification if you face anyone from Team B when it activates * **How to handle:** Team A will get pushed away from where they were hit by the circle and Team Bs Shriek will activate. Team A must get pushed to the north area, facing away, while Team B stays on south area and face away from each other * **Forked Lightning**  circle AoE on Team A. Just spread and avoid getting clipped * **Blight**  raid-wide AoE **Height of Chaos**  tankbuster **Megiddo Flame**  straight-line shareable AoE on both healers. 4 people stack on one side, while the other 4 on the opposite side **Shadow Flare** # PHASE 2 **Again the Majestic**  a set of ff. mechanics: * 2 Tank Meteors + Circle AoE on healer * 2 Tank Meteors * 2 Tank Meteors + Aether Gaol **Again the Martyr**  a set of mechanics where you need to be in the right position after the knockback * Healers will be marked with straight-line AoEs * DPS will be marked with circle AoEs each * **How to handle:** * everyone stack at middle before the push * 1 T/H pair position to get pushed at north * 1 T/H pair position to get pushed at south * DPS position to get pushed on east and west areas separately * the point is to avoid clipping. On knockback: * tank and healer pairs will get pushed to their areas and share damage * DPS will get pushed and their circle AoEs will explode **Again the Abyssal Celebrant**  another set of mechanics * Raid-wide Striped conal AoE * Straight-line shareable AoEs on healers * AoE puddle on DPS * **Sequence:** Conal AoE &gt; Straight AoE &gt; Conal AoE &gt; Straight AoE &gt; Conal AoE &gt; Straight AoE &gt; Puddles * **How to handle:** 1 T/H pair position on NE, 1 T/H pair on NW, while those with puddles spread on the middle and south.

Stand at center while avoiding Dark Seal * **Shadow Stream**  straight-line AoE on the center. Stand on the sides while avoiding Dark Seal **Dark Seal** **Life in Captivity**  time maneuver mode! # FINAL PHASE **Dark Current**  multiple moving circle AoEs on the direction of their arrows. Sidestep to avoid. Getting behind a circle after the fact is best **Gigantomachy**  raid-wide AoE **Quadrastrike**  raid-wide AoE with 2 tank towers, then another raid-wide AoE with bleeding **Dark Current** **Gigantomachy** **Quadrastrike** **Gigantomachy (enrage)**"

I've been a player since 2.0 and I've mained SCH/SMN and SAM since that came out. I've been fleshing it out, really getting into the swing of things as a DRK and after weeks of clearing E4N as healer, or a DPS, I decided I would go as my DRK, and it turns out that I ended up as the MT. **I made a mistake with my mana**, which is pretty normal for a newer DRK that screwed me on getting the blackest night out. I popped my other CDs but after taking a vulnerability stack from an earlier mechanic, I was not able to survive it. No problem, the OT picks up agrro while I apologize for my mistake in party chat. **Then a massive land slide comes out, and both healers forgot that the mechanic is IN, then OUT, and they went down**. We were probably 8-10% away from killing him, the DPS drop the LB3 and were are still about 4 to 5% away from killing him, so I see my MT take a stack of vulnerability on one of the mechanics, and he is taking a beat-down, his health is falling, he has no more CD, and so I think ***SHIT, it's coming and I can save him.*** **This was the first time I really knew my shit as a tank**. I picked up the aggro at around 70% health, knowing he couldn't survive the next tank buster, I provoked, and titan was finishing up his last auto on him, that allowed him to walk away with the smallest sliver of health. Like under 5%, it was dire, and so I take the next auto, and then the tankbuster begins it's cast**, Stonebreaker is coming**, and I am well into the mid 60ish% area at this time. It drops, and BOOM. It nearly brings me down, Titan is at 2ish% now, **it's a race between the remaining DPS, and our rapidly dwindling health pools**. The DPS is giving it all they got, i'm so low, ***I can't survive another hit***, I smash my Living Dead, and I become the Walking Dead, I see one last hit go off, the seconds are ticking by, and 0%. Titan goes down. 5 seconds later, after our fanfare begins, the walking dead expires, after me having reached 0% and I fall. Not that I ever feel entitled to them, but they are nice to get, I got one single player commendation. I know it was that fellow tank. I was new to the fight, but that newly developed instinct, to save, after years of healing,cutting and casting. Made me feel new again. This has been one of the most gratifying, reinforcing things for a new tank to experience. Thanks for letting me share."

They are mostly English speakers who have no second language - kind of a red flag but I believe they have their reasons. Some have pointed me to the reddit post [URL specifically defucchi's reply there regarding his/her experiences after a month on a JP server, but it didn't really prepare them for what they experienced. I think the observations are mostly accurate, but defucchi's reply didn't address ""why does it happens?"" or ""how do you deal with it?"" &amp;#x200B; Some stuff about me: I'm an ethinic Chinese Singaporean, fluent in English, Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese and German and I use them on a daily/weekly basis at work. I did my PhD in Oulu, Finland and my postdoc in Austin, Texas. I had work stints in Wichita, Kansas; Stevange, England and Dsseldorf, Germany. I never really managed to feel comfortable with the people or culture in NA or EU, so I moved back to Asia to live and work. These days, I'm back in Singapore with fairly frequent trips (work and otherwise) to Erzgebirge, Germany; and different parts of Japan. After living and working in several places around the world, one thing is clear: being able to speak the language, and understanding the full context behind what is said; are two different animals. The exposure to difficult cultures often conflicts with my upbringing - but I'd like to think I'm very fortunate to have been able to travel and still continue to do so. It helps to give context to lots of social situations. I play on Alexander in Gaia DC exclusively with JP groups because the English community there is small to non-existent and most of us are fluent Japanese speakers anyway. Defucchi's reply in that post brought a few chuckles, he/she observed the behaviours, and described them accurately, but still couldn't understand why things happened the way they did. Well, I spent over a year in Austin, Texas and I couldn't understand most of the behaviour(did end up making some friends though) - so these things happen. &amp;#x200B; \~Let's start with some common scenarios that can generate culture shock in a JP server\~ \##### Scenario: ""I said that I'm new to the duty/ but my party is silent and carried on ahead with the duty. Help!"" &amp;#x200B; There's a lot of emphasis on what isn't said. If you say that you're new and provide no further context, on JP servers it is assumed 100% that you've watched or read a guide regarding the duty. If you mess up a bit here and there, the party will still think it's normal because ""some people learn by doing, they've watched a guide - just need to get used to it."" Remember, in Asian cultures it is a source of personal shame and speaks badly of yourself, your family, your upbringing if you burden others unnecessarily. It's not just JP culture, Korean, Chinese, Thai, Viet, Indonesian, etc. have this as part of the traditional core beliefs. So, most players have watched a guide - it is expected of each individual. What you can do is to state, ""I'm really bad with movement, should I be closer to or away from the boss?"" or ""I know most bosses cleave, but does this boss have anything really big like 270 degree arc attacks to note?"" or ""Are there any orbs/markers dropped by the boss that I should avoid/eat?"" or ""If I am marked by a prey/puddle AOE, where's the best place to drop it?""  \~   Asking those questions are more useful. Players inclined to mentorship will feel more inclined to help because they only need to explain portion you're unsure about rather than the whole fight. It will also allow you to learn and recognise mechanics faster if this is you're new to FFXIV. It shows that you are interested to improve the dungeon run experience for your party and more importantly demonstrate the extent of unfamiliarity that you have. &amp;#x200B; \##### Scenario: ""My team mate is struggling/doing poor dps/trouble keeping the team healed/tanking badly. That's my main job so I know how to play it well. I politely gave a few pointers for improvement/linked a guide, but my team mate became upset."" or simply ""People are easily offended if you give sincere advice."" &amp;#x200B; This is one of the uglier parts of Asian culture. Unless someone is in your ""inner"" group (e.g. family, close friends, subordinate to you, etc.). It is EXTREMELY rude to give unsolicited help even if someone is struggling. It does not matter how politely you phrased it, it is still considered RUDE. Wait for them to ask for help. Also, don't give more help than what is asked for. If they don't ask for help, just be silent. Whether you're in North Asia or South-east Asia, this still applies. Here in Singapore, I've seen tourists at the train station struggling, checking the map they picked up at the airport, checking the station's locality map, having a lost face for all to see. No one helps when the tourist is too shy to ask for assistance. We want to help, we see someone in distress, our innate culture says to mind your own business until they ask for help - so we walk past and continue with our day. I'm always faced with an internal conflict in this scenario, half the time I help, the other half I walk away. In China, let's say there's a hit and run accident and you go help the victim - if eventually they can't find the driver, the victim's family may seek compensation from YOU and they have a decent chance of the courts awarding it. Anyway, Chinese culture in China is different from the Chinese diaspora, but the similarities are still there. Back to the scenario in game, it doesn't matter how politely you said it. The fact is you said it when it wasn't asked for. Just bear with, if they want to improve they will reflect on it later and feel ashamed, then go look up some guides. Otherwise, you'll likely never meet them again in roulettes.  Helping sometimes will get you a polite and short thanks, but that's just our upbringing to be polite. Remember what I said about a lot of emphasis on what isn't said? Yeah, they said ""thanks."" What they are really thinking is ""Why is this person so rude, offering help when I didn't ask for any? Didn't their parents teach them that this isn't right? What lousy parents and upbringing!"" So, I'm sorry to tell you this but they're not going to look at the guide that you linked to within the game chat. Now you might be asking what's the solution. There is one but I think most players won't do it: At the end of the duty ask if it's okay to add that player as a friend. Befriend that person, play with them more often, show a positive example and explain why YOU do certain things that way. Eventually that player will try to follow your example, or simply ask for your help to work on rotations, timing, etc. As you can see, it's a relatively large investment of time and energy. Therefore, advise and help only those you think have the potential to improve, which is a rather tall order given that you just have a 15 minute dungeon run with them. That's partly why we choose to remain silent even in the face of clearly bad play. &amp;#x200B; \##### Scenario: ""People greet all the time."" or ""They apologise too much even though they created a learning party."" or ""People are so silent apart from greetings. What's the point of greeting then?"" &amp;#x200B; Yes it happens, it may feel contrived if you come from another culture. The greeting is a form of acknowledgement - ""I'm here. I see that you're my healer/tank/co-dps. I acknowledge your presence and you as a player and a person."" Yes, some JP players don't greet - they are greatly frowned on by the community. The apology thing is an acknowledgement of the mistake. The person fumbled, acknowledges that a mistake was committed. The party apologises to acknowledge, ""I'm in this party, and a mistake was made. Perhaps I could have done something; no matter how minuscule to have mitigated that."" This is related to how Asians see the individual and society as a whole. If you've travelled to Asia, most immigration forms will list: ""Family name, Given name"". It's seldom to never ""First name, Last name."" Each individual is constantly judged, day and night, as a member of their family, upbringing, community, school, company, profession, etc. you are never really John Smith the individual, you are John, member of the family name ""Smith"", representing all Smiths, his parents, etc. This is why we favour this kind of system in game: player A makes a mistake - slap player A once, slap everyone else in his team 2 to 3 times. Second player to make a mistake? Slap that player once, slap everyone else 4 to 6 times. Notice something familiar? Yeah, sounds a lot like vulnerability stacks when you fail mechanics. The game has a global audience, so in FFXIV the stacks are placed on the individual (imagine if they place it on the entire team instead). However, there are mechanics where one mistake from anyone wipes the group - yes, we love those kind of things. You succeed as a group, fail as a group, the group is the single unit. We don't see the savage clear team as 8 individuals together, we see them as one blob with 8 head-like things sticking out. You are not that healer who saved the raid with well timed healer LB3, you are just a portion of the blob that cleared the content. Ninja messed up trick attack because he was horsing around? Everyone's fault, both tanks, both healers, the dancer who was busy buffing people, the dragoon dead on the platform, yes even that black mage in her ley lines in the corner dps-ing her heart out enough to make up for the sleeping dragoon and more - all are at fault. They failed to raise the team beyond the sum of their individual parts and weaknesses. Or at least that's the mentality, we're too polite to say it explicitly that way. This leads to the topic of awkwardness or . Mistakes happen, apologise and then continue or disband. You do not complain, cultural norms demand that you do not have the right to complain. Angry or frustrated? Stay silent. We're taught from a young age - ""you have the right to an opinion, but you DO NOT have the right to express it as and when you like"". People tend to interpret this in really creative ways these days but the core belief is still there. Even if the mistake is clearly someone else's fault, undeniably a single person's fault, you stay silent. Remember, you're part of the team too, just like that person. This leads to the last scenario I'll cover for now since it's getting a bit long. Different cultures have different social norms - if we played in NA/EU we'd be expected to follow the social norms there too. Try to get used to it? It's just greetings and silence. &amp;#x200B; \##### Scenario: ""No one seems to want to call out someone else's mistakes."" &amp;#x200B; This one - it's just as ugly when you know the truth behind this practice. Saying ""We wiped because you were greedy about dps uptime and didn't get to your position in time."" isn't just saying ""you made a mistake in the game, and all of us including you are being made to pay the price of that."" In the Asian context, pointing out someone's mistake in front of others is the same as pointing and saying ""You made a mistake. A mistake is a flaw. You are a flawed human being who couldn't pay attention and play a game perfectly for 15 minutes. You disgrace your family, your upbringing, your academic and professional training. You don't deserve love. You don't even deserve to be alive."" Wait. What? Pointing out a mistake publicly in an Asian context is the same as saying their worth as a living being is a mistake. There is absolutely ZERO separation. Taken to an extreme in real life - take the stereotypical Asian ""tiger mum"" demanding straight As, berating the child for a single B+. In her mind there isn't a separation of the results from her child's worth as a person. It doesn't matter if her child was very ill on the examination day. The results to her, show that her child failed, she failed as mother, both failed as humans. The family failed as a unit. That is why she is taking it so hard. Please note. I'm not condoning such behaviour. I'm pointing it out as the cultural reason behind why this scenario happens. So how do we handle this in the game? The party leader or a friend in the party requests a time-out, maybe even exit the duty. Everyone goes to get a drink, bio break, rest their eyes etc. Someone in that person's ""inner social group"" sends a tell and talks to the person to try to address the mistake. Here, the choice of words is critical. I learnt this from my Finnish doctoral advisor, bless his heart. It seems to transcend cultures. So, as one friend in the game to another or as a static member, or even just a person from the same server you occasionally see in pugs on party finder: ""Hey, there were a lot of wipes. A bunch of critical mistakes happened. Think we should change things around? Folks could change positions, ask everyone again about who wants to volunteer to execute aiming the cones away from the centre. As long as the mistakes continue, no one is rolling on any loot tonight. Tell me what you think, ya?"" So we see (1) state the situation (lot of wipes), (2) state the cause without listing any actors, (3) suggest solutions that involves everyone in the project (swapping positions), (4) reiterate the problem to emphasise the gravity of the situation (AOE cone not being baited correctly, contributing to the wipes), (5) state the consequence carried by the whole group if improvements are not made, (6) seek inputs from that person, validate his/her existence and contribution to the team. (tell me what you think) Notice at no point was there any finger pointing, or comparison with others. Yet it still carried gravity of the situation - wipes, mistakes, no loot. It takes time, effort and practice to do this. I'm still trying to do this in all aspects of my life but I fail... a lot of the time. This is very different from,""You need to be less greedy about uptime. That's the 5th wipe you caused with the pure ray orbs. You need to get your game together. C'mon man, buck up!"" On the surface it sounds like encouragement from a friend, however - if we read into it a bit more, it's literally finger pointing. This also the most common feedback we see in the game. People might say, ""Grow a thicker skin."" ""Don't be a wuss and stop taking things so personally!"" Well some cultures are more sensitive to this and if you're playing in a JP server, that's why ""No one seems to want to call out someone else's mistakes."" &amp;#x200B; \##### If you've read up to this point, you'd have realised this isn't a JP &gt; NA/EU post. Rather, it shows a lot of the ugliness in JP and Asian culture. Yes, a lot of it is my culture too. I hope this post explains the ""why"" behind the observations. I fully expect most people to disagree with the logic behind the observed behaviour, it is from a totally different culture after all (since most of reddit seems to be NA/EU). I felt there's too much of ""JP vs NA vs EU"" and not enough of ""xyz does abc, we do efg. It's so different. Why do they do that? I want to understand."" Just sharing. Let me know what you think. Hope that it helps you to understand the rationale behind the observation. Have fun in game. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; P/s: Oh yes one more thing. Since this reddit, if you think it is TLDR, don't like reading or just like to downvote things. Please go ahead too."

The timer only had 12 minutes left on it. The group had 0 chance of killing the last boss: we were repeatedly failing the DPS checks, I was highest DPS as the healer, my tank was averaging 3-5 stacks of vulnerability every pull. My gear broke. I abandoned. I now have a 30 minute deserter debuff. Why? I legitimately have to sit there and wipe for 90 minutes with a group that has no chance of success?"
17,vulnerability,ffxiv,Trust Guide,244,cbjqgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/cbjqgo/trust_guide/,2019-07-11 03:34:47,"In this guide, I will be going over what you should expect from trusts. While we all understand that running in DF is generally faster, Trusts are a good queue-less alternative and has quite a bit of nuance. This guide will be a WIP as I level my trusts and give new discoveries on what they do. **Trust Availability pre-Epilogue** Holminster Switch: The Crystal Exarch - All-Rounder Alphinaud - Healer/Academician Alisiae - DPS/Red Mage Lyna - DPS Dohm Mehg: Thancred - Tank/Gunbreaker Alphinaud - Healer/Academician Urianger - Healer/Astrologian Alisiae - DPS/Red Mage Minfilia - DPS/Oracle of Light The Qitana Ravel: Thancred - Tank/Gunbreaker Urianger - Healer/Astrologian Yshtola - DPS/Sorceress Minfilia - DPS/Oracle of Light Malikahs Well/Mt. Gulg/Amaurot: Thancred - Tank/Gunbreaker Alphinaud - Healer/Academician Urianger - Healer/Astrologian Alisiae - DPS/Red Mage Yshtola - DPS/Sorceress Ryne - DPS/Oracle of Light **Trust Availability Post-Epilogue** Your final party becomes available across all 6 trust dungeons, but they de-level to 71. At this point, their level determines their availability, needing to reach the appropriate level to do the associated dungeon. Also, trusts only have dungeon specific dialogue they were there for in the MSQ. As a consequence, you lose the ability to experience The Crystal Exarchs and Lynas dialogue/associated banter in Holminster Switch after you beat the game. **Trust AI Overview** Your scion friends do follow a somewhat predictable AI pattern that may affect who you decide to level first or at all. The primary things to keep in mind about general trust activity: 1. They dont do AoE rotations. This is the primary factor that makes trusts not as efficient as DF. However, some of their skills do AoE damage. 2. The three trusts that have access to the same jobs as we do tend to follow those jobs with very little deviation. However, the three with their own job/class titles deviate a lot more. 3. Each trust has a general combo and a burst combo. The trust will revert to the beginning of their general combo if they idle for too long from mechanics or you enter a new encounter. 4. Trusts _may_ keep moves they get from level ups even if they sync down. I will need to level more myself to confirm. 5. If you just want fast clears, _based on personal and very pending experience_, you want to bring Alphinaud, and Ryne if youre bringing Thancred. However, the difference between clear times is pretty minimal; its more impacted by your job choice, with SCH and AST being a couple of the slowest. This may also change as I level more. **Thancred: Tank/Gunbreaker** General AI behavior: if you stand close enough to a mob group, Thancred will pull them without you needing to pull aggro. This wont happen for a couple of bosses, such as Philia. He will prioritize maintaining aggro on all mobs, meaning you need to pull yourself if you want wall-to-wall pulls. Moveset: Keen Edge -&gt; Brutal Shell -&gt; Solid Barrel: Thancreds general combo. Brutal shell will give Thancred a self-heal and a shield. Cartridge Combo + Continuation: Thancreds burst combo. **This is only accessible if Ryne is in the party.** Thancred begins this combo by saying an un-voiced Ryne, the cartridges! Demon slice: AoE Attack. Thancred uses this once to establish enmity on trash. Royal Guard: Gunbreakers tank stance. This is permanently on Thancred. Aurora: Grants a targeted player a HoT. Its trigger is if damage is being taken. He will typically prioritize himself as hes the one who should be taking damage, but he will also use it on you on occasion, typically after raid AoE. Heart of Light: Grants party in range magic reduction. Its trigger is party HP dropping below a certain point. Nebula: reduces damage taken. Its trigger is Thancreds HP dropping below a certain point, likely 50%. Sonic Break: deals an attack and inflicts a DoT. Thancred will use this skill as much as possible. Rough Divide: Gap Closer + damage. Thancred will pull new groups with this. **Looking for Confirmation** Potion: Thancred will heal himself for a substantial amount. This is pending as its ridiculously hard to confirm and force Thancred to do. However, I do notice he occasionally gets a massive heal after a tank buster despite no heals from me or Alisiae. Blasting Zone: requires lv 73. Deals damage. Uses this fairly frequently when unlocked. **Alphinaud: Healer/Academician** General AI Behavior: will DPS when party is reasonably healthy. However, he isnt much of a risk taker. Since hes not a Scholar, he instead uses carbuncle. Broil II: deals damage. Upgrades to Broil III at level **Pending**. Bio II/Miasma: DoTs. He doesnt have 100% upkeep but typically starts a battle with these two. Physick: a single target heal. He will use this when a single person has been reasonably damaged. Adloquium: a single target heal with a shield. He will use this when a single person has taken heavy damage. Succor: a partywide heal with a shield. He will use this when multiple people have been injured. He frequently tops people up with this even if the party is only minimally damaged. Lustrate: an OGCD single target heal. He will use this when a single person takes very heavy damage. Esuna: cleanses a single debuff. Alphinaud will use this when necessary. Gust: Carbuncle continuously uses this attack. He tends to focus on the first target, even if the party, including Alphinaud, change targets. **Urianger: Healer/Astrologian** General AI behavior: Will DPS when the party is reasonably healthy. This section will be a massive WIP for awhile as hes the last Trust Im leveling. However, Im welcome to input. Malefic III: deals damage. Diurnal Stance: Adds a regen to Aspected Benefic. Urianger doesnt leave this stance. Benefic: a single target heal. He will use if someone is reasonably damaged. Helios: an AoE heal. He will use if the party is reasonably damaged. Aspected Benefic: a no cast-time single target heal. Since Urianger is always in Diurnal stance, it will also grant a regen. Casts it on non-tanks if theyve taken moderate damage, or on the tank if theyve taken minor damage. Draw/Play: Urianger will play cards that give a damage buff. He will prioritize you if youre a DPS. Hell prioritize Alisiae, Yshtola, or Ryne if youre tanking. Unsure if the cards have differing effects like ours or if theyre just a general damage buff; Urianger will give you unsuitable cards if the former is true. Black Hole: Urianger will deal AoE damage and inflict Slow and Heavy on afflicted targets. Doesnt appear to be a specific trigger. Will still use against bosses. Death: instantly kills the target. Urianger tends to cast it when the enemy is already on the weaker side. Does not use on bosses (who are likely immune). **Alisiae: DPS/Red Mage** General AI behavior: almost identical to our Red Mage job. She will use the Skyshard LB the moment its up against the first or second boss. She will save for Starstorm in the final boss and use immediately. Jolt II + Verthunder/Veraero: Alisiaes General damage combo. Corps-a-corps + Enchanted combo + Verflare/Verholy: Alisiaes burst combo. Alisiae may have her own mana bar that she abides by. Vercure: a single target heal. She will use if an ally takes heavy damage. Engagement: requires lv 72. Does damage. Shell use it if shes in melee range, which is typically after her burst combo. **Yshtola: DPS/Sorceress** General AI behavior: plays like a typical black Mage. She can struggle during mechanics that requires movement but the AI will continue attacking during, such as Philias rotating stomps. **Input necessary** Appears to have the highest chance of picking her own target regardless of who you or Thancred are attacking. **Input necessary** Some of her spells may do AoE damage; it has been difficult to confirm. Tier 1 spell of the Seventh Dawn: Yshtola will cycle through every base elemental spell at the beginning of her general rotation. Tier 4 spell of the Seventh Dawn: when she finishes her tier 1 rotation, she will then use tier IV spells of every element. Foul of the Seventh Dawn: when she finished through every tier IV spell, she will finish with a foul. She will either restart her rotation or cast triple cast. Despite the name, uses Xenoglossys animation. Triple Cast + Fire IV of the Seventh Dawn x 3: Yshtolas burst rotation. She can use at any time, but most frequently after Foul of the Seventh Dawn. Will put her in the beginning of her general rotation. Even if Triple Cast wears off from doing mechanics, Yshtola will finish her Fire IVs unless a substantial amount of time passes with no casts. Swiftcast: requires lv 72. Yshtola will follow triple cast with swiftcast on occasion, granting her an extra Fire IV. This Fire IV will be cast even if swiftcast wears off from mechanics unless a substantial amount of time passes with no casts. **Minfilia/Ryne: DPS/Oracle of Light** General AI behavior: the most supportive DPS of the group. She is the least likely to use the limit break, even if youre not a DPS. Spinning Edge + Gust Slash + Aeolian Edge: Rynes General damage combo. Has the lowest uptime of the scions; she will auto a couple of times before restarting her general combo. Banish III + Dream within a Dream: Rynes burst combo. Banish III has a cast time. Dream within a Dream inflicts a damage down on the target. _May_ have a trigger as she will sometimes almost never use and other times she will use it frequently. Hide + Trick Attack: Ryne begins every battle with Hide. Afterward she will slowly walk to the first enemy and use Trick Attack, dealing damage and inflicting a 20s vulnerability up on the enemy. This move is a positional! Ryne will stay in hide until she can execute Trick Attack on the enemys rear, so shell be stuck if you or Thancred spin the boss too much. She doesnt appear to use this after the initial. **Afterthoughts** This is gonna take some time to update considering how finicky the AI can be, how much exp they need to level, and how the Scions do indeed unlock moves as they level. Apart from the fact some of their attacks are hard to catch (I know Alphinauds Carbuncle can give a damage buff, but Ive never seen it on the buff bar; only occasionally see it as it falls off). Will appreciate help if anyone notices something I havent covered or reached. Im currently leveling trusts across 3-4 jobs to make the exp gain at least somewhat efficient, so this is the primary reason it will take time for me to add stuff."
18,vulnerability,ffxiv,ATTN: New tanks doing EX/Savage/etc content with tank swaps,588,cezqem,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/cezqem/attn_new_tanks_doing_exsavageetc_content_with/,2019-07-19 09:08:04,"You **CAN** provoke before it finishes casting. I know that sounds odd to see your name on the boss when he's casting the tank buster that then initiates the tank swap.... but in actuality, the person he began the cast on will be the one to take the tank buster, not you. &amp;#x200B; ""But why does it matter then if I wait until after its done or before?"" &amp;#x200B; Some, if not most tank busters in content put a vulnerability of some form on the main tank. Something like water down, lightning down, physical down, etc that implies the tank is now rendered useless to mitigating most damage from the next attacks from the boss, that's what makes it a tank buster typically as well. Waiting until after its cast, risks the boss auto attacking the current tank just that little extra bit while you have an enormous vulnerability debuff on the person tanking. That sounds silly but when the tank buster eat 3/4 of the MT's health, then auto attacks are now dealing 1/4 every hit, it can easily cause your tank partner to wipe because you waited too late to swap. &amp;#x200B; Not only that, but it gives your current tank time to use ""Shirk"" before the cast is finished. This allows them to not have to wait to pop it and can more fluidly do so when they're popping their mitigation. Personally, when I MT, I like to see the name of the other tank before the tank buster cast goes off, that tells me I'm free to shirk them after I've already popped my mitigation and that they're ready to get into position. Its like when you book a reservation somewhere, its not ""required"" to call in a few minutes beforehand of the reservation, but it is very handy to do so an gives them prep time to ready for you, rather than just wrap up as soon as you get there. Don't be afraid to communicate this in the beginning of parties to ask when the person provokes too, it can only be to your benefit."

20,vulnerability,ffxiv,Make NIN Great Again,0,cl4o22,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/cl4o22/make_nin_great_again/,2019-08-03 00:14:33,"Wall of Text Alert! TLDR: Gust Slash Potency still too low~ Im sure youve seen the memes and they are certainly warranted. At this point its obvious how pointless NIN is to bring into raid, at least to the community. SE doesnt seem to know what to do to fix the job. It received the least amount of changes from the recent patch and truly needed them the most of any job. Its funny because I was so excited to hear about the NIN changes from ShB and on paper they sounded amazing. However, like many others getting to 80, I quickly realized thats not the case. In fact, it made me miss MCH 4.0. At least everyone knew how bad it was and immediately swapped or demanded changes. This doesnt seem to be the case for NIN in 5.0, sadly. So, I have a couple of ideas that could help the job legitimately. Please feel free to contribute or correct me. First thing I would change that might surprise everyone: Remove TA! Yes... the one and only utility NIN brings. It has run its course and now just holds NIN back. It sounds odd but think about it. What is the one thing that we justify leaving NIN as weak as it is? I propose changing Trick Attack to Sneak Attack. Remove the vulnerability down and change the potency to 1500, while leaving the positional and Suiton requirements. This would give NINs a guaranteed decent skill like most other dps. Second: The biggest problem people have with NIN is ping and its something SE has been struggling to resolve since the beginning. There is a simple solution no one is mentioning. Remove the third Ninjitsu - Jin! This change can be quite complex when you first think about it because 3 mudras have been the backbone of our class since it was created. Really though, it is not that bad. I believe they should upgrade Fuma Shuriken to Raiton or Katon depending on wether you use Ten or Chi through a passive skill at level 45, same level as Jin is. This change would also require changing the rest. List of mudra changes: Change Ten from Fuma Shuriken to Raiton - Passive Upgrade Change Chi from Fuma Shuriken to Katon - Passive Upgrade Remove Hyoton, Remove Doton, Change Huton to Chi &gt; Ten, Change Suiton to Ten &gt; Chi, Change Ten to Hyosho Ranryu - Available only during Kassatsu Change Chi to Goka Mekkayaki - Available only during Kassatsu The changes would be a lot to get used to at first and it would be sad to lose Doton but I do believe this is one the best ways to fix our ping issues. I would certainly appreciate not having to pay for a VPN to play my favorite class. But wait.. how would this change Ten Chi Jin? Honestly, this skill has been terrible since we first got it in SB. I dont have the best solution for it other than either allowing us to use it while moving or just remove it entirely. There are far too many situations where we have to move right after using the skill. It makes it awkward to use and should be revised ASAP. Third: Upgrade Bunshin! I really love the idea of Bunshin and on paper I believe most of the community feels the same way. However, when we finally get to use it we realize how bad it is. It basically replaces our duality without the same potency. This really needs to be addressed. Bunshin should mimic your exact damage, crit/dht/combo potency, all of it or its pointless. It only mimics our weaponskills base damage and barely provides any Ninki. Fourth: Upgrade our sustainability! This sounds like an odd request but what you may not know is that the longer a fight goes on the weaker NIN becomes. This is due to several things including our class being burst focused, the removal of venom, removal of slashing resistance down, our potencies, etc. I would really like to see Venom back in some form. Obviously NIN was broken with it in 2.4 and it should be revised. However, the removal of slashing resistance down has had a massive impact on our overall damage. Fifth and final on my mind: Change Shadow Fang Back! SB NIN had a few problems with Tin Ch Jin being up there but it was well received by the community. One of things that we got was a quality of life change with Shadow Fang. The dot was stacked with Dancing Edge. With the removal of Dancing Edge due to the removal of slashing resistance down we are now back to a two skill Shadow Fang. This feels absolutely terrible. My solution is to remove Shadow Fang and bring back Dancing Edge. Dancing Edge would apply the Shadow Fang effect. Another solution would be to make Shadow Fang combo off of Gust Slash instead of Spinning Edge but with upgraded potency. Having Shadow Fang on two skills again feels absolutely horrible and is a step backwards. There are quite a few changes I would like to see and I hope I provided a decent reason and solution. Truly, I want NIN to feel like an Assassin and I believe most that try the job feel the same way."
21,vulnerability,ffxiv,A bit of an oddity I just noticed while I've been learning to heal...,3,cmkhdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/cmkhdz/a_bit_of_an_oddity_i_just_noticed_while_ive_been/,2019-08-06 12:05:30,"So, apparently, the option in Character Configuration &gt; UI Settings &gt; HUD to ""Display only detrimental effects you inflict"" needs to be taken very literally! I've been using it for some time as both DPS and tank to make it easier to keep track of my own debuffs; no needing to worry about anyone else pinging the target with the same debuff and confusing me as to how much longer mine is lasting. There was a bit of an edge-case thing in Stormblood where the old piercing vulnerability debuff sometimes didn't seem to be applied because another dragoon in the party had applied it and overwritten mine, but that's hardly a problem in the end, just a glance at the party list to confirm that's what's happening. I've started leveling a healer - scholar, specifically - and I've noticed that apparently, it also doesn't show detrimental effects that you didn't inflict *on teammates.* On the actual buff/debuff bar, you can't see what debuffs your teammates have, because you didn't inflict them! Normally that's not really an issue; I can see their debuffs in the party list easily enough. However, where this has become an issue is in Alliance Raids. In the Alliance party frames, you can see when your alliance-mates get a debuff on them by the red down arrow that appears on their bar. However, there's no indication on this red arrow of what the debuff is or - more pertinently - whether it's cleansable. And of course, I can't click on them and find out, because I can't see what debuffs are on them! Alright, so, not a huge problem, just uncheck the option to only show my detrimental effects while healing... except then you end up with a run like the Mhach run I just did, where five of the healers were scholars. Five different stacks of Bio make it hard to tell if mine has fallen off at a glance :p Has anyone else run into this problem, and perhaps found a workaround? And does anyone else think it's a big enough issue to pester Squeenix about? It seems pretty edge-case but it surprised me that ""Display only detrimental effects you inflict"" didn't automatically exclude party members - what's the point of hiding debuffs you didn't inflict on party members when you're not inflicting debuffs on party members ever (that I can think of)?"

23,vulnerability,ffxiv,Idea for a Blue Mage rework.,0,bmrl94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/bmrl94/idea_for_a_blue_mage_rework/,2019-05-10 10:31:10,"Someone named Kalise posted an intresting take on a Blue Mage rework that I think they could easily do, it's a win win for everyone. I'll post a link in the comment if you want to read it yourself but here's the her idea. Blue Mage Redesign Idea This is an attempt to design a complete overhaul of BLU, so that it can incorporate both aspects of its design - Those being, a fun side activity where you go through irrelevant content and use OP skills to do silly things as well as being a relatively balanced but fresh take on the Mage role. The thread will discuss a plethora of things and will focus more on the ""Unlimited"" side of Blue Mage (Given that the ""Limited"" side needs little actual discussion... Since it's a case of add any ""Odd"" or ""Overpowered"" skills into it that allow it to be fun) and will address things such as Level Syncing, Skill Restrictions, Job Gauge as well as some core changes to existing skills. What will be the role of Blue Mage in a standard party? I see BLU being a supportive DPS type job in the same vein as RDM and SMN. With a few skills that can aid the party, but otherwise a focus on slinging spells at targets. Their gameplay will be unique from other Mages by having a focus on using short ranged spells (Thus having extra protection and mobility to allow them to stay with mDPS positioning) as well as utilizing oGCD spells with cast times to weave into their rotations. Firstly lets discuss some changes to existing skills: * All casted skills now have only 1 second cast times. This will allow weaving of skills much more easily. * Off-Guard and Bristle are now instant cast. Bristle is also oGCD now too but now has a 30s CD. * Instant-Kill and Petrify skills are now 50% chance to work up from (What seems to be) 1%. Restricted Actions and Level Syncing: In order to deal with separating out ""OP"" actions and issues involving Level Syncing when doing FATEs, Dungeons, Trials and Raids, there will be an update to the Blue Mage Spellbook. * Selecting a particular skill set up from the list, will also adjust your action bars too. Meaning when you save the skill set, it also saves your Action Bars. * There will now be an additional Skill Set that is call the ""Duty Set"". This set doesn't function like the other sets and instead, will have its 24 slots locked behind job levels. In addition, these 24 spell slots aren't as malleable as with the other 5 sets, in them you can only select specific types of skill from the ones you have available. * Unlocking the Duty Set will be done by a Quest at level 50, which will task you to seek out skills that would fill it out. It will have steps which will take you through the 17 skill slots a level 50 character would fill out (With steps being skipped if you already have relevant skills learned) After unlocking this Duty Set, you will be able to access FATEs and Duty Finder. * When queuing up for Duty Finder and entering a non-Undersized duty, you will automatically be swapped to your ""Duty Set"" * When encountering a FATE if you Level Sync, you will also equip your Duty Set. If the FATE is the same level as you and you don't have your Duty Set equipped, there will be a button (Like with the Level Sync one) to allow you to swap to your Duty Set. Before unlocking your Duty Set, you cannot interact with FATEs. Enemies from them will ignore you and you will get an error if you try to attack them (With the first time having a pop up to tell you about the Duty Set) The Duty Set will be structured something like this: Level 1) Single Target Filler Examples: Water Cannon, Thunder Dart, Blaze Blast, Ice Beam, Dust Storm, Gale Missile, Sharpened Knife, Snipethoom, Rock Throw. These will be 100 potency GCD actions with instant cast and 2.5s Reuse. Their purpose is to be skills used while moving when casted actions are thus unavailable. Level 2) oGCD Filler Example Mind Blast. These will be 100 potency oGCD actions with 1s cast time and 2.5s Reuse. Their purpose is to be weaved inbetween GCD actions while other more potent oGCD skills are unavailable. Level 4) Damage Boost Example: Off-Guard Level 6) GCD Filler Example: Glower, Plaincracker, Bubble Shower, Flamethrower, Drill Cannons Level 10) Combo Starter Example: The Ram's Voice, Aqua Breath, Heat Breath, Stone Breath These will be standard 150 potency GCD skills that will instead of having CC effects will apply an elemental debuff such as ""Ice"", ""Water"", ""Fire"".

Where, whenever they cast a spell, they attune to that element and then get a boost on their next spell of the complementary element. For example, using an Ice skill makes your next Fire spell leave a DoT effect for a percentage of its damage. Which then makes your next Wind spell deal bonus damage, which then make your next Ice skill have additional critical strike rate etc. The major difference with this gauge from the Magia Board, is it will also include Physical damage types too, which will have their own combo system too (So you can play Physical damage BLU as well as Magical BLU) Now, as I mentioned prior, Combo finishers will interact uniquely with this gauge, where they will always benefit from the enhanced element effect as well as shift the Gauge into their respective element. This will allow you to play around with different skill set ups to weave in multiple elements or damage types, or to simply maximize a particular smaller set of damage types. Depending on which skills you have learned and equipped."
24,vulnerability,ffxiv,"So is BRD the replacement for Protect now? (RIP protect, 5.0 speculation)",0,bsb2qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/bsb2qm/so_is_brd_the_replacement_for_protect_now_rip/,2019-05-24 11:39:58,"So what we know: - protect is gone - so far we know only tanks have an aoe defense buff - passive crit buff is gone - songs reworked - I didnt get the part about wardens paean due to the sound issue, but it has some relevance in the changes. - BRD is aoe buffer, DNC is single target buffer - the leaks are mostly true  Now, to restate it, the leaks happened to be mostly true. One of the most interesting leaks that caught my attention, was that Troubadour is permanent. So what does that mean for BRDs role in a party? Well, Troubadours focus is on defensive vulnerability buffs and an HP buff. And with protect being no longer; BRDs role of defense bolstering is that much more important. The same way DNC has curing waltz to help mitigate damage with a short range aoe heal.  Now, assuming this is the case; that means 2 things will likely happen: 1. They combine physical and magical vulnerability into 1 song, and give a new defensive buff (maybe a parry buff or something?), or have 1 song be intermission as a dps buff. 2. Because troubadour will be permanent, its most likely they will reduce its effectiveness by even half. Making it slightly weaker than protect. Now this would be really unique, and totally keep BRDs place as a must have/competition to DNC, as they could even re-invent Battle Voice to double the effects of these defense buffs. Im sure now that our dps buff will be pushed onto foe requiem (though I feel as though were maybe getting a haste song? Based on the animation of one of the skills in the job ability preview?) we will have also another addition of utility to make up for the potential loss of palisade. As they want ranged dps to be interrupters to enemy spells.  With the lite confirmation of the leak; Overall I am hypothesizing that BRD will be Protects perfect replacement and the most wanted support. And put support role will still be a must for end game content (because screw DNC). And based on the overall view of Yoshidas hot bar, despite DNC having a 30% crit buff, BRD has FAR more dps opportunity making it more wanted in plenty of content. o/ let me know what yall think about this. And as a final note, DNC or BRD? Who will be more popular in this next expansion?"
25,vulnerability,ffxiv,How to avoid wipes in Alexander raids (Normal modes),42,blrnc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/blrnc0/how_to_avoid_wipes_in_alexander_raids_normal_modes/,2019-05-08 00:53:54,"So I had planned to do this little list after I had to wipe the Kirschfaust encounter in DF in a lunchbreak during the free login. That was 2 weeks back but I actually took those 2 weeks distance from PC/TV etc screens at all so excuse it if anyone was waiting. My initial idea was to do actual guides for all Alex turns but by now I think it might be better to break down to mechanics that actually make you wipe (and are not super common AoE markers) so this list will skip quite a lot of mechanics and partly even bosses. Please note that this is from memory and hence might be partly incorrect. For me it has been almost 2 years since I ran most them. Also I am a reddit formatting noob. I am open to any correction suggestions. **Alexander 1, The Fist of the Father:** Remember to split the two bosses else they get damage up stacks and easy mechanics will just wipe the group. **Alexander 4, The Burden of the Father:** The two healers should get out of the group and apart from each other during Judgement Nisi cast. If the red and blue DoT land on the same person a possibly (might be able to out gear it but havent tested) the group wiping AoE will happen. **Alexander 5, The Fist of the Son:** The electricity thing in the middle of the room activates the two syringes when someone stands on it. You need the red puddle to have someone transform into a gorilla when Bombs Away gets cast, the Gorilla can push the Bomb away from the group so the explosion wont hit the group. The Purple puddle transforms into birds, you should do that when the boss uses Boost else everyone gets quite a lot Vulnerability up stacks. You may want to tankswap during Concussions since the maintank receves a Stun and wont be able to use CD for the tankbuster. **Alexander 6, The Cuff of the Son:** Brawler (second miniboss): Tankswap at roughly 3 stacks it gets else very hurtful to handle for tank/healers. Vortexer: Tankswap as with Brawler, also make sure to freeze the water pillar so you can hide behind it (opposite side to where Vorty is/LoS it) when he casts Ultra Flash. **Alexander 8, The Burden of the Son:** Kill the 4 adds during Onslaughter before they explode, the cast to summon them is Execution. During Brute Justice keep in mind that he will do some linear or cone AoE whenever he turns around to the group. Just get behind him to avoid Vulnerabilty up stacks or instant death. **Alexander 9, The Eyes of the Creator:** The base mechanic of this boss is that he tries to Reconstruct itself. Each add he absorbs will help it and therefore make it for the party harder. To avoid its reconstruction you want to have adds fall into the lava. To get adds fall into lava you need to kill them in the quarter of the room where orange arrows indicate that lava will appear soon. To temporary reactivate the adds, so that you can move them, a generator needs to be picked up and placed in range of them. Adds will tether to whomever had the generator and follow this person. Adds that are still alive when the lava appears will explode for roomwide (possibly wiping) damage. This means the idea is to reactivate adds  lure them to lava ground  kill them ASAP Note: in NM you ignore the first adds since their corpses already are on ground where lava will appear. Also try to be right behind the boss during Scrapline, it hurts a lot. **Alexander 10, The Breath of the Creator:** Highest chance to die here is to die of laughter when you enter the first time and figure this one out. Prepare to raise a lot. **Alexander 11, The Heart of the Creator:** Dodge a lot and stay in range of the healers (this used to be the main reason of wipes... when people were out of AoE healrange). During Whirlwind LoS the skill coming from the boss. **Alexander 12, the Soul of the Creator:** Dodge Sacrament by not standing in the direction of the white (very visible) lines he summons, the AoE is linear from those into both directions. After every time stop he will cast a sacrament, so make sure to look for the boss (who teleports to a random direction) fast and adjust your position to not get hit. During Timegates make sure enough players follow the adds to the past and kill those ASAP. And dont forget the tank LB during the transition (you will know when) use it at about 3s."
26,vulnerability,ffxiv,The Blue Mage Retrospective,67,b41fhh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/b41fhh/the_blue_mage_retrospective/,2019-03-22 17:06:43,"I think that it's been a good few weeks and that this is probably the best time to make a post that's completely independent of first impressions and can be as objective as possible. **The Beginning** Among the past four years of my life in Final Fantasy XIV, being someone who has participated in most all content, ranging from being an [avid minion collector](URL leading me to play almost all content, as well as a [Savage Raider](URL very little actually inspires quite as much emotion in me as Blue Mage does. To give some background, I've also enjoyed past Final Fantasy games to quite an extent, Final Fantasy V being my favourite, and Blue Mage being my favourite Job. I was captivated by how, above all else, its spells were unique - an untraditional method to attain highly effective results. I used White Wind instead of a dedicated healer, and it provided one of the most unique experiences I've ever had in an RPG. As a result, I naturally came to long for Blue Mage in Final Fantasy XIV. I speculated on how it might reasonably be any role, ranging from being a Tank, a Healer, or, matching its support capabilities and damage, a physical ranged - but, regardless, one of my favourite pastimes was pondering all of the possibilities and realising that, probably about no matter what, I'd love how it'd be. And then comes the Las Vegas Fan Festival, where I'm just about fucking dying as it is when the CEO came out in that Blue Mage outfit, and then I see the gorgeous Artifact armour, actually learning the spells (I thought this was then a unique leveling method), the kind of spells used, the absolute fucking swagger and style that Blue Mage radiated. When I saw ""available in Patch 3.5,"" my throat was already sore from screaming, but my heart sank a little bit when I saw ""Limited Job"" with no other details, and being Level 50 locked. Needless to say, the next day's Live Letter made me feel like I was in the goddamn Twilight Zone. I had all of these thoughts about Blue Mage, the clear-but-unclear, hopeful vision in my mind, and I was sitting here being told that the Job couldn't use the Duty Finder and wasn't designed for party play. I couldn't actually believe that they were pulling this shit in the name of ""Job identity"" or whatever. I completely dreaded the time leading up to its release, and, as it turned out, my fears were beyond confirmed. **""""""""Job Identity""""""""** It's fairly understandable that the developers didn't want to compromise on Blue Mage having distinct ability-gaining in comparison to other Jobs, as it iconically does in most Final Fantasy games. What isn't understandable is how this had to come at the cost of having a classic Final Fantasy Job in real content. Initially, even before release, we could immediately compare this claim to other Jobs already in the game, and the following observations can immediately be made: * Red Mage isn't a Healer/DPS hybrid * Paladin doesn't have major healing capabilities * Dark Knight doesn't sacrifice its HP for unique abilities * White Mage has actual damaging spells (beyond undead) and isn't just a healslut, as in most games * Bard has a fucking bow and is still heavily damage-focused * Summoner doesn't summon massive deity-like beings for literally every attack etc. The general point is, Jobs in the game aren't 1:1 copies of their past incarnations, and in most instances, that's really pretty cool - the feel of the Job is often preserved, and even improved upon. Paladin uses a combination of sword, shield, and divine magic for fucking crusading; Dark Knight still feels like it's as angsty and pure-aggressive while still ultimately fighting for good (directly akin to Cecil); Red Mage has a perfect balance of black magic, white magic (as defined in this game, with Stone and Aero spells, and even Cure and Raise as utilities), and swordplay; Bard still embraces support without making the player feel like a buffslut and nothing more. Some might say that Summoner is a downgrade, but in many regards, it's at least, in this expansion, still heavily focused on channeling primal power. The developers claim that Blue Mage's identity was being stupid overpowered and just breaking the game, but in a lot of ways, especially as you're just progressing through the game, Blue Mage is really just different - it has offense and support, but with certain caveats. White Wind needed certain amounts of HP to even be effective, a lot of offensive magic fell off in effectiveness as you progressed, were locked between AOE or single-target, etc. Blue Mage could have fit perfectly as, for example, a physical ranged DPS archetype (perhaps fulfilling the general party role, providing notable damage buffs to the party and mitigating incoming damage, and Blue Mage's large support focus), focused on maybe weirder and less orthodox effects based on pasting together the general concept of various monster abilities. Blue Mage could even potentially fulfill this role, but just deal magical damage, making it an interesting party dynamic. Here's some potential concepts: 1) Eruption is generally a targetted circular AOE attack, and most primal attacks have some sort of Vulnerability Up attached. What if this was Blue Mage's equivalent of Hypercharge or Foe Requiem, attacking the target and applying a Vulnerability Up to target and nearby enemies, using that exact same ""1"" icon that it uses on the players? 2) Peculiar Light could be a Magic Vulnerability Up, just like it is now. 3) Mighty Guard could be much akin to Troubadour. 4) White Wind could even be a high-cooldown Raid heal - perhaps single-target for balancing purposes - somehow based on the Blue Mage's HP, which gives Blue Mage a completely and utterly unique position. 5) Off-Guard could effectively be Blue Mage's self-buff (like Heavy Thrust or Straight Shot), but you know, actually fucking deal damage and be unique in that it has to be on a particular target. And yes, many of these ideas can potentially be unbalanced, but not all of them need to be implemented, and the effectiveness of buffs / debuffs and Blue Mage's personal damage could absolutely be adjusted to be in-line with other Jobs, while, again, perfectly hitting that ""weird"" niche that Blue Mage always fills. **Blue Mage As It Is** **Leveling** Being curt, the Blue Mage leveling experience is absolutely not enjoyable. It's like an extreme version of playing old Lancer - for most of it, you're literally spamming one button infinitely against single targets, and you typically learn spells quickly enough, and the spells are sparse enough, that you're spending most of your time mindlessly running around and killing shit (of course, assuming you're not using the exploit, which you honestly should do). Killing something instantly with 1,000 Needles is amusing the first few times, but isn't for the next thirty levels. Enemies mostly have no mechanics and die too quickly to do anything, even if they did. There's no defense for this, it's beyond vapid and has no value. **Learning** Then there's learning, which is also a complete shitshow, given that the best way to learn spells is to not play the game. Everyone's done the 2:2 Dungeon parties or 4:4 Trial parties where half the party are on a real, Level 70 Job and the other two are on Blue Mage, with the players mutually carrying each other to the spell. This means that half your Blue Mage learning time at Level 50, the way to obtain almost every spell, is spent 1) not playing the game, and 2) not playing Blue Mage. I don't think that I need to discuss why this is dumb. Some might argue that doing it with complete Blue Mage parties is fun enough to warrant the slower rates of clearing and thus, learning, but even that is questionable. Most players are too dumb to even consider doing this in Party Finder to begin with, requiring a dedicated group of players for something that is largely treated as a side activity, and the rates are absolutely not scaled for this kind of play - your kill speeds go down so radically without the Level 70s, and with the spell acquisition rate being as low as it is, particularly on Extreme Trials, you could very well fucking never get many spells if you were trying to do things the ""expected"" way. Taking a full day to maybe learn a spell like this - one with overall minor benefit - is ridiculous when this is, again, largely a side activity that is not actually difficult or engaging in the slightest, and that many players who play this game probably barely have time to even play. Also it's retarded that it's RNG-based when they go on so much about ""preserving Job identity"" when it was never like this before, instead of developing a different, potentially actually challenging or engaging method of attaining the spells and making them feel like a reward - they're basically the equivalent of max Item Level gear for Blue Mage. **Masked Carnivale** This is not a suitable replacement for Blue Mage to have as endgame content. Orbonne Monastery is a great example of good example content. It has mechanics that can be difficult to execute and organise, just enough so that they feel satisfying to complete. They have mechanics that you can often improve on over time and push out a little more from yourself every week (like greeding on Agrias shields), constantly needing to pay attention to live, but, ultimately, being forgiving enough that mistakes are still fine. It's fun, it's engaging, and it's always a genuine pleasure to do. The reason I put that shit there is for comparison, as the Masked Carnivale is ""endgame"" that's like [playing a word shape puzzle.](URL 1) Identify if it's weak to Instant Death or any elements 2) Abuse one or both of the above until enemy is of a sufficient HP value, Silence / Stun spam on anything it casts if it's vulnerable, dodge AOEs (like literally any other content in this game) 3) Hyperbuff Final Sting or Self-Destruct and win Yeah, there are the occasional ones with unique mechanics, like the bomb pushing one, but those are still fairly simple as it is, and then every other one just devolves into the above categories. And while the Weekly Targets can very occasionally provide some variation, they're scarcely an improvement - clearing within a certain amount of time (one that's easily done with all actions), using only certain spells (the rotation's fairly Lightning-focused so it's largely just shifting / unbinding some primal abilities or changing Glower to something else), physical-only (change Glower to Drill Cannon), etc. Even the achievement ones don't take much time at all, with Perfect Blue mostly being a muscle memory exercise. **Conclusion** In a general sense, I find Blue Mage to likely be the least thought-through piece of content to ever be added to the game. Every part of it feels like an insult, to being touted as a real Job at first and then pulling a fucking bait-and-switch with it being a minigame, to RNG learning, to the Masked Carnivale making me feel like I'm in preschool, to having such fucking gorgeous Artifact gear that I can't use in any actual content. **Side Notes** (and stuff that didn't fully fit into other categories xd) * The rotation feels abhorrent. Having everything have a cast time makes Blue Mage feel like a much, much worse version of old Level 60 Bard. It makes every little thing you do as Blue Mage just that much painful and frustrating when the flow of the rotation is genuinely nonexistent. It's designed so that you can reasonably take stuff out when you need to for Masked Carnivale, but then that kinda just makes you feel empty inside when the really satisfying parts of your rotation are stripped from you. It's like if they challenged you to just not use Assize or Sidewinder or Dragonfire Dive or Inner Release - it's obviously a damage penalty, but it feels more like a fun penalty. * There are probably other topics that I could still respond to in the comments, Blue Mage is a pretty vast subject, if this almost 13,000-character post somehow implied the opposite **Actually Positive Things** * Job quests are actually really cool. Having a New World Job is legitimately really interesting, and the New World lore in general is great. It was actually a very unexpected treat. The characters felt like they had some depth to their motivations, and while the main antagonist was still a dick, it at least felt like he had reasons. * Again, the [Artifact gear is gorgeous, it's my favourite set in the game.](URL * Using certain abilities feels really good, animation-wise. Mountain Buster feels like it misses a bit of weight that the original had, but Shock Strike's an unexpected joy and the pose and explosion of Eruption are genuinely incredible. Glower even feels like a cool choice for the generic spam-spell (same function as Ruin but feels way better). * Spell descriptions are some fun lore. What really disappoints me, in the end, is how all of these are aesthetic or otherwise just non-gameplay based. Blue Mage is really beautiful when you ignore everything mechanical about it."

I think beastmaster should go the easy of pokemon where beastmaster's weaken an enemy and capture it with an tetherball. It's essence is recorded into your soul or whatever lore thing they come up with. In battle, beastmasters should be able to transconfigure into any of the beasts they have captured and acquire all of their skills and perks. Easiest example is palace of the dead, transconfigure into a succubus for the 5x vulnerability and then transconfigure into whatever else helps the group. I'm sure it would go the way of BLU and be OP but I'd play around with it. "

Ive raided quite often as a tank. Cleared a ton of fights. Active since original 2.0. So Ive seen and done a lot, and I know DPS is incredibly important, especially with getting high parses being such a big deal. Lately Ive been doing Seiryu farming for some weapons (not raiding this tier per my static breaking) and Ive found people struggle quite a bit on that fight. Farm groups will have amazing DPS but people die left and right. Clearing for a totem is honestly sometimes up in the air because people will die so much (especially in final phase). Then enter the group I just got done with. We hit final fifth element cast for enrage 4/4 times. And we cleared 4/4. The groups DPS was abysmal compared to most groups Ive joined, but Id be lying if I said it wasnt the most mechanically sound group Ive farmed with so far. Around 1 death per run, and vulnerability stacks almost non existent. It was an extremely competent group of players. I know having high DPS and being mechanically sound arent mutually exclusive, but I feel some people want their DPS parses to be so good theyll cheese more than they should. Or they focus on their DPS more than an upcoming mechanic. Finding groups who are actually mechanically sound give me more confidence than those who have orange parses but are trying to force so much theyre hit by nearly everything (Ive seen it). Figured Id bring this up for discussion, because honestly I feel like the community lacks in mechanical skill in this game, and I consider that my strong point (where as my DPS is a 40-50th percentile average). Im curious of the communities thought on mechanical sound skill compared to DPS? Do you expect both? Which would you prefer if you had to pick?"

Once we are happy with this, I will remove this introduction accordingly. ___ Hi, welcome to a beginners job overview as of patch 4.4. The goal of this guide is to help you make an informed decision on what job(s) to play as you journey through FFXIV. This guide will split the jobs into 5 major categories based on distinct role archetypes, and provide a comprehensive overview of each jobs playstyle, strengths, and weaknesses, rotation, as well as any notable quirks. Note that each pros and cons will be taken within the context of each of these said categories. ___ ### Tanks Takes hits for the team via their high defense and an array of defensive cooldowns. Tanking in FFXIV is more methodical than reactionary. They are in charge of positioning enemies and surviving scripted tank busters &amp; mechanics, all while trying to squeeze out as much damage as possible. Tanks all have a defensive stance and an offensive stance. The goal is to use defensive stances only as necessary, since they reduce damage output and disable certain offensive abilities. ___ #### Paladin (PLD) - Available from the beginning as Gladiator ___ ##### Overview: The classic sword and board tank. Excels at providing support to allies with holy magic. ##### Pros: - Strongest party-wide mitigation with [Passage of Arms](URL and [Divine Veil](URL - Best at co-tank support with [Cover](URL and [Intervention](URL - Access to a shield that passively blocks damage. ##### Cons: - Worst snap-aggro generation - Cannot initiate pulls without taking a heavy penalty in opener damage output - No gap closer - Worst aoe damage output - Switching between tank/damage stances is clunkier, as they are tied to the Global Cooldown (GCD) ##### Special notes: - Paladins have powerful defensive cooldowns with very lengthy recast timers, but can rely on their extremely good on-demand CD [Sheltron](URL to fill the gaps - Requires an above average amount of keybinds/hot bars to play their kit effectively due to many situational abilities - The only tank with a powerful ranged attack, [Holy Spirit](URL [Hallowed Ground](URL can bypass certain mechanics that other immunities cannot ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Alternate between physical combos and Holy Spirit spam - Has a Damage over Time (DoT) that is naturally maintained through rotation - Static rotation, and complexity comes from effectively managing utility skills ___ #### Warrior (WAR) - Available from the beginning as Marauder ___ ##### Overview: The axe-wielding, offensive tank. Does comparatively more damage than its counterparts by roughly [(4-5%)](URL and the preferred pull tank currently. ##### Pros: - Higher damage output - Stances are off Global Cooldown (oGCD) - Loses the least amount of dps when pulling via the help of [Unchained](URL and strong aggro tools. - Best gap closer option - Party shield ([Shake it Off](URL has a short 90 seconds cool down - Ability to put up slashing debuff with [Maim](URL ##### Cons: - On-demand mitigation [Inner Beast](URL is tied to the tank stance ([Defiance](URL - Tank stance does not offer direct mitigation, and the bonus healing only works for healing spells, not abilities. - No co-tank support ability ##### Special notes: - Invulnerability skill, [Holmgang](URL has a relatively short cool, but has some usage restrictions - Semi-nuanced gauge management with [Enhanced Infuriate](URL and [Deliverance](URL crit bonus ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Lowest CPM of all tanks - 10 second burst windows every 90 seconds via [URL - One damage buff to maintain - Heavily punished for messing up burst window ___ #### Dark Knight (DRK) - Requires access to Ishgard in Heavensward expansion and start at level 30 ___ ##### Overview: The personal mitigation tank that uses greatswords. Excels in fights with heavy magic damage. ##### Pros: - [The Blackest Night](URL is the overall best on-demand tank mitigation, and can be used to shield co-tank or another party member - [Dark Mind](URL lets the player mitigate magic damage extremely frequently ##### Cons: - No party-wide shield - Dark Mind does nothing for physical damage so its strength is very encounter specific ##### Special Notes: - High CPM due to the amount of [Dark Arts](URL spam - Double resource management with mana and blood - Absolutely stellar at tanking dungeon mobs with its aoe kit once max level ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Primarily only uses one combo weapon-skill set - Empower various abilities with Dark Arts - Requires frequent weaving and double weaving (act of putting ogcds between gcds) due to the sheer amount of Dark Arts usage - Resource management is key in dealing damage during buff windows while still being able to use The Blackest Night as necessary ___ ### Healers Keeps the party alive through healing and resurrection. Simpler damage abilities to compensate for the added healing responsibilities. Healers in FFXIV are not meant for sustained healing. They rely primarily on their oGCDs to counteract predictable incoming damage while maximizing their damage uptime, contrary to many other MMO titles. ___ #### White Mage (WHM) - Available from the beginning as Conjurer ___ ##### Overview: The most straight-forward, regen based healer. Has overall high potency damage and healing GCDs, and relatively low mobility. ##### Pros: - Great mana management tools like [Thin Air](URL and [Assize](URL - Large variety of aoe healing options - Mana efficient GCD heals - [Holy](URL is an excellent aoe tool, especially for dungeons. ##### Cons: - No party wide mitigation abilities - Very few instant cast spells, so weaving and movement windows are critically limited - No party damage utility ##### Special notes: - The most beginner friendly healing job, and is the only one you can choose from the start (CNJ -&gt; WHM) - The developer have commented about reworking the current job gauge, lilies, as it is currently not a useful/reliable resource to aid with the job's performance ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Two dots to maintain - Throw rocks ___ #### Scholar (SCH) - Available from the beginning as Arcanist, which is a dps role until obtaining the job change at level 30. Shares levels with the Summoner (SMN) job ___ ##### Overview: Pet-based, shield centric, tactical healer with incredible flexibility and strong mitigation tools. An integral part of the SCH kit involves gathering Aether charges with [Aetherflow](URL and using unique abilities that consume them. ##### Pros: - Incredibly potent oGCDs options - Great mana management thanks to [Aetherflow](URL and [Energy Drain] - Great mobility by being able to substitute primary dps spell with instant cast spells - Pet ability [Embrace](URL is the best regen tool available - [Chain Stratagem](URL and to a lesser extent, [Fey Wind](URL provide offensive party support ##### Cons: - Relatively expensive and inefficient GCD heals - Pet management controls can be clunky ##### Special notes: - Suffers more from button bloat than most other jobs in the game - The most powerful skills all cost an aetherflow stack to use. Smart usage of resources is needed to be effective ##### Rotation and Playstyle: - Two dots to maintain - Spam broil - Uses an arsenal of aetherflow abilities to mitigate/heal/deal damage at a set pace. ___ #### Astrologian (AST) - Requires access to Ishgard in Heavensward expansion and start at level 30 ___ ##### Overview: Time-mage inspired, versatile healer with powerful party buffs via the use of its unique card system ##### Pros: - Best raid dps increase buffs in the game - High mobility due to [Light Speed](URL and short primary dps GCD cast time ([Malefic](URL - Offer some mitigation with [Collective Unconscious](URL and shields in [Nocturnal Sect](URL ##### Cons: - Semi-dependent on rng to draw the right cards - Tend to struggle more with mana due to worse mana management tools - The most powerful aoe healing ability, [Earthly Star](URL requires planning and party cooperation to be effective - Slightly weaker aoe damage options in dungeons ##### Special Notes: - Can be both regen or shield based healer based on stances ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Only one, high duration dot to maintain ([Combust](URL - Malefic spam has 1 weaving window to facilitate card play, unlike broil or stone which has none ___ ### Melee DPS All jobs in this category excel at dishing out damage up close. They have combo attacks that have positional bonuses when used from the flank or rear. Melee dps roles are highly mobile, and mastering them requires being comfortable using that mobility to maintain uptime and proper rotation on targets. ___ #### Dragoon (DRG) - Available from the beginning as Lancer ___ ##### Overview: Supportive spear wielding dps. Specialized in flashy jump attacks and long but slow combo chains. Offer great party damage utilities ##### Pros: - Critically, the only job in the game that can apply a piercing debuff for piercing damage (bards, machinists, and red mages can benefit from this) - Can boost party dps with [Battle Litany](URL and [Dragon Sight](URL ##### Cons: - Lower end in personal dps (pdps) - Jumps ([Jump](URL | [Spineshatter Dive](URL | [Dragonsong Dive](URL have animation locks that prevent the character from moving for a short period ##### Special Notes: - [Blood for Blood](URL can sometimes mean taking lethal damage from unavoidable attacks - [Blood of the Dragon](URL is an essential buff maintained by performing combos, losing it will be detrimental to a dragoons dps ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle - A fixed, 11-GCD rotation with a fair dose of positional requirements - Slowest GCD among all melee dps, but has numerous ogcds for single &amp; double weaving ___ #### Ninja (NIN) - Available after reaching level 10 on another job, and picking up the quest: [My First Daggers](URL in Limsa ___ ##### Overview: High utility, dagger-wielding dps with a unique mudra/sign system to rapidly create [Ninjutsu](URL spells on the fly ##### Pros: - [Trick Attack](URL increase targets damage taken by 10% for 10 seconds every 60 seconds, providing huge raid dps (rdps) increase when coordinated properly - [Shade Walker](URL and [Smoke Screen](URL are great tools to aid in aggro management, and even open up more damage centric openers on tanks Provides slashing debuff ##### Cons: - Level 70 ability [Ten Chi Jin](URL is potent, but requires user to be stationary for an extended period of time - Lower pdps vs most other dps jobs in the game, so contribution will be heavily hinged on proper utility usage ##### Special Notes: - Heavily punished by ping and/or failing the rear-positional on Trick Attack - Fast GCDs thanks to [Huton](URL ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Only three positional attacks - One simple tri-hit combo with 3 different finishers - Heavy amount of weaving with oGCDs and mudras ___ #### Monk (MNK) - Available from the beginning as Pugilist ___ ##### Overview: High damage, positional oriented melee dps using fist weapons. Has fast GCDs thanks to the maintenance of [Greased Lightning](URL Has a non-traditional combo system by having each weapon skill shift the form the monk is in, opening up different weapons skills in the process. ##### Pros: - 2nd highest pdps melee - Minor physical damage party buff via [Brotherhood](URL - Offer bonus party healing with [Mantra](URL ##### Cons: - On the lower end for utility ##### Special Notes: - Failing to manage the Greased Lightning buff during an encounter is generally pretty detrimental to damage output - One of the busiest jobs during downtime due to [Meditation](URL and [Form Shift](URL to help manage resources - Can be considered the hardest melee job at the highest level due to how complex it is to use [Tornado Kick](URL properly ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle - Mostly fast GCDs and constant shifting between the flank and rear, as every single-target weapon skill has positional bonuses - Has a slower phase with [Riddle of Fire](URL ___ #### Samurai (SAM) - Available once level 50 on another job and own the Stormblood expansion - [The Way of the Samurai](URL ___ ##### Overview: The katana-wielding, selfish dps. Provides next no utility but has the highest damage potential vs other melee roles. ##### Pros: - Great personal damage output - Good mobility - Only two weapon skills with positional requirements - Powerful aoe options ##### Cons: - Only utility is the ability to put up slashing debuff, which two other jobs have access to - TP dependent for aoe, especially at lower levels ##### Special Notes: - Only melee that has a skill with cast time, [Iaijutsu](URL ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle - Has multiple opener combinations based on skill speed stats and encounter timings - Generates two unique resources, Sen &amp; Kenki, by executing the three different weapon skill combos - Iaijutsu has three different effects based on the number of Sen consumed Kenki is primarily used to fuel oGCD attacks ___ ### Physical Ranged Dps Specializes in dealing damage from afar, while being some of the most mobile jobs in the game. Both available jobs provide powerful utility tools for the party, such as [Palisade](URL to reduce incoming physical damage, and restore mana through [Refresh](URL ___ #### Bard (BRD) - Available from the beginning as Archer ___ ##### Overview: Bow-wielding dps with powerful supportive tools. Primarily a DoT based job with a multitude of proc based offensive skills to unleash a barrage of attacks onto enemies. ##### Pros: - Being ranged and having only one skill with a cast time, bard can basically move about the battlefield without restrictions - Offensive utilities include increasing party crit rate through songs, direct hit rate with [Battle Voice](URL and enemy damage taken with [Foe Requiem](URL - Defensively, they can increase the effective HP of the party via [Troubadour](URL dispel selective debuffs with [Warden's Paean](URL and increase target's healing taken by spells through [Nature's Minne](URL ##### Cons: - The only source of piercing debuff is locked behind a DRG's [Disembowel](URL which plays a critical role in a bard's personal damage output ##### Special Notes: - Personal damage output is also more heavily hinged on party composition and gear than average due to the job's heavy synergy with offensive utilities and crit rate - Usually tasked with handling more mechanics vs other dps due to its superior mobility and the ability to attack from afar ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - A loose rotation composed of three distinct song phases - Dynamic gameplay due to the high numbers of proc based abilities the player have to micromanage - Highest average cast per minute of any job when played at a higher level (mid to high 40s / minute) ___ #### Machinist (MCH) - Requires access to Ishgard in Heavensward expansion and start at level 30 ___ ##### Overview: Burst damage style ranged dps using firearms. Has a turret to help deal single target or aoe damage. ##### Pros: - Super mobile - [Dismantle](URL is a strong mitigation tool - [Hypercharge](URL on your [turrets](URL give a vulnerability debuff on targets hit ##### Cons: - Punished quite harshly for messing up its strict 1-minute rotation cycles. - Ping and raid composition dependent to do optimal rotation/damage ##### Special Notes: - The rotation changes completely once max level via the use of [Flamethrower](URL to enter overheat window - Developers have spoken about reworking the job significantly in the next expansion ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - One of the most rigid and strict rotations of any job - The rotation revolves around the skill [Wildfire](URL that amplifies all damage dealt by the user during its 10-second duration, so the player is tasked to fit in as much damage as possible during that window - The other resources, ammo and heat, are all used to support the wildfire window to maximize its damage ___ ### Caster DPS High damage magic attackers. All three caster jobs have a varying amount of cast time to limit their mobility, and have ways to reduce incoming magic damage through the use of [Addle](URL and [Apocatastasis](URL They can also transfer their mana to an ally with [Manashift](URL Summoners and Red Mages are also capable of reviving downed players during battle ___ #### Red Mage (RDM) - Available once level 50 on another job and own the Stormblood expansion - [Taking the Red](URL ___ ##### Overview: The ranged &amp; melee caster hybrid. The red mage uses black &amp; white magic to build up mana in order to unleash a powerful melee combo with a rapier against foes. Every other spells that has a cast time normally will be instant, thanks to its unique mechanic, [Dualcast](URL ##### Pros: - Grants party damage utility through [Embolden](URL - Can heal players with [Vercure](URL and revive them with [Verraise](URL - With the help of Dualcast, a red mage can revive players more rapidly than any other job in the game ##### Cons: - Lowest personal dps among the three available damage caster roles - [Displacement](URL requires a large safe space to execute and has a lengthy animation lock, so using it incorrectly can lead to positioning problems or death ##### Special Notes: - Only mana recovery tool is through the role action [Lucid Dreaming](URL so overspending mana on expensive spells like Verraise or being revived without LD available can lead to awkward situations - Generally considered the easiest dps job in the game, as there is no buffs/debuffs to upkeep, and recover from death well due to its simplicity. ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Black and white magic are used to build up mana, while oGCDs are woven behind Dualcast windows - The rotation is dynamic and priority-based due to certain spells locked behind procs - Mana is consumed to fire off enchanted melee combo attacks that lead up to a powerful magic finisher based on black &amp; white mana balance ([Verholy](URL | [Verflare](URL ___ #### Summoner (SMN) - Available from the beginning as Arcanist, and shares levels with the SCH job ___ ##### Overview: Dot based caster with burst phases and pets.

Highest damage potential in the game at the cost of having no utility and relatively restricted mobility. ##### Pros: - Highest potential dps job in the game - Recovers mana quickly via [Umbral Ice](URL so death is not as punishing - Great burst aoe damage ##### Cons: - No party utility aside from role actions - No ability to revive downed teammates - Longer than average cast times on most abilities, so when movement tools are exhausted, damage potential will drop significantly during movement heavy mechanics ##### Special Notes: - [Manaward](URL is a powerful shield that sometimes allow BLMs to ignore otherwise fatal mechanics - Cannot recover mana via most means in [Astral Fire](URL - Being effective in combat will typically require extensive of fight knowledge and planning, so it is generally more challenging to bring this job to the progression stage of high-end content. This is further exacerbated by having no combat resurrection ##### Rotation &amp; Playstyle: - Maintains dot damage with various varieties of [Thunder](URL - [Fire III](URL &amp; [Blizzard III](URL (or [Transpose](URL to switch between fire &amp; ice - Deal high damage with Fire - Recover mana with Ice ___ Thank you for reading! Please notify me of any errors and feel free to provide feedback &amp; criticism. "
32,vulnerability,ffxiv,How would you change Dragoon going into 5.0?,1,ab1h5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/ab1h5d/how_would_you_change_dragoon_going_into_50/,2018-12-31 11:07:05,So I have played Dragoon since 3.0 and I think the number of buttons is too high. Here are a few ways I would change the job to help reduce bloat and make the job more fun to play. (In my personal opinion) &amp;#x200B; 1) Mirage Dive effect should be baked into Jump and Spineshatter Dive while Blood of the Dragon is active. Mirage Dive would then be what puts you into Life of the Dragon. 2) Blood Surge effect should be baked into Full Thrust and give it a positional effect when attacking from the flank. 3) Heavy Thrust effect should be baked into Impulse Drive. 4) Dragon Sight needs to be reworked. Instead of it just giving a 20 second buff to damage it should instead function along side Life of the Dragon. You place a permanent buff on a party member and when you enter LotD you and the other member get the damage buff for its duration. 5) Jump should get rid of the re-position part of its effect because it is just bad and causes more problems than it should. 6) Spineshatter Dive doesn't need a stun effect. Instead it should give a Vulnerability Up effect for 10-15 secs. Also its potency should be increased. 7) Elusive Jump should give a mini sprint effect for 5 second to help with re-positioning after use. &amp;#x200B; These are just a few things I could think of for 5.0. I would love to hear any other ideas that could help Dragoon work better. I'm aware that reducing some of the buttons and combining effects slightly takes away from the complexity that some people like but I think the class can still be complex without having tons of buttons to press.
33,vulnerability,ffxiv,Seiryu (Extreme) Guide by TFG,1,aebpmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/aebpmu/seiryu_extreme_guide_by_tfg/,2019-01-10 08:40:15,"*Video guide coming on my site / YouTube soon!* ### Mechanics &amp; Rotation \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **PHASE 1** \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Fifth Element** \- raid-wide AoE **Kuji-Kiri** \- 4 AoEs on 4 random players, giving them a water vulnerability debuff. At the same time, intersecting line AoEs will also drop. Spread and dodge accordingly **Symbols: Yin-Yang or Dragon Attack** (There's no cast bar, look for the animation around boss) * **Yin-Yang** \- AoE near the boss. Move away * **Dragon** \- Donut AoE damage from boss. Go near him **Cursekeeper** \- puts barrier on main tank that explodes as AoE later, dealing damage based on how much the tank got damaged while the barrier is up. Also gives a vulnerability debuff so do a tank-swap here. OT PLD can also just Cover the main tank **Infirm Soul** \- tankbuster right after Cursekeeper. Main tank should use a cooldown here \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **ADDS PHASE** \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- * **2 Red Wheels** \- tethers to 2 players, will do line AoE and knockback. Face them outwards to east or west, depending on where your wheel is placed * **Blue Wheel** \- tethers to 1 player, dealing shareable AoE damage. Everyone stack together at the south * **2 Ogres** \- appearing first at north, they will jump at a random edge (opposite sides) and do a big circle AoE there. Dodge accordingly. Those tethered to red wheels should avoid getting knocked back to where the ogres are * **Birds** \- thick line AoEs. Dodge accordingly * **2 Ogres Part 2** \- 2 players will be tethered to one ogre each and will get conal AoE tankbusters after. Tanks intercept one tether each and going near them. Face them away from the party (north or south), and use cooldowns. Everyone else stay in the middle * **Doro no Shiki &amp; Numa no Shiki** \- small and big adds. They do raid-wide AoE upon death so kill them in the following sequence: *small &gt; big &gt; small &gt; big &gt; small*. The big ones also cast Stoneskin so silence them while casting * **Dragon's Wake** \- ultimate attack. Top up and shield before it hits. You will then be knocked back swimming in the water outside. Get back to center land immediately while dodging the conal AoEs and 'closing-in' AoEs on the water \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **PHASE 2** \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Summon Shiki Snake** \- snakes will spawn on east or west, knocking back players halfway through the arena. Do not get knocked back outside of land **Summon Shiki Golem** \- AoE on the half-east or half-west of the arena, depending on which hand he uses so watch out. This is alternating so just keep moving to the opposite sides **Fifth Element** **Snakes + Golem** \- same mechanic for Snake, but Golem will attack the center of the arena while also knocking back players. Position near the center in a way that you'll be knocked back by the Golem first towards the Snakes, and the Snakes will knock you back after **Forbidden Arts** \- 2x straight-line shareable AoE that hits right after you get knocked back by Snakes. Make sure to have everyone stack for this \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **PHASE 3** \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Blazing Aramitama** \- puts him in Super Saiyan state and mechanics will now be harder **Enhanced Symbols** \- he will use both in one go. Sequence depends on what 'logo' appears first so watch out for the animation e.g. if it's Yin Yang and then Dragon, move away first and then get near him **Kuji-Kiri x2** \- a 2nd set of intersecting line AoEs will attack the safe zones of the 1st. Dodge the 1st set, and when the 1st set disappears, hence becoming safe zones for the 2nd set, move there **Enhanced Symbols** **Fifth Element** **Serpent Ascending** * Circle AoEs on everyone. Stack and bait them in the middle * 4 players (tanks + healers or DPS) will be marked with circle AoE. They should position themselves in their assigned cardinal positions (N, S, E, W) * 4 towers appear at the intercardinal edges (NE, NW, SE, SW) where the other group of 4 must occupy one each **Enhanced Forbidden Arts** \- shareable line AoE that will attack each healer once while also giving a vulnerability debuff. Split the party in 2 groups: 1 tank, 1 healer, 2 DPS per group. Face each group the other way so the AoEs won't clip **Fifth Element** **Enhanced Cursekeeper** \- he just does this twice, meaning two tankswaps. Watch out for the tankbusters **Fifth Element** **Enhanced Summon Shiki** * 2 Ogres * Enhanced Symbols * 2 Ogres Part 2 * 2 Red Wheels (You can face them north or south. DO NOT get knocked into the water. Use anti-knockback skills) * Blue Wheel * Circle AoEs on everyone * Kuji-Kiri x2 * Golem * Fifth Element * Golem x2 * Snakes + Golem * Enhanced Symbols * Golem x3 * Snakes + Golem * Enhanced Forbidden Arts * Fifth Element **Enhanced Cursekeeper** **Fifth Element** **Enhanced Symbols** **Serpent Ascending** **Kuji-Kiri x2** **Fifth Element x4** \- 4th time is **ENRAGE**"
34,vulnerability,ffxiv,A party version of BLU,1,a25sg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/a25sg2/a_party_version_of_blu/,2018-12-02 06:07:53,"I had been tinkering with the idea of a party version of blue mage for a few months -- mainly as an unimportant thing to think about when I fall asleep. I threw some notes down on paper and thought I would share them here. I honestly do not have any opinions about the announced implementation being an alternate system. I'm was mainly just challenging myself to think about how to make it feel as nostalgic BLU as possible within the available party system. &amp;#x200B; I'm no balance expert and welcome criticism on that front. Potencies are probably too high. Let's just assume that the abilities I present are for level 70 cap. &amp;#x200B; Concept: Mid-to-long range magic DPS with different damage types that enhances party utility of certain jobs; primary stat is INT. There are three resources: MP, blue mana (BM; which accrues up to a limit of 50), and burst affinity (which accrues up to 3). To keep things simple, the potencies that I list are the combo potencies only. Please note, when BLU inflicts a physical damage resistance, it does it differently than other jobs. It not only inflicts the effect if it is not present but adds to the duration if it is present. &amp;#x200B; **Statuses** * Mind Blast: Upgrades certain area of effect actions. * Convergence: Restricts area of effect actions to a single target and increases potency by 1.5 times. * Azure Lore: Increases magic damage by 25% and upgrades certain actions. * Oil: Increases vulnerability to fire damage by 10%. &amp;#x200B; **Spells** * Goblin Punch. 88 pot, 25y range, 2.5s cast, 2.5s recast, 50% blunt/50% non-elemental. * 8% chance of inflicting 8x damage.

We had a lot of difficulty with two bosses in particular: &amp;#x200B; Howling Atmos &amp; 5 headed dragon. &amp;#x200B; For the 5 headed Dragon, we continued to DPS the main heads and someone else focused on the adds in case there was something to cause us to wipe. It is strongly suggested that at least one of them go as healer, WHM can use their cooldowns on other alliance members, I'm not sure about the other healer types if they can do the same. A healer is definitely going to be needed for Cloud of Darkness due to damage and vulnerability stacks. &amp;#x200B; For Cerberus, we did not bother with the mechanics and straight beat down. It would have been easier with them, but we just let him stay off the chain and avoided aoe's, mobs and allowed the gastric juices to stay on the field for a while. They don't do anything, so I think we forcibly skipped the mechanic by leaving them on the floor and not using them until the end of the battle. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, the Howling Atmos gave us a particularly difficult time due to the mechanic where it pushes you off the ledge. Before you get pushed off the ledge, there will be a glyph, stand on it before you are sucked in every time and you will eventually kill it after a few tries. You have to make sure you know where your glyph to get back up is before you get blown down because if it disappears you will die. If you don't hit the gylph, you will die. It definitely is the longest part of doing this raid 3 man, lol. &amp;#x200B; Cloud of Darkness was also a pain due to how much damage done during the add phases, we had a person in the one alliance die twice due to that. &amp;#x200B; I'm posting this just in case someone comes by and needs help with the raid, I know we had to figure out what we were doing and the only post to help was a another reddit post that actually did not discuss how they beat the Howling Atmos. &amp;#x200B;"

39,vulnerability,ffxiv,A Suggestion for Dark Knight moving into 5.0/Eventual Rework,1,9mna34,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/9mna34/a_suggestion_for_dark_knight_moving_into/,2018-10-09 19:02:40,"Addressing the state of Dark Knight. Having read through a history of tanks made by user ImpliedMustache I did some digging myself. DRK was my first 70 and the class I most looked forward to as a new player when I started. What I was greeted with at endgame was rather disappointing, and I ended up just primarily playing WAR for my static. I make these suggestions because I want Dark Knight to be different than WAR, and because I feel it has lost it's class identity. Dark Knight and it's current state. Dark Knight as of patch 4.4 has nothing inherently wrong in it's defensive options or DPS for raiding. Analyzing deeply shows that it can perform well enough at a high level to be useful and that it will not cause a group to meet enrage simply by it's presence in a party, nor is it currently unable to survive tank busters of the current tier. Far from it in fact, I believe Dark Knight is very strong defensively. It does on the other hand lack any form of utility, something both of the other tanks currently bring in spades. Unlike the other tanks though it doesn't do significantly more damage or have enough of a mitigation lead for it to be incredibly desirable. For Dungeons (While I know most do not care, whether we all like it or not some people do enjoy Dungeon content. I feel a Tank should still be balanced in regards to Dungeon content, even if it is not the primary focus of balance.) Dark Knight currently suffers. It has deceptively low AoE DPS, and while it certainly is not Paladin, it is still much worse than Warrior's. What Dark Knight does wrong. When you play a Black Mage currently you can feel the power of your spells in every cast. Playing a Warrior lets you experience the elation of popping Inner Release at the perfect moment and devastating whatever you are fighting. Bard brings with it songs to help your friends and abilities that look quite cool at the same time. These are class fantasies, something incredibly important to every job and role. They are a core part of the identity of jobs; they are the reason you want to play them. A job's class fantasy is important because without it you will simply gravitate towards something better or something that feels good to play. It is beyond balancing (though good balance is still needed.). As of patch 4.4 of Stormblood Dark Knight does not fulfill a class fantasy. Warrior has better mitigation, self healing and damage. Warrior is better in dungeons. Warrior is more adaptable in fights. Warrior has better snap aggro generation. Warrior feels cooler to play too. The core problem with Dark Knight is that it is directly comparable to Warrior. Bloodspiller is bad Fell Cleave. Soul Eater is bad Storm's Eye. Blood Weapon is bad Inner Release. Carve and Spit is bad Upheaval. Plunge is bad Onslaught. Living Dead is bad Holmgang. Grit is bad Defiance. So what do we do with Dark Knight? Dark Knight has to find it's niche. It needs to find things it can do that other tanks cannot do. Not something other tanks do worse or better. It needs mechanics exclusive to it and it alone. But what should these mechanics be? Looking at the history and lore, as well as player suggestions dating back as far as Heavensward content I believe Dark Knight's niche should be debuff/lifesteal with mid to high mitigation. Currently Warrior has lifesteal baked directly into it's kit and...that needs to be removed entirely. I will list a potential kit change to Dark Knight. This is of course something I would personally like to see happen with DRK and while I am not demanding anything from the developers, I do hope it gives them potential insight into what tank players may want with DRK in 5.0 Feel free to skip the next section if you are not interested in the kit proposal Kit Overhaul All Global attacks now generate some Blood Gauge, but blood Gauge generation is eliminated for off global attacks. Hard Slash to Power slash Enmity combo left unchanged Hard Slash to Souleater changed in the following ways; Syphon Strike now cleaves and restores mana like Quietus. Quietus removed. Unleash now Combos off of Syphon Strike; Combo potency increased to 220+for highest sustained AoE of any tank. Unleash now always lifesteals for a portion of it's damage dealt. Salted Earth snares enemies caught within it. Salted Earth is cast at the user's feet if double clicked/pressed. Dark Passenger innately blinds. Dark Passenger is now a cone roughly double in length to Overpower. Dark Passenger always has it's current DA potency. Carve and Spit has it's current bonus DA potency. Scourge returns, it's DoT gives DRK a unique Refresh like effect, restoring mana for it's duration. Darkside is now a trait for Dark Knight. Blood Weapon no longer locked from use in Grit. Blood Weapon altered; now has a 25s CD but can be recast early for 50 blood. Blood Weapon must be combod off of Souleater or Power Slash as a 4th combo action(Unless payed for with Blood), but remains off global. Blood Weapon no longer restores bonus MP. Blood Weapon now lasts 18-21s. Blood Weapon no longer generates additional Blood gauge or MP. Delirium removed. Grit changed; Grit now gives +20% damage reduction and reduces damage by 20% unless under the effect of Blood Weapon. Grit no longer gives bonus enmity generation, this effect is moved to Blood Price. Grit becomes Global to toggle on or off. While under the effects of Grit you generate a small amount of blood gauge whenever you take damage. Blood Price can still only be used in Grit. Blood Price now gives bonus enmity generation currently tied to Grit but no longer restores MP when hit. it's duration and cooldown remains the same. Soul Survivor now doubles your lifesteal for it's duration, otherwise working as it currently does. Unmend has it's current in-Grit enmity generation made always on. (For levelling purposes.) Abyssal Drain has it's current in-Grit enmity generation made always on. Abyssal Drain gains Unleash's old free cast from Unmend. Abyssal Drain now applies a 10% damage down onto any enemies that are stunnable for 5s when used with Unmend's free cast. Bloodspiller now deals it's damage normally for the first enemy, 10% less for the second, 20% less for the third, 30% less for the fourth, 40% less for the fifth, and 50% less for all remaining enemies. Bloodspiller now absorbs a portion of the damage dealt as HP. Bloodspiller extends Blood Weapon self buff duration by 5s per use to a maximum of 30s. Reprisal returns as a DRK only oGCD. Additionally it now silences a target for 1sec in addition to it's normal uses. Dark Knight loses access to the following; Rampart, Convalescence, Anticipation, Awareness, Interject. Shadow Wall has it's CD reduced by 20s from 120s to 100s. Dark Mind gains a movement immunity effect, but otherwise remains unchanged. Dark Arts is now an oGCD toggle ability. Dark Arts now drains mana like HW Darkside, but at a much faster rate. Accounting for Syphon Strikes you should get no more than 2 full Souleaters under the effect, or possible 3 if benefiting from Scourge's refresh. It no longer increases potency on abilities, instead it causes all abilities to gain a significant amount of lifesteal (in the case of Souleater it simply gains more lifesteal.) and applying a harmless DoT effect on any enemies hit. The DoT works as an inverse HoT; it deals no damage but requires an enemy for the Dark Knight to benefit from it. The Blackest Night is left unchanged. Results Pros Dark Knight now has a true AoE combo. Dark Knight now has a buff it must carefully maintain akin to enochian or greased lightning, making it more interesting to play. Dark Knight has substantial lifesteal; enough that it be able to regain 1/2 to 2/3 of it's HP in 10 seconds while under all the applicable buffs which should help alleviate the use of Living Dead. It is now the only tank with an always on tank stance, benefiting from the high passive mitigation and through the use of proper TBN mid to high active mitigation. It is now undeniably a good debuff tank. Proper use of this tank should see it's addle effect almost always on a boss which will help healers with raidwide. It's skill cap would be raised, allowing people who are very good at the job to really shine. It still has a fast gameplay style with the potential to get more interesting off globals levelling 70-80, without feeling overly spammy. No more Dark Arts Spam. Should benefit most from high uptime, easily able to overcome WAR DPS in a low downtime fight/striking dummy encounter assuming you play correctly. No longer needs nearly as much healer attention outside busters. Probably the easiest casual content tank once mastered, playing on it's self sufficient class fantasy. Cons Dark Knight is now harder to play at a base level. It has lower mana regeneration than right now. Mana would/should become harder to generate. Dark Knight now has to choose between good mitigation and good lifesteal through TBN and Dark Arts. Dark Knight will need to recover from downtime in fights the same as monks. It has far more windup before it takes off, and would probably have the weakest opener of any tank. It is still a DPS loss to pull in tank stance since you need to hit your 3rd combo to get into your enhanced state which eliminates your Grit damage down. Has the worst snap aggro generation of any tank. Has the hardest time with aggro of any tank if played incorrectly. Has poor active mitigation compared to other tanks. Active Mitigation is harder to use appropriately. Can easily back themselves into a corner just like current Black Mage. Has poor utility compared to other tanks, but still much better than current. Passive mitigation and good self heal will ease healers trying to heal DRK, allowing them to better focus on Raid Wide and Mechanics. Should have DPS somewhere between PLD and WAR in most fights, but lower than either in bursts. Dark Knight would be especially weak to Vulnerability Stacks with it's limited active mitigation, and as such is punished pretty heavily for doing mechanics incorrectly compared to other tanks. Likewise Dark Knight being more reliant on lifesteal effects would mean Damage Down debuffs hit you very hard. Being reliant on mana for mitigation also means that it has a harder overall time recovering from deaths when they do happen. Having a slow startup also punishes dying. Closing Thank you for reading, feel free to discuss or suggest changes. I personally hope a Dev might see this, and if one is reading this thank you for taking your time to do so even if nothing ultimately comes of it."

I was mulling over ideas at work the other day, and thought about a way to possibly make Dark Knight a better job. More streamlined, and all that fun stuff. It involves reworking the Dark Arts ability and streamlining other parts of the job. Without further ado, here are my suggestions. Dark Arts, instead of being an oGCD ability that consumes x-amount of MP, and improving one ability at a time, I propose the following changes: \-One time activation, similar to a stance like Darkside or Grit. \-Drains MP over time, similar to Foe's Requiem on BRD. \-Slight potency increases to all weapon skills, barring Hard Slash. \-Carve and Spit, Dark Passenger, Quietus, Abyssal Drain, and Bloodspiller all have their Dark Arts additonal effects remaining the same. \-Can still only be active while Darkside is active. \-Adds additional effects to certain abilities/weaponskills \-Power Slash: When used alongside Grit, will reduce incoming damage to self and nearby party members (5-10y) by 5&amp;#37; \-Soul Eater: When used alongside Grit, provides a regen effect of 50 potency, scaling off of the DRK's VIT stat, lasting 15s. \-Unleash: When used alongside Grit, provides a damage shield to nearby party members (5-10y) totalling 5&amp;#37; of THEIR maximum HP. Shield duration 15s, stacks with Scholar's Galvanize effect or Astrologian's Nocturnal Sect shields. Adds a 15s recast timer to Unleash. \-Adds an additional weapon skill, comboing off of Syphon Strike, that would add a potency increase of some shape or form (think things like Slashing Debuff on enemy, or a Vulnerability Up on enemy), that would last 15s. \-Allows usage of Scourge, which would now be an oGCD DoT, dealing 50 potency up front, and another 25 potency per game tick, for 30 seconds, sitting on a 90 second recast timer. To keep all this balanced, I propose lowering the amount of MP Syphon Strike recovers, by around 50-75&amp;#37;. Keeps DRK in the game with being a resource-management job, but also lends them a bit more raid utility. Anyway, those are my thoughts. Any thoughts/suggestions/criticisms? Let me know. Thanks for reading."
43,vulnerability,ffxiv,Summoner Rework,0,8spcoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/8spcoc/summoner_rework/,2018-06-21 15:36:00,"Hello! I'm still really new to the Reddit community in general, and this is only my second ever post. I have some ideas on how to make the summoner a more flow-y kind of job, for lack of a better term. When Square dropped 4.0, and the mechanics behind Demi-Bahamut, I thought, why not take it a step further, and do that with the whole class, completely reworking it? These are my thoughts on how to go about that. Brace yourselves, it'll be a ride. Let's start off with the basic abilities before we go into the summons. TO start off with, the potency of everything goes down. \-Ruin II potency lowers from 100 to 75. \-Ruin III potency reduced from 125 to 110. \-Ruin IV potency reduced from 200 to 150. \-Bio III potency reduced from 50 to 35 over 30 seconds. \-Miasma III potency reduced from 50 to 35 over 30 seconds. After all the potency nerfs, it's almost disheartening to think about how the job can go up from here. Now, I'll touch on some Aetherflow changes. \-Aetherflow's Cooldown reduced from 60 seconds to 45 seconds. \-MP restored from using Aetherflow is lowered from 10&amp;#37; to 7.5&amp;#37; of maximum MP.-Energy Drain potency reduced from 150 to 125. \-Fester Potency reduced from 150/300 potency to 100/200, dependent on the DoTs you have applied to the target. \-Painflare potency reduced from 200 potency to 150. Alternatively, could add a drop-off similar to Akh Morn. \-Bane's damage fall-off now starts after the first target. In exchange, the DoTs are reset on all targets it hits. So the target you use Bane on will have its DoTs reset, and will take full damage from them. The next target will only suffer 80&amp;#37; of that damage, and so on, down to 50&amp;#37;, in 10&amp;#37; increments per target, up to a maximum of 10 targets. So now comes probably the biggest change... Summoner, should my design get implemented, would no longer be a pet class. -insert collective gasp here- So the things I thought Summoner should keep are Dreadwyrm Trance and the Summon Bahamut actions- they just have vastly different ways to get to them. And by vastly different, I really mean VASTLY different. \-Summon Aether: \-Duration 20s. Cooldown 60s. Grants one Primal Aether after duration ends. \-Aspects all of your damaging Aetherflow abilities to Fire, and increases their potency by 50. \-Using Bane when targets are affected by both Bio III and Miasma III will apply Inferno to all targets hit by Bane. \-Inferno will share the same damage and DoT effect as Ifrit's normal Enkindle. \-Summon Titan Aether: \- Duration 20s. Cooldown 60s. Grants one Primal Aether after duration ends. (Couldn't really think of a better name for it...) \-Aspects all damaging Aetherflow abilities to Earth, and decreases all MAGIC damage the SMN receives by 3&amp;#37;. \-Using Bane when targets are affected by both Bio III and Miasma III will decrease all damage taken by nearby party members by 5&amp;#37;. \-Summon Garuda Aether: \-Duration 20s. Cooldown 60s. Grants one Primal Aether after duration ends. \-Aspects all damaging Aetherflow abilities to Wind, decreasing your GCD and cast times by 15&amp;#37;. \-Using Bane when target is affected by both Bio III and Miasma III will apply Magic Vulnerability Up on all affected targets. I tried to incorporate the best of what I feel each egi has to offer right now. So now comes the best part. How do you get to Bahamut? It's quite simple. I've re-worked completely how Enkindle works. \-Enkindle: \-Duration 20s. Cooldown 120s. \-Consumes 3 Primal Aether upon activation. \-Increases the potency of your Ruin spells by 50. \-Summons the Aether of Bahamut upon activation, while simultaneously granting 3 stacks of Aetherflow. \-Aetherflow Cooldown resets. \-Tri-Bind potency increased to 70. \-Immediately makes Tri-Disaster available. \-Deathflare becomes available twice during this period, similar to how Akh Morn worked. Potency 250 to the first target, scaling down 10&amp;#37; each target, to a minimum of 50&amp;#37; after 5 targets have been hit. \-Enables usage of Akh Morn. \-Same mechanics as now. 15s Cooldown. \-You cannot activate Summon Ifrit Aether, Summon Titan Aether, or Summon Garuda Aether while Enkindle is active. And those are my thoughts on how to improve the Summoner job. It almost makes the Summoner into a ever-changing class like how Bard is with its songs. I've also included some thoughts on what things could actually look like for the Summoner. \-Ifrit Aether makes the Summoner glow red, with horns on their head. Their book becomes replaced with large red claws, like Ifrit-Egi has. \-Titan Aether makes the Summoner glow yellowish-orange, and the Summoner's book disappears and is replaced with the Summoner's fists enlarging. (Couldn't really think of something cool for this one...) \-Garuda Aether makes the Summoner glow greenish-yellow. Their book disappears, and is replaced with Garuda-Egi's wings protruding out of the Summoner's back. \-When Enkindle is active, the Summoner's book comes back, and Bahamut's wings spread out from the book the Summoner is holding. What do you all think? Comments, suggestions, and (constructive) criticism is welcome."

Sharing here my guide for Patch 4.3's new Extreme Trial fight. **For the full version \(I'll be posting a clear video soon\), you can visit my page** [here](URL Let's Begin! ### Mechanics &amp; Rotation ======================================================================================== **PHASE 1** **Reprimand** \- raid\-wide AoE attack **Nightfall** \- equips either sword or gun and attacks with it. When gun, she will say *""Beg for mercy""* and does a shareable straight\-line AoE to a random target\- everyone stack together. If sword, she will say* ""Your end is near*"" and will do three consecutive conal attacks targeting one random tank, one random DPS and then one random healer. Players of the same class should stack together but away from other classes e.g. tanks on north, DPS on southeast, healers on southwest **Nightbloom** \- raid\-wide AoE attack ======================================================================================== **PHASE 2** **DPS Check**\- adds will appear and those tethered to Yotsuyu will attack her, raising her Suffering bar. They key here is to kill the adds while preventing the Suffering bar to reach 100 **1st set of adds** \- 2 from north \(tethered\), 3 from east \(melee\) and 3 from west \(ranged\). Bring the melee to the ranged and burn them down with AoEs and then proceed to kill the tethered adds **2nd set of adds** \- 1 from the NE \(tethered\), 3 from southwest \(melee\) and 3 from northwest \(ranged\). Do the same as you did in the 1st set **3rd set of adds** \- Zenos will appear, then knockback and stun everyone for a few seconds. He does raid\-wide AoEs every few seconds. Kill him ASAP **Nightbloom** ======================================================================================== **PHASE 3** **Supreme Selenomancy** \- splits the arena in two halves\- dark and light. Standing in either side will give you stacks for that side, while standing on the opposite side will reset your stacks to one for that color. They key here is to not reach five stacks by alternating between light and dark. But watch out\- after casting Supreme Selenomancy, you'll be immediately given four stacks of a color so be aware and step right away to the opposite side **Moon Donuts** \- two donut AoEs will spawn during Supreme Selenomancy in one side. If it happens to be on the side you'll be going to, keep aware and avoid the AoEs **Note:** the side where the Moon Donuts explode will contract while the opposite color will expand. Tank the boss between the two colors for easy handling of stacks ***Nightfall*** **Meteor** \- one random tank, one random healer and one random DPS will be marked to drop a huge AoE attack. Each marked player should bait their AoEs in their assigned class positions e.g. tanks at north, healers at east, DPS at west. Everyone then proceed to the small safe zone at the south before the AoEs explode. It's preferred to stand on the side with the smaller color in preparation for the next mechanic **Midnight Rain** \- the arena will be completely covered with the dominant color, giving you no more chance to reset stacks ***Moon Donuts*** **Meteor Part 2** \- the meteors that dropped before will explode again so go back to the previous safe spot right after the Moon Donuts. This time, the meteors that landed on the smaller side before will leave a puddle of that same color, making it the only place for you to swap colors. The meteors are also colored for easier visual reference. Run towards there to reset your stacks **Antitwilight** \- raid\-wide AoE that also removes the floor colors ***Reprimand*** **Zashiki Asobi 1** \- spawns two sets of fans that will cover 2/3 of the arena \(north or south\), then another set that will cover the remaining 1/3. What you do here is stay first on the safe 1/3 area, then proceed to the 2/3 area after the fans there go off to dodge the second set. Keep aware as while the first set of fans are going off, the boss will already be casting Nightfall ***Nightfall*** **Torment Unto Death** \- conal AoE tankbuster giving a vulnerability debuff. Use invulnerability or swap tanks afer ***Supreme Selenomancy*** ***Moon Donuts*** **Dance of the Dead** \- raid\-wide AoE ======================================================================================== **PHASE 4** **Note:** the next two attacks will be a combination of her 1.\) Moon Alignment as shown in the animation and text on screen and 2.\) Blade Type as shown in her casting bar **Moon Alignment** * **Light of the Full Moon** \- AoE near the boss. Move away from her to dodge * **Darkness of the New Moon** \- AoE away from the boss. Move near her hitbox to dodge **Blade Type** * **Dark Blade** \- AoE on the left half of the arena. Go to the right half to dodge * **Bright Blade** \- AoE on the right half of the arena. Go to the left half to dodge *So for example\-* **Light Alignment \+ Dark Blade** = run to the right side of the arena away from the boss **Dark Alignment \+ Bright Blade** = move to the left side of the arena while near her hitbox ***Reprimand*** ***3rd Moon Alignment*** **Zashiki Asobi 2 \+ Lunacy** * **Zashiki Asobi 2** \- fans will spawn in a circular fashion around the arena, starting at the center * **Lunacy** \- multiple shareable AoE that increases its hits the more times it is cast. The first cast is two hits, second cast is three, etc. a.k.a. Akh Morn **How to handle Zashiki Asobi 2 \+ Lunacy:** Everyone should stand where the last fan will spawn, share the AoE there, and run to the center when the area becomes safe, at the same time sharing the second AoE ***Moon Attack \(3rd Alignment\) \+ Blade Combo*** ***Torment Unto Death*** ***4th Moon Alignment*** **Zashiki Asobi 1 \+ Hegatsu** * **Hegatsu** \- one random tank, one random healer, one random DPS will be marked to drop a small AoE around them while Zashiki Asobi 1 is happening **How to Handle:** You can assign positions\- the three marked can spread out in the left, middle and right of the safe 1/3 area to drop their Hegatsu, and then everyone proceed to the 2/3 area when it becomes safe. Players without markers can get hit by Hegatsu as long as not any one player will get hit by two ***Moon Attack \(4th Alignment\) \+ Blade Combo*** ***Reprimand*** ***Reprimand*** ***Random Zashiki\-Asobi Combination*** ***Random Zashiki\-Asobi Combination*** ***Lunacy*** **Enrage**"

At 4 stacks, they become Awoken, which changes the primal's usual skills, for example Wicked Wheel on Garuda is a point blank AoE, on Woken Garuda it's a point blank aoe, followed by an arena-wide AoE with a point blank safespot. Upon death, the primal also drops a buff puddle that a single player can pick up. That buff gets the player through doom, which will kill everyone without that debuff. So far (afaik) only Garuda and Ifrit's awakenings are known. Cleansing 2 stacks in the spiny bubble generates a woke stack, meaning you have to cleanse 2 stacks 4 times. Ifrit's nails get buffed when they're hit by the 4 fire aoes that drop on the 2 furthest players, killing a nail that got hit twice generates a woke stack, meaning you have to hit each nail with 2 AoEs, then kill them with 2 Vulnerability Down stacks, so they take less damage. Titan has a new dialogue line for being woken, but it's still not known exactly how to awaken him. Hope that clears it up for people who aren't keeping up with the ultimate prog! 24/7 ^cause ^they ^have ^a ^life ^^I'm ^^Jealous"
47,vulnerability,ffxiv,Recent content highlights the real ingenuity behind Square's game design,0,8pl45z,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/8pl45z/recent_content_highlights_the_real_ingenuity/,2018-06-09 02:05:00,"Hello everyone, i thought I'd quickly take this opportunity to highlight how reflecting on a recent in game experience I had led me to realize the real thought that not only goes into the content, but also the underlying functionality of the game itself, in Final Fantasy XIV. To explain it would be best to start with a bit of background. MMOs as a genre, since their inception a short few years ago by a pioneering independent game developer called blizzard, face many functional issues not found in most single player games brought about by their persistent worlds and online multiplayer connectivity. What I am chosing to focus on with this post is the issue of hyperinflation and the decreasing real value of monetary assets in game. For those interested, here is a nice succint well illustrated video explaining the issue from the team at Extra credits: URL To explain for those short in spare time, as the fans of this genre of game are most widely known for, MMOs face the problem that they attempt to create a functional in game economy for the players with their ictional currency of choice, here Gil. The only problem is Gil is generated for the players in infinite supply, something not possible in the real world. Every time you kill a mob, complete a quest, or sell an outdated piece of gear given freely through quest rewards or instanced loot, the game generates currency for you from the aether, adding to the total amount of currency existing in game. The more of this that exists in world, the less it becomes worth. Thus there is usually some system in place that attempts to alleviate this inflationary pressure, i.e. to force the player to pay out some of their Gil and remove it entirely from the overall pool of resources existing spread out thought the player base. Most prevalent in FFXIV this manifests in the form of market board taxation, teleportation fees, and repair costs. Square Enix have most valiantly attempted to manipulate the spending on repair costs by the ever increasing difficulty of content available in game. While people struggle with the current savage level sigmascape they look back fondly on the gentle days of Heavensward and Gordias. Square were thus forced to fall back on their most reliable source of repair cost generation since the reinvention of the game in a Realm Reborn, that of the 24 man raids. Utilizing strong incentives to lure their most hardcore, and thus affluent, player base, such as high end gear needed to progress on their most recently re-released nostalgic stroll through some long ago beaten bosses, Square came up with the Ridorana Lighthouse. Not content with just this, Square snuck in 2 burgundy gatekeepers that are required to be fought before being able to experience the lighthouse itself. Cleverly designed to take the players aback with their gentle adorable demeanor, they chain cast consecutive aoes so fast that in a flash of only a few of FFXIV's infamously fast global cooldowns players were left with more vulnerability stacks than was previously required for tanks to clear the extreme version of the primal Byakko, and so removed a large swathe of gil from the denizens of eorzea. Unfortunately, Square unwittingly designed a 300 hour game experience as a pre requisite to this moment. Even though, judging from a lot of reactions, this game experience was devoid of this new kind of damage signalling from in game enemies, it had built up player resilience enough a lot were able to adjust quickly enough and pass through. luckily square were not out of tricks, which brings us to the second part of this post, teleportation fees. Square dug deep into past experiences, back to some of the most enjoyable parts of the early game where the player base were enticed as a prelude for their first meeting with the fearsome Titan into traipsing around Eorzea in a series of extremely important quests. So enjoyable was the experience that many people failed to notice that they were secretly being tapped from gil through their teleportation expenses. Cue the second unlock quest: [My Power, My Pleasure, My Pain](URL So caught up in the nostalgia of such a treasured memory most people were fooled in this clever rehash that saw players teleport across the world and around the La Noscean isle. No other reason could present itself to me other than this for such a flagrant manipulation of one of the most treasured leveling experiences than this. Most often the grinding gears that underpin the ever flourishing world of Final Fantasy Fourteen go hidden, so I hope you enjoyed my attempt today to highlight a couple of examples that struck me most recently while playing. Thank you for reading"

Sharing here my personally written guide for Sigmascape V3.0 (Savage) or otherwise known as O7S. Yeah, it's already a bit too late for guides, but I know others who are still trying and having a hard time clearing Savage content. For the full version (complete with images, links and video), you can visit my page at URL Let's Begin! MECHANICS &amp; ROTATION Note: The boss will either use one of two rotations for the entire fight. What rotation the boss will use will depend on what program he will Load on Phase 2 (either Dadaluma or Bibliotaph). Discussed below is the Dadaluma Rotation. I will list the summarized Bibliotaph Rotation afterwards. PHASE 1 Magitek Ray  boss faces random player and does straight-line AoE attack upon cast bar finish. The AoE is a bit thin so its easy to sidestep during casting (0:16 of video) Arm and Hammer  single-target tankbuster. Shield and heal as necessary (0:26 of video) Atomic Ray  marks all DPS with a red orb over their heads. Orbs spewing circular AoEs will drop where they are after a few seconds so they must bait it to the edges of the arena, and away from each other. Getting caught up in the explosion will cause heavy damage and a Vulnerability Up debuff (0:34 of video) Missile  single random DPS is marked by prey and will be hit by Missile after the cast. This will deal heavy DoT (five ticks) to the player so healers must watch out. Paladins can use Cover before it hits, and one of the healers can just Regen the Paladin (0:44 of video) PHASE 2: LOAD PROGRAM (DADALUMA) Shockwave  drops immediately after the casting of Load. Medium raid-wide damage that comes with a potent knockback effect. Main tank should position boss a bit to the north and everyone should stack near the boss so they wont be pushed all the way to the south and get paralyzed. Everyone can use anti-knockback skills here to keep DPS uptime (0:53 of video) Missile Simulation + Chakra Burst Circles  eight yellow Chakra Burst Circles will spawn where each player must occupy one before they detonate. To make things worse, a number of missiles from the east, west and south will cross the arena. Pre-assign each player to a specific circle, and watch out for the missiles. It will always be safe between missiles, awareness and positioning is key. Tilting your camera for a birds eye view helps. Just dont leave your circle no matter what (1:06 of video) Run Program (Dadaluma Add)  Dadaluma will spawn from the northwest. Off-tank must tank it and position it beside the boss in the middle for best handling of upcoming mechanics, DPS uptime and AoE healing. There arent any cleave attacks except for the easy-to-evade Magitek Ray and Aura Cannon (1:23 of video) Magitek Ray Aura Cannon (Dadaluma)  blue marker on single random healer or DPS. Dadaluma will fire a thick straight-line AoE facing that player so it must be baited away from everyone. In our case, we had the marked players position west. After the initial damage to the targeted player, heavy DoT (4 ticks) will follow so healers watch out. Dadaluma will continue using Aura Cannon until he dies (1:42 of video) Arm and Hammer Missile Magitek Ray PHASE 3: SKIP PROGRAM (BIBLIOTAPH) Demon Simulation  summoning circles will appear on the north, east, south and west edges of the arena. Each circle will summon a strong add (equaling to a wipe) unless four players will simultaneously stand on each circle. To handle this, split the party into two groups of four, and assign two circles for each group. Example: tanks and melee DPS will stand on north circle first, and then sprint to the east circle afterwards while the healers and Ranged DPS will handle the south and west. You will know its safe to leave the circle when you see a chain animation above the circle (2:22 of video) PHASE 4: RETRIEVE PROGRAM (AIR FORCE) Interdimensional Explosion  melee-range AoE on boss. Everyone just move away from the boss after the casting of Retrieve Program (2:40 of video) Copy Program (Missile Simulation) Run Program (Air Force Adds)  each DPS will be tethered to an add (either SE, SW, NE, NW), and they must go to the add tethered to them and kill it ASAP. Be careful when on your way to your add as by this time missiles will also be crossing the arena (Missile Simulation) (3:09 of video) Bomb Deployment  two bombs will spawn in two different locations. Each bomb will have a red and blue circle on its sides, and one of them will glow a few moments after appearing. To diffuse the bombs, each healer will claim one bomb, wait for one of the circles of their bombs to glow, and step on that circle. Not stepping on the correct color or not stepping on it at all will detonate the bomb and deal heavy AoE damage to everyone (3:25 of video) Diffractive Laser (Air Force Adds)  DPS should face their adds outside the arena as they will do a huge cone AoE attack facing the one theyre tethered to. Run past the add or sidestep while casting to dodge (3:29 of video) Arm and Hammer Magitek Ray PHASE 5: LOAD (ULTROS) Ink  when the casting of Load finishes, Ink AoE puddles will drop on each player. To handle this, players may pre-assign positions as not to clip anyone when this mechanic drops. You can use the yellow Chakra Burst positioning for easier handling of the mechanic (3:50 of video) Diffractive Plasma  raid-wide heavy damage AoE (4:09 of video) Tentacle Simulation  everyone stack as closely as possible in the middle while facing north (very important!) to bait the tentacles. When the AoE markers appear on the floor, run away to dodge while avoiding the middle and north section of the arena (thats where the tentacles were baited to face, thats where they will attack) (4:19 of video) Run Program (Ultros Add)  Ultros will spawn in either NE, NW, SE or SW. Off-tank will tank it where it spawns. DPS can still continue DPSing the boss at this point for maximum output (4:30 of video) Stoneskin (Ultros)  Ultros will start casting Stoneskin which must be silenced (e.g. by tank or bard) no matter what. Players can start killing Ultros when the boss flies away and becomes untargettable (4:42 of video) Main Cannon  while Ultros is casting Stoneskin, boss will lock on to a random players position and fly upwards. Boss will adjust to have a better view of said position, and then he will start to use his guns and eventually AoE cannon on that particular area. To handle this, everyone should stack near the edge of where Ultros spawned and stay there until the boss flies up. Once you see the animation of the boss flying up, immediately run to the opposite corner far away to avoid the gun attacks and minimize the cannons AoE damage. Kill Ultros before the boss flies back down (4:42 of video) Diffractive Plasma PHASE 6: SKIP PROGRAM (VIRUS) (5:15 of video) This is the most complicated part of the fight. After this, it will only be a repeat of the previous mechanics mashed together. Make sure you put the boss in the center of the arena before Skip Program finishes casting! Upon cast finish, players will get the following debuffs: -1 tank paired with 1 DPS (melee) will get Abandonment + Knockback Tether -1 healer paired with 1 DPS (melee) will get Abandonment +Knockback Tether -1 tank paired with 1 healer will get Searing Wind + Pull In Tether -2 DPS (ranged) paired together will get Searing Wind + Pull In Tether -1 unlucky DPS will get Aether Rot Abandonment  debuff that will need the players affected to be near another player when it goes off. Positioning of those with Abandonment (also with Knockback Tethers) will be around the center of the arena near the boss Knockback / Pull In Tethers  players tethered with +/- Charges will be pulled to each other when it goes off. Conversely, those with +/+ and -/- Charges will be knocked back away from each other. Positioning of those with Knockback Tethers will be around the center of the arena near the boss, while those with Pull In Charges will be the NE+SE and NW+SW edges of the arena Searing Wind  huge AoE that will pulsate twice. No one should get caught up in this. Positioning of those with Searing wind (also with Pull In Tethers) will be the NE+SE and NW+SW edges of the arena. This is to avoid hitting those in the middle with the AoE of Searing Wind Aether Rot  15-second debuff that must be passed to another player before its time expires. Those previously affected with Aether Rot cannot be affected again so watch out. How to Handle Virus Phase: -Make sure boss in the center of the arena as Skip Program is being cast -Wait for your debuffs to determine who will go where -The tank with Abandonment will Provoke the boss -Those with Abandonment will stay near boss -Tank and healer will stack in front of boss -The 2 DPS will stack behind the boss but not too near to avoid passing the Aether Rot -DPS with Aether Rot will only pass it to the other DPS just before its time expires -Dont stack too far away from boss. Avoid getting pushed to the edge or to the players with Searing Wind -After tank is pushed to the middle north by Knockback Tether, he may stay there and let the boss follow -Those with Searing Wind will move away to the NE, NW, SE, SW edges -Ranged DPS 1 can go to NE while his partner Ranged DPS 2 can go to SE -Tank can go to NW while his healer partner can go to SW -Searing Wind &gt; Pull In Tethers &gt; Searing Wind -When the Pull In Tethers pull you, go back to your designated edges to avoid clipping others with the second Searing Wind -After the second Searing Wind, players may go back to the boss -Just before the Aether Rot time expires on the 2nd melee DPS, he should pass it to a designated healer, who will then pass it to the other healer, and so forth -Aether Rot pattern would be Melee &gt; Melee &gt; Healer &gt; Healer &gt; Ranged &gt; Ranged -To avoid passing the Aether Rot accidentally, we had the one affected with Aether Rot position to the east. Other players would avoid that area. Players who will receive the Aether Rot next will standby in the southeast so the one who will pass it to him wont have a hard time Diffractive Plasma Diffractive Plasma Missile Viral Weapon  removes the Aether Rot debuff but inflicts Temporary Misdirection to everyone. A rotating pointing finger will appear on everyones heads, indicating which direction they can only go to when they move. This makes it hard to handle the next attacks (especially when you panic), but a little practice can go a long way (6:19 of video) Magitek Ray  just hope to RNGesus that it wont be facing you on cast lol. If it does, try to run past the boss or go to its sides. Timing where the finger points when you move is key Main Cannon  best-case scenario here is everyone should be near the northern edge (can be northeast, center north or northwest) so the gun attacks and Main Cannon will be baited there. When the boss begins to fly up, you can proceed to run anywhere towards the southern edge to minimize damage Electric Pulse  right after the Main Cannon explodes, a green radar animation will begin ticking on the floor. Do not move when this goes off or it will paralyze you. You can still use attacks, skills and abilities, just not your feet. This will now go off in-between mechanics from now on so watch out (6:44 of video) Arm and Hammer Diffractive Plasma PHASE 7: PASTE PROGRAM (AIR FORCE) Interdimensioal Explosion Copy Program: Missile Simulation Run Program: Air Force Adds Bomb Deployment Diffractive Laser (Air Force Adds) Arm and Hammer Diffractive Plasma PHASE 8: SKIP PROGRAM (BIBLIOTAPH) Demon Simulation Electric Pulse Run Program (Bibliotaph Add)  spawns on the northwest. Its the same with the Dadaluma add but hits a lot harder and has a tankbuster attack. Off-tank should get it and tank it beside the boss to maximize healing and DPS. Off-tank may use his invulnerability skill here to help the healers. Kill it ASAP (8:38 of video) Diffractive Plasma Diffractive Plasma Diffractive Plasma Missile Magitek Ray Diffractive Plasma PHASE 9: RETRIEVE PROGRAM (DADALUMA) Shockwave Electric Pulse Missile Simulation + Chakra Burst Circles + Atomic Ray Missile Magitek Ray Diffractive Plasma PHASE 10: SKIP PROGRAM (ULTROS) Ink Tentacle Simulation Bomb Deployment Atomic Ray Magitek Ray Diffractive Plasma Run Program (Ultros Add) Missile Simulation Stoneskin (Ultros) Main Cannon Diffractive Plasma Extermination Sequence  enrage.

People I mentioned it to hadn't heard of it and thought it was amusing. In PotD, if you use a Pomander of Lust while playing as Red Mage, Dualcast still procs on use of Void Fire II (the ability you get as a succubus after using the pomander), enabling you to cast it back to back, which increases mobility slightly and stacks the vulnerability debuff more quickly at the beginning of the fight. I'm not sure if this works with Resolution and Kuribu yet, as I haven't tested it. If Square ever catches on, I'm guessing it'll be fixed, but it's more of a minor quirky oversight than a game-breaker like Ungarmax."
51,vulnerability,ffxiv,"BLM, still a detriment to parties in 4.2",0,7rpwib,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/7rpwib/blm_still_a_detriment_to_parties_in_42/,2018-01-20 22:30:59,"There's just no other way to say it. The changes that have been stated in the LL aren't going to fix BLM's standing amongst the DPS jobs unless Fire IV's damage is through the roof, but we know it won't be, given that they aren't touching Samurai at all. On a surface level, the changes only help to raise the skill floor. It does nothing to push against the ceiling, which is where BLM is really struggling to shine. These are nothing but smoke and mirror changes, and do nothing to fix what actually makes BLM such a horrible job. ***** Let's run through the changes slated for 4.2 as we know it. **AETHERIAL MANIPULATION** I hear many people are excited about Aetherial Manipulation being lowered to 10 second cooldown. While it is an improvement to Aetherial Manipulation *as it is*, it doesn't change that Aetherial Manipulation is fundamentally flawed on two parts. 1. Aetherial Manipulation is reliant on targetting an ally in order to be utilised. Now, in what scenarios do you actually use Aetherial Manipulation at a raid level? To dodge abilities. In a job that is already punished by even dropping a fraction of a second, having to find a suitable party member to dodge to only puts needless complexity to the BLM and, unless you have a proc, a DPS loss. 2. At a high level content, if the BLM needs to dodge, so do everyone else. You require other party members need to position themselves to not only dodge AoEs themselves but also provide space for a BLM to zoom to them, and also stay in range of said BLM so they can actually press. Let's also not forget that Aetherial Manipulation is *not* ""instant"" as the description tries to make you believe. There is latency involved. And you also teleport to the *side* of your ally. Should they stop just outside an AoE (for optimal DPS uptime), a BLM zooming to them would not only be animation locked, but also STILL be in the AoE. In a nutshell, Aetherial Manipulation *is not a reliable method of dodging AoEs*. It would have been far better had it been a caster version of Shukuchi, targetting the ground itself, and to not have a range limit to actually do the job it was made for. So any changes to AM as it is, does nothing to actually help BLM because it's intrinsically flawed. **TRANSPOSE** The only content this change actually affects is lower-level BLMs. A decreased cooldown does nothing for a 70 BLM, which has Fire III and Blizzard III for normal switching, and already using transpose for times when bosses are invulnerable or mechanics necessitate movement. This similarly applies to.... **FIRESTARTER** This change only improves the skill floor, for BLMs who accidentally let AF or UI drop. A normal BLM at 70 would be using Firestarter procs in their AF phase already, making the proc extension redundant as it is used at set slots in the rotation. **THUNDERCLOUD** A length extension to Thundercloud proc is actually beneficial. In the right scenario, TC can be used to maintain DPS while dodging mechanics, in normal cases where your only choice is Scathe or twiddle your thumbs. Any chance to lower hard casting of Thunder III is always beneficial too, as the proc extension allows for greater opportunity during UI for usage. However, this doesn't change that BLM is STILL punished by multiple TC procs. The timings of AF is so tight that using multiple TC is just detrimental towards a BLM's rotation. **FIRE IV** How large of a potency buff is yet to be seen, yet given SE's track record, it won't be large enough to miraculously lift BLM into a suitable slot for end-level parties, given the list of flaws BLM still has. And oh boy does it still have a lot... ***** **REDUNDANT ABILITIES** BLM is the only job to have 5 redundant abilities at lvl 70. Blizzard, Blizzard II, Freeze, Scathe and Sleep. Sleep can be excused, and only marginally being that it's never used in new dungeons with straight AoE burning being preferred over CC. But it doesn't excuse why BLM has so many useless abilities clogging the hotbars. MNK has a similar issue, however... **RAID UTILITY** ...At least it brings some utility to a party. BLM brings absolutely none, and on top of being entirely selfish outside of role abilities, a party has to position themselves around a BLM in order to let them be played optimally, to the detriment of themselves in most cases. With FFXIV as it currently is, where the highest DPS potential comes from stacking multiple raid buffs, BLM has no place at all to be even considered to be part of a synergising group. **CONVERT** What the hell is Convert still doing in its sub-par form, with unnecessary costs and impossible cooldown? All for two paltry Fire IVs every three minutes. It's an outdated ability, and while it's still used, it's only used *because there's nothing else that BLM can utilise*. Get rid of the HP cost, and make Convert grant three Umbral Hearts to really make it have an impact. **BLIZZARD IV** When a rotation is able to discount an entire ability and still be able to perform almost the same in terms of DPS, there's something wrong with that ability. Blizzard IV either needs to do justifiable amounts of damage, or grant a buff of sorts. A magic vulnerability down, or since SE is allergic to ever giving BLM useful raid utility, Fire resistance down. It will literally only help RDM, which is also severely in need of changes. **ENOCHIAN** Enochian is literally a press once at the beginning of a fight, and you can then delete it off your hotbar. If it's going to be like this, Enochian may as well just be an in-built trait that starts as soon as AF or UI begin. Yes yes, benefiting the skill floor as well, but it's close to be redundant with how much interaction that button actually has with a BLM. Give Enochian an in-combat use. Let Enochian refresh AF or UI on use. Do something to make it more than a one-punch button. ***** **TL;DR** SE doesn't understand that what BLM needs isn't more of the same. It's a fundamental change of certain core abilities of the job that will be able to lift BLM to be actually competing with other jobs for a spot in raid scenarios. Until they understand that, and do what they did with WAR in 2.1 and SMN in 4.1 with fundamental changes, BLM will remain being the king of garbage, married to SAM. Simply buffing BLM's damage and bandaid fixing mobility isn't going to do anything for how optimal it would be for raids, nor do anything for it being incapable of competing with other jobs for a desired position in parties. 4.2 changes to BLM do nothing to really address the issues that have been plaguing BLM since Heavensward, and it seems as if they *don't* know what these issues actually are."

I've been on O7S since week 1 and have been seeing some... *issues* with abandonment. I've already seen people talking about the issues surrounding abandonment related to ping, but SE has been pretty quiet about addressing this. In the last patch maintenance we saw fixes for Byakko Ex and nothing else. Is anyone else seeing issues with abandonment? I'm a MNK and have become very intimate with this mechanic and how inconsistent it is. My melee dps partner is an east coast player and I'm a west coast player. [Here's](URL a video clip of us attempting the mechanic. We have adopted horizontal virus where the melee DPS exchange Aether Rot before the knock back occurs. Have any of you also been experiencing the inconsistently inconsistent behavior? The above strategy that failed has also worked multiple times. Does anyone think that they'll do something to adjust it? I think the last time SE actually adjusted a mechanic in Savage was A6S. After discussing the video I've linked above with a colleague of mine, we came up with what I think is a better alternative to abandonment. abandonment basically exists to punish people who can't avoid searing wind. We think that giving a fire vulnerability up debuff in place of the abandonment debuff would be a much simpler solution to a problem that seems to be pretty reliant on ping. A funny side note: One of my raid members said I should make a video compilation of all the times abandonment fails regardless of being literally on top of each other. I think it'd be interesting to hear exactly what members of the development team would have to say. I'd be interested to see what others have to say. Edit: Misinformation about A6S"

I've made ones myself before but I feel it needs to be said again. I'm seeing more and more Ninja using single target doton. Why are people propagating the myth that a single target doton is the best option? I'm not referring to TCJ usage, by the way. First, here are the possible Ninjutsu and their *unbuffed* potencies. Huton not included as it doesn't do damage. Ninjutsu | Potency :--|:-- Fuma Shuriken | 240 Raiton | 360 Katon | 250 Hyoton | 140 Suiton | 180 Doton | 360 To get it out of the way, I am aware that it is better to use Doton on single target with TCJ *in the majority of cases* due to Katon being higher potency than Suiton. The problem I'm seeing is that people are using single target Dotons outside of TCJ. You may have noticed that Doton has the same potency as Raiton. This has been the case since they buffed the potency and fixed the issue where it was affected by the poisons and slashing debuff. Doton is no longer affected by either of these. Another thing to note is that Doton is not affected by some things that the others are affected by. Trick Attack and the vulnerability debuff from MCH don't affect Doton but do affect Raiton. I'm unsure if Foe Requiem does. This makes Raiton the better choice for a few reasons: 1. Raiton is quicker to cast 2. If the enemy is outside of the Doton for just a single tick, it becomes lower potency 3. Raiton can be buffed Am I missing something? Did I miss a memo about how Doton is better than Raiton against single targets outside of TCJ?"

Edit: Sorry for the late update. First and foremost, I am not naming names due to this subreddit's policy on witch-hunting/name shaming. But I can say that the group is on Adamantoise. About the details, it was from a private stream I watched early on. What I found is that after the tower phrase, Nael somehow gained a vulnerability and hp down debuff. The fight was really suspicious, because Nael was killed under 30 seconds which is clearly impossible. What I noticed is that the hp of Nael started dropping really quick around 3 seconds into Nael phase. After Nael died, the group transitioned into the golden bahamut part, but bahamut actually didn't have a vulnerability down and hp down effect. About the results, the group wiped later on to bahamut's fatten. At first, I was wondering if it was a bug or glitch, because if it's a hack, they would probably do in on bahamut too and get their easy clear. But after reading the comments down below, I figured it was probably some sorts of hacks/cheats like some of you pointed out, as there was a similar case about the use of pomanders in Zurvan Ex. If they were using some sorts of hacks/cheats to get world first in Unending Coil of Bahamut, I hope SE will investigate into this case because it is really harmful to all the raid teams out there who actually put in their effort and do the raid legitimately.

DPS dying to mechanics, MT taking vulnerability stacks/not mitigating properly or tankswapping, basically everything that could go wrong went wrong. Part of the problem was my coheal WHM (I was an AST) was not using regens at all. Instead they expexted us to stay stacked all the time so they could top us off with Cure 3, which absolutely gutted their MP no matter how much Ewers I threw at them. After the first wipe I switched to Diurnal because without WHM regens as back up my shields would not be as effective. I pretty much solohealed the fight (and it showed in the parse). Wiped again and the blame game was thrown around, with the party saying that I am a bad healer because I didn't rez the dead DPS (it's not that I didn't want to, but the party continued to take damage and if I stopped healing to rez the party would die) ans the WHM was a lot better. There is only so much shit I can take so I shouted back that I was doing three times more hps than the WHM and the DPS should stop dying so they would actually do more than 2k DPS. They threatened to report me for parsing and then I got kicked out of duty. I know that it's been confirmed that parsing is okay as long as you don't use it to harass others. I didn't mean to harass the party, just pointing out that they could be a little more considerate considering that I had to work my ass off to cover for their mistakes. In this kind of situation, should I just keep my mouth shut and quietly leave? Or are we allowed to use parse numbers to defend our performance? Looking back, I realize that I probably should have just left and taken my penalty. I don't think it's fair if I do get banned over this."
57,vulnerability,ffxiv,Outline for DNC healer; something that would make me excited to heal again.,0,726g6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/726g6t/outline_for_dnc_healer_something_that_would_make/,2017-09-25 03:35:08,"I've been playing FFXIV for as long as it's been out, and FFXI before that. In all those years, I've never really gravitated toward the healing jobs, though I respect their contribution to the party. The only job I ever enjoyed in a healing role is Dancer in FFXI, though it was more of a multi-role job there. The times I did end up as main healer were pretty exciting, and far different than any other healers I had tried. So, I did a bit of brainstorming and put together a mock-up of DNC that would fit within the confines of FFXIV's framework (FFXI made skill bloat into an art form) as a dedicated healer, while retaining that ""combat healer"" vibe. Regarding weapon of choice, I'd imagine a single dagger or maybe a chakram, but it's honestly not that important. Aesthetics are easy to change and don't affect how it plays, it's the mechanics that are really what make the class. However, for the sake of somewhere to start, I'd think that thw quest would be flagged at the Thavnairian embassy, and we'd see further into Thavnairian culture as the job quests progress. Without further ado, the Dancer: Overview: Healer that uses a branching combo system in order to provide healing and build a resource (finishing moves) that allows for healing as well as party buffs. Play should feel akin to a melee dps, but focus split biased on allies rather than target. All abilities have nominal TP costs, cross-classes with ranged physical skillset, Primary stat is DEX. Specific numbers are merely suggestion and are naturally subject to tuning. _______________________________________________________________________________________ Single target DPS skills support 1-2-3-4 order with a base heal (requiring no combo, the cure of the class) plus a branch from each step in the DPS combo for different effects. 1: Cleanse. 2: Area heal. 3: Large heal with decaying damage resistance buff. DoT combo allows for DoT &gt; HoT on party member AoE 2 step damage, branches into significant heal (between basic heal and 3-combo heal). _______________________________________________________________________________________ Finishing a combo builds finishing moves (FM), which can be spent to activate certain buffs and extraordinary abilities. Different FM abilities have different FM costs, FM stack up to 10. Finishing a healing combo grants one FM, finishing full DPS combo grants 3. Use of FM abilities is an OGCD action. Job gauge informs player of number of finishing moves remaining and active samba (red/green color code) FM options: Divine Waltz: Moderate AoE heal; Cost 3 Haste Samba: Increase SS and AA speeds by 15% for allies in range; Cost 4 Drain Samba: A portion of damage dealt is returned as health for allies in range; Cost 2 Feather step: Increase critical vulnerability for target enemy for 10 seconds; Cost 5 Resurrection: Revive a fallen ally; Cost 5 Saber Dance: Inflict damage on a target in proportion to number of FMs remaining. Likely a capstone ability ______________________________________________________________________________________ OGCDs: Fan dance: Its protect Trance: Ability allowing free cast of healing enders without combos for a short duration, does not generate FM. Likely a capstone ability No Foot Rise: Generate 5 FM on demand Twelves Waltz: Large AoE heal, serves as panic button/mechanic recovery.

Feedback/input are, of course, welcome and appreciated. If there's demand for it, I could put together some lore. Brief pros/cons, Good single target heals with excellent sustainability, strong damage contribution, weak at healing through multiple strong AoEs, more dependence on party than other healers. TL;DR: I've never been big on healing classes, because they feel too detached from the fight for my taste. So, I put together something as an example of what I would find engaging enough to get me back into the healing game."
58,vulnerability,ffxiv,Crystal Tower raid refresher guide,239,75esy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/75esy8/crystal_tower_raid_refresher_guide/,2017-10-10 15:44:25,"**CRYSTAL TOWER** With the new 24-player raid roulette coming out in patch 4.1, the following is a brief raid refresher that hits the salient points of all the fights in case the veterans need their memory jogged about a certain mechanic. Currently it is not known how the 24-man roulette will handle level sync and gear sync. While it is most likely that the roulette will simply sync the entire alliance to the highest ilvl of ARR and Heavensward (ilvl 135 and ilvl 275, respectively), thus trivializing most of the mechanics (Syrcus Tower in particular is guilty of this), it is also possible that we will be synced to a point where mechanics will be an actual challenge. **!** An exclamation point in the bulleted point is an important mechanic which should command special attention. If there is anything I should add, let me know in the comments. **Part One: Labyrinth of the Ancients** **I. Bone Dragon** tl;dr version: Add control fight. The Bone Dragon has three Live Phases and two Dead Phases, requiring it to be killed thrice to stay down while the raid manages adds. - MT positions the Bone Dragon on the center platform (some data centers prefer north, but center is usually better). - OTs pull Platinal spawns to the edges of the rooms, to be killed by ranged DPS. Platinals should not die next to each other; they get speed boosts if they come too close to each other. This phase occurs in the first two Live Phases. - (*Trivialized by gear*) During Bone Dragon's dead phase, acid rises. Stay on the platforms and nuke Platinals down before they reach the boss' corpse, otherwise everyone is hit for roomwide unmitigatable damage. - Healers can dispel poisons, but this is not critical. - (*Trivialized by gear*) When the Bone Dragon rises the third time, OTs should pick up Rotting Eye adds and tank them away from the raid. DPS should focus the Bone Dragon down at this point and ignore the adds. Save LB for this point. **Intermission 1: The Walk of Lament** tl;dr version: Raid coordination fight. Each party should take a separate lane (usually party 1 takes top lane, party 2 takes midlane, and party 3 takes bottom lane). - **!** If people start this fight early with too few raiders present, get out and wait for the inevitable wipe before trying again. - **!** At least four party members MUST be standing on the raised button midway down the lane in order to bring down the shield on an enemy lane Atomos. Ideally, use both healers and two ranged DPS. If two ranged DPS are not available, melee DPS will have to compensate. *The button group does not leave the button for any reason whatsoever until the adjacent lane's Atomos is dead, not even to dodge AoEs.* - Lane tanks are responsible for add control and should bring the adds that spawn to a position where the ranged camp can nuke them, but not so close that their frontal attacks will cleave the button group. - Any leftover players (three DPS) should burn their lane's Atomos down. - If any lane wipes, the entire alliance wipes. **II. Thanatos** tl;dr version: Add control fight. Thanatos can only be harmed by groups with the Intangible buff while the other groups fight to keep the alliance from being overwhelmed by constantly spawning adds. - **!** Friendly Magic Pots are placed on the other edge of the arena and must be kept alive by the party's healers. They can be shielded and healed. If all three Pots are smoked, the alliance wipes. - Party A starts with the Intangible buff upon pull. As such, the MT should tank Thanatos in the center. Intangible lasts roughly 50 seconds, during which the group should deal as much damage to Thanatos as possible. - (*Trivialized by gear*) Parties without the Intangible buff should fight the adds. OTs should pick up and tank Nemeses facing away from the raid. - Sandman adds do not respond to enmity and should not be tanked. DPS should prioritize burning any which are tethered to a Magic Pot. - Once the second Intangible goes out, the OT provokes Thanatos and becomes the MT when his Nemeses have been killed. Rinse and repeat. **Intermission 2: The Walk of Fire** tl;dr version: Add control fight. The Allagan Bomb which is the primary target is invincible and gradually grows in size over the course of the fight, exploding to wipe the raid if it reaches full size. To make it vulnerable, destroy the Vassago adds. - Each party's tank must tank a Vassago away from the other Vassago adds, as the Allagan Bomb's growth accelerates if Vassagos are close by. - **!** Allagan Napalms and Balloons will spawn. Balloons detonate if allowed to reach the Allagan Bomb and Napalms detonate if not killed quickly enough. DPS kill priority is Napalm &gt; Balloon &gt; Vassago. Napalms can be tanked by either the party's tank or a DPS without unduly stressing healers. Vassagos also gain Vulnerability Down when Balloons are present. - Napalms and Balloons deal raidwide damage and accelerate the Allagan Bomb's growth if not killed before detonation, which will quickly lead to a cascading wipe. **III. King Behemoth** tl;dr version: Add control fight (notice a theme yet?). The King Behemoth must be steadily burned down while controlling an arena that is constantly damaging the group, as well as avoiding instant-wipe mechanics. - (*Trivialized by gear*) The floor is electrocuted and constantly deals damage to the raid. This cannot be avoided, but can be mitigated. - Four towers are present at ordinal directions at the edges of the arena and should be covered by the healers or ranged DPS. Each tower has three levels of charge and increases the damage of the floor per charge. Discharging a tower removes all charges and inflicts minor damage on the discharger, so towers should be discharged regularly. If towers are destroyed by add damage, they remain at full charge for the rest of the fight. - The alliance should agree on a single MT and a single OT. The MT should tank King Behemoth on the west side of the arena, facing out (north is standard but west is preferred due to Iron Giant spawn positions). - Three Iron Giants spawn during the fight, once at the start and each time after the first two Ecliptic Meteor casts. The OT should pick up the Iron Giant and tank him at his spawn while the DPS burn down the Iron Giant. Iron Giants spawn at north, east, and south, in that order. - Puroboros spawn in pairs from the center and slowly head to a tower. They cannot be tanked, but should be burned before they reach a tower and detonate. - Random players are marked for meteor drops. Meteors do minor damage on impact and leave a Comet behind where dropped. Players should spread out Comets and avoid standing near any Comet until Ecliptic Meteor is cast. - The Iron Giant targets Comets for flame AoE attacks which leave a nasty debuff on anyone standing near the targeted Comets. Healers should cleanse immediately; if the floor damage is not controlled, the constant damage can become overwhelming. - The King Behemoth casts Charybdis, which leaves behind stationary damaging whirlwinds which should be avoided. - Kill priority is Iron Giant &gt; Puroboros &gt; King Behemoth. - **!** At 70, 40, and 10% health, King Behemoth stands up and emotes a roar, casting Ecliptic Meteor. All raid members must LoS the King Behemoth behind a meteorite until the cast is over; anyone not behind a meteorite when the cast finishes will die. This move destroys all meteorites on the field. If the Iron Giant has been allowed to destroy all meteorites, the alliance wipes. **IV. Phlegethon (the artist formerly known as Acheron)** tl;dr version: Positional fight. If it looks bad, don't be in it, and handle his insta-wipe move correctly. - The MT tanks Phlegethon in the center of the arena. - Phlegethon's AoEs will cover more and more area as the fight goes on. - When Iron Claws appear, DPS should switch and kill them quickly. They immobilize a player if allowed to latch on. - **!** Twice in the fight, Phlegethon moves to the center of the arena and begins channeling Ancient Flare. At this point each party must move to its corresponding button (A for left, B for center, C for right) and all three buttons must have at least four members standing on them simultaneously to activate the arena barrier. Failure results in an instant wipe once Ancient Flare finishes casting. Anyone caught within the barrier once Ancient Flare finishes casting will also die. - (*Trivialized by gear*) Adds appear on the buttons once Ancient Flare finishes, burn them quickly before resuming battle against Phlegethon. **Part Two: Syrcus Tower** **I. Scylla** tl;dr version: Battle for survival where orbs need to be properly managed, requiring at least moderate raider awareness. Healers should be aware that healing requirements are often high and unpredictable in this fight. - Most groups tank Scylla in the center. Halfway north is better, to give the raid more room to deal with mechanics. - Assign party A to the northwest lightning rod, party B to the south, and party C to the northeast. - Staves will spawn continuously throughout the fight and emit donut-shaped AoEs around themselves. As they require a lot of damage to destroy and automatically despawn, they should be ignored by the DPS. - Lightning orbs will spawn randomly until all of the lightning pillars are fully charged. Each lightning pillar requires three orbs to fully charge. If tethered to a lightning orb, a raider should run his orb through a non-fully charged pillar. If not done quickly enough, the orb explodes for raidwide damage. - Ice orbs tether to random raiders and cannot be avoided. When they catch a raider, they freeze the raider in place. (Note: anecdotally, party A seems to get MUCH more ice orbs than the other two.) - Flame orbs spawn and tether to a random player. Player should run past a frozen raider and allow the flame orb to strike the frozen player, thawing the raider and leaving a puddle of water behind. - (*Trivialized by gear*) Scylla casts Ancient Flare (long cast time) at regular intervals at around 60-50% into the fight. Raiders should stand in water puddles, which confer very high fire resistance. Ancient Flare deals negligible damage to players in water puddles, but heavy damage to players caught outside, and evaporates all puddles. (Currently it is not known if healers can Rescue frozen players into a puddle.) - (*Trivialized by gear*) Scylla regularly casts Unholy, an unavoidable raidwide AoE to stress healing. - **!** (*Skipped if DPS is high*) Scylla casts Daybreak. As with Phlegethon, each party must have at least four members standing on their lightning pillar to activate a raidwide shield. Failure will petrify the entire raid for a long time (but is not an automatic wipe). This mechanic can be skipped with high DPS. - Adds appear after Daybreak and should be tanked by the respective party tank and burned. **II. Glasya Labolas** tl;dr version: Add management fight with team coordination mechanics. Whereas Scylla is a healer check on gear and skill, Glasya is a tank check on intelligence. - As with Scylla, party A is assigned to northwest, party B to south, and party C to northeast. An inactive telepad is present at each of these locations. - The MT should tank Glasya in the center of the arena and avoid moving him. Glasya has a powerful donut-shaped AoE that can be avoided at melee range or at the edge of casting range. - Clockwork Wrights spawn and empower Glasya. They cannot be damaged until a raider steps into their power zone at point-blank range. Doing so stuns the raider, requiring the rest of the party to finish off the Wright. - (*Trivialized by gear*) Glasya casts an unavoidable roomwide AoE after all Wrights are destroyed, with damage scaling on how much he has been empowered. - **!** (*Skipped if DPS is high*) When three Clockwork Squires spawn, Glasya becomes invincible to damage due to the six generators empowering him. Squires can be reduced to 1 health but not killed until siphoning from the generators. Each party's tank should pick up ONE Squire and move it between two adjacent generators. This will cause the Squires to siphon power from the generators and become killable. The three Squires must be killed before Glasya completes his cast, or else the raid wipes. This phase can be skipped if Glasya is killed before it comes out (roughly three minutes into the fight). - **!** Once the Squires are killed, each party must escape from the center using an empowered telepad. Glasya can be harmed until he finishes casting, allowing the ranged to get off final shots before escaping. Telepads allow the party to jump to the outer circular platforms around the arena. These platforms only permit clockwise movement and the raid should move clockwise, killing the Spanner Rooks on each platform. Once all Spanner Rooks are dead, the fight moves back to the center and Glasya repeats his mechanics. **III. Amon** tl;dr version: Add control fight. Some kiting and positioning are also required. - The MT should tank Amon in the center of the opera house. OTs should pick up any Kum Kum adds which spawn. No one else should ever be in front of Amon, as he has a highly damaging cleave. - Purple tethers occasionally appear, linking a mini ball and a player. The ball will Mini whichever target it hits, greatly reducing damage output and increasing damage taken. Tethered players should run a tethered ball into a Kum Kum to shrink them. - Slime adds spawn in the three corners and ooze towards Amon. If they reach him, they will explode and inflict a debuff on the entire raid (Silence, Pacification, etc.) These adds are suspectible to Heavy and Stun. - Random raiders are turned into frogs and will be chased by snake-like adds named Kichinebiks, which they must kite. - Healers should dispel Aetherochemical bomb debuffs immediately. - Random players are targeted for freezing and encased in ice. Players turned into frogs have an action called Flame Breath which can be used to melt ice. - **!** Melting should not be done on the set of ice right before Curtain Call. Like Ecliptic Meteor, Curtain Call must be LoS'd behind ice blocks, or else the raid will wipe. This mechanic cannot be DPS'd past, unlike Scylla's Daybreak or Glasya's Squires. **IV. Xande** tl;dr version: Mechanics fight that requires the raid to correctly handle each raidwide mechanic. - The MT should tank Xande in the center of the arena with the rest of the raid spread out circularly around him. Be careful to avoid his line AoE, which has a severe knockback. - About a dozen golden orbs appear with a small radius at regular intervals in the fight. If no one is standing in the radius, they explode for moderate raidwide damage. If someone is standing in the radius, they hit only that person for negligible damage. - At 70% and 40% health, Xande teleports out and calls meteors down on the raid. Small attractors should be destroyed before the big one in the center. If the big attractor is not destroyed, a raid wipe occurs. No damage is outgoing at this phase, so healers are free to DPS. - Immediately after returning, a stack mechanic marker appears over a random person from each party. The damage from this mechanic should be soaked by the entire party. After the attack is resolved, an anti-gravity zone is left behind which causes anyone inside to float. - **!** Xande casts Ancient Quaga after the stack mechanic, hitting anyone who isn't floating at the end for very severe damage. **Part Three: The World of Darkness** Note: The World of Darkness was the last raid in the Crystal Tower series and aimed at ilvl 110 players, as such none of the mechanics are too susceptible to being outgeared. **I. Angra Mainyu** tl;dr version: Positional fight. - The MT should tank Angra Mainyu in the center of the room and MUST always keep him facing the same direction. Occasionally Ahriman adds will spawn and these should be picked up by the offtanks, who should stun their casts. - Double Vision separates the room into white and red, each one inflicting a different stacking debuff with damage increasing for each stack. Players should alternate which debuff they have by switching sides each time. - **!** Mortal Gaze inflicts Doom, which kills the player after ten seconds if not dispelled by standing on the lit platform (out of four) in the center of the room. Can be avoided by looking away as Mortal Gaze is cast. - Four Final Hourglasses spawn at the outer quadrants of the arena and should be burned by the DPS. Once the last hourglass is destroyed, everyone should move out of the quadrant targeted for instant death. - When he casts Level 100 Flare, one raider is randomly rooted to the spot and cannot move, and will have a red radius around himself. If an even number of players is within the radius when the cast finishes, everyone inside will be hit for heavy damage. - **!** Level 150 Death works similarly, except it kills everyone inside the radius instantly dies if there are a multiple of three people within the radius. **II. Five-Headed Dragon** tl;dr version: Another positional fight, and winner of the least creative boss name award. - The MT should pull the Five-Headed Dragon all the way to the very north of the arena, facing north, with his back to the wall. Offtanks are not needed in this fight. The raid will need the room to move. - Ice expands and everyone should move away from icefalls. - Slimes should be burned quickly by DPS, and then at least one person must stand in the remaining puddle to prevent more slimes spawning. - A lightning ball symbol requires the ensuing damage to be split. - Fiery orbs that spawn (Prominences) should be burned by the DPS before they explode. - If a bobbing spore appears over a person's head, that person should immediately run away from the rest of the raid to a safe distance. When it expires, the Five-Headed Dragon sneezes at the player, knocking him and all surrounding players up into the air and inflicting a Vulnerability debuff. - **!** Untargetable flamebirds spawn and tether to random players, inflicting stacking debuffs to the tethered player. Taking all of the damage is usually lethal, and the tether should be passed to another player immediately. - Heatwave (cast only once) inflicts Pyretic, causing feedback damage for any actions taken. - The boss' signature attack, Discordance, causes all five heads to become targetable. Discordance's damage and cast time decreases with each head destroyed; as such, the heads should be AoE'd down instead of single-targeted. **III. Cerberus** tl;dr version: Boss management fight. Correctly managing the boss' phases is required to avoid a wipe. - The MT should tank Cerberus facing sideways, to avoid both a frontal cleave and a tailswipe attack. - One offtank should pick up Wolfsbane adds that spawn outside during the stomach phase. Wolfsbanes can quickly kill healers or DPS if loose. - When Cerberus breaks free of its chains, one person is targeted with a Gastric Orb and should place it at a location where it is accessible to a majority of the raid. The orb pulses regularly and anyone within the pulse is inflicted with Mini. Players who have Mini when standing in Gastric Juice will be swallowed by Cerberus and sent into its stomach. Players without Mini when standing in Gastric Juice die instantly. - Within the stomach, one tank should pick up all of the Hecteye adds that spawn. Healers must heal through increasing stacks of digestive acid damage, and DPS should ignore the Hecteye adds and burn through the Stomach Lining. - **!** When the stomach has been burned down, Cerberus is stunned. Two chains must be brought to chain him again before he recovers or else the raid wipes. **IV. Cloud of Darkness** tl;dr version: Long battle for survival-type fight where staying alive is of paramount importance. As such, always prioritize personal safety. Ranged DPS are also equipped to deal with more mechanics than melee. - Whomever is MT takes incredible punishment. Healers must keep up steady healing on the MT. - Cloud of Darkness uses a powerful frontal beam attack whenever she vanishes and reappears. She can appear in one of six positions, but never one that she just vacated. - Throughout the fight, comets will fall and must be soaked by one player standing underneath, or else they hit the entire raid for raidwide damage. The number of comets falling increases as the fight progresses. - **!** Marked players should immediately bolt away from the raid, as they will be chased by a series of blasts that will quickly kill them if it catches up. - When worm adds spawn, one hit will make them despawn. Failing to despawn them causes them to cast a frontal cone of Bad Breath. - When the Cloud of Darkness begins sucking in clouds, they must be burned before they reach her or else her following raidwide attack will be too powerful to withstand. During this phase she gains stoneskins, but they can be broken with sufficient damage. Players can and should stand in front of clouds to afflict them with heavy. - When a trio of clouds spawn surrounded by a hexagonal barrier, each party must enter one and burn the cloud within down. Failure to do so causes the cloud to explode for raidwide damage."
59,vulnerability,ffxiv,Quick guide to Drowned City of Skalla,47,75gj7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/75gj7h/quick_guide_to_drowned_city_of_skalla/,2017-10-10 22:54:39,"While everyone is busy slaughtering each other over Shirogane housing, I ran the new dungeon once, therefore I'm clearly the authority of knowing everything there is to know about this dungeon. Unfortunately, I don't remember the boss names, but eh. Dungeon drops ilvl 315 gear. ***** First boss: First, the edges of stage is a red zone. Standing in it will apply a stacking increased water damage taken debuff. Since the boss' AoE attacks are all water, stay out of it the best you can. This horse has 2 purposefully misnamed attacks, Hydro Push and Hydro Pull. It will jump to a side of the area and cast either one. Hydro Push will PULL everyone towards it, and Hydro Pull will PUSH everyone away from it. Therefore, run towards it during Hydro Pull, and away from it during Hydro Push. During Hydro Push / Pull, it has an attack that drops a water ball on non-tanks, then spawns a ball that chases the person. Has a tankbuster, but it hardly did like 15% of the tank's HP in damage. Has an unavoidable AoE attack with a cast time. ***** Second boss: Looks like an Arahabaki. This guy has a long cone attack, so stay near it to dodge it easier. It also shoots AoEs at non-tanks, so move out of it. Its main mechanic is to summon 4 small versions of itself and go invincible. Destroy the little ones to interrupt his unavoidable AoE attack. After the first set of little ones, this fight will get interesting. It will summon the little ones and will transform everyone into bunnies with 1 ability, to drop a bomb. Everyone should drop the bomb ahead of the little ones to destroy it. ***** Last boss: Oh god this one. If you like Laskhmi, you'll have fun here. First major tip is to stay near the boss for most of the time. First, he has 2 attacks with no telegraph. You will get the message ""boss' name raises its claw"", and ""boss' name raises its tail"". The claw attack will do a cone in front of it and apply a stack of vulnerability. The tail attack will do a cone behind it and apply a stack of vulnerability. It has one of those look-into-my-eye attack that inflicts confuse, like the last boss in Bardam's Mettle. It has a beam attack thing with no telegraph. The boss will turn to face the target. Has an attack that puts an AoE centered around a player. Move away from others. Has a room-wide AoE attack that deals less damage the further from it. Pulses purple circles while casting. Then, the 2 Laskhmi attacks. Grand Cross will target a person and generates a cross attack centering on him. Another attack will generate a doughnut AoE centering on a player. Later into the fight, he will do these 2 attacks at the same time and 1 or 2 or even 3 of the above mentioned attacks at the same time. In my experience, you will generate a full bar of Limit Break about halfway through the fight. ***** If you're wondering, we wiped on the first boss once because it tripped us up on the names. We then one-shotted the second and last bosses."
60,vulnerability,ffxiv,Ideas For a Caster Tank,0,6vbned,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6vbned/ideas_for_a_caster_tank/,2017-08-23 01:11:40,"So all current tanks are melee which limits the play style somewhat. They are all too similar. I'm imagining something radically different. Share your ideas what one may look and play like. Here's mine. Weapon: Baton on each hand, one long and one short. Used to cast defensive and offensive magic. Play style: - Low armor and natural defense. Leather/cloth-based designs. - Relies solely on self-buffs for constant mitigation, e.g. an always-on mitigation stance. - Dancing between magic and physical stances. - Attacks like BLM but mostly melee-range. - AoE debuffs on enemies, e.g. slow/bind/blind/vulnerability up. - Less on reducing received damage, more on weakening enemy attacks. What do you think? What should this tank be called? NOTE* This is still a melee-ranged tank. Not one that kites stuff around. Just that your skills and animations are magic-based instead of swinging around a metallic object."
61,vulnerability,ffxiv,How to make Machinist viable again - from someone who has cleared Omega 4 Savage with it.,7,6qgvd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6qgvd6/how_to_make_machinist_viable_again_from_someone/,2017-07-30 21:20:10,"We all know by now from the amount of posts on here and on the official forum that Machinist currently has issues, it's not a secret. Not to people who play very casual and don't plan on doing savage raids. But to anyone who wants to raid, might it be casual or HC, the question currently is, ""Why bother with MCH when you can bring bard?"" Let's take a look at some numbers, first popularity wise. (These numbers are taken from FFlogs.) O1S currently has 648 Machinist parses, being the least parsed job. Bard has 4262, being the most parsed job with RDM having 2 more. O2S currently has 508 Machinist parses, being the least parsed job. Bard has 3824, now being the most parsed job. O3S currently has 150 MCH parses, 15 more than SMN being the least parsed job. Bard has 1497, again being out rop parsed job. Lastly, on Neo Exdeath, O4S there are 8 MCH parses and 258 Bard parses, making MCH the lowest and Bard the most parses job. What can we take from this trend? MCH is overall very low in popularity. Bard is much more popular and MCH is not played much. But more we can see that the higher we go in raid difficulty, the bigger the discrapancy between MCH &amp; BARD. Some of these MCH parses for O4S are players that cleared with Bard before playing MCH. I'm not going to say MCH is not viable to clear current content as I did that myself, it's just, why bother? Your group will dislike it, you yourself will dislike your dps number and the utility you don't really have. Bard is just superior in so many ways. Now after we've seen that Popularity wise MCH is kind of a dead job (Shout out to fellow SMN players who are in the same position) let's take a look at raw dps numbers. To really compare the numbers efficiently we have to look at the top parses. It shows the dps ceiling for the class, average parses can't be accounted for. On O1S the highest DPS on Bard has been 4.9998 (barely 5k). The highest MCH parse has been 4.5k, a whooping 500 dps behind Bard. On O2S it currently looks like MCH and BARD are equal, which does not make sense as it's again like O1S a dummy fight (no downtime whatsoever) I expect these numbers to turn once people have BIS gear and speedgroups start running. On O3S, Bard is ahead of MCH by again, 500 DPS. Lastly, O4S, Bard again is ahead of MCH by 400 DPS. This makes us question, both are supposed to be support jobs, so how come there's such a huge discrapency in DPS between the two groups? Again the question, why even bother with MCH when you can bring bard. Lastly, let's take a look at the so called utility both classes bring to the raid. Let's start with defensive cooldowns. Bard brings Minne on a whooping 45 seconds Cooldown. This is basically a free convalescence every 45 seconds stronger than most people think. More than that, Bard bring Troubadour on a 180 seconds Cooldown. A 30 Second raidwide help (depending on used with which song) and makes it very strong for phases with multiple AOE wide damages. Mch brings dismantle. A 5 seconds 10% damage down debuff. That's it. It's usefull for big hits (Almagest in o4s) and that's it. Offensive wise Bard brings the following: A 100% uptime 2% crit buff with the songs. Battle voice, a 180 seconds cooldown offering 15% DHIT rate. And Foe, a 3% vulnerability on the boss that consumes Mana. What does MCH bring? Hypercharge, a 120 second CD that gives 5% vulnerability on the boss. In conclustion, MCH neither brings better defensive CDs, nor offensive CDs. Again, no reason to bring MCH over BRD. Now, how can we fix MCH? There are several ways, with priority being to bring their DPS on par with Bard as nr 1 priority. This can be done imo with upping potencies, that would be the easiest way. But there are other ways. 1) Make OH actually worth. Currently it's barely worth overheating for the trouble we get from it. Make it clear if OH is supposed to be used in WF windows or if it's supposed to be a punishing mechanic. 2) Give us more Ogcds. Back in Creator MCH was a blast to play with all of the Ogcds we had, now we have gauss round and riccochet. 3) Change the way Rook Overload works. Make it less potency, don't remove the turret but make it a steady gain instead of a lucky rng hit that can be great from time to time (29k hits I experienced feel amazing) 4) Make Turret shots count into Wildfire There are far more ways to buff MCH dmg but those are some. Now utility wise we need more. We're sitting on a full MP bar throughout the whole fight, why not make use of it? I suggest to give Rook Turret an Aoe that ups either crit or dh or even det for a small consumption of Mana. Or as a shield upping Defensive stats. There's so many ways to fix MCH, and it needs to be fixed. Bard will become stronger and stronger with how crit scales and how their Kit works. The job is already dead, so it at least needs to be rewarding for those that decide to play it. "
62,vulnerability,ffxiv,Big Problem with PUG vs. Static / Watching guides,0,6raw2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6raw2p/big_problem_with_pug_vs_static_watching_guides/,2017-08-03 18:12:46,"Hey there, yesterday it hit us hard. We are a guild raid group and tackle o3s right now. Sadly our MT is ill for this week and we decided to fill up his slot in party finder. Our static does not watch guides, because every single boss comes down to memorising pattern. Watching guides is generally a bad thing and here is why: The first Rnd we got was Samurai. O2S: our tactic is to always let the 4 dds go up at the top/bottom stack marker. This Samurai ignored it 3 times and gave us all vulnerability. After the wipes he left saying: lol it's a practice group. Next Rnd was a DRK Tank. We told him MT always goes North and OT always goes South at Mechanics like Tentacles. He said no OT has to go East and left. This continued on until we finally got a WAR who told us that he will adapt and we got him the kill... So one guy who didn't even had the kill was able to adapt while other pros were not. As I said, we don't know PUG tactics but we know how the mechanics works. I remember in ARR at T9 everyone could tell me where they had to go but no one could tell me why. This is a serious problem as to people leave groups cause of wipes without even knowing why they wiped. Am i right with this? What are you experiences with this issue or do you think there is no issue at all? "
63,vulnerability,ffxiv,How I would improve Machinist,0,6rmk6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6rmk6s/how_i_would_improve_machinist/,2017-08-05 04:44:29,"Just some personal thoughts. - All weaponskils (bar Cooldown) raise heat by 10. No +5 when under 50, just a solid 10. - Hot shot increases damage dealt by a nice and simple 10%. - Gauss Barrel is now a trait. If you're over level 52, your heat gauge is there, if not - it's gone. No more reapplying Gauss Barrel after overheating - you overheat -> you're locked out -> you're back in at 0 heat. - No more +5% damage buff on Gauss Barrel. Working out the benefits of overheating would be more straightforward - i.e. no more -5% for 10 seconds. - Overheat damage buff raised to 20%. - Flamethrower now instantly sets heat to 100 (i.e. overheat). This means that you don't have to worry about your heat level when Wildfire is coming up. Oh I'm at 50 heat and Wildfire is up? no problem - tap Flamethrower and i'm overheating. A quick jet of flame from the gun and we're off. No weird dps loss. - Flamethrower potency increase to, say, 100. It's gotta feel good for adds right? - No more turret on the party list. Turrets don't need health. Instead, small turret icon appears on the job gauge. When Hypercharge is used, the turret icon glows with a countdown. When Overload is used, the turret is greyed out. No more looking in 3 different areas to see the status of the turret. - Dismantle recast down to 60s. - Hypercharge vulnerability effect up to 10%. - Tactician and Refresh now have the pvp 'flare gun' animation. No more butt wiggle. - Just a thought, with the removal of the apply Gauss Barrel ability, there would be room for another action. The job doesn't need one but perhaps Lead Shot could come back. It could combo off Hot Shot - what with the 30s timers and all, and give you something to do after overheating instead of spamming your pea-shooter. - Finally, please give us the option to /remove the aethero-lunchbox. And while you're at it, make the Gauss Barrel toggle server side :) Thank you very much for reading. I'd love to hear some thoughts."

How you guys feel WAR is doing after the patch? Comparing DRK and WAR in dungeons i noticed i was very busy with WAR managing all the cooldowns and combos/gauge to keep me alive (Like, the HP bar fluctuated like crazy unlike DRK who gets its HP drained steadily + blackest night gives some breathing room with big pulls and other stuff) About numbers, well with DRK offtank i struggled to get any DPS above 2200~2400 in extreme primals while with WAR i reached +3.1K peaks if the boss doesnt moves a lot (otherwise it drops to 2.7k) while this is good i am afraid of the assumed ""frailty"" when it comes to swapping, stance dancing, taking tankbusters or dealing with a stack of vulnerability in some cases. Normal raids are not an issue since i usually dont have to tank swap and the damage is a lot lower. What do you guys have experienced? Any tip from other WAR mains? I have yet to clear V3S and im progressing with my RDM atm since i think its a job a bit less strict. Oh and btw since i havent seen the skill speed thresholds for SB yet, do WAR needs skillspeed again?(currently sitting with 2.40 GCD) Like back in HW we had to get some to be able to do the triple FC / have a bigger time window to do 3FC to not get screwed by mechanics. Any tip, experience or insight is welcomed, thanks!"
65,vulnerability,ffxiv,My take on a possible The Emperor battle in the second tier of Omega,0,6sb2nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6sb2nf/my_take_on_a_possible_the_emperor_battle_in_the/,2017-08-08 14:07:12,"So, as Exdeath was the final boss of the Delta patch cycle, I have my hopes up for some FF2 love, since it rarely gets any. I made up a scenario where you fight the emperor as the final boss of the raid cycle, hope you guys like it! The Emperor (Normal Mode) 100-80% HP: This is ""classic GBA boss phase"". He Will cast Haste VIII on himself at the beggining then combo with Thunder X, a cone like AoE at each positional (front, rear and flanks), once at a time, in random, so everyone must keep an eye out to dodge when it spams. He will also cast Slow IX (party wide debuff) followed by four Thunder X, wich will spawn at his front, hear and flanks, giving small space to be safe. If you are afflicted by slow and takes damage from Thunder you will get a vulnerability stack. 80-60% HP: This will be the ""Trap Master"" phase, and will be based on his Dissidia skills. He will cast Landmine 1, wich will conjure three bombs midair wich will explode in contact; it will be impossible to be hit by them at this point, but they will remain on the field. He will then use his tankbuster, Dynamite, wich will apply a fire vulnerability debuff, and tank swap will be needed. After a while he will cast Landmine 2, wich will spwan on the ground; he will follow this cast with Thunder Crest, an circular AoE around him wich causes repeated damage and paralysis. If the party members escape Thunder Crest but don't mind the Landmine 2 they will trigger an explosion wich will send them midair in the direction of the Landmine 1 location, wich will result in death most of the cases. If the party dodges Thunder Crest and Landmine 2, allthe traps will disappear and he will reset this phase until he hits 60% HP. 60%-50% HP: The DPS Check Phase. Several Light Crests will appear in the North, South, East and West locations of the arena, and will send magical bolts to the nearest player. Meanwhile The Emperor will be invincible and will began casting Tornado. If the party focus on one Light Crest for too long the other three will explode, potentialy causing a wipe. The tanks should pair with the healers, and the remaining DPS should pair up too, to focus on all Light Crests at once. If the DPS Check is successful Tornado will cause moderate damage and the phase transition will begin. 50-15% HP: Emperor of Hell Phase: The arena will change to resemble Pandaemonium and The Emperor will proclame himself ruler of Hell, transforming himself into his final boss incarnation from FF2. His tankbuster, Flare XVI, will need to be shared by both tanks to avoid a vulnerability stack, and it will HURT, so healers will need to shield and act quick. The Emperor will use a multitude of status ailments on the party, Blind XVI on the dps, Silence XVI on one healer and Curse XVI on one of the tanks. Curse will cause disease and bleeding, and must take priority on cleansing, healers will have to toggle between using Esuna and healing the party. Starfall XVI will be an party-raid damage spell wich must be shielded; if the tank has too many vulnerability stacks, he will die. This phase is all about coordination and minding the status effects, and healing through great damage. 15-0%: UNGAHHH! In his last phase the emperor will lose his aggro table and will target ANY member of the party with physical attacks. Each attack will give him 5% more health, and if he reaches 50% it will be a wipe. It will be scary to see him getting health back, but the mechanic here is not to burn him asap, as everyone will get a quicktime button-mashing event to get the ""Blood Weapon"" buff. If everyone succeds and attacks (With cooldown, OGCD's, spells or even auto attack AT THE SAME TIME he will die in agony, banished to the pits of hell. Duty Complete! If you guys like this I will do the Savage one! Leave your toughts :3 Also, sorry if my english is bad, it's not my mother language."

I started off as a Lancer and eventually turned into a DRG at level 30 and got it to level 60. As I was enjoying this game so much, I got one of my friends to play this game with me, so I decided to level a sub-job to be able to level with him so I went with Ninja. Today I have both jobs at level 60 ( yes I'm not level 70 yet, I'm sorry if i sound naive ) and I find NIN a lot better than DRG. By better I mean, they are more mobile, they have very similar DPS numbers and to top it all, there's no kit under DRG's belt that will out class ""Trick Attack"". Trick attack is so god damn useful dungeons are a joke. Now don't get me wrong, you may call me a ""bad DRG"" but i have more hours put into my DRG and I can tell you, i'm really a try hard when it comes to optimizing my game play. I start off with Heavy Thrust, get all my buffs and debuffs going and Jump as much as possible. But even doing all this, I see NO reason whatsoever to pick DRG over NIN. Yes they have Chaos Thrust for dmg over time, yes they have piercing damage debuff, they have Blood of the Dragon, but in my opininon, I find Trick Attack more useful than all these combined. Only because i can cast it more often, and the Vulnerability Down debuff is just that good. I want to like DRG better, I want to main DRG, because I like the class better in general for looks, astetics and I find that they fit the game more than Ninjas. But please, give me a valid reason why I should go DRG over NIN. Thanks in advance, and I'm sorry if i sound ignorant. "

Lance Mastery is such a ridiculously good trait, and it honestly makes the class play in a way that I felt it always should have. Also, making Full Thrust always go into Sharper Fang and Claw, and Chaos Thrust always go into Wheeling Thrust was another really good change, because dragoons always had to stand in an awkward spot between the side and back to be able to hit positional moves in a timely manner. This coupled with the removel of Gierskogul reducing BotD by 10 seconds made keeping BotD up in combat much easier. However, most combat won't last long enough for LotD to ever make an appearance. Making Heavy Thrust always last 30 seconds was a really nice change for when I get put in early content due to roulettes. However, for high level content, LotD is honestly more of a thing that I treat as a nice little treat I get every once in a while. This is coming from someone who is definitely not a casual, so it's not mechanical issues. Due to down time in combat, we simply just lose our BotD, as well as our stacks. I have tried refreshing BotD with half a second left by casting it again, and for most primals that still isn't enough. For a Sophia EX run yesterday, we had like *FORTY THREE* seconds of down time for her phase swap. I had two seconds left after refreshing a 30 second BotD gauge to do anything, so I just fired off my Gierskogul and Nastrond and got another one in, because that's all I could do. My biggest gripe with BotD is that it isn't super rewarding to keep up, even though we and monks are the only melee classes that have to keep our base gauge up. Warriors can build beast stacks, go make a sandwich, get married IRL, come back, and still have their stacks and get a fell cleave off. This wouldn't be that big of a deal, but our entire level 70 big dick power move (that isnt even that strong) is tied to keeping BotD up for around 2 minutes. Long story short, eyes need to be reworked in some way. Maybe keeping eyes separate from BotD and letting us hold eyes even when we lose BotD goes down. Some other suggestions: * They could give us eyes for things other than Mirage Dive, why not reward properly placed positional with eyes? Why not reward casting Dragon Sight with an eye? There's 2 eyes right there, a right and a left. * Eyes could be an ammunition system and they could let us hold more than 4 and have us use 1 whenever we fire a Nastrond off, and give Nastrond a much shorter cooldown. This could make DRGs have really good temporary burst if they store up a bunch of eyes and fire off like 10 Nastronds in quick succession. * They could make Fang and Claw apply a bleed or damage debuff and Wheeling Thrust apply a vulnerability debuff since SE wants DRG to be a melee utility class. * They could even experiment with making it only take three eyes to go into LotD, this would reduce the buildup time to a little over 1 minute. * I personally hoped that LotD would make Fang and Claw and Wheeling Thrust have higher potencies or extra effects, but sadly they are unchanged. * LotD could make all of our recast times for our base combos much shorter, that way we can get more burst in from our base rotation * Marking an ally with Dragon Sight and casting Nastrond could maybe make them also shoot a Nastrond These are all just suggestions, obviously they would need to be tuned. TL;DR: LotD sucks big dragon dick and for a mechanic that DRGs are supposed to base their play around, it is very weak. Furthermore, actually getting LotD to proc just isn't feasible for a lot of content due to combat downtime. "

Here's a quick guide to how to deal with them: 1. Add Tiles - Boss will summon non-targettable adds that cast a round AOE around them. At this time the boss will also cast a narrow conal AOE on each player's position. This can cover a good chunk of the room. To avoid this mechanic, it is probably ideal for all players except the MT to stack at a spot not covered by the round AOEs to let the boss put them in a single line, then move out of the way to evade. 2. Rock Tile and Ice Tile - From what I've seen, the Ice Tiles are the safe tiles as she will cast an earthquake like attack on all transformed rock tiles. The Ice Tiles are always in a diagonal through the room. MT should position boss between the Ice Tiles to give ample space for DPS to position. 3. Aetherial Tear - When you get sucked in, each player needs to ride the sand waves towards the exit before the meteor drops. The pattern has always been the same in all of my 5 attempts. 4. Role Tiles - 4 tiles in the center will have icons corresponding to each 3 roles, 2 for dps and one each for tank and healer. Stand on your correct tile. 5. Frog Tiles - 4 tiles in the center will have frog icons. Every player needs to stand in front of the boss to get hit by a cone AOE transforming them to frogs, then stand in the frog tiles to avoid a room AOE."

They start small and when they flare up and get bigger they're about to explode. They apply vulnerability. Downburst (tornado in the center) can move these, knocking players and the flame spheres away from itself. Do /not/ run into downburst's circular AOE, stay outside it. It will hit a tank for 88k. (heh.) The ground becomes icy during these sometimes too, causing you to slide around. Ramuh's lightning circles, don't stack with these. Twin Fang or whatever it's called, is a shared tank buster. Kind of hits for peanuts though. The lightning tethers the OT and MT together. Frontal line attack, easy to avoid. Charbdys sets all HP to 1, cannot be avoided or mitigated. Roar is a raidwide light-damage. This guy is kind of tank and spank with some AOE dancing. Give yourself plenty of distance from the flame orbs that spawn, and when they start to get knocked around it's easy to avoid the first set, then the knock back happens, and you run back towards the center to avoid them. If he's doing this on the edge of the arena, stack on the wall next to the boss then scatter to avoid clipping ramuh levin circles while dodging the second set. Boss likes to pair charbdys with roar later on. Just heal through it. Tanking is easy, but keep him away from center orbs that first spawn. Oh and tanks keep in mind: Likes to weave in animation-less cast-less tankbusters that hit for about 20k in tank stance unmitigated otherwise. Happens frequently and hits like a truck. I swear I've seen it crit but maybe not. **Fight 2** This guys is weird. Earthquake, epicenter, the wierd purple floor goop that gives the six feet under debuff. Use your extra action for all of these, before cast bar finishes or before you sink into floor. Has a gaze attack that petrifies. ~~The light attack is odd, I haven't figured out the first pattern that spawns but from there-on it seems to me that the exact center where all the lights overlap is safe. Often pairs his gaze attack with this.~~ Standing in purple light means you must be levitating to be safe. White light is ground level. When there is massive overlap, the exact center is safe. Do not be levitating for the aerial launch when he flings you into the air. Tentacles: They'll begin to wriggle. The one that stops wriggling first is 'safe', run towards and behind it all the way to the wall. Has a tankbuster, though the name escapes me, it hits kind of hard but not that often. **Fight 3** This lady is fun. Ribbit: Frontal Cone AOE attack that turns you into frogs. Casts this almost first thing into the fight. Watch for when she turns and get behind her. She will aim this anywhere. Blizzard Blade: Circular AOE that freezes you, get out. Medium range. Thunder Blade: Line AOE, haven't seen anyone hit by this, but easy to avoid. Fire Blade: Donut shaped AOE like Sophia's Thunder III. Center (In her hitbox) and the outside is safe. Large radius. Holy Blade: Marks up people with spread markers or stack markers or both. Spread/stack appropriately. The Game: Turns the floor into either Role Icons (Blue shield, Green Cross, Red Sword) or Frog Icons. If they're role icons, stand on the one appropriate for the class you're playing. If they're frogs, she's going to use ribbit soon. Get hit by it then stand on the panels. She often pairs ribbit with this for the role icons, so be careful. If you're a Samurai for example and you get hit by ribbit, you'll still get punished even if you're standing on the DPS panel. Dark Piece place untargettable adds on the arena that make AOEs, first time it happens the center is safe. She pairs this with thin cone attacks targetting each raid member. Avoid them, they knockback and apply vulnerability. Dark piece can also place them on the outside of the arena, when this happens pop sprint because there will be ONE safe square to get to when they initiate their attack. When the board changes to blue/black, The Queens Game will hit everyone not in a blue space with damage and vulnerability. Stay on the blue tiles. Place Piece summons a dragon. It has a frontal castless cleavebuster that applies vuln. Off tank picks it up and drags it so he is standing on a blue space, the dragon is facing away, and the dps can stand in a blue space too. Dies quickly. Forced March, Left Face, Right Face: Force march makes you walk forwards, wherever you're facing. Left face makes you strafe left, and vice versa for right face. She pairs these with movement based mechanics so angle/position appropriately. First time you see it is after the dragon add. If it's forced march, aim yourself along the diagonal blue squares so you end on one. Left face, turn to be 90 degrees (perpendicular) along the blue line. Later she'll use these with a holy blade stack. Everyone should stack behind the boss facing her exactly. The holy stack blows up soon after (similar to thordan's knockback+stack). As soon as it detonates she hurls a lightning blade towards you guys, so scatter left and right. Aetherial Tear: Transports you to team rocket's hideout. Sand tiles will shunt you in the direction they flow. Walk out into the sand and attempt to make it to the tear across the arena. **Fight 4** This guy is annoying. Watch his model, when he's casting a spell while sucking in void magic, the spell changes. THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE CAST SPELL, ONLY ALTERS IT'S EFFECTS. Doom: At the start of the fight he puts DOOM on two targets. **one of the healers must have esuna for this** (ty /u/SpiritualRemains) Blizzard: Puts AOE circles out that make icebergs. This hurts. Void Blizzard: Move continually, you want to be actively running in any direction when the attack hits or you get frozen and vuln. Thunder: A tankbuster that stacks lightning resistance down Void Thunder: A massive AOE attack centered on the boss that stuns and gives 40s+ of paralysis afterwards. Fire: Marks up several players who will detonate for AOE damage around them. Spread as appropriate. Void Fire: Places Pyretic on everyone (Maybe only some people?). Using /any/ actions while you have this will hurt like a motherf-. Vacuum wave: Contrary to it's name, this knocks you back a considerable distance. Holy: usually the follow-up to vacuum wave. Stack to share damage. Please try to run this to the bosses's butt if you can. After a while he begins the 'true fight'. The center gets marked with a meteor marker, run away from it. After it detonates all the walls on the arena fall off, you can now fall to your death. A giant head spawns in the center, who will do a wide angle conal AOE that makes you a zombie with no control that attacks friendlies for a sizable amount of time. The center where the head spawns inflicts a bleed. (Ty, /u/Ven_ae) After the meteor blows up sprint towards the center and look for which way the head is facing. Try to get behind it ASAP. From here mechanics are repeated but he adds in Black Hole that spawns many aetherial tear looking things. This is like the 2nd boss in the Vault. These void holes deal heavy damage and give vulnerability. Be mindful of them as you dodge other attacks. Be mindful of vacuum wave here, to avoid falling off &amp; hitting black holes. He will summon tentacles with cone AOEs facing outside and a meteor in the middle. Find the missing tentacle and stack on the very edge of the arena. If you're just behind a cone AOE, it will hit you for 32,000+ (I was a tank, so probably more) The fight repeats after this. Have fun everyone and I will update this soon or add a link to a more detailed guide when one becomes available. Please feel free to correct me and add info!"
74,vulnerability,ffxiv,What are your Savage Mechanic Predictions?,22,6lejis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6lejis/what_are_your_savage_mechanic_predictions/,2017-07-06 01:00:29,"Heres my predictions- What are yours? ---- #Deltascape V1.0 ###Alte Roite ----- 2. Cyclone - Reversed down burst - pulling the party and outer edge fireballs into the middle of the arena. 3. Comet - Drops Comets on players, and we have to use them to keep cyclone from sucking us into the orgy of exploding fireballs in the middle of the arena. 4. Twinbolt - Inflicts vuln on the primary target necicitating a tank swap 5. Encircle - High damage to all targets. Permanently removes anyone who is killed by it from the battlefield preventing raise. this would follow charbydis in place of roar. the same fight, just with more punishing mechanics, and an added layer onto the pushing of fireballs. ----- #Deltascape V2.0 ###Catastrophe ----- 1. 1000 G's - Deals massive damage and inflicts heavy to anyone under the float status - used just prior to summoning the tentacles to punish anyone who mis-floated. 2. Tentacles - Tentacles now All earth quake, but they do them staggered where it becomes possible to dodge them by running around the arena. 3. High/Low AOE - Two simultaneous stack AOEs are launched- one High, one low, requiring half the party to float, the other half to not. 4. Shatter - kill any petrified targets. this just becomes a more intense version of its original fight- just changing up how tentacles are handled, as well as the punishment for using float at the wrong times. ----- #Deltascape V3.0 ###Halicarnassus ----- 1. Reverse Polarity- Used during the game to exchange the position of players. one dps Panel and the tank panel will exchange anyone standing on them, and one dps panel and one healer panel will exchange anyone standing on them. deals heavy damage and inflicts vulnerability to anyone not standing on a job tile. 2. Seduce - seduces the primary tank 3. Kiss of death - instantly kills the target if they are seduced. 4. Trap Floor - Exchanges a tile on the battlefield with a Warp trap, transporting anyone who touches it into the endless desert trap 5. Grand Meteor - Summons a grand meteor- Instant death to anyone still remaining on the battlefield. 5. Spike trap -Changes a tile on the battlefield into a spike trap. anyone who steps on this is inflicted with permanent bind, and a bleed effect. Rescue can pull player off of the spikes. 5. Comet - Summons a comet on a random party member. Destroys spike tiles if the party member is standing on it. deals damage to all nearby party members 6. Bottomless trap - removes a tile from the playing field allowing players to fall to their death. Functions as the Enrage mechanic. eventually there will not be enough tiles remaining to survive forced march. 8. brain jack: Chaos- forces the healers to flee in a random direction (since the battle field will be shrinking, fleeing a random direction would be particularly fatal. this fight becomes a fight purely about positioning and timing. you will literally be playing a game with halicarnassus, and you have to use her own attacks against her to win. E.G. she will continually summon new spike traps onto the battlefield- Proper handling of the comets keeps them from flooding the battlefield. you have to counter her grand meteor by running into the endless desert traps, and you counter Brainjack:Chaos by intentionally stepping onto a spike trap, and your tanks are forced to swap to counter kiss of death. ----- #Deltascape V4.0 ###NeoExdeath ----- This will be completely different. instead of it just being a rehashing of the exdeath fight, we fight the fully transformed neo-exdeath. if you watched the final CS- exdeath got sucked into the void instead of being deleted by omega. cannonically this is how exdeath becomes Neo-exdeath. you defeat him and the power of the void consumes him transforming him into neo-exdeath. if you remember yoshi's comment on 'expanding the raid story via savage', he said he was thinking about it, but didnt want to create a situation where you missed out on story for not completing the savage version. its possible they went this route so no story is lost, but we get a new boss fight that sort of functions as a pseudo expansion of the story.

81,vulnerability,ffxiv,"Can we talk about how DRK got a 2 minute, 115 potency ability and some other things?",173,6ezkt6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6ezkt6/can_we_talk_about_how_drk_got_a_2_minute_115/,2017-06-03 15:24:16,"Hello, I've been a lot on DRK now that we've got the new tooltips from the media tour. Most people seem to think DRK is rather good. I'm here thinking its actually not very good. And this is not only because PLD appears to be 30% ahead of DRK in potency with way more mitigation, but rather because the new changes seems to quite bad frankly. Let's start with the new abilities! * **Delirium** Delirium is a 120 second cooldown ability, which extends the duration of Blood Weapon and Blood Price with 8s and 16s respectively, generates 2400 mana and costs 50 gauge. Blood Price being locked behind grit makes that part almost worthless outside of dungeons. The gain from extending Blood Weapon 8 seconds results in 7 extra hits in a normal scenario. This means 7\*480+2400 (5760) mana gained and 21 blood gauge recovered. This is 2.4 Dark arts or 336 potency, the lost Blood Gauge is worth (29/50)\*(380-250) (75.4) potency. This is equal to a 260.6 potency gain if you get full uptime on the extended BW. When all is said and done, its a convoluted, glorified 2 minute, 260.6 potency cooldown. Sadly I cant edit the tidle to reflect on this error. Edit: As someone has pointed out, delirium would be 127.6 potency if one would calculate the time gained from faster attacks in BW. 140, if one calculates slashing vuln up into it as well. It is still bad. Someone also pointed out that I had to subtract the average cost of a GCD for the Bloodspiller before I calculated it, which is entirely correct. * **Quietus** You would want to use this move you will be in a situation with trash mobs, and thus would be in grit and have access to Blood Price, which nets you 5 gauge per hit taken. The potency of the move in grit would be 128 without Dark arts and 168 with it. Due to Blood Price giving back 4800 mana for every 50 gauge, this is move will more or less always be used with Dark Arts, which makes this a good tool for extended periods of trash mobs, such as dungeons. Delirium is also significantly more powerful in this situation. It is also worth noting that incase one has 17 enemies aggroed, using Blood Weapon and tanking out of grit will result in unlimited casts of Dark Arted Quietus. But for a raid scenario, the discussion about Quietus is mostly a footnote. * **Bloodspiller** Bloodspiller is a 380 potency Weapon Skill which increases to 475 while in grit. Dark Arts adds 140 potency, pushing base potency up to 520 potency, which increases to 650 potency while in grit. It costs 50 gauge. To start off with, the grit bonuses just equals out to ignoring the penalty while in grit. While the move is your highest potency move and it is worth using when available in our rotation. However its hardly good compared to a move we lost: Scourge. Since they fill the same kind of function in our rotation, I do think its a fair comparison. Every 45 Seconds we will generate enough for 2 Bloodspillers. This means at 4:30 wed have used 12 Bloodpillers in and 9 Scourges in 3.x. The former is worth 4560 potency, the latter is worth 4500. But thats more potencies for the Bloodspillers! I hear someone say. You also lose an entire Souleater combo, which is worth 750 potency, meaning the standing of the moves is actually 3810 vs 4500. Values with slashing up is 4191 vs 4590. The average Bloodspiller in this scenario is worth a total of 399 potency against the Scourges 510. It needs at least 30 extra base potency in order to break even with Scourge. * **The Blackest Night** The Blackest Night is an Ability with a 15 second CD that costs 2400 mana. If used on self it shields for 20% of your maximum HP and shields for 10% if used on an ally. When it expires it generates 50 gauge. On a hasty first look, it looks rather good. A defensive utility which also grants a free Bloodspiller or Quietus. If one sits down and does the math, one is bound to be depressed. Due to the low potency of Bloodspiller, the shield is actually a potency loss on average. This is because for each use of The Blackest Night and useage of the consequtive Bloodspiller, one delays the combo one step. This means that every 3 Blackest Nights used is a lost Soul Eater combo, which is 750 potency, as previously established. In addition to this, we have lost 7200 mana from activating the ability, which in turn is worth 420 potency. This totals to a 1170 potency loss, compared to the three 380 potency moves gained, totaling on 1140 potency. Every 3 Blackest Nights used is thus a 30 potency loss on average. If one wants to do slightly more complex math each Hard Slash pushed out of a rotation this way is a 90 potency gain, every Syphon Strike a 80 potency lost and every Soul Eater 40 potency lost. Since weapon skills are lost in reverse order when pushed out of a rotation, assuming one would have ended on a souleater, you will never gain potency from using The Blackest Night. The only times The Blackest Night is a gain is if you would have ended up using a Hard Slash as last Weapon Skill on a boss or if you push a single Syphon Strike and a Hard Slash out of the rotation, in which case it would be a 90 potency gain for the former and a 10 potency gain for the latter. Any further Blackest Nights used than those two is a personal DPS loss. To never lose potency from utilizing the skill, Bloodspiller would need at least an extra 120 potency added to its base amount. Due to these things, it is a defensive CD with a very situational upside which is mostly a problem which ties back into that the base potency for Bloodspiller is really bad. For generation of AoE damage, it is actually not quite as bad in that you need 3 or more enemies for it to be a gain in potency to use, not counting any effects grit might have. **Things We Lost** We lost a fair few skill in the ability pruning, most of them was actually quite bad to lose for us as the damage lost was never made up somewhere else even though the utility was. Much of these changes was made in the interests of raising the skill floor and lowering the ceiling too. * **Blood Price** Being gated behind grit is perhaps the worst thing to to the job and if it wasnt for the fact that Darkside no longer continuously drains mana, it would have been devastating to the mana management of DRK. Sadly the removal of drain from Darkside removed the penalty for mismanaging mana other than being low on said resource when needed to pick up adds. * **Dark Dance** It might have had one of the more disliked abilities on DRK amongst the general community, but it was still a very good one, not for its defenses but for the chances to parry which results in more low blows and reprisals. * **Reprisal and Low Blow** While we did not lose the utility of the two skills, we lost the damage. Together they represented between 3.5%-5% of our total DPS in a normal scenario, which is made up by the increased damage Darkside. * **Delirium** Delirium was the other combo finisher which lowered the targets int with 10% for 20 seconds. It had its base potency moved to Soul Eater, which makes the difference in damage from the loss of the combo option 0. While the removal of 10% less int is a bit sad, these effects were removed across the board and not just removed from DRK. * **Dark Passenger** Due to the mana cost being increased to that of a Dark Arts and the potency being at 150 means that it is only worth using in burst windows where you cannot push more Dark Arts into weapon skills as slashing vulnerability will increase the worth of a Dark Arts to 154. Against multiple targets and in parties without slashing vulnerability it is still better than a Dark Arts. * **Scourge** The dot with a 100 initial hit and 400 potency over 30 seconds. It is a skill which was incredibly powerful when managed right and was usually between 6 and 7% of our total DPS. The closest thing to a replacement we have is Bloodspiller, at a tiny bit below 4/5ths of the potency over the course of a fight. **Conclusion** DRK lost a fair bit of complexity, the new gauge is not a management aspect apart from using the new Delirium once every 2 minutes, which means that when you have have 45 seconds left on the CD you should not use a Bloodspiller unless you risk capping out at 100. The mana management aspect was also almost entirely removed as there is now no real downside to bottoming out on mana other than not being able to efficiently pick up adds whereas in the old world it would have lost the player 15% damage and locked them out of several abilities. While this was done in order to raise the skill floor so that newer players would have had an easier time to play, it also completely removed the DRKs mana management aspect as the drawbacks of mismanaging became entirely marginalized. The new Gauge also is entirely devoid of interesting decisions as the the three spenders have three very strict times when they are of use. The Blackest Night is an undesirable skill for two reasons, the first is that it already increases the already spammy environment of the DRK, which was one of the main complaints I heard in my circles, the second is related to Bloodspiller being bad which i sincerely hope is fixed by the release of SB. **Additional Notes** Average Potency Per GCD compared to the other tanks, this more or less translates to DPS once all is said and done, more is better. WAR has 458.7 potency/GCD, DRK has 430.6 and PLD has 562.5. That is 30% more potency for PLD than for DRK and 22.8% ahead of WAR. The difference between DRK and WAR is much smaller with WAR being 6.5% ahead of DRK. It is not quite the same % differences in practice for DPS, however unless formulas has changed a lot compared to now, they are good enough as ballpark numbers. This is a very clear disparity between them with the current numbers. The things I have brought up does not attempt to solve this disparity, but rather to solve the problems that exists within a vacuum. This disparity however is something which absolutely needs to be changed and that definitely needs to be looked over by square and confirm that it does not have damage disparities similar to the potency/GCD disparities. There is also a picture in japanese of Sole Survivor gaining its PvP effect for PvE, which while it would be a good ability is extremely boring and once again adds nothing to the jobs playstyle. It also potentialy creates an undesirable situation where DRKs main selling point would be a large raid damage increase rather than the rest of the kit. Finally, while I have done my best to guarantee accurate math, there is a chance that I have made errors, if you spot any, please tell me so that I can correct it. edit3: fixed some math calculations which were off and spelling."

Riddle of Earth is still crap. Or it negates using Tornado Kick. Either way, it just doesn't really work in a raid setting. But the benefit MNk has gained comes from two things: 1. Skillspeed will now reduce the Autoattack Delay, meaning you hit faster. With how much of a melee's damage coming from its autoattacks, this is an increase in MNK damage over all. The trick will be in determining by how much will SS affect AAD. {Nyepels Lux} have an AAD of 2.56s (meaning you autoattack 23 times a minute, which amounts to 39 pot/s). If we reduce AAD by the same rate as SS does cast/recast (at level 60; this should change as we level) and we have a SS gain of about 300 (over the 345 base; for me, now), we should expect a recast reduction of 0.45ms, on top of the 15% reduction, for a total recast time of 1.7s and a potential AAD of 1.73s. This gives us 34.8 autos a minute, or 58pot/s, which is a pot gain of almost 20/s. Again, if they reduce by the same value. 2. The other thing is about Brotherhood. I've heard a lot of people knocking this skill, and it's been based on either misunderstanding what the ability says, or misunderstanding how potential damage in a fight works. Brotherhood does two things, one of his is just a gimme to the MNK, and the other is a benefit to everyone. It grants 5% damage increased to *everyone* in the party, rather than something like increased crit rate, which can wiff, but it's not as good as vulnerability increases (but pairs well with it). The other effect is that now everyone who performs a weaponskill on the boss (tanks, other melee, RDM during its melee combo) icreases your chance, per party member performing a hit, to grant you Chakra. This gives you the potential of a full Forbidden Chakra use every other GCD, including your own Deep Meditation trait, which seems to provide a Chakra on crits. What all this ends up doing is that the MNK is now attacking for a *lot*, and a lot more often. But, you may say, Riddle of Fir-- And there I must stop you. Because all Riddle of Fire does to your cooldowns is it [edited portion] makes your *weaponskill* recast time longer. Your autoattacks and off-globals aren't affected by RoF. So it's staggering the recast benefit of your GL, but not the haste benefit, so you are still AA fast, and now have the opportunity to doubleweave without clipping your GCD. Plus you're doing 30% more damage on top of all the other gains. With all of your damage multipliers up at once, this increases your damage by a flat 56%, an added bonus from RoF to 86%, from Brotherhood to 96%, and the damage gains from AA haste (a 30% increase to about 60% of your damage) will throw this well over 100% bonus during this phase. MNK has a slow wind up, and that's not changing, but it looks like the floor on the sustain will increase and the burst after the windup will go up. Of course, it will ""feel"" slower since you won't be hitting as many buttons during the RoF window as you feel like you should be doing, and I get that. Potencies of several attacks have been reduced, including off all of the main WS, removal of a DoT effect, shortening of another one (which merely cleans up the rotation, since the extended time on Demo was an issue that had to be resolved by sometimes taking Fracture). TP should be much, much less of an issue at higher speeds, due to the loss of ToD, the RoF window imposing a small slow down, and the potential to more readily turn Chakra into Purifications. But you're doing more damage."

86,vulnerability,ffxiv,What do you think about FFXIV's responsiveness?,102,6bpq1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6bpq1a/what_do_you_think_about_ffxivs_responsiveness/,2017-05-18 02:18:36,"TL;DR: What do you think about FFXIV's general responsiveness? Would you welcome a change to FFXIV action usage to be more client-sided? EDIT: r/Anidamo expressed FFXIV's clunkiness at higher than exemplary latency very clearly in their post: &gt;Pretty much the only change I think needs to be made to the combat engine/netcode is that the global lockout timer (the timer on all skills that forces you to wait 0.75 seconds after inputting one action before you can use another) should start the instant you press the button, not when your client receives the ACK packet acknowledging that you pressed the button. &gt;I don't know exactly how the system works so I'm speculating, but it seems like the 0.75 second timer does not start until your client receives a response from the server acknowledging that you initiated an action. As a result, it ends up being more like 0.75s + your ping, roughly. With a 2.5 second GCD, you only have 250ms of leeway to double weave (0.75s * 3 = 2.25 seconds, or weaponskill, oGCD, oGCD), so as soon as you have more than ~70ms or so it becomes very difficult to double weave without clipping a bit. ________________________________________________________________ After the server move, there are a lot of players who have much worse Ping than before; and many who have much better. That's to be expected. Ping is an integral part to online games. That's obvious. But some games handle Ping better, and some worse. I'll be blunt: FFXIV handles Ping worse than some cheap free KMMOs I've played. I personally feel that FFXIV is abysmally unresponsive. If you have anything other than exemplary ping and close to no dropped packets, you get to deal with the following: * Moving targets are more difficult to hit, as melee abilities start then stop if you aren't inside of the target * oGCD ability queueing is entirely tied to latency, meaning some people can double weave seamlessly, and others clip into more than half of the next GCD * Buffs/Debuffs need a tick to apply, or the next GCD used after them will not benefit from them unless you wait a moment (best exemplified with using Bio then Fester or Bane) People often cite the vulnerability to hacks that client-sided ability execution would make, but considering we've had several high-profile cases of people editing game files from the client to give themselves faster GCDs or using Pomanders outside of PotD, I don't think this argument holds much weight. I think if FFXIV's ability execution were made to be more client-sided, much of the game's clunkiness would evaporate instantly. __________________________________ OFFICIAL FORUM post: URL "
87,vulnerability,ffxiv,Feast Season 4: PvP Beginner Tips and Common Mistakes,141,62afjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/62afjq/feast_season_4_pvp_beginner_tips_and_common/,2017-03-30 10:46:57,"Lots of new players in the new season of the Feast ranked. With chat removed and so many new players, a lot are making mistakes that I cannot help correct them on unless they are on my server. So in hopes that maybe some people will see this, I thought I'd try making a general 'tips and common mistakes' thread. -------------- **Use your PvP Skills!** Open up your skill window, go to the PvP tab, and look at those skills. Read their descriptions, become intimate with how they will work in your burst rotation/peel/healing. Put them on your hotbars and get ready to use them. Too many buttons? There will be some PvE skills that are completely useless in PvP. You can make room on your hotbar by removing some of these skills. For example healers can remove all offensive spells (except one with effect like Stella and Stone) and Cleric Stance which gives plenty of space for PvP spells. Tanks can remove stuff like Provoke and Foresight (Foresight just doesn't work in PvP, do keep other defense buffs). Less used skills can be placed onto a different hotbar so you can click them once in a while. PC players I recommend making a macro to swap between your PvP and PvE hotbar setup. If you are brand new to PvP and these new skills, I recommend practicing them in 8v8 mode first so you can get used to them and learn how they will work with your other skills in the grand scheme of things. **You can use Purify on allies.** Purify is a PvP spell that removes all debuffs (most, but pretty much all). It is an absolutely godly spell, and it is important to remember that you can also use it on your teammates. This is important especially if you are up against WHM/BLM. They will often sleep your healer when their team is bursting yours, and a healer's purify is not always up. If you see a healer asleep when damage is being taken, especially if they use the ""Purify not ready!"" command, their purify is on cooldown. Purify them to wake them up lest your team gets killed. #DO NOT WEAR DIADEM GEAR. This is the biggest mistake that I've seen people make. They enter Feast with pure pink Diadem gear. Unfortunately with the way scaling works, wearing pink gear essentially makes it so your gear is useless. Secondary stats, instead of getting synced to the cap, get synced down to 0-9. Put on some other gear. **How to gear up?** Unlike what you may think, wearing full Garo 235 PvP gear is *not optimal*. Feast and Shatter are item level synced down to i150. This means that as long as you are wearing i190 gear, or i180 PvP gear, your secondary stats will be capped out as best they can be. Therefore, the optimal way to gear up is to find gear that is i180 PvP or i190 higher with the secondary stats that your class appreciates, and no useless parry or too much accuracy. For example, I play a healer and good substats for me are Piety and Spellspeed or Crit. So my set is a mix of gear from different ilevels that gives me Piety and Spellspeed. I have the i180 PvP hood, and the i270 Shire coat, because those gives me piety and spellspeed. I also wear a Fending accessory and reallocate my stat points into vitality so that I hit 10k hp. I recommend any healers make sure that they are at 10k hp. You can wear two fending accessories or one fending accessory and reallocate your stat points. You will get attacked a lot and it is vital that you have extra HP to survive, especially from stuff like the Melee Limit Break. You will want to research or ask what stats may be best for your class. For accuracy, you want to reach 410 accuracy synced. I think that may be done with two accuracy accessories. **ALWAYS give the Adrenaline potion to the Melee.** If your team successfully manages to take the Adrenaline box, the Adrenaline potion will become available. If you are not a melee, ignore the item completely. Melee limit break is too powerful for the melee not to take it, unless they are literally AFK. **Who gets the Wolf's Heart buff? It is situational, but generally...** The biggest thing to remember about Wolf's Heart is that it is a buff, and if you die, you lose the buff. Therefore, it is best on classes that can survive well. Healers can generally make excellent use of the buff, as it will give them great survivability due to haste boosting their heals and almost infinite mana. Warriors and other tanks are a safe bet as they can survive really well to make maximum usage of the buff. Monks can pick it up and do fine with it thanks to their Fist of Earth giving them boosted defense so they do not die as easily as other DPS. It is risky on other DPS as they are more frail and prone to dying with it, wasting the buff. If you find that your DPS are doing fine surviving, then it is fine for them to have it. **Make careful use of stuns.** Stun is a hugely important CC effect. And like every CC effect, it is subject to diminishing returns. That is, people will become immune to the effect after it is used on them 3 times for a minute. CC is very important for bursting an enemy down, to neuter a healer, or to stop an enemy's burst. Because of that, you should *never* throw around stuns when nothing is happening. You are only setting yourself and your team up to have some trouble when they try stunning later. If you are a WHM, don't cast Holy to stun, you are not helping your team. **Watch the medal count.** The main mechanic around Feast are medals. This is how you win and lose games. When someone dies, they drop half of the medals they have. When you have 150 medals, you get 1 stack of vulnerability called ""Heavy Medal"". This number increases as you pick up more. This means that you want to watch both how many medals you have before you pick stuff up, but also how many medals the enemy has so you can tell at a glance who is vulnerable. I recommend keeping the Feast team window open and off to a corner so you can see this. Ideally, don't pick up more than 1 stack if you aren't a tank. Be sure to help pick up coins if the tank has 4 stacks of Heavy Medal or if you had died, since if you died you'd have less medals and can safely pick up medals without overstacking (unless its a huge drop). [Review the Feast page here, which includes and explains some of the advanced rules of the Feast including medals and at what count you get stacks](URL **Watch your Line of Sight** Remember that though walls, pillars and trees will help cut you out of line of sight of enemies, they will also make you out of line of sight of your healers too. When getting focused, make sure that when you are kiting defensively that you also keep track of where your healer is so you don't accidentally cancel their cast. **Sprint costs no TP** In PvP, sprint does not cost any TP. So use it! Use it to flee, or use it to chase and get a killing blow! **Don't be discouraged if you don't play perfectly, but always look for room to improve.** Sometimes you'll play badly, you'll make silly mistakes and it sucks and someone might go ""Nice Job!"". They may even send you a whisper after the game. Don't get discouraged! Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone has to start from somewhere. However, make sure that you are self aware of your play. Ask yourself if there was something you could have done to fix the situation, or how you could have played better. If someone whispers you giving you advice or calling you out on what you did wrong, don't get defensive. You must learn to take advice and criticism, both in the game and in the real world. Even if they word it a bit mean, think about what they said and how you could apply it to future games to better your play. I enjoy recording or streaming my games and asking for advice looking back at the videos. You are the only person who can improve yourself, but you have to take the steps to do so. #Are you a tank? **Don't pick up the defense buff!** As a tank, you are already hard to kill and people won't attack you if you don't have stacks picked up. The defense buff should be left to the DPS as they will be the ones who will get focused by bursts at the start (healers too, but healers have more ways to help themselves survive so its better on DPS usually). **Your job is to pick up medals, but not too many!** Since tanks are the most defensive, they are the ones who are tasked with picking up the medals and handling the brunt of the ""Heavy Medal"" debuff. However, it is important to remember that there is a limit to how many you want to pick up. The *maximum* amount of medals that you want to pick up as a tank is 200, that's 4 stacks of heavy medal. If you pick up any more than that, you become a free and easy kill to the enemy. Once you have 4 stacks, or the enemy drops an amount that would push you over 200, let someone else pick it up. Click the ""pick up medals"" button if need be. Only take them if it is obvious no one is going to get them in the absolute worst scenario. **Swap to your defensive tank stance when you have 4 stacks of medals.** Once you have 4 stacks of heavy medals, you want to switch to your tank stance. At 4 stacks, you are about as squishy as a DPS. You want tank stance so you do not get as easily bursted. You will do less dps, but it'll be a bigger deal for the team if you died and gave the enemy team 100 medals. **Full Swing? Ideally used when your DPS are bursting** Full Swing is a godly skill that makes whoever it is on squishy af. This means that you only want to use it when your DPS are bursting or very heavily pressuring someone. Putting it on the target can mean a sure kill, unless they purify it. On the flip side putting it on someone that no one is attacking is useless. #Are you a healer? **Blizzard II is your best friend.** Regardless if you are playing WHM, AST, or SCH, Blizzard II is an amazing skill that you will want to have cross classed. It is a very handy bind that is a small aoe around you instead of being targeted. This makes it ideal for running behind a wall from an enemy, and pre casting it while they run to you, binding them when they arrive. Or for a quick cast of it (Swiftcast is a cool thing to use with Blizzard II in a pinch!) when you are surrounded to get away to recover yourself. It has no cooldown, and is the only bind that AST and SCH get, whilst WHM though Fluid Aura is godly, they need to target the enemy which can be troublesome. Learn how to use this skill to help peel for yourself. But you must also be aware of the enemy's resistance to bind if you use it too much (or have a drk in the team lol). **Don't worry about overhealing.** In PvE, you see your ally at about 80% health, you'd just cast a Cure/Benefic instead of a Cure II/Benefic II. In PvP, you don't want to do this unless you are 200% sure that that ally isn't getting targeted. Damage comes out very quickly, and very heavily. By the time you finish casting your baby Cure your ally may have already dropped to 50% or less HP. If you are starting to cast a heal when they are already that low, it may already be too late. **NEVER use PvE raise.** NEVER EVER use the PvE raise. Remove it from your hotbar, replace it with the PvP raise ""Divine Raise"". Divine Raise on cooldown? Just let your ally respawn. Using the PvE raise gives weakness, which the PvP skill does not. Weakness is a gigantic deal in PvP because your team needs every little bit of damage and hp they can get to kill and survive. Giving them weakness makes them almost useless for that minute or so that it is on them, and also makes it extremely easy for them to get killed again. #Are you a DPS? **Be careful of Blood for Blood.** Blood for Blood is a great offensive cooldown that gives you a great boost in damage. However, it has a secondary effect that is often forgotten: it also increases the amount of damage *you* take. If you pop Blood for Blood while you are getting attacked, or people swap to you after you pop it, you will probably die. Therefore, make sure you have a macro that removes the Blood for Blood buff off of you. If you are new and having trouble keeping your awareness of the enemy targeting you, I'd even recommend not to pop the buff at all until you are more used to the mode. On the flip side, if you see an enemy cast Blood for Blood, remember that they are also frail! Go for them if the opportunity arises. **Burst &gt; Sustain** Healers in PvP are strong. But they are strong for a reason: DPS in this game have a large amount of powerful OGCD, instant cast skills which they can multiply its strength with buff upon buff. Unlike PvE, you are not aiming for a strong sustained DPS over time. Healers can heal through that. You want to burst instead. Save up all of your OGCD and offense boosting buffs and use them at the same time. You want to get everything down in the span of a few seconds, to give the healer little time to recover. --------------- These are just a few points that came to mind while typing this out. If you have any questions or recommended points I should put up, or I said something completely misinformed and wrong (I sure hope not!) feel free to let me know! If you are new to PvP and really want to get into it, I highly recommend joining the Tryhard Discord. It is filled with a number of really good PvPers far better than my mediocre butt who can give great advice when you want to delve deeper. They can get a bit rowdy, but they are generally nice people if you are open to advice and criticism.

Removing the chat feature in feast has been both good and bad. The good: Less arguing to distract people from the match. No personal insults. The bad: I've never been depressed by the words ""Nice Job"" and ""Thank you"" before Feast. Had no idea people could be so mean with pleasantries. Also, it's impossible to help people improve unless they're on your server and willing to listen. So take this as a voluntary ""Tips"" guide for new feasters. I am by no means a Feast Maestro, and there are a few jobs I've yet to try out in there, so if you see anything wrong, feel free to point it out with pleasantries. This list is assuming you understand the basics of feast - if you don't, head over to URL for some comprehensive guides. **Tanks** **Warriors:** The biggest thing I see with warriors is them going off on their own to Full Swing their own target. Please don't do that. DPS will usually pick a target before the match begins, and that 20%(enhanced) damage reduction is a nearly guaranteed way to burn that target down if the DPS are good. Another tip is to not be Holmgang-shy. The two best times to use holmgang are: A. catching someone behind a wall, preferably a healer. B. Pulling a DPS in during the opponent's retreat when their healer goes down. Also, since you don't need provoke in Feast, consider throwing mantra onto your bar. That extra curing may not seem like much, but your healer always appreciate the boost. Also, don't be allergic to Storm's Path. It's quite wonderful in Feast. **Dark Knight:** Don't spam unleash. Remember that people build a resistance to bind after a while, and if a healer can't blizzard 2 there way out of a bind(I'm so sorry), they're going to be in a tight spot. Plunge and tar pit are wonderful moves to aid retreat kills. Don't forget to delirium casters when you can if you don't have a monk in the party. **Paladin:** Cover is the most useful thing in the world. Clemency is obviously great to combine with divine veil, so don't be afraid to throw in a few MP combos after you use it. The main issue I see with Paladins is them spamming Royal Authority over Rage of Halone. That Str down really makes a difference on Monks and Dragoons. Tempered Will can be used to cleanse bind. Your job is primarily crowd control, and you will be using quite a bit of shield bash. Use Spirits Within on the healer. Fully max Testudo **General tank tips:** Coordinate full swing with the DPS's main target. Purify your healer if they get slept or hit with full swing. If you can help it, never get more than 4 stacks of vulnerability, and once you do, switch to your defensive stance. Don't spam stuns, and use weapon throw to remove sprint from players running away. Don't forget to distract the healer when the match calls for it, although there are times when it's best to just 3 v 1 somebody down. Remember, even though you have almost chance of soloing a healer down, there are little things you can do like silences, stuns, and holmgangs. It's far more difficult on the healer when he has to heal himself and a DPS instead of just the DPS. Make them sweat. And remember, foresight doesn't work in feast. Your limit is best used to counter opposing LBs and to help the healer when their MP is low. **Melee DPS** **Monk:** You probably took one ilm punch off your hotbars for PvE. Put it back in. It's wonderful. Also, don't spam your stuns. Don't forget resistances. If you're using it to burst someone down, that's fine, but you can ruin a healers day with a well-timed Shoulder/tackle or steel peak. And on that note, shoulder tackle is absolutely a monks best tool. Try to use it at the perfect moment. A box trick at the start of the fight - Shiftx2 snap, shiftx2 snap, shift x2 snap. Greased Lightning lasts longer in there and let's you start with GL3 without having to use Axe kick immediately so you can save it to interrupted a burst. Its VERY important to fully buff Axe Kick and Somersault, because 50% spell speed minus Somersault is wonderful against white mages and scholars. Swap to fists of earth if you're being targeted or you have the lead and the fights almost over, abuse mantra, and don't forget about Enliven. If you get bound, instead of wasting your purify, recharge your chakra. Make sure to keep dragon kick up on casters whenever possible. Also, arm of the destroyer will make a black mage hate your guts. **Dragoon:** Feint is grossly underused in Feast. There's not many statuses more annoying than slow, and often times, you'll catch a trigger happy player willing to waste their purify on it. Skewer the casting DPS when they pop raging strikes. Few jobs are better at finishing off an opponent, and Elusive jump will save your life many times. **Ninja:** I know absolutely nothing about ninja. I'm not even sure if trick attack stacks with Full swing? If any Ninja pros read this, please chime in! **General melee tips:** You have the best Limit, and as such, you need to be sure to get on the adrenaline crates ASAP unless there's somebody about to die. Also, LINE OF SIGHT. You need to be aware of where your healer is at all times because it's likely your fault if you get stuck behind a wall. I understand getting caught up in the chase. Another thing is to use any and all survival tools at your disposal if you're being focused. You may think it's the healers responsibility to keep you alive, but there are moves at your disposal to help. As such, use Fetter Ward wisely. At the beginning of a fight before people start their bursts, during retreats if your healer goes down, or if you're chasing the opposing team - these are the best times for it. Make yourself a crit/det set, make sure you have 410 accuracy, and learn how to master the melee limit. Sometimes you can't stop the paladin from shield bashing you, but if you try limiting an opponent with sprint on and a stun resistance and you miss, there's a good chance you cost the match. I never attempt to limit without a bind or stun up on my target, and I never limit the healer unless I know attunement is down for them. Most important of all: /statusoff ""Blood for Blood **Caster DPS** **Black Mage:** You have the benefit of being the most overlooked DPS in the game. A lot of times, teams will kill a black mage at the start and then completely forget about you for the rest of the match. This is, of course, their doom. Sleeps are the most useful spell in Feast, and if you can organize it right, you can completely take the opposing healers out of the opening bursts. It is worth throwing thunder up on someone every now and then because a thundercloud proc is your best DPS when you have to move around. Do not forget manaward/wall if you're getting focused, and master Aetherial Manipulation if you haven't already. Don't forget blizzard 2 and lethargy, and always equanimity when you get a chance to raging strikes. One last tip: I once read about putting a face target keybind on your mouse. I think it was in Vespi's guide. If you can google Vespi's black mage guide, I'm sure you can find much better tips ni there. **Summoner**: Tri-bind might be the best retreat tool in feast and a good way to force an early purify. Even though you wont use Miasma 2 often in PvE, the healing debuff is great in Feast. Throwing shadow flare on a ley lines or bubble can be a nice trick, too. Don't be allergic to Ruin 2 when your mobile, and aetheric burst those melee whenever you can. Eye for Eye is WONDERFUL when someone is being focused down. A well-timed Bane can force some early purifies too, and some healers will get overwhelmed by 4 HP's dropping at once. **General caster tips:** Most groups are going to come after you early. As such, make sure you get the defense supplies. Abuse sprint, as you have plenty of mobile spells like scathe and ruin 2, and watch out for the walls. Do your best to follow your melee's lead, because they're usually the ones putting out the most uninterrupted damage. Its absolutely vital that the DPS work together, and with you being the main target for the opposition, you'll end up spending a fair amount of time trying to survive and crowd control. **Ranged DPS:** **Machinist:** Without a doubt, the most annoying DPS to kill in Feast. You have everything... Blank, distance stuns, bind, knockbacks. When I go melee, I very often let the machinist take both supplies, so don't be shy about grabbing both if we back off. You guys have the best ""kill-shot"" moves outside of scathe so that extra power is nice to have. If you haven't already learned from PVE, feint is a must-have for when your gauss is still and you're forced to move. Not just that, but the slow, while not as powerful as Dragoons, is very-very-very useful. Foot Graze is my favorite move. If you can catch a healer behind a wall, GG if their purify is down. Typically you'll use head graze more than suppressive since you're never going to be a primary stunner as a ranged and don't want to build their resistance, so time it on the healers just right to stop a big cure. Dismantle and Rend Mind are useful tools to weaken a burst. Between the Eyes is one of the strongest moves in feast, so be sure you're using it right. **Bard**: The king of the killshot. With Bloodletter's quick procs and Misery's End, Use Warden's Paean often on your healer. Protip: Always use swiftsong at the start of the match to reach crates so we can save sprint for the battle itself. Blunt Arrow the healer when you can interrupt a big cure with it. Use Flaming Arrow over Ley Lines and heal bubbles. **General Ranged DPS Tips:** One thing I see a lot of bards and machinists do that I wish you'd stop as a melee: please don't use blast shot or Blank on the target we're fighting unless you're reasonably certain it's going to kill them(Or they're about to kill you). You're also responsible for keeping an eye out on the healers MP. If a battle lasts a while, you can guarantee that the healer is going to run low on MP at some point, especially if they don't have the Wolf's heart. You have abilities on cool down for that, and I'm sure they won't hate you for throwing up a turret or song for a little while when the time is right. Some bards will absolutely snap at the idea of playing Mage's Ballad during a feast, but honestly, when the choice is 10% less damage or death, I'm going to choose the former. And, as I said for melee, /statusoff ""Blood for Blood"". **Overall DPS Tips:** Make sure to get those adrenaline crates before the enemy. You don't have to finish them off, just do the majority of the damage, and make sure your Melee gets them. If a Melee plays correctly, he can easily get 2 limits in per battle. One of the DPS needs to choose which target to take out. Please, please, work together. If somebody calls ""Attacking ranged"" or marks them, just attack them. If you're attacking your own target, they're never going to go down. WATCH MEDAL STACKS. I shouldn't have to say this, but I can't tell you how often I see DPS attacking a caster without stacks when the Dragoon is running around with vulnerability on. Likewise, you need to be ready to pick up a stack of medals yourself when the tank has reached 4. Don't overdo it. Don't kill the same DPS over and over. You'll get a few medals at a time, but you'll get far more if you kill the DPS that hasn't died yet. That black mage may be terrible and run behind walls all the time, but if he's only dropping 12 medals at a time, it's time to shoot for the other DPS and get 50. Watch your healer's statuses. There's no shame in being safe with your purifies if you see the ZZZ's on your healer. Sometimes the tank's purify is down, or maybe they're unaware of their ability to purify others. I don't know. But support your healer at all costs. #1 Rule of DPS: If your healer dies, RETREAT. **Healers** Let's just get into the disclaimers now. Healer is the most important job in Feast, and as such, you will be blamed for EVERY loss, even when it's not your fault. You will see tons of ""Nice jobs!"", you are the player most likely to be harassed if someone is on your server, and you will be stressed. A lot. If you have a thin skin, don't do it. If you are a bad healer, please don't go into ranked feast until you're comfortable in 8v8. If you have a 20% win rate, chances are you are not very good at feast yet, and you need to get some more practice, because at the end of the day, you're not just screwing with your ranking, but with other peoples' rankings as well. I don't say this to be mean. It's just general advice. If you feast often, you can generally predict how a much is going to end up just based on who is healing for the teams. Make it competitive and practice! With that being said, Feast rewards healers well for their burden. You have the quick queues, allowing you to rise in the leaderboard fast, and since the match is typically designed around how good the healer is, this offers you the best chance of winning the season rankings. And the commends. P:&lt; **General healing tips:** 1. Let me start by saying that you are the general in PvP, not the tank. If you are low on MP, let the party know to pull back. If you don't trust the DPS to go after Supplies or the Wolf's Heart, let them know a few seconds in advance 2. Attunement can be canceled early, but if you do that, make sure you have a stun or instant-cure ready to go. 3. Don't stop moving! You need to master mobile casting and use sprint like your life depends on it. Walls are your friend if a ranged is on you, but don't cut yourself off from your own spells. Hug walls when you can. Focalization is a must-use if you're being targeted. 4. Blizzard 2 is your most useful tool for surviving. Use it often. 5. Retrogradation isn't just an AoE cure. It also removes buffs and debuffs. If you can use it to ruin an opposing healers day, do it! 6. Fending accessories. There are a few, like the Makai Neck/Wrist that have Crit and Det so you don't lose secondaries. Some healers are capable of surviving in full mind, but generally, you want at least a pair of these. Remember, it's not the power of the heals that gets people killed so much as it is the speed in which the cure is delivered. 7. Paladins are buttheads. Be wary of them. A good bind and sleep can stop that stun barrage they're going to hit you with at the start of the fight. 8. Save Purify for yourself. Max it immediately. 9. At some point in the fight, a Melee will probably limit you. If you're at that point where Limit breaks are up, keep yourself topped off if the DPS are on you. 10. TRIAGE. Some parties are just extremely good, and there will come a time when you have to choose between healing one of your teammates or the other. If the Black Mage has died 3 times and the Ninja hasn't died, but they're both low, cure that ninja first. He has more medals. And of course, the tank takes priority over all. If he dies, you're probably going to lose the match. **Astrologian**: Don't spam aspected benefic unless you want to run out of MP quick. Remember that you can start the fight in Diurnal to get Regens up and then switch to Nocturnal. All about preference here, I've seen some Asts cure the whole match in Diurnal. Stella is a good tool when you're being chased. You also want to use Luminous fairly early so it's up again in time. If you draw a spear with your second card, don't be afraid to cast it on yourself. Having a spear up for Celestial and Luminous is a great thing. Also, don't forget about light speed! If multiple people are on you, pop light speed, celestial for a stun/extension, and laugh maniacally as they pound away at a full HP healer. Last but not least, SYNASTRY! Such an underutilized move. **Scholar**: I didn't want to lead off with this, but on Saturday night, I went into a PVP with a scholar doing all the wrong things. First off, use Eos. Second off, PARK your fairy. If you're moving, your fairy is going to chase you. Combine Rouse with whispering dawn, and remember that Fey Covenant doesn't work in feast. Indomitability is best used as a counter to Caster LB, and if you sense a melee LB coming soon, be prepared to keep Adlo on yourself. I'm far from an expert scholar, so interested in hearing any other tips people are willing to offer. **White Mage:** Since white mages don't have shields with their cures, they were given abilities to make up for that handicap: Namely, Sacred Prism. No PVP ability is better. Max this immediately. You also have tons of self-survival tools: Blizzard 2, stone for heavy, and best of all, Fluid Aura. You can completely take a DPS out of the match with a fluid aura + repose; just make sure it's not the DPS being targeted. Don't be afraid to use Tetra and Assize often, and use Shroud of Saints relatively early so it's up again before Wolf's heart. Presence of Mind is one of the best tools when you're being chased. [For another great guide, check out Mekose101's. Way better heal tips than I gave xD](URL Divine Seal Regen + Medica 2 at the start of the battle can drastically help with surviving those initial bursts(especially if you get slept/stunned). You want to try and refresh these whenever you get a break from spamming cure 2. Last but not least, repose gives you your biggest advantage over shield healers. Use it well! So yeah, just a general breakdown of what you should be doing in feast if you're on that job. I know this isn't the most comprehensive guide out there, but I just wanted to create a ""one-stop shop"" guide if anyone's interested in using it. Feel free to leave tips, feedback, corrections, or anything else. o/ "
90,vulnerability,ffxiv,Class choice summary,0,65f60b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/65f60b/class_choice_summary/,2017-04-15 06:55:54,"So far, with relatively limited experience in the various FF14 classes, I'll like to dump here a list of reasons why one might want to play the various classes, together with a barrage of links as to stuff people might want to read as references for those classes. This is to save other new players from the free trial the trouble of searching for all of the resources separately. And also to save me time whenever I forget opener rotations after changing classes from the nth time. As all classes in FF14 are playable at once there is no need to play multiple characters - one character can max all classes and swap at will, though some players might want to hold on to a stack of stat resets for the inevitable SMN&lt;=&gt;SCH switches. In keeping with my usual style of playing *everything* in every MMO I've completed so far, I'm playing all classes here as well, though some of this might be useful for players who would prefer to choose one class in advance to main. I made none of the content in the links. ***** **Tanks** This role involves attracting and holding aggro from mobs as a first priority, damage mitigation as a second priority, designating targets for DPS players to focus down as a third priority, positioning targets to expose their backs towards the rest of the party (and their front cone AoEs away from it) as a fourth priority (URL URL and maximising personal DPS as a final priority. ***** **Gladiator(GLD)/Paladin(PLD)** Highest non-cooldown survivability of all the tanks. Uses both MP and TP, but more of TP and can run into TP starvation issues. Very high threat generation. Lowest DPS. Essentially no AoE potential. High threat may be a good thing in light parties since you're unlikely in the extreme to get aggro dragged off you, but a bad thing in full parties where a PLD in offtank mode may steal back aggro by using their max damage rotation. Image guide: URL **Marauder(MRD)/Warrior(WAR)** Highest single-target damage out of all tanks. Uses only TP. Good AoE potential, but TP-dependent. Can use abilities for either damage or tanking, but not as competent at balancing both as DRK is. Generally the offtank spot holder. Text guide: URL **Dark Knight(DRK)** Highest AoE potential of all tanks based on MP pool. More single target damage than PLD, but less than WAR. Similar mitigation to WAR, but have more self-heal. Can deal nearly maxed damage while operating as main tank. Little or no TP problems. Text guide: URL ***** **Healers** This role involves keeping themselves alive as a first priority, tanks alive as a second priority, dps alive as a third priority, reviving dead players as a fourth priority, activating mechanics (lamps, etc) as a fifth priority and doing DPS of their own as a final priority. In general clearing damaging debuffs should be done first, then applying heals over time, then applying spot heals - though the priorities will change if members are critically injured. ***** **Conjurer/White Mage(WHM)** The earliest healing class, WHM are also the strongest class at healing specifically. Though no current endgame content is said to be difficult enough to really require this much healing in proper groups, it can be useful for safety if dealing with inexperienced players, or if the new expansion shakes too many things up. In particular, Fluid Aura can be used to punt a ranged mob into the melee zone if your tank does not drag melee into that mob, used to punt away a mob (and sleep it) if your tank overpulled beyond your healing ability or used to punt a particular turtle in a guildhest towards the endzone (and interupt its AoE at the same time). This is also the most infuriating ability around if WHMs don't use it properly, including but not limited to punting mobs outside attackable zones leading to time wastes while the mobs slowly walk back. Text guide: URL **Scholar(SCH)** The highest personal DPS healing class, though it comes with pet management shenanigans that require you to do a little micromanagement. Has a lot of DoT spells it can drop on targets while healing, and an empowered Virus. Focuses more on damage mitigation than it does actually healing. Image joke guide which somehow works: URL **Astrologian(AST)** Due to the number of buffs this has, it increases party DPS the most, even though its own DPS in a solo context falls behind the scholar's. More RNG-dependent than the other two. Base text guide: URL Text guide (dependent on other party members): URL ***** **Ranged DPS** In general what separates this from melee DPS is that positioning is generally not a thing. They generally do not do as much damage as melee, but also take less damage than melee due to the increased distance, and can maintain much of their damage while still mobile to some extent. To balance out the reduction in DPS relative to melee, most ranged classes have some form of buff mechanic, and tend to be more reliant on RNG procs or DoTs, while melee DPS classes tend to do more of their damage upfront. ***** **Archer(ARC)/Bard(BRD)** While initially one of the most mobile classes, it is later turned into a caster hybrid of sorts with Wanderer's Minuet in exchange for its mobility. This class greatly increases the longevity of the party in sustained fights, although it tends not to do as much damage as most other DPS classes. Text guide: URL **Machinist(MCH)** Like the bard, except while the bard does semi-consistent damage over time, the machinist does damage in blocks of overpowered DPS, before reverting back to a longer period of inferior DPS. Machinists tend to be better suited to bosses with invuln mechanics and the like where they can time their bursts for the vulnerable periods, while bards kind of coast along the whole time. Class suitability depends largely on the encounter. Highly reliant on off-global cooldowns, which may be difficult for high-ping players. Text guide: URL **Arcanist(ACN)/Summoner(SMN)** The current king of AoE damage in the game, and highly mobile for a caster. Not particularly good at dealing with overly weak trash as most of their abilities are DoTs, but extremely good against bosses with summons where the boss's DoTs can just be duplicated onto the summons. Can act as off-healer in a pinch. Also one of the best candidates for casting instant revives as main healers tend to use Swiftcast for other things. Text guide: URL **Thaumaturge(THM)/Black Mage(BLM)** Similar to SMN in that it also mixes high AoE DPS with high single-target DPS, but is better at single-target DPS. Will never run out of resources. Can act as off-healer in a pinch. And like the BRD-MCH comparison, the BLM is a burst damager while the SMN is a more reliable form of damage over time - so the fights in which MCH &gt; BRD are the same fights in which BLM &gt; SMN. Also, AoE Sleep gives this class the ability to greatly reduce chances of wiping when an inexperienced party runs. Text guide: URL ***** **Melee DPS** Positioning is generally key to making these classes do their ideal damage, though the Ninja is kind of an exception to this rule for the most part. These do the best single-target damage in the game. ***** **Pugilist(PUG)/Monk(MNK)** The Most Positioning-dependent class. Monks take time to ramp up to their highest damage potential, but when they do, they outdamage everything else in existence if used from the perfect positions. Their debuff affects only themselves as there is no other blunt-damage user in the game. The effectiveness of monks in a dungeon setting is highly dependent on the skill of the tank - a good tank is capable of chaining encounters together with low enough delay that Greased Lightning can be ported from one encounter to the next - a bad one will lead to GL fading, which makes the monk among the worse DPS choices in that situation. Text guide: URL **Rogue(ROG)/Ninja(NIN)** Ninjas can debuff targets towards attacks from themselves and tanks, which is a pretty important trait to keep up in party play. They also have a global vulnerability debuff that works on pretty much anything, which applies over and above their normal damage. In the open world they have the highest dps available against most targets and possess Mug, making this The Farming Class if you ever need to do something like farm 600 fleece. In the same way that pet classes need to split their minds between self-skills and summon skills, ninjas need to split their minds between normal skills and ninjutsu skills, so some level of micromanagement is required. Ninjas also require the ability to think like tanks, to manage aggro effectively - generally reducing healer aggro and increasing tank aggro. However, among the three melee classes, ninjas have the weakest single target DPS on their own in long encounters. Image guide (pre-HW): URL **Lancer(LNC)/Dragoon(DRG)** While they have the strongest opener of all three melee classes and are not that position-dependent, the exact order in which you use the global cooldown skills matters a lot - far more than for any other class. As they are capable of debuffing targets to piercing attacks, DRG is also a go-to if your party is known to have MCH/BRD on board, while in other cases NIN might be better (several encounters, few bosses) or MNK might be better (OP boss, few trash encounters). Leg Sweep also makes this the general class in charge of interrupting mob attacks after the tank if your tank is dead, if two mobs use interruptible attacks on a WAR, etc. They also wear the 2nd heaviest armor class, and are capable of off-tanking in the event that your tank is horrendous. Ideal for clearing story missions as they balance interrupts, damage (even without much positioning requirements) and survivability very well. The rewards for the missions, should, however, be claimed on a WHM. Text guide: URL ***** **Powerlevelling** Finally, with levelling multiple classes comes the problem of... levelling multiple classes. The most efficient tactics I've found for 'all-class levelling' are included below, though if you wanted to main one, you could simply devote most resources into that one, and allocate secondary levelling resources for the two other classes required for cross-class skills. - PLD/WAR/DRK - Highest dungeon you have access to. Instant queues. - WHM - Story mode - all quest reward EXP should go here as they have neither the queue speed of tanks nor DPS of... well, DPS. Also use daily roulettes on this as they queue much faster than specific-dungeon queues. - NIN - Farming mobs for any drops you need for crafting professions. Also, leves. - DRG - Killing closely spaced mobs in FATEs (with no other aggressive mobs in the area) and FATE bosses with no - AoE telegraphs. Also, leves. - MNK - Killing FATE bosses with AoE telegraphs. Also, leves. - BLM/BRD/MCN - Killing mobs in FATEs which are either spaced far apart, or have aggressive mobs near them. Also, leves. - SMN - Killing closely spaced mobs in FATEs (with no other aggressive mobs in the area). Also, leves. - AST - While story mode would have been nice, you complete the story before getting this, so... queue dungeons in Gold Saucer or something so you can GATE or hit the minigames while you wait. Out on a Limb is pretty good and should average 599MCP per try with no inventory space requirement. Queue time is too short to justify FATEs or leves, but too long that you still need a filler. Use daily roulettes on this. While doing the FATEs and leves on the DPS classes, also set dungeons on DPS queue. The reason for the need for addition of these is that the DPS queue is very slow. Based on this you should end up levelling all except the final three (DRK, AST, MCN) at almost identical rates. ***** Edit: After checking out the claims in the first round of comments, found the first draft was wrong wrt. PLD vs DRK DPS. As the DRK and WAR rotations are suboptimal, the differences are more pronounced than this test indicates. URL Can find no reliable statistical information to either prove or disprove the claim of WARs outdamaging DRK in AoE, and I doubt this is the case based on the nature of their resource management. As far as the information I'm getting off FFlogs indicates, BRD are still lower than average in basically every content type I can find, and unlike Ninjas, don't exactly come with party-wide DPS boosts."
91,vulnerability,ffxiv,A12S farm parties are shockingly bad...,0,65guby,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/65guby/a12s_farm_parties_are_shockingly_bad/,2017-04-15 12:32:08,"I can understand if someone screws up in a farm party once or twice because of getting accustomed to a different strat. Mistakes happen but I'm beginning to see more and more people who seem to have bought clears in these farm parties now and proceed to mess up mechanics then blame others. Please, if you are not entirely comfortable in the fight and pass the blame on to others, don't join and waste everyone's time. Also to the MCH who kept dying to defamation in the party I was in today. It is not a healing issue if you take a magic vulnerability stack then get hit by someone elses defamation wiping half the party in the process."
92,vulnerability,ffxiv,[Discussion] Sooo... about SAM-Skillset,0,5uyfsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5uyfsy/discussion_sooo_about_samskillset/,2017-02-20 01:24:24,"So I was thinking about what they said about how Samurai would work, with the three forces of Sen (Setsu, Getsu and Ka) and the use of Iai. And the little bit of ""storing enegy in the katana and unleash it"". I came up with a bit of an rotation of how it **could** work and would like some input of what you guys think. first we got the three forces Setsu, Getsu and Ka: each of them would be a weapon skill with a potency of around 220~240 and gives a minor buff * Setsu could give a stacking damage buff of 1% * Getsu could give a stacking crit buff of 1% * Ka gives a stacking atk speed buff of 2% maybe they have positionals with them (or maybe not) of these buffs only the four most recent ones stay active, and they have a generaly short duration, like 12 seconds or so. Iwould consider these buffs to be the ""store energy"" part. after that you have sen, a melee-cast weaponskill that consumes all buffs you currently have and deals effects based on the buffs you currently have. This would be the ""unleash energy"" part. Effects could be like: * for every Setsu-Buff you the skill deals an additonal 40 potency damage * for every Getsu-Buff you apply a DoT with 30 potency over 9 seconds (time stacks, potency doesn't) * for every Ka-Buff you apply a Speed-Buff for the group that lasts 9 seconds * if you have exactly one of each you inflict a vulnerability-down debuff on the target for 10 seconds (like Trick Attack) For Iai and the other swordplay techiques I could see either OCD skills that you can weave between your Sen-""Combo"", or non-combo weaponskills like mutilate etc. What do you think? Would that be enjoyable gameplay? It would certainly be something different from the other DPS-Jobs, and I kinda like it"
93,vulnerability,ffxiv,"Paladin: The Inspiring Knight ft. NIN and MNK! (Or, my take on balancing PLD, tanks, and overall game health.)",0,5vea13,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5vea13/paladin_the_inspiring_knight_ft_nin_and_mnk_or_my/,2017-02-22 08:22:21,"With the release of Stormblood drawing near, Ive been seeing more and more class-balance threads popping up on this subreddit. Specifically, Ive been noting a lot of PLD and MNK threads. This is my take on a PLD/tank update, designed to bring the class up to par with current standards without breaking its niche or destroying class balance, while simultaneously making it just a little more fun without adding complexity. My changes: -Shield Bash: Add a 20 or 30 second cooldown, and make it function similarly to Shoulder Charge; rename it Shield Charge. *Reason: Honestly, I dont feel that a spammable stun spell is really adding anything incredible to the class. Its neat and occasionally useful, but not necessary. Adding a mobility spell to PLD within the theme of the class would not only make it more fun, but add some level of excitement and power to an otherwise simplistic job. Also, youre a knight. Run at a fool with your shield.* -Tempered Will: *Tentatively* delete it. Add the effect on Shelltron. *Reason: If were looking to do some button clipping, Id chop Tempered Will. As it stands, the useful effect can be placed elsewhere without requiring its own button. Sword Oath/Shield Oath: Make it one button and toggleable. *Reason: Youre never going to not be using one or the other. Just let us toggle!  And to the same with WAR, while youre at it.* Divine Veil: Make it only apply in Shield Oath. In Sword Oath, change effect/spell to *Inspire*- Increase damage and SkS of nearby allies for 10 seconds. Make it function similar to a Bard song, affecting only close-ish allies. *Reason: Lets face it. PLD needs some damage utility. It shouldnt have too much, however. Unfortunately, every MMO has a damage meta when fights have been figured out and optimized. A purely defensive class will almost always fall out of favor at some point. Thats alright  Youll always have a black sheep, I think. PLD shouldnt be completely denied, however. By only affecting close allies, some positioning and light-synergy with melee is allowed. Wont some of these changes cause problems? If PLD keeps its defensive utility AND offensive utility, would it not become OP? The thing is The only real offense buff I gave PLD was inspire. And that requires blowing Divine Veil. Of course, if you didnt have a PLD in the first place, you obviously didnt need Divine Veil. Though, say Divine Veil also blocked Vulnerability application and let a BLM tank some more AoE Thats just theorycraftin for balance. So what about the other tanks? WAR: Rework Storms Eye/Path. Increase effect but only buff the users damage. Do the same with Dancing Edge and Disembowel. *Reason: While these buffs sound like a great way to increase synergy, they really just force comps. It doesnt even force equal comps, since there will be more classes with one attack style than the other. This will probably increase WAR personal DPS, but thats okay! Were helping PLD and DRK out too.* DRK: Change Blood Weapon to a stance. Toggle Grit/Blood Weapon. *Reason: With these changes, PLD DPS contribution goes up slightly, and WAR personal DPS increases a little with Storms Eye rework. By toggling Blood Weapon as a permanent stance, we increase DRK DPS just the slight amount to get it competitive.* Result: The damage of all tanks goes up just slightly, and thats alright. If Dancing Edge and Disembowel are changed to personal buffs, DRK and NIN personal DPS goes up slightly as well. We then take a pass at MNK and other classes, while noting that the resistance debuff change might open up Magic comps and versatility once more. PLD is also brought up to date as a still simplistic yet slightly more interesting class to play. Tl;dr: Modernized paladin with a light utility buff, rework resistance debuffs, bring DRK/WAR in line with PLD utility and WAR buff changes. Obviously Im taking a rough pass here and Im not a game designer. However, I dont think these initial (very rough) thoughts are terrible. By ALL means, disagree and state the problems here. This is how solutions are found, am I right? Edit: Failed italics, and a Tempered Will change. "
94,vulnerability,ffxiv,What new mechanics do you guys want to see on 4.0?,0,5vieeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5vieeu/what_new_mechanics_do_you_guys_want_to_see_on_40/,2017-02-22 23:31:24,"I haven't played FFXIV for that long compare to alot of you guys here, but I do consider myself a fast learner on boss fights. But when you finally get use to the game, you will see every fight becomes similiar. Boss cast a ability you either avoid telegraph or preposition somewhere safe, stack, spread, add phase, knock out of stage, meteor, AoE placement, look away etc. I personally like to see more of these: - Remove telegraph. - Remove cast spells and pay attention on boss animations. - Give bosses faster action speed to speed up the pace a little bit. - Give players a short dash/roll/blink ability, a little more mobility than just sprint. - Mechanics that requires jumps to dodge ground attacks, which requires some timing than just walk out of telegraph. - More randomize abilities from the bosses since all fights feel scripted. - When you getting uncontrollable status like the boulders from titan, instead of getting saved by other give player a way to get out by themselves. Maybe some button mashing. - Right now we have vulnerability debuff when you getting hit by attacks, add a debuff that you cant receive any healing for a while to make it more punishing. - Add certain death you cannot be revived, like some of the primals when you fall off the stage. But skills that actually ""delete"" your corpse then unable to be revived. - Maybe some platforming arena which you can fall. Since you mostly just fight bosses in FFXIV, so I thought maybe make it little more intresting. I have some more ideas but feel like im going off track to much. What new mechanics do you guys want to see? Edit: Many people have a misconception what I mean by removing telegraph. Yes you cant remove all of them but here is an example. Thunder III in Sophia fight - Normal mode there is a lightning ground indicator and a cast bar. - Extreme mode only have the cast bar. - Here is my idea if they gonna make harder than extreme/savage by adding more difficulty, removing the cast bar and pay attention to the animation instead. Hope this make it more clear. Edit2: A quote from a reply // But I also want them to break the learning pattern a little bit. ""I see boss casting Southern Cross, I wait till the cast end then just move"" instead ""I see the boss channeling an ice ability both hand raised up, it looks like he is about to cast the spell with some hand motion alright time to move"" // Edit3: Today I learned this subreddit can't hold a decent discussion. 70% of the post is already offended somehow even before discussion even started.

95,vulnerability,ffxiv,A (Revised) Discussion on Balance.,0,5vkwa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5vkwa7/a_revised_discussion_on_balance/,2017-02-23 06:45:06,"So I recently made a discussion thread in which I attempted to list some changes for PLD, as well as tanks and game health as a whole. However, I made one fundamental flaw in all of my logic: I designed changes based on what *I* wanted, not what was desirable for mains of the class. So, my apologies. Now, with a step back and some feedback... I'm going to bring up discussions of ideas that I have seen frequently mentioned, rather than solid changes. -Phasing Out Resistance Debuffs: When I say ""resistance debuffs"", I'm specifically referring to things like Disembowel, Dancing Edge, and Storms Path (and to a lesser degree, Delirium/Dragon Kick and Storms Path). Resistance debuffs have the effect of forcing team comps based around their existence, since, ideally, you would want to maximize your partys damage and efficiency of the buff. With SAM being released as (presumably) slashing and RDM a (presumably) piercing DPS, there is a potential balancing issue to be had with an unequal number of classes per resistance  especially with mages! (Unless RDM releases with magic vulnerability down, but I still believe this could be problematic. That would probably force RDM/BLM/BRD/DRG vs. NIN/DRG/SAM/MCH, or something.) -Storms Path/Delirium/Dragon Kick, specifically: While these may seem inherently less harmful, they still force comps on the idea that you want someone who can bring these debuffs to the table, as less damage on party = more damage on mob. Specifically, Storms Path really forces WAR into an OT role (besides, yknow, his damage) as the decreased damage lets other tanks shine even more. As great as the synergy was when PLD and WAR were the only two tanks, it has created a problem now that we have 3 (and eventually more). -PLD buffs: PLD is the unfortunate victim of the MMO DPS mentality. As a defensive class, it is probably safe to say that it will tend to fall behind where other tanks are just as effective and can bring more damage. Possible solutions? --Add a damage utility. Preferably a team buff. Inspire! would work within the theme of a knight and make PLD slightly more useful in certain situations. Its boring, sure, but effective. Issues: Balance, obviously. This could overtune PLD, or require buffs for DRK/WAR. --Add an AOE. PLD really lacks a good AOE for damage. A lot of people mention that this would streamline a lot of PLD pulls, and I can agree. --Increase damage from content/boss autoattacks: Make PLDs defense even more meaningful by making it a lesser heal priority when all else is requiring more heals. Issues: Difficulty, and healer issues, and making other tanks have problems. Also, this might make PLD MT even more forced. Question: If resistance debuffs are removed, should they be retooled as personal damage amplifiers, or find a new use completely? Final Thoughts: In basically any MMO, there will be a #1 team comp for any scenario where speedruns are concerned. However, I think thats given. The question is, for the larger portion of the playerbase, can we bring balance closer together so that other compositions are competitive and less scrutinized? **Also, I'm aware that I didn't say anything about MNK, SMN, or BLM. I do not have the experience to give any ideas on what would help them out right now, so I'll leave that to the rest of Reddit.** "
96,vulnerability,ffxiv,Beast Master (BSM) Job concept,0,5vpy43,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5vpy43/beast_master_bsm_job_concept/,2017-02-23 22:41:41,"After a conversation in another topic I tried to come up with an example of how a BSM tank job might possible work. Since I tried to put forth a more rounded up concept I think it would be nice to see what you guys think about it. ----- **BEAST MASTER** *Role:* Tank *Weapon:* Double Hatchets *Armor:* Chain - Shared with DRG **CONCEPT AND THEME** Beast masters don't have a relationship of master and servant. They are a single spirit shared between two bodies. They are inseparable companions that act in unison, as a perfect single being. Blood brothers whose life spark cannot be separated. Their bound allow them to go in and out of spiritual forms, using each other as anchors in the physical realm. As a pack of wolfs, their tactics is to split the attention of enemies, making foes concentrate on the physical form of one partners while the other attacks from the shadows between physical and spiritual. In game this relatioship makes control of the Bsm and its partner a bit differen t from the way SMN control their pets as you can't think of your partner as something you can order around but, instead must consider it an extension of your own character: **Partner Skills** BSM have a special category of abilities named Partner Skills. These are shared commands that make both the BSM and his Partner do complementary actions. Partner skills are part of the bsm rotation and are not relegated to a pet bar. They are the way BSM control their Partner. - **Extended commands:** Some partner skills make the Pet do a combo of 3 attacks, for a total of 3 gdcs. In general if no partner skills are used after these 3 skills the Beast repeats the combo once from the beginning. Using other partner skills immediately interrupts the combo and cancels its animation so the pet instantly shifts to the new action. These command breaks normally doesn't mess with the flow of the animations because most of the partner skills are bound to the global cooldown. Examples of the effects of extended commands are *""aoe combo""*, *""single target tanking combo""* and *""damaging combo""*. The first strike of these extended commands always have special properties with telltale animations like howls, flashing effects or shadow echoes, BSM players should use them to time their individual attacks for greater effect, either by debuffing mobs or receinving temporary buffs. - **Pack Tactics and ""shadow hunter""**: BSM has an off-GDC skill named *Pack Tactics* which changes effect depending on the current Partner skill being employed. The first strike of the Pet combo is the one that triggers the effect change of Pack Tactics. Main Example: ""AOE"" combo makes pack tactics Become a skill named **Shadow Hunter** - an AOE effect centered on the BSM that deals damage and inflicts the *""Prey""* debuff on enemies (a vulnerability effect. Useful only to BSM). While any enemy remains with *Prey* debuff in the battlefield the BSM becomes locked into a spirit form named ""Hunter"" that has a movement speed buff, can't be damaged and has diminished aggro. While the partner can still receive damage, it does gains a 20% damage reduction buff as long as the BSM keeps attacking his ""Preys"". Shadow Hunter is a versatile tool that allow BSM to stay in the middle of the fight in large packs of mobs and serves as a way of avoiding that AOE attacks hit both him and his Partner. When tanking this is a very safe skill to use that helps with damage mitigation and can become part of the tanking rotation (with the downside of not using the other possible effects o Pack Tactics). **Instant Relocation and Lifeline**: The BSM and its partner are fused in a single tangle of flesh and spirit so one can only exist near the other. In game this is represented by a white aoe circle that appears around the Partner if the BSM moves a bit far from him. Crossing this bondary makes the partner instantly blink to the BSM position after 3-5s. This is bondary is a close range, enough for the BSM to stay behind a Boss while his partner tanks in the front. This spiritual connection, on the other hand, also means that when a BSM uses a partner skill his partner instantaneously appears from the spirit realm at the location of the BSM target, no matter the enemies that it might have been fighting or the physical barrier that might have been between them. All aggro that the BSM generates instantly shifts to the partner as soon as a partner skill is used on that target. The other side of the spiritual relation is also true, if the BSM uses a partner skill on a enemy outside his range but that is on the reach of his beast companion, he will instantly blink to his enemy position - BSM are specially good at chasing enemies and very sliperry targets in pvp. - **Spiritual Howl, Resources and Repositioning**: A special partner skill named *Spiritual Howl* makes the BSM partner to Instantly appear at the BSM position and enter spirit form (becoming immune to damage and swapping aggro with the BSM). While using this partner command the beast stays in place howling and recovering mp, if the BSM keeps close his tp also regenerates at a slower rate. During *Spiritual howl* the BSM can wander far away from the beast - up to 10 times the normal *Lifeline* maximum distance. The main purpose of this skill is to reposition the partner without a target on which to use a offensive partner skill or to simply stop the partner from atacking. This can also be used as an ""ambush"" and relocation skill by preemptly putting the partner at the location where an enemy will pass and then using another partner skill to instantly blink the BSM to it. The downside is the drastic dps reduction of not having the partner and the fact that the player must be able to target the enemy using the ui which is based on the BSM position, putting a limit on how far one can effectively blink. **Shared Lifespark** : BSM and Partner are actually a single Character. They share the same hp bar and while BSM skills use tp, Partner skills usually consume MP whenever they are first activated or automatically repeat themselves. Players can target any of the pair to use skills on the BSM and macro targets or ui targetting will always select either the closest one or, if one of the pair is in Spirit form, the ibe that can be damaged. **GENERAL GAMEPLAY**: Beast Master is all about thinking about how to position his partner and how to interact with the flow of his combos. The partner is generally immobile while the BSM himself dance in the battlefield using his skills to instantly relocate the partner as needed. Mp is a minor concern mostly punishing BSM who abuse high damage partner skills. The BSM attacks do require positioning, like DRG and MNKs and its aoe attacks follow a frontal cone pattern so using the partner as a tool to correctly position the enemies is the major skill component of the job. Most BSM skills and attacks are meele but partner skills do have a bit of range slowing BSM exceptional gap closing and chase potential. The purpose of the kit is to make players feel they are actually controlling a single character and his extension. While tanking the beast should be the main concern with the BSM serving as support to position, healp with stabilishing aggro (by using damage rotations and dumping the gained enmity with Partner skills) and deal with mechanics. When mainly dpsing the opposite happens, with the BSM doing his rotation and using Partner skills to change his ""pack tactics"" into benefitial buffs and extra damage. Compared to other jobs the BSM can easely hit positionals even while solo and his partner grants him exceptional chasing/locking and movement potential. Form a mechanical standpoint it should be very straightfoward like a paladin using basic Damage / Aggro rotations that benefit from backside positionals. The partner, like a scholar faery, is able to keep up with 60% to 80% of the aggro generation depending on how much time the Player allows it to spam the single target enmity combo, the most challenging part of the job when holding aggro is to be able to keep a good rotation with the BSM itself and Dumping the generated enmity to the partner at the right time. While the BSM itself can tank, his defenses are way lower then the pet and it isn't sustainable for long periods of time (think of a DRG tanking). The lion share of the difficulty of the job lies in splitting the attention between the Beast and the Character and strategizing around mechanics for both at the same time. As a SCH, in easy content, the job becomes one of the easiest tanks in the game, since the Beast can pretty much hold aggro on it's own. In this content the fun of the class is to actually feel like a third DPS in the party and trying to optimize the damage output (which should be around DRK potential). In raid Environments, where the BSM cannot mindlessly dps and must strictly keep using aggro combos and strategies, his dps falls down to PLD levels or a bit worse but they can help with mechanics other tankers might not since they can output damage to two targets and may join in soaks and position mechanics with more ease. ---- *Ok, guys. What do you think? What are the problems you see arising and what suggestions you might give over how to avoid them? Any ideas of skills for this concept or a concept of your own for us to read?*"
97,vulnerability,ffxiv,My suggestion for fixing class balance and party composition in Stormblood,0,5vqguw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5vqguw/my_suggestion_for_fixing_class_balance_and_party/,2017-02-24 00:50:40,"First a couple of administrative points - I understand that any class is viable, and almost any composition is viable. That said, there is a clear meta, and a few jobs left out in the cold as a result. I understand that it's better to pick the right person to fill a place rather than the right job - but it's tough to get 'punished' for doing so. Suggestions are like opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and most of them stink. I've not posted this on the OF, just looking to start a discussion on what might be a nice way to help out the MNK/PLD/WHM types who aren't included in any 'meta' composition. What if each class had a few options in their build - I don't want to say talent tree, but maybe something similar - that they could adjust based on the players their grouped with. For example, why not give MCH and BRD (and hopefully RDM) the option to boost casters **or** melee based on allocations of some talents/skills. Why not give all melee the ability to trait one of their skills to cause blunt/slashing/piercing resistance down on a boss? The jobs still play the way they play, no change there, but we would be less tethered to certain optimised compositions. These would have to be changed outside of battle of course, or I'm sure there would be a way to abuse it somehow. It just strikes me that most of what goes into a 'best composition' currently is how each class boosts those around them, rather than raw dps numbers. So currently we are rewarded by choosing *jobs that fit the skills* - wouldn't it be nice if we could choose the *skills to fit the jobs* instead? Even PLD could be put in much higher demand if rather than increasing it's damage directly they just give it the ability to cause some sort of resistance down/vulnerability to boost raid DPS instead. The ability to augment that ability to fit any party composition would be a huge boon. "
98,vulnerability,ffxiv,Story Time: Bad raid turned AWESOME!,3,5ww2oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5ww2oi/story_time_bad_raid_turned_awesome/,2017-03-02 01:19:00,"Our story begins with a small company in Faerie starting their weekly raid with their newest level 60 Summoner. It was day 1 for the new 3.55a patch and the small group of 5 friends wanted to do all the 24 man raids. With high expectations for the events to come and with the new weekly quest in their logs, they queue up for the all 3 raids and join into The Weeping City of Mhach. The group was assigned as Alliance A. The raid quickly downed Arachne Eve, everything seemed business as normal. That is until Forgall The raid wiped as a result of missing the DPS check with the 3 adds. The group of friends having done these raids many times were perplexed. How could we have wiped on such an easy fight? What had happened? Then the Paladin of the group decided to check on the gear of the DPS as a whole. And discovered much to his dismay that 40% of the raid was severely under geared. They had concluded that due to the new patch they had an influx of day 1 raiders new to the whole experience! After much explaining of the fight mechanics to the newer players the raid group cleared Forgall and moved onto the Ozma. The group of friends fondly referred to this fight as Geometry and were very comfortable with the mechanics of the fight and confident of their ability to carry the newest raiders through the mechanics. After explaining the fight briefly to the new raiders in their party Geometry began. The fight went verily smoothly until the last 5% of the fight. The veteran Ninja got caught up in directing some of the newer players and moved with Acceleration bomb on his head causing all but one of Alliance A to wipe. However the fight was cleared thanks to the efforts of Alliances C and B. At this point all three alliances were somewhat irritated at the difficulty they were having at completing this verily standard raid and just wanted to get the fight over as soon as possible. As a result of their impatience they began the fight without explaining mechanics AND before everyone was able to make it to Calofisteris arena. The fight began with several DPS locked out of the arena. Despite the lack of DPS and the plethora of new raiders whom did not understand the mechanics of the fight things were going rather smoothly. That was until the last 10% when people started dropping like flies due to the vast amounts of vulnerability stacks on the raiders. Several raiders tried using the level 3 limit break to finish off Calofisteri but with no luck as they would die whilst casting the Limit Break. Things were looking very grim and it was starting to look like a wipe. One by one the valiant raiders would die leaving a lone Paladin to brave the last of the fight. But not all was lost! As the lone Paladin noticed he was the last one left he used a clutch Hallowed Ground to out last the vulnerability stacks left on him. Free of the vulnerability he swapped to sword stance and used for the first time in his tanking career his level 3 limit break! At this point the boss was down to 1% health remaining. The raid group had resigned itself to a wipe and spirits were low. But our lone Paladins group of friends had faith and cheered their comrade on. It quickly caught on and soon the entire raid was cheering on their last hope of finally finishing the crappy raid. There were several close calls but with some well timed cooldowns and a lucky Clemency crit, the lone Paladin was able to beat the odds and clear the raid! The entire Alliance chat blew up with jubilation and words of praise for the clutch plays of the Paladin. With a general agreement that the brave Paladin should receive ALL THE COMEDATION. And as if the gods of FFXIV were watching the Paladin won his very first raid minion from the loot. Sorry for the lengthy read but I just had to share about last nights raid. If you read the whole thing I hope you enjoyed the read. And if you have any similar stories please share them in the comments below! "

Therefore, during the second wave, Awareness can be delayed to around 5-6 secs after pulling the two Execreted Wills. - Most farm parties prefer a Tank LB during Soar in last phase. Optimal timing seems to be 5 seconds after Zurvan jumps away or right after the red balls of fire on everybody's heads show up. - If one uses either Vengeance or Thrill of Battle (both 120 sec cooldown) during the first Tyrfing, it/both should be up by the time Demon's Claw shows up.

100,vulnerability,ffxiv,When a target has resistance to magic damage (such as 50% reduction for Ice in Frontlines Shatter mode) does that impact the strength of DOT's spread to non-resistant targets from SMN's bane?,8,5peu0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5peu0n/when_a_target_has_resistance_to_magic_damage_such/,2017-01-22 14:14:06,"Something I've been wondering about based on SE's brilliant solution to make ranged vs. melee damage against ice more comparable by giving ice resistance against magic damage alone- when I cast my DOT's onto an ice tomelith in Shatter and bane onto nearby enemies, does the magic resistance on the primary target I'm baneing from impact the strength of the DOT's applied to nearby targets, cutting it down to half of what it would otherwise be? Or is the impact the same as it would have been if baneing off a target without magic resistance? I'm on PS4 and with 72 people in combat and all the stuff going through the battlelogs there's just no way for me to be able to figure that out, but thought maybe someone would know. If it turns out that DOT's bane'd off of ice tomes get a 50% reduction passed on from the ice (which is prior to the bane's inherent additional potency reductions to targets subsequent to the first three it hits) I might need to adjust my strategies in Shatter games a bit. Thanks! **Update** It appears that in PVP specifically, the DOT's spread through bane would be reevaluated when it comes to resistance/vulnerability for each target, based on Momoko's findings from patch notes: &gt;I forgot which patch it was, but wasn't there a change that modified this for PvP? As in bane would no longer snapshot the target, but would use whatever buff/debuff on each person it was baned to. Edit: was patch 3.21: The damage calculations of Bio, Bio II, and Miasma spread by Bane will now be affected by the beneficial and detrimental effects of targets."

It would be treated as a healer and support class. Instead of having any direct heals, like Cure or Physick, she instead applies a strong regen effect on her target that ticks frequently to be equal to as many Cures or Physicks a healer could cast within the duration of her dances. All of her dances also provide bonus effects, such as increasing a target's defense or attack, making the immune to common status ailments. Instead of actually attacking enemies, she does dances that debilitate them. She aids in DPS by her primary combat dance applying a Vulnerability debuff on the target. I think that might work... maybe? What does anyone else think?"

They are indeed magical damage as proven through testing (the only skill that isn't magical is Flaming Arrow). It's a widely known misconception that DoTs such as Shadow Flare, Doton and Salted Earth are affected under Foe Requiem. During my stream today Rioszz from Angered mentioned how they weren't affected by Foe Requiem but affected by Magical Hypercharge instead. The reason behind this is because Foe Requiem puts up a [Magic Resistance Down debuff](URL and Magical Hypercharge puts up a [Magical Vulnerability Up Debuff](URL Basically what this means is besides being 'well known knowledge that skills such as Shadow Flare and Doton are affected by Foe Requiem' is that these skills really aren't affected by it but instead only affected by Magical Hypercharge. Below is the testing of certain skills. [Doton with Foe Requiem](URL [Doton with Magical Hypercharge](URL [Salted Earth Foe Requiem](URL [Salted Earth Magical Hypercharge](URL [Shadow Flare Foe Requiem](URL [Shadow Flare Magical Hypercharge](URL Even though the likelihood of actually utilizing these skills under Magical Hypercharge is almost nonexistent it's still a fun fact to know x) On a more personal note I said it was better to Doton over Raiton in A12 for Temporal Stasis due to the fact Doton gets an extra 3 ticks in which puts it at 440 potency but if you have a Bard in the party they should have Battle Voice up at that point which puts Raiton at 432. The difference being minimal and doing Raiton lets you get off an extra GCD most of the time anyways if your ping is similar to mine (around 50)."

The reasoning was Foe's lowers ""magic resistance"" and Hypercharge increases vulnerability to magic. Now at first, I thought Foe's lowered ELEMENTAL Resistance, so the fact that SF and SE don't have elements would make perfect sense as to why they're increased by one but not the other. But that's not the case, as Foe's just does ""Magic Resistance."" So the only way this makes sense in my mind is if the enemy already had 0 Magic Res and couldn't be reduced lower than that. But we know that's not true because Foe's works for other abilities. Another note, it's odd that enemies don't have Defense but they have Magic resistance. The only thing I'm coming up with, is since almost all physical attacks are Piercing, Blunt or Slashing..and enemies stat page would look like: Piercing Resistance: 100 Slashing Resistance: 100 Blunt Resistance: 100 Magic Resistance: 100 (then maybe some elemental stuff, idk) But even if, say, Foe's reduced Magic Resistance to 90 (10% damage increase, like Storm's Path and DE to slashing DMG) then it should still work for SF and SE. So I don't know, I can't come up with anything. The stat system in this game is so absolutely convoluted and there's no consistency. Like how Vengeance gives Vuln Down as opposed to just being like Rampart and Shadowskin. What's the difference? Sometimes enemies get DET UP, sometimes they get ATK UP...but the main point is the same between the two."

Are they too part of snapshotting or does damage increase even if they're applied after a DoT is?"
107,vulnerability,ffxiv,Using Aero as an AST,1,5mgfoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5mgfoo/using_aero_as_an_ast/,2017-01-07 08:46:27,"Heya, fellow ~~Yu Gi Oh Fans~~ Astrologians. Just a question that suddently came accross my mind whilst looking at ways to do some proper DPS on Savage content : is it worth using Aero as an AST ? I think I pretty much got my own answer, but I'd like some input on it. I do not recall seeing a lot of ASTs using it either, but that could be totally wrong on my end. Anyway, on to what I thought about. To me, it seems to be pretty worth using for a few reasons : * Low Mana cost (353) for the same potency as Malefic II (18/3 * 25 + 50 = 200, malefic II is 530 mana for 200 potency) * Instant cast, meaning you can easely move if something is happening, or in prevision of it. * DoT. This last one is... Debatable. DoTs have an on-tick crit chance, and Aero also hits once when applied. It basically means that out of the 7 total hits from each Aero casted, there is a fair chance at least one will crit. **It isn't as powerful as a single Malefic II crit, given that Aero would have to crit on every single tick in order to have the same power as a crit Malefic II**. It's less powerfull than a crit Malefic II, but it's like trading a non-crit one for a spell that has a better chance of being slightly more potent. DoTs can also be snapshotted, wich means it'll benefit of any power-up it had when applied for it's whole duration ; you can throw an Aero with a second left on Balance and your NIN's vulnerability and still benefit from them for the whole 18 seconds afterwards, in cases where a casted spell would be too late. As mentionned, it'll also allow you do off-gcd things, such at looking for exodia in your deck or turning off cleric for Essential Dignity and putting it back on instantly cause you've got DPS to do, without wasting GCD time like you would with a casted spell. Or simply moving without wasting GCD, too. Last but not least, Aero is applied on-hit, unlike Combust wich applies without initial hits. That means **Aero requires accuracy to apply, like Maleficient. Combust does not.** That doesn't sound as important as the rest, but is worth noting nevertheless. So... Yeah. Any input, thought, maths or anything on this topic is more than welcome !"
108,vulnerability,ffxiv,Zurvan Extreme Guide,155,5oii8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5oii8l/zurvan_extreme_guide/,2017-01-18 02:01:22,"Hello! This Thread is to help people with general rotations of the boss AND also to discuss! ------------------ #Boss Rotations and Guides ------------------ # 1. First Phase - (boss does auto attack cleaves all the time. Should always be facing away from party members) - East Platform falls + Red Circle AoE's: Bait melee fire circles together at right side of South platform and then move away. - North Platform falls - West Platform falls + Red Circle AoE's: Bait again. # 2. Second Phase - Soar (skipped at 75%): see below - Ice pad Spawns under the boss. You can't move through the boss. - Biting Halberd: needs to be directly behind the boss (Edit: Biting Halberd is used right after **THIRD** Cleave attacks. Like, Ice pad spawns -&gt; cleave x3 -&gt; Biting Halberd) - Southern Cross: Stack at the butt to bait and then move out. - Biting Halberd/Ciclicle/Tail End: Randomly selected (skipped at 59%) # 3. Adds Phase { ADDS: Execrated Will = Should be tanked by a tank. Does high damage attack, which always crit, on its target and gain damage up buff every 10 sec. Use of Awareness helps mitigating damage especially when a single tank is getting both Wills in wave 2. Execrated Thew = Small add. Should also be tanked by a tank. Nothing special. Execrated Wile = doesn't need to be tanked. Should face away from it when Meracydian Fear is cast. Execrated Wit = Doesn't need to be tanked. Should kill it before Meracydian Meteor casting is done. } - Will x1 (North) + Thew (North): just AoE down - Will x2 (West) + Wile x1 (South) + Wit x1 (East): Each tank grab 1 Will at West. All DPS classes kill Wile first. Should face away from South to avoid Fear. Bring two Wills to South and AoE them down once Wit is dead. - Will x1 (South) + Thew x3 (East) + Wit (West) + Wile (North): One tank grabs Will and the other tank grabs 3 Thews while DPS classes burn Wit. Should face away from North to avoid as well. Bring all the adds to North and AoE them down once Wit is dead. - Zurvan's Ult # 4. Final Phase Part I - Tethers appear: 2 pairs of Infinite Fire and 2 pairs of Infinite Ice come out. Tethered pair should be close enough to each other to avoid DoT damage (about 10k dmg each tick). (similar to T11 tethers) - Wave Cannon: Randomly selects a non-MT player and does damage with Bleeding debuff. Everyone else should be away from its target, but make sure target's partner is in safe distance of tether. - Tyrfing: Attacks Main Tank 5 times with spear and does fire damage at the end. High Damages and cooldowns are needed as necessary. - Southern Cross: Stack under the boss and move out. Make sure tethered partner is going to the same direction or it's going to kill both players. Call out where you're going to! - Broken Seal: Spawns 4 fire meteors and 4 ice meteors. 4 players with Infinite Ice go into 4 Ice meteor circles while 4 Infinite Fire goes into 4 Fire meteor circles. (Match your color) Since players are tethered, tethered pair should always be close to each other. Call out! There are three patterns that randomly spawn: please check [here](URL - Biting Halberd/Ciclicle/Tail End: IF blue/red circles at EDGE: Ciclicle(IN) IF blue/red circles at CENTER: Tail End(OUT) IF DIAMOND shapes x2: Biting Halberd(Butt) &lt;basically repeating again from here&gt; - New tethers appear: find a new partner and hug each other. - Wave Cannon: targets a random non-MT player. Away from its target. - Tyrfing(hits 6 times and fire damage) - Southern Cross - Broken Seal &lt;repeating ends here&gt; - Biting Halberd/Ciclicle/Tail End: # 5. Final Phase Part II - Soar: see below - The Demon's Claw: Does High Damage and Stuns MT while putting Magical Vulnerability up. OT vokes the boss off MT. MT will also get knocked back. Make sure position yourself at the center so MT doesn't get knocked back into the fiery wall. - Wave Cannon: targets MT (not sure if it targets OT if he/she vokes during Demon's claw or MT still gets targeted by it) and shows huge AoE box that arrows indicate into the AoE. Seems like People stack in the box to soak the damage together. However, my group just killed MT and had OT voking the boss after. &lt;basically repeating again from here&gt; - New tethers appear: find a new partner - Wave Cannon: targets a random non-MT player. Away from its target. - Tyrfing(hits 7 times and fire damage) - Southern Cross - Broken Seal &lt;repeating ends here&gt; - Biting Halberd - The Demon's Claw - Wave Cannon - New tethers appear - Wave Cannon - ... Probably repeating... You wanna kill the boss now. ---------------------- ------------------ # Mechanic Discussion ------------------ # About Soar: When Boss casts Soar, he shows 3 rectangle AoE's toward the edge of the arena. After Rectangle AoE, the boss disappears and spawn 3 mirages at the edge where the three rectangle AoE were targeting at. Then, 6 red unavoidable circle AoE(size of shadowflare or a little bit bigger) spawn on 6 randomly selected players. When 6 AoE's explode, three Divebombs of mirages happen at the same time, so should be away from mirage's divebomb range AND avoid clipping each other with red AoE circle. After the damage, one random player is targeted with a Stacking AoE marker(Thordan's Dragon's Rage AoE with 4 arrows indicating inside) while the other random player is targeted with a small red marker. Most of players should get into the Stacking AoE to soak the damage together, and the other player with a small red marker should be away from anyone around to avoid additional damage. - THIS IS NASTY MECHANIC. TRY TO SKIP THIS MECHANIC WITH HIGH DPS IN 2ND PHASE!! - Save LB3 for healer LB so your healer can always raise everyone after the mechanic. If no death or a few deaths, Melee LB after the mechanic. - Divebomb Damage does a lot more damage than red Circle AoE AND also leaves Vulnerability up debuff to a player who gets hit. If there's no choice, I think clipping AoE is better than getting hit by mirage's divebombs. Edit: - Just TANK LB during Soar helps a lot! - Never Targets HEALERS with red AoE circles. IT means, it always targets 2 tanks and 4 DPS. - For Diagram, please check this out: URL --------------------------- # About Broken Seal: - check this out for 3 different patterns: URL - If there are more than 2 deaths before this mechanic, expect wipe :c - Communication is KEY. Say where you're going to! - After Southern Cross, position yourself either Right Flank or Left Flank of the boss. Have 1 red and 1 blue pairs on each side so you can simply go to the closest meteor circles. But Still, Calling out is the best strat. Edit: IF blue/red circles at EDGE: followed by Ciclicle(IN) IF blue/red circles at CENTER: followed by Tail End(OUT) IF DIAMOND shapes x2: followed by Biting Halberd(Butt) -&gt; Remember you CAN just walk through the boss. --------------------------- # About Demon Claw - After Soar ends(in final phase part II), MT pulls the boss to the edge, and get knocked back to the other side. - All other players get into the ranged AoE to save their MT. Edit: - IF there's DARK KNIGHT, pull the boss to the edge of the arena and pop **Living Dead** right before Demon Claw and You'll be knocked back to the opposite side of arena. After a few seconds, Boss will target MT with Wave Cannon. Everyone stay away from it and Dark Knight will be killed and gain Walking Dead Status. Heal Dark Knight as necessary and everything's done! - Check this out for image: URL - PLD'sHallowed Ground also works just like Dark Knight's LD. Time it correctly; use it right before demon claw casting is done. Make sure you are not knocked back into the dirty wall or it's still going to kill you. - Hugging Wall still kills you even in hallowed ground/holmgang/walking dead status. --------------------------- --------------------------- # **Recommended Strategy ** --------------------------- **Southern Cross:** - Stack at the butt. - MT moves to the RIGHT(counter-clockwise), or just walk across the boss to be less risky with tether. - Party moves to the LEFT(clockwise) - If you're tethered with MT, move RIGHT(180 degree, so you don't get hit by tank cleaves) **Wave Cannon:** - Go to LEFT/RIGHT FLANK of the boss (assign one) - Rest of party can have RIGHT/LEFT Flank(opposite flank of wave cannon) and Rear. **Broken Seal:** - 1 Red + 1 Blue on each Flank of the boss. Position yourself once Ice puddles disappear. - Never stay close to the other pair of same colored tethers. - If there's no matching circles on your side, go to opposite side of the other same-color tethered pair. **Soar:** *strat 1:* - MT North, OT South, 2 DPS East, 2 DPS West, Healers stack with any tank/DPS - Look out which pattern of soar (you have bunch of time to look out. memorize where soar AoEs are at) IF Evenly spread, there are 6 safe spots. go to the closest flank of a mirage IF 2 Mirages together, there are 2 large safe spots. position yourself not to clip each other with red AoE. *strat 2:* - Just Tank LB this shit before mechanic or Healer LB3 after mechanic. - You may get clipped by NO MORE THAN TWO AoE's. Just AVOID the Divebombs -------------------------------------- --------------------------- If having any questions or things to discuss with, please bring it on! Please let me know if something's wrong or needs to be fixed. Edit: See URL for nice diagrams. Hopefully this helps you to clear Zurvan Extreme! Enjoy your Loot!"
109,vulnerability,ffxiv,Random Bits of Info About Palace of the Dead,317,5e9o40,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5e9o40/random_bits_of_info_about_palace_of_the_dead/,2016-11-22 19:21:27,"I've been running a lot of Palace of the Dead lately and have collected various random bits of information. None of these on their own would deserve its own thread, but I thought I'd impart the collective bits and pieces I've collected. You'll probably know some of this on your own, but hopefully something will be new. **Aetherpool &amp; Jobs** * If you don't have Heavensward installed, your in-duty level cap will be level 60. Exp gained within though, will not allow you to reach level 60 in the outside world. * You can check a party member's aetherpool level by examining them. * You can be too far away from party members to gain EXP. * You can never be too far away to gain Aetherpool. * Joining an in progress party will result in your level being set to the average level of the party you join. * Going as a class, rather than a job, increases survivability for non-SMN DPS classes when solo. * Stat Allotment isn't calculated in Palace. * You can enter Palace of the Dead floor 51 solo in order to set up your hotbars in advance for classes you intend to level. * In Deep Palace, Paladin's non-ability stun and ability to cross-class Raise is very useful. * You can preview your Aetherpool Arms (Padjaal &amp; Kinna) by changing jobs on intermission floors. * You can get +2 (Brightens) and +3 (Flares) boosts to your Arm/Armor. These happen more frequently (only?) to whichever is currently your lowest. * You gain +1/+1 to Arm and Armor from defeating the bosses on Floor 50, Floor 100, and any boss above Floor 100. * Actual gear is irrelevant, so you can enter in glamour gear and it won't affect your stats. The only exception to this is that a Paladin or Gladiator will need to equip a shield before entry, or they will not get access to their shield based skills. The effectiveness of their Aetherpool Arm will also be halved. * Entering while equipped with a one-handed Conjurer's Arm or Thaumaturge's Arm will still result in having a two-handed at half potency inside unless a shield is also equipped. * Gear does not take damage in Palace of the Dead. * Gear will not spiritbond or bind to you if used in Palace of the Dead. * Probability of an Aetherpool upgrade is determined by the current floor you are on compared to your current aetherpool level. If the Arm/Armor's stats display in white, then a silver chest will always upgrade it. Yellow, it will become uncommon. At +99, it turns red, which means it cannot be upgraded further. **Hoard** For an in-depth look at how Hoard works, please find /u/matirion 's post down below. * Accursed Hoard has roughly a 33% chance of spawning per floor. * If the Accursed Hoard there, it is always there, whether you have an intuition up or not. Intuition only makes it visible. Standing on one without an intuition will spawn it. * Accursed Hoard mostly shares spawn maps with traps. The two are not mutually exclusive. A trap and a hoard can be in the same place at the same time. * Only one Hoard can spawn per floor. * Hoard cannot appear on boss floors. * Banded coffers cannot become mimics. * You can predict the rarity of the item as you're appraising from a sack. If the window lightly flashes, it will be a ""Common"" item from the sack. If two spiraling lights appear, it will be ""Uncommon."" If it spirals and then flashes quickly and brightly, it will be a PotD unique item. * Intuition detects the presence of a banded coffer, not a hidden piece of the hoard. If you activate a new intuition after finding the banded coffer, but not opening it, it will tell you you sense a piece of the accursed hoard. **Treasure Chests** * Chests come in four types: Gold (Pomanders), Silver (Upgrades), Bronze (Physical items), and Banded (Accursed Hoard). * Rooms will only display a descending hierarchy of chests. If it has a gold and a silver, it will only display a gold on the map. * Accursed Hoard does not appear on the map, if the coffer is left alone. * It is possible to use Signs to mark treasure chests, to alert your party to important/chests to be ignored (For that fifteenth purity pomander this floor) * Treasure chests dropped by mimics can be mimics. * Only Gold and Silver chests can explode. Silver chests seem to be more likely to explode than gold, however. * Any of the Gold/Silver/Bronze chests can become a mimic. * The droprate on Gelmoran Potsherds increases drastically on floor 101+, but the drop rate of Phoenix Downs seems to become 0. * Exploding chests deal 70% of maximum HP to all targets within range and can be used to damage monsters. These can outright kill if HP is low enough. * The Palace Corpse and Palace Dullahan without heads that are on patrol will not aggro you if you're not moving (even if you're engaged in combat.) **Traps** * The Silence/Pacify trap can be used to lock the abilities/spells of nearby monsters, provided they aren't immune to the status effect. * You can revert from frog by stepping into a second frog trap. * Landmines deal 80% of current HP to all targets within range and can be used to damage monsters. It will not kill on its own right. * Activating a luring or landmine trap will remove a Ninja's Hide. **Monsters** * Unique monsters that have died in various stories (Dungeons, questlines, etc) can spawn in Palace of the Dead. Gamer Escape has lore articles on these monsters, and who they were when they were alive. The articles can be found at URL &amp; URL * Unique monsters will behave as a typical ""Mummy"" enemy, devoid of the attack Rotting Bandages. Monsters with unique mechanics in the outside world (such as Half-cracked Captain) will not retain them. (Have not tested with all due to rarity.) * Mimics, Mandragoras, and Uniques, grant increased EXP and have a higher drop rate on treasure chests. * Mimics can be stunned up until floor 40. * Confusing a transformed person with a Lion's Cry will not cause them to attack other players, only stare menacingly at them. * Some monsters detect by sight or sound, while others have True Sound (Will hear you even if standing still or walking). Ninja can sneak by the former with Hide. Normal sound monsters can be gotten by by turning on walk mode, Normal sight monsters can be gotten by by running behind. * It is possible to ""Outrun"" Final Sting with sprint. The hornet, however, will not die, but its timer to recast Final Sting will reset. * If you slow a squirrel, it will attempt to spam Scamper in order to reapply haste. Its haste cannot override slow. * The effects of Eye of the Stunted from a Deep Palace Catoblepas will revert anyone transformed who is caught in it (And shrink them). * Level 5 Petrify and Level 5 Death used by various Deep Palace Ahrimen are frontal cones. * Affecting an Onyx Dragon with Silence and Pacify from a trap will cause it to repeatedly try using Chaos Eye and Miasma Breath on random targets in rapid succession, resulting in it flailing around wildly. * The effect of Bad Breath from a Morbol will remove the Damage Up of a Strength, but not the Healing Up. * In the event that all party members die to a boss, but the final one is revived with a Pomander of Raising, the boss will reset its position to its original and restore to 100% HP. * The sea serpent on floor 70's puddle grants it a haste boost if it is within it, but does nothing to a player stepping in. (No debuff, no dot) * The sea serpent on floor 170 gains both a haste boost and a damage up boost if it is in its puddle. The puddle still does nothing to players. * The Giddy Bomb on floor 90 can be used to stun The Godmother regardless of her built up stun resistance by catching her in its AoE, likewise, the Lava Bomb of floor 190 is capable of breaking The Godfather's stun immunity. * Massive Burst from the above will not kill, only reduce players to 1 HP. Players can sprint away in order to have a chance to be healed up in time. * The reason floor 160-169 does not have a monster who casts a ranged AoE is because it was assigned to Pteranodons, who are also the patroller of the area. If there is a monster room containing a Pteranodon, it will cast an instant cast lightning AoE on someone nearby for ~3k damage. * Vengeful Soul, from Gravekeepers, is soaked damage. * Monsters' internal timers continue even when they are stunned or Witchinged. Monsters with a hard enrage/hard kill will activate/begin using it as soon as they revert if they reach their timer. * Palace Cobras and Deep Palace Cobras will use devour, instantly killing a frogged player. * While engaged in combat, Deep Palace Bilokos will attempt to cast stoneskin on any nearby (engaged?) monsters. * The stacking physical vulnerability caused by Deep Palace Slimes will continue to apply, even if the slime is stunned. * The move used by the Floor 100 boss ""Accursed Pox"" only causes Disease. The move used by the same boss ""Doom"" does in fact cause doom (that can be removed with any cleanse). * Confirmed monsters with hard enrages/hard kills (Unsurvivable without being out of range/not their target): Palace Slime, Deep Palace Slime, Deep Palace Hornet, Deep Palace Demon, Deep Palace Sandworm. - This is not a full list, if you know anything else that has a hard enrage, please tell me. * Deep Palace Garm merits a mention. Though it isn't a hard enrage, Voice of the Ram and Voice of the Dragon are fatal should they hit a player. **Pomanders** * Water Imps deal more damage with their auto attacks than chickens or frogs. * Mandragoras will not die in one hit if transformed with a witching pomander, but if they have aggro on anyone, will die using Heirloom Scream immediately after reverting. * The knockback is what kills from Rage. Attempting to use a Rage on a floor with a knockback penalty will not kill (unless the damage from the attack is enough, of course) * Unmodified, the attacks from Lust, Resolution, and Rage have a rough potency of 200. * Requiem and a Bishop Turret's overcharge affect the damage of Lust and Resolution. * Attacks by transformation pomanders are affected normally by buffs and debuffs on the player and monster. This includes Bloodbath on a Rage, healing for ~2k an attack. * Wraiths are considered Ashkin, and are vulnerable to the increased damage of Resolution. This is useful against Au Puch on Floor 140. * Transformation pomanders will cancel any active bard song from the user. * Transformations are affected by Swiftsong, Ninja's enhanced movement speed, and Fists of the Wind. * The damage of transformation pomander actions is modified by Pomander of Strength. * It is possible to travel through the Cairn of Passage while transformed, allowing a fourth transformation pomander gained on a floor to be put to use. * The effect of Pomander of Fortune stacks with the increased drop rate by Uniques, Mimics, and Mandragoras. * The attacks of Lust and Resolution are blocked by Silence, but the attack of Rage is not blocked by Pacification or ability lock. * Rage's knockback is not a guaranteed kill on non-bosses. If a Deep Palace Salamander uses Mucilage, its stoneskin is strong enough to make it survive a hit from Rage. * Pomanders of Resolution (and raising?) cannot be gained before floor 61 (51?). * Pomander of Resolution can be used to prevent the adds on Floor 100 from respawning by casting its spell on their dead bodies. * Transformations cannot crit. **Layout and Floors** * There can only be one trap per room. * Music changes every 3 floors and is drawn from non-trial battle content, as well as events. Some obscure songs, such as the Go Go Posing Rangers theme, the dueling theme, and the theme of the solo instance version of Aetherochemical Research Facility are included in the possible track list. * Boss floors, floors 1-3, 47 to 49, and 97 to 99 have predetermined music. * Floors 101-199 seem to only draw on Dungeon music, but can also draw on the songs from 47-99 and 97-99. * Waymarks do not appear on the map, as they would in a normal area. * If the room that was designated as the spawn room for a floor is designated as a ""Monster Room,"" it will contain 4 chests, but one of the nearby rooms will instead contain all the monsters and a normal amount of chests. * An alteration pomander chooses a room on the next floor. If it chooses a monster room can create a monster room full of mandragoras or mimics. * Pomanders of Flight seem to have a chance to reduce the size of the floor as well reduce the number of monsters. * It is possible for a three room floor to spawn. These floors will occasionally need a monster to spawn in order to activate the Cairn of Passage. * The maximum dimensions of a floor will never go over 5 in height or width. * **Empirical observation only** I don't believe I've ever seen a floor with 10 rooms. The maximum number of rooms seems to be fewer. * It is possible for a floor to be a [Metal] chest floor. Every chest to appear on that floor will be of that color. (I had a floor with 7 rooms, 6 with chests, all silver. Two chests dropped from monsters, also silver) * Monsters also suffer the effect of Knockback Penalty, if the floor has it. * Knockback Penalty prevents a black mage from using Aetherial Manipulation. * Healers will either be locked into or locked out of Cleric Stance on an ability restricted floor. Likewise, warriors will be locked into either Defiance or Deliverance. Machinists and Bards will likewise be locked into Gauss Barrel/Minuet. * It is possible to circumvent this by allowing the person in question to die and be raised. * The Vulnerability Up effect of Lust overrides the Vulnerability Down of a gloom floor, but Trick Attack will not. * Negative floor effects skyrocket in probability on Floor 190+ * The intermission rooms are all located on the same map on your home server. Tells can be sent from here, and communication between rooms can happen through Shout and Yell. **Items** * The reward on floor 200 is seemingly random. Whether you are awarded with a Firecrest or a Glass Pumpkin at the end seems to be unrelated to your starting floor (1 or 51) or score (Received Firecrest on 2m and 2.5m, got a report of someone getting Glass Pumpkin with a score of 2.3m). * On clearing Floor 100, the Orchestrion Blasphemous Experiment becomes purchasable for 1 Gelmoran Pothsherd. 150 unlocks Fog of Phantom for 5, and 200 unlocks Notice of Death for 10. * Echo drops can be carried by mages to remove their silence from floor traps. * Echo drops, spine drops and smelling salts, and gold needles can be used on other party members. * Food works in Palace of the Dead, but does not grant the +3% experience points bonus. * On clearing floor 200, four new items become available for purchase. Firecrest Earring, Firecrest Trophy, Glass Pumpkin Earring, Glass Pumpkin trophie. Each cost either one Firecrest or Glass Pumpkin. * Floors 1-50 grant Bronze-trimmed Sacks, 51-100 Iron, 101-150 Silver, 151-200 Gold. * All Accursed Hoard sacks can drop the Palace of the Dead furnishings. * Bronze-trimmed Sacks can drop Modern Aesthetics: Samsonian Locks * Iron-trimmed Sacks can drop the Wind-up Edda minion and the Blackbosom Orchestrion roll. * Notable items from Silver-trimmed Sacks include: Ifrit, Garuda, Titan weapons. Replica Allagan weapons, Replica High Allagan armor, General-purpose Dye, and Abagail Barding. * Notable items from Gold-trimmed Sacks include: Ramuh, Bismarck, Ravana, Moogle, Replica High Allagan weapons and the Night Pegasus Whistle. It can also drop all previous unique Palace of the Dead items (Blackbosom, Wind-up Edda, Abagail Barding, Palace Pedestal, Interior Wall, Interior Floor, Samsonian Locks) I'll be editing this later if anyone gives me some good info, or I realize I forgot anything. Credit goes to myself, my free company, and many people in this thread."

Since Alexander - The Creator (Savage) is beaten by people within a single week from when 3.4 patch is released, now these people are actually looking for more contents to challenge at this moment. Although there are still many groups on progression to clear The Creator (Savage), it is true that there are no more challenging contents to progress further for hardcore players and there are still a lot of time left till the next hardcore raid tier comes out. If we expect the next savage-difficult raids would be on patch 4.0, we still have about 5-6 more months left. I am not sure about what Square Enix is going to introduce us some more contents for both casual players and hardcore players. Here, I just wrote some interesting guess on FFXIV's further contents for hardcore players who are seeking for the new contents to challenge. THIS IS 100% FICTION, my guess. Please look into these and leave some comments below. How do you think about these ""SAVAGE"" difficulty contents? If you like it, why do you like it? If not, why not?

Difficulty and number of mechanics would not be as hard as each Savage primal bosses. - No trash between four bosses; move onto the next boss using teleport. - increase in number/difficulty of mechanics - high damage from mechanics - high dps check Loots: - 150 Tomestones of Lore, 30 Tomestones of Scripture - Armors (same as Normal Raids) - New Mount or Minion.

(Water -&gt; Thunder -&gt; Gust, Gust -&gt; Water -&gt; Thunder... w/e) -&gt; Thok ast Thok (Savage) - Blinding Blade should be mitigated by stacking with a whole group. - Tapasha now leaves physical vulnerability down on a player who gets hit by it. First hit of Tapasha also requires cooldown mitigation to survive. - For seeing X mechanics: ""The Seeing Right"", ""The Seeing Left"" or ""The Seeing Wings"", failure of the mechanic will result in taking both slow debuff and huge knock-back effect(will fall off the arena if there isn't wall behind). - Laughing Rose targets both healers(if there's not enough healers, targets a random player instead) and leaves magical vulnerability down upon hit. Should be mitigated with a group of player to share its damage. getting hit by both will result in instant death due to magical Vulnerability up. - Swift Liberation now targets all 8 people with 4 different markers. Two clones of Ravana charge to two players with the same markers at the same time. Each charge leaves physical vulnerability up debuff on its target and players nearby. First two charges are from the center of the arena. (Since there are 2 markers for each marker, you cannot expect which clone will charge to which player with a same marker. There are two #2's!!!) - Final Liberation now leaves 4 Preys instead of 2 preys. Each player should pass the prey to players who did not get any prey before. Prey Targets will get physical vulnerability up while non-prey targets will targeted by AoE circles that leave magical vulnerability up debuff on a player and any players nearby. - Chandraha(or Ult) will always leave only a single wall. -&gt; The Minstrel's Ballad: Thordan's Reign (Savage) - There is no permanent safe spots for Three Dragoons' divebomb. The pattern differs every time. - During the Two paladins phase, a Dragoon spawns at the edge of the arena and does Divebomb through the center several times. Getting hit by it will result in instant death. The other two dragoons will target two random DPS and dive on them. Damage to non-target players is based on the distance from the target (Same mechanic as Extreme). Two tanks should position themselves in the safe area. - No change in number of 8 Comet circles and 1 big meteor circle at the center. More AoE's happening instead. - For Dragon's Eye, TWO eyes spawn outside of the arena instead of ONE. The angle between these two eyes is random.(can be 90 degree or 180 degree). - The mechanic with black holes(2nd boss' ability in The Vault(lvl57)) is added. Staying nearby will result in receiving a huge damage with a vulnerability up debuff. -&gt; Containment Bay S1T7 (Savage) - More complicate mechanics with Green Bubbles. - 180 degree room-wide Cleave mechanic happens with random combination between: 4 Green Expanding Bubbles(3 on one side, 1 on the other side, as T shape) + 3 Purple(big) Circle AoEs, or 3 Green expanding Bubbles(3 on one side) + 3 purple(big) circle AoEs + 5 green(small) circle AoE's. - Cochma leaves physical vulnerability down debuff on its target when it dies. The other tank should get the other Cochma. - Cochma enhances magical damage of Binahs if they are close enough. Should be tanked away from each other. - Sephirot divides the arena into two different colors when he casts Force of Field. standing in Orange area grants orange debuff while standing in Blue area grants blue debuff. When Six tethers spawn, 6 people should have blue debuffs to take these tethers and the other 2 should have orange debuff for towers. - The Tower damage is shared with the other players in the same tower. However, it leaves physical vulnerabiltiy debuff to anyone who took the damage. Since Earth Shaker is also physical damage, it's not really recommended to have everyone in the target. Also, Tank will not be able to survive the earth shaker or another tower attacks in the duration of physical vulnerabiltiy debuff. -&gt; The Minstrel's Ballad: Nidhogg's Rage (Savage) - Now, players can fall off the arena and every single Nidhogg's Divebomb will do knock back. - More complicate combination of Black Circle AoE + Hot Tail + Hot Wings - Shadow Dragon's Fireball now leaves a fire puddle on the floor. It will remain until the add phase ends. - Snake and Lizard adds will not die very quickly here. several tank swaps are required throughout the add phase. Shadow Dragon will apply vulnerability up to all players when its casting is completed at 50% of its HP. Instead, it can be silenced even though there is no casting bar. If Shadow Dragon is not dead in time, it will apply vulnerability up debuff to all players and it cannot be silenced. Vulnerability debuff cannot be cleansed and will remain until the add phase ends. Vulnerability debuff allows any damage from the enemies kill any players. (Add's auto attack will one shot your tanks with vuln up) - A lot more Geirskoguls and AoE stuff. Proper bait strategy is required. - Ala Morn now leaves 10 second long physical vulnerability up debuff and mostly followed by cleave attack. - 8 Small towers spawn instead of 4 towers. Two random players except for tanks are targeted by Soul Tether and Two tanks are supposed to take these off. - In final phase, Sable Price(Fire Orbs) also spawn when Akh Morn is happening. Appropriate positioning before Akh Morn is required. Also, 4 people are targeted by AoE at the same time. Only 4 people can stack for Akh Morn and the other 4 players targeted by AoE circles should spread out. Containment Bay P1T6 (Savage) - Players who fall off the arena are not able to be revived. - Head's laser attack will always result in instant death, instead of giving mild damage with vulnerability stacks. - Aero II is introduced in Savage. Aero II has same attack range as Thunder II. Knocks back any players got hit. - More combinations of Quasar Meteor. Blue meteor does not always mean heavier side. (1 Blue + 4 Reds can happen!) - Adds randomly spawn in the final phase mechanics. - For Aion Teleos, there can be more than 4 clones of Sophia. Also, Sophia now casts three different abilities for a single set of Aion Teleos/Execute (like, Thunder II+Aero III -&gt; Thunder III + Aero III+ Thunder II). - Tilt + Aion Teleos combination can also happen. (you're supposed to get into the safe spot with tilt sliding. Goal-in to Thunder III safe spot!!!) - combination of Tilt and Quasar meteors on the arena can happen. --------------------------------- Thank you very much! Please leave some comments and any other ideas!"

The fact you have a boss with an unavoidable aoe that hits you to 1 HP on the boss when you have the queueing system not even set up to ensure you have a healer is some of the poorest design choice ever. I'm not certain if they goofed up and messed up the % the 'big ability' is used on or what, but it is damn infurating when you lose all your progress all because you didn't have a healer (and keep in mind, did it with 5 vulnerability stacks on the boss too). If you want POTD to not require a healer, then design it around it. So many mechanics in it royally screw you over if you have no heals in the group and potions aren't enough to save you from it. "

(A11S Tips)",56,5b62el,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5b62el/forward_and_back_but_mostly_backwards_a11s_tips/,2016-11-05 07:38:23,"With the gentler difficulty curve of Creator and ease of Raid Finder, I thought I'd get back into some raiding. A9S and A10S were passable with some effort, but I've been stuck on A11S for the past 3 weeks. I've seen a wide spectrum of players during my 3 weeks of RFing (probably close to 100 attempts) and here are some tips I have for fellow RFers to make wiping to A11S less painful. * Know your directions, especially left and right! This concerns his Left/Right Laser swords. Getting hit by this won't outright kill you if you were at max HP when it happens, but the vulnerability stack that comes along as a free gift makes the boss' AoEs hit you even harder, potentially killing you. The main tank follows the direction of the sword being cast (i.e. Right Laser Sword -&gt; MT moves right). Everyone else goes the opposite of what is being cast (i.e. Right Laser Sword -&gt; Group moves left). Tanks, I know you have plenty of HP and can take a sword or two, but always remember that for every stack of vuln you have, your healer gets cancer ten times faster. * Use self heals if you have them, especially after the first Photon in the last phase. Sometimes that tiny Second Wind heal can make all the difference whether you die to Whirlwind or not. * Know the sequence of Photons, especially during the second phase as Pyretic (the fire debuff) can kill you if you move after being Photon-ed. Off-tanks, please don't get yourselves killed by this because we need you to get bashed in by E.D.D. instead. * If you have a WHM in your party, make sure you are within range of a Cure III. Similarly, if an AST is channeling Collective Unconscious (the pretty bubble thing), please stand in it. * For the DPS players, please know how to play your job effectively. Take some time and attempt the Stone, Sky, Sea A11S dummy and make sure you can get to sub 5% if not clear it. The last thing you want is to constantly wipe at 3-6% to GA-100 because DPS wasn't high enough (which happens a lot). Searching for A11S POV clears of your job also helps you figure out how you want to manage your cooldowns! * When the boss Limit Cuts into the dashing mechanic, spread out slightly to make sure the numbered dots above you are actually yours before moving to your pre-assigned locations. Some groups I've been in clump so tightly causing massive confusion as to who got which number. There is actually a significant delay before the boss starts charging so make good use of this time to be 100% sure what number you got. * The explosion animation of Aetheroplasms (the tether bubble mechanic during the Lapis Lazuli phase) is actually larger than the actual bubble they leave behind. The size/diameter of the bubble is roughly 1/6 of the outer circumference of the arena. The next time you load into A11, take a look at the floor pattern - It's divided into 6 slices. So think of the Aetheroplasms as giant pepperonis that you have to place neatly on each slice of 'pizza' and you'll be golden. * Healers, memorise the sequence of moves! If there isn't going to be massive AoE damage coming out for a while, let those HoTs and fairies heal the raid up while you DPS. Every extra damage counts, especially when you have fail DPSers who expect to get carried! TL;DR: Know your lefts and rights, get better at your jobs, use self-heals to help your healers, drop aetheroplasms like pepperonis on a 6-slice pizza! Hopefully these tips help you put one foot forward and clear A11S! (Back to the RF queue I go...)"
113,vulnerability,ffxiv,Because It's really hard to find one: Here's a basic rundown of Palace Of The Dead 1-50 for newcomers.,0,5cb4db,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5cb4db/because_its_really_hard_to_find_one_heres_a_basic/,2016-11-11 10:20:57,"This entire guide will assume you're using the Matched Party Feature. FLOOR 1-10: This one is VERY simple, almost too easy. All 4 of you will start at LvL 1, and only have 1 attack, not that it matters because you'll two shot everything until about floor 3. Feel free to split up and look for treasure. When you get to the boss, it really helps if you have a Pomander of Lust, as it will melt him down is seconds, keep in mind that two people can use the same Pomander if you're quick, so if you have a friend, count it down. FLOOR 11-20: Once you're in you'll notice two things. You're about two levels below or above your other team mates, and none of your inventory saved, this trend will continue until you're lvl 60. This time it's a good idea to split into teams of two to cover more ground, you can knock it out in a good 30 minuets that way. The boss is very similar to the first one with some added health, just pop your Lust and go HAM. FLOOR 21-30: This is probably the first time you're going to see a death. You should all be together in a group of 4. Stop at the beginning of rooms and let a ranged team mate grab the aggro of the enemies inside, this is the best strat for clearing rooms from here on unless you have a Pomander of Rage. Use them sparingly, but you will be able to one shot everything while under its effect. There is no need to save it for the boss, but *try* to use them on 25 and up. This boss is very simple as well, but he has some added AOE attacks and once again, added health. A lust and some good DPS is really all you need. FLOOR 31-40: Shit gets real here. Lots of adds, and most of them are hard to take out solo unless you have a DOT or like me, A Bishop Turret. Try to kill as many things as possible as you REALLY want to be above lvl 50 for the boss. He's pretty easy as well though, but there is an attack you want to look out for. I forget the exact name of it, so if someone in the comments would help that would be greatly appreciated, but when we casts it you want to be far away and look away from him, or else you will lose control of your character and possibly get hit by an AOE, and these ones hurt. Two lusts and a ground DPS is the ideal set up. FLOOR 41-50. So, you made it this far, great job. Now you just gotta beat that spooky lady you're seeing in all the cutscenes. But we'll get there in time. A LOT of time, this is one of the longest floors you've faced yet. It's similar to 31-40 but with bigger floors and more enemies. Your Pomanders of rage are gonna come in handy here, but they don't make you invincible, so be smart with them and only use 1 at a time. Once you get to floor 50, it's on to the boss. FINAL ROUND, FINISH HER: Okay so the first thing you want to know about is her AOE attacks. For one you need to be right underneath her, and for the other you have to be far away. Getting hit by these will not only heal her, but it will charge a Glyph on the ground, they're the big glowy red symbols. If she manages to get 3 or 4 of these charged, it is very punishing. She will use a large room wide attack that is unavoidable, and the damage that is dealt depends on the number of Glyphs lit up. 1 and 2 hurt, but are tankable, 3 and 4 are very punishing, with 4 almost killing everyone, and 5 is a wipe no matter what, So bring your A game and dodge those AOES. She will also have a similar attack to another boss that I mentioned earlier, It is called ""Cold Feet"" and when she casts it you must look away or you will lose control of your character. She also has a move that will spawn an AOE under everyone in the room, so be ready for that too, preferably you guys want to be semi-close together the entire fight with the exception of the large room wide AOE. Other than that it's straight DPS, and the Pomander of Lust once again comes in handy here for Vulnerability stacks which in turn, let the DPS do more damage. Do all that and you should be good to go. She will drop a Gelmorran Potsherd after she dies, which can be used to purchase things like Materia, Minions, and a mount for 10. And there you have it, 1-50 explained. I realise this guide could stand some improvement, so if I left anything out or made an error, let me know. "
114,vulnerability,ffxiv,"The (nearly!) complete PoTD Mob and Boss Addendum. All the information you wanted but couldn't find, all in one place.",181,5cu3x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5cu3x7/the_nearly_complete_potd_mob_and_boss_addendum/,2016-11-14 15:18:23,"I'm going to preface this by saying I do not know every mob and how they all work, so any suggestions I should add or change are more than welcome. I'm writing this fresh out of a floor 197 wipe, so I'd like to put this helpful info down while it's still ripe in my mind because we had a hard time finding it outselves. Let's get to it. *EDIT: I am requesting that if anybody knows specific mob names that are weak to kuribu to let me know, so I can add a new section for mobs kuribu is well against* **IMPORTANT** **ADDS** * **Slimes** -These will put a vuln stack with every auto, so pull these cautiously. They also will still explode but will take much longer to do so. * **Onyx** **Dragon** (Black dragon) -These mobs will always start with a conal gaze followed immediately by another cone aoe, unsure if being hit by this applies status effects or not. Position appropriately. The first gaze CAN be silenced. * **Deep Palace Anzu** (Name from /u/Star-Seer and /u/tylian) -Applies windburn to random targets and will also target a random party member for a bodyslam that stuns and adds a vuln stack with big damage on anyone within the radius. Keep sufficiently spread when encountering these. (/u/chain_eremi) * **Bird** **of** **the** **Deep** **Palace** (Name from /u/EverythingFinal) -Two moves; it casts Revelations on party members (targeted AOE circle, has a cast time and is dodgeable), and casts a silenceable Tropical Wind buff that applies Damage Up and Haste Up to itself. (/u/Star-Seer) * **Gravekeepers** (The ones with big coffin things on their arms) -These ones have a very bright cleave that is just as dangerous as it is pretty. If you aren't the tank, this could be fatal to you. This is cast shortly after they have been aggroed, but not right away. (/u/drolra) FOOTNOTE: This may be splittable among a stacked party (/u/PhantomWings). These apparently aggro by sound, so if you stand still or toggle walk you should be able to sneak past them way easier. (/u/AlbrechtAcalladem) * **Flood** **Dragon** (light bluish dragon) -These dragons will always start with a small ice aoe centered on the person with aggro, so when pulling these try not to clip your teammates as they will shoot the ice while you are pulling them. After this, typical granite rain and dodge the red. They are also capable of targeting players with a medium circle AOE, aggroed or not. **Nankas are also capable of this** * **Deep** **Palace** **Wraith** (Look like floating jackets, someone please comment the correct name if I am wrong please) -Still have the usual huge roomwide AOE, stunnable. In addition, they can target players with a medium circle aoe without having any aggro on them. At higher floors, try not to let these AOE's push you into other packs of mobs or you might pull too much. * **Deep** **Palace** **Knight** -At 191+ these guys will telegraph their instant kill move with a dark red indicator and a noise, the only safe spot is the circle around him that isn't indicated with red. If you are not inside this circle very fast, it will ~~instantly~~ ~~kill~~ ~~you.~~ inflict around 16k damage unmitigated (/u/drolra and /u/gamesmart). The range on the outside I am unclear on, but it is at least as large as a whole room and half of the hallways attached to it, so you're better off trying to run into the safe spot. I did not encounter these until floor 197. * **Deep** **Palace** **Bicephalus** -These guys look like the last boss of copperbell mines. They aren't too spicy, but always initiate with a leaping punch that hit me for around 3-4k in shield oath. They only have normal small AOE's that need to be dodged and a haymaker move that hits about as hard as their leaping punch. Healer should be on the ready for critical hits though, as those can kill you. * **Ahriman** -These appear in 191+. They will cast *Level 5 Death*, a conal AOE that has no telegraph on the ground but the casting bar. If you don't stun it, or step out of the way, you will be instantly killed. * **Deep** **Palace** **Worm** -The slimes of 180+; you need to kill these FAST or they will suck in the entire party and squash you like a bug. It is unknown to me how large this radius is, if it can be dodged, or if it can be negated by immunity as when I tried it on PLD it either went straight through it or I just wasn't fast enough. If you are on PLD, I advise stun locking these at around 50%, they should die before your diminishing return has run it's limit. The damage on the bodyslam is proximity based. (/u/chain_eremi) * **Gorillas** -These ones will periodically pound their chest and roar several times in succession, applying a vulnerability stack every roar to everyone within the very, very large radius. Before pulling these, let them stop roaring and let the stacks drop off of you as they only last around 10 seconds. In addition, avoid tanking mobs within the vicinity of a gorilla's roaring or it could make it hard on the healer to keep your tank alive. * **Lions** -Casts a large aoe called ""cry"" that does a sizeable amount of damage. (/u/chain_eremi) I am also pretty sure they have a hard hitting swipe attack that may or may not be a cleave. * **Chimeras** -These will be EVERYWHERE on floors 185-187, most of the time roaming. When you spawn in the floors you will probably have one already on it's way. I advise pulling these one at a time and not with other mobs, pull to a safe corner away from other patrolling mobs if you must. The mechanics are the same as every chimera, except dragon's voice is a possible one shot for ranged and the freeze is like 10-15s long. **REMEMBER:** You need to be close to something if you want to ram it, so if he casts Voice of the *Ram*, RUN AWAY! If he casts Voice of the *Dragon*, you need to stack INSIDE it's hitbox. *See /u/ruan1387 's comment below on a better way to remember this; I didn't want to cut and paste it here because it's already top comment.* * **Crocodiles** -When pulling these into hallways try to position them so they are perpindicular with the walkway, so you don't point their conal AOE at your ranged. Being hit by this does a LOT of damage and will likely kill the tank if the healer isn't ready for the next auto. They will do this AOE from both the head and tail. * **Deep** **Palace** **Demons** -Will cast Charybdis if they arent killed fast enough. This hit /u/Hakul 's SCH for ~16k. Unsure if it can be spread among the party. * **T** **Rexes** -Same deal as crocodiles, except their AOE's are circular shaped. * **Scorpions** -Try to face these away from the party. They will do a big suck in move to pull your party close, and then will impale whoever has the prey icon for medium (3-4k in shield oath) damage. Will target a random player with tail screw and will hit dps for about 2/3 of their HP, so healers be ready. ~~I~~ ~~am~~ ~~unaware~~ ~~if~~ ~~this~~ ~~is~~ ~~an~~ ~~AOE~~ ~~or~~ ~~not~~ *It is an AOE* (/u/Star-Seer). Avoid stacking. * **ALL** **MOBS** -Whether they have special abilities or not, you need to be careful of crits. Even critted autos from any mobs above 171 can do up to 10k damage on the tank. This is one of the reasons why I recommend only pulling 1 at a time if possible beyond 150, unless you're going for a high score at the end. *If you think I missed any important ones, please tell me in the comments so I can add it.* **BOSSES** * **110** / *Alicanto* -Weak roomwide AOE with a few targeted AOEs. Tank and spank. * **120** / *Kirtimukha* -Same as floor 20, except with bee adds. Kill these quickly or you'll bee stung to death. * **130** / *Alfard* -Tank him at the edge, and all ranged also hug the edge to keep his targeted AOEs out of the middle of the room. When he runs to the center, stand under him to dodge hysteria. * **140** / *Ah* *Puch* -Use shields and other mitigation if he uses his big aoe move (I forget what it's called) and use the kuribu pomander when the adds spawn to burn him down quick. Good DPS will allow you to push phase. * **150** / *Tisiphone* -Avoid large succubus terror AOEs. When crawling adds appear, kill them quickly as they will root you when they get to you. It's not a death sentence, but if they root you inside of an AOE, it could spell trouble. There is also an unavoidable raidwide AOE called blood rain, with a cast bar. Later, a second succubus will spawn. After some time, the boss will eat this add and heal for however much HP is remaining. However, it will reduce the damage of the previously mentioned Blood Rain, so if you have 4 people and the DPS then you don't need to kill this add. (/u/DarkhShadow) * **160** / *Todesritter* -Bait targeted bleed AOEs to the edge of the arena. If you are targeted by his linear charge, be sure to position so you aren't knocked into a bleed circle. If you shield and mitigate all of the charge damage, you will not be pushed. Tempered will works here as well. * **170** / *Yulunggu* -Tank pull him out of the water puddles on the ground, and healer be ready to cleanse the heavy that will be applied on the tank each time or he may be caught in the AOE. * **180** / *Dendainsonne* -More tornadoes, avoid them. Tempered will does negate the suck in from the tornadoes. When he jumps to the side of the arena, avoid his front as he will do a large conal AOE and run through called trounce that will do a lot of damage if you are hit. At about 20% HP he will begin to cast meteor like in floor 80, but much more rapidly and it is unlikely you will skip it this time. Stack up and prepare a deploy, virus, divine veil, whatever you got, and burn. Not needed, but it will probably be easier on the healer if you save melee LB for this stage. If you don't kill him fast enough the meteors will eventually outdamage your healer and you will wipe. * **190** / ~~The~~ ~~Godfather~~ ~~Blue~~ ~~Slimer~~ *Living* *Liquid* *after* *he* *got* *fired* *from* *from* *his* *job* *in* *Gordias* -Avoid tiny bombs when they appear. Kill large orange bomb, but push the large blue bomb into the boss so it's explosion indicator is inside the bosses target ring. It only has to barely be in to count. The distance the bomb flies is proportional with damage it is hit with, and is knocked back harder by physical than magic damage. The tiny bombs exploding also count as damage to it, so don't let it get knocked away from the boss by a tiny bomb. In addition, make SURE that pets will not hit it also, because it will count as two hits and launch the bomb too far. This means you shouldnt let your MCH do the bomb pushing (/u/Delois2 , /u/ser_metryk). To help counteract this, I recommend tanking him right on the wall just in case you push it a little far, because it will just stop at the wall and still hit him. **TIPS** * Always hug the walls and pull to the hallways, because there is no chance of traps in hallways. * When you spawn into the floor, try and figure out if you can see the cairn of passage from where you are. if you can see it, clear mobs in that direction first, and go back if you need to kill more. If you can't see it, then use a pomander of sight or pick a random direction you feel good about. * Save witching pomanders for spawn traps unless you have 3 of them or are in a very hard situation, like 3 approaching chimeras. * When using manticore pomander, take care and remember you are not invincible and you can still trigger traps. If your tank is on the same wavelength, let them pull mobs to you one at a time. * If everybody is 99/99, don't bother with silver chests because at that point all they are is potential ~~mimics~~ bombs (/u/gamesmart). * after 170, I personally would never use alteration. The risk of an entire room of mimics is too great, unless you are willing to suffer through the pox. * If you are on paladin, make sure to cross class raise. * After floor 180, you should consider every orange indicator an ability that will 1 shot you. Because in most cases, it will, including tanks. * If you are a DRK/PLD with sight pomander on, you can pull mobs into a bomb on purpose while you have immunity on to bring each add to 10% HP. The bomb trap icon looks kind of like a square shaped star. Works best on PLD, don't think it's possible on WAR. * Bloodbath (MRD Skill, Crossclassable) is procced by your Manticore hits. This means its like a 7k heal every time you slug something. (/u/Onigokko0101) * Mobs will use their strongest ability immediately after coming out of witching pom. For example, if you witching a worm and don't kill it, it is going to use it's pull in &gt; bodyslam move as soon as it is back to it's normal form. * My group started pulling only one at a time from floor 150 onward, but if your party is good you can probably pull more than that until 171. After 171, I recommend pulling only one at a time in anticipation of spawn traps and roaming mobs. * Another thing my group did was have our SMN be our sort of watch for roaming mobs. They made a macro to say ""Roaming mob incoming! &lt;se.7&gt;"" In chat so the tank can grab it before it smashes someone else. This is helpful, but the takeaway from this tip is just be observant and aware for roamers. The macro is just something that can help you help your team if you know they aren't keeping an eye out.

115,vulnerability,ffxiv,Sophia EX Mechanics,86,54q3cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/54q3cm/sophia_ex_mechanics/,2016-09-27 21:22:26,"Excited for this primal because the music is ridiculously godly. Will update as mechanics are discovered. Honestly feels like this EX Primal is much more unforgiving than a lot of the recent ones. This is what I know so far: **First Phase** Thunder III = Donut attack. Thunder II = Tank frontal cleave. Aero II = AoE around her. Four Black Shadows= Whatever abilities Sophia uses will be tethered onto the adds in two patterns. Avoid these. Execute will then be cast where all adds simultaneously use their ""borrowed moves."" Daughter thingy = Directional knock off. *Credit to u/deuxclydion = If damage is mitigated, you are not affected by the knock back. **Cloudy Heavens (Add Phase)** The Third Dermiurge (Lancer) = Does a raid wide AoE vulnerability and also drops ice shit. Gnostic Rant = Works a lot like Ravana's charge up and then spinning circles, stack behind him for it. Rest are pretty straightforward. Kill second. The Second Dermiruge (Healer) = Divine Spark confuses people, so look away. Kill first because he heals the fuck out of other adds. The First Dermiruge (Paladin) = Knocks back and has directionals parry. Immersion = Seems to turn people into zombies when it hits the targeted player or anyone in the Aoe. Maybe mitigation in time will prevent this? Haven't tested. Phase transition = Stack on the right of the arena to be knocked left and then right and then mitigate the large damage. **Second Phase** Quasar = Essentially a mechanic caller. You will see tethers. The very first thing that will happen is that it will drop proximity damage AoEs around each player. Stack accordingly on one side of the arena, then move to the other. Beam mechanics: You will see blue meteors and orange, smaller meteors drop down. Watch the ships on either side when these meteors drop down to determine which area of the arena you should run to. You should always run away from the blue meteor. Also, the orange meteors determine how far across the arena you will be knocked depending on the strength of the colored meteors. This will be an important mechanic later in deciding how far across the platform you'll need to stand in order not to be struck by lasers when you're knocked across it. --- After all of this, the second beam mechanic will be cause you to slide nearly across the entire arena. You must stack on the very corner of one side of the arena or you will die. A *DIVEBOMB* will happen at the same time. Pretty straightforward. She'll appear at one side of the arena and fly across, dealing massive damage and causing a vulnerability stack. She will cast some kind of Balance spell and party members will be affected with an equal amount of Black/White circles underneath. One black/white marked party member must stack with each other. No more than one or there will be tons of damage. Tank Buster = You will see her charge up and then strike the tank with a lightning resist down + tons of damage. Tank swap every time or the affected tank will die. Cintamani = In between this will be Cintamani, which will be tons of AoE damage. It will strike 2x for the first time. And then when the four shadow adds from earlier are spawned, it will strike three times. The tank with Lightning Resist down will be hit for around 10k+ damage so they will need heavy healing. Her daughter thingy will also spawn at this time to spit out this vertical laser thingy across the arena when you are being knocked across the arena. **Edit:** Unfortunately, I had to leave before my group could clear due to a mandatory side quest called Real Life (currently dying inside because I can't play for another few hours), but this fight has been cleared by a lot of groups already. I've covered most of the mechanics (apologize for the format) and the fight's last phase pretty much makes the divebomb/laser spitting daughter thingy a tad bit more complicated. Thanks for everyone's inputs and comments and good luck in clearing to you all! "

If the outer ring flashes it will be a Rare treasure. * Glamor - Common * Minon - uncommon * Hairstyle - Extremely rare * Materia - Common 2. If the outer ring does NOT flash- it will be a normal treasure * Fireworks - Most common * Food - rare * Medicine - rare * Crafting mats - uncommon * ***The Level of the floor the sack is found on does not impact the quality of treasure recieved*** * If farming solely for Hoard treasures, it is recommended to only spam floors 1-20. i've cleared the 100 treasures achievement, and regularly get 2-4 treasures per clear using this method. * it is an extremely good idea to farm these in a fixed party as you will have times where an abundance of intuitions will drop, and you wont be able to use them all in one set of floors. * If spamming 1-20 in a fixed, if you complete 20 with at least 2 intuitions remaining, it is a good idea to farm floor 20-30, and continuing that trend any time you finish a floor sequence with at least 2 intuitions remaining. * You can do this on your 60 class to get a boatload of scrips/lore super fast. ##Bronze Rimmed Sacks Currently this is the only item that is rewarded out of the Accursed Hoard. it is likely only going to be rewarded for floors 1-50 Respond below if you have an item to add to the list. ##**its likely all the Aquapolis drops were mirrored into POTD From the items that are dropping** ###Confirmed Materia * All tier IV Elemental * All tier IV Combat * All Tier V Elemental * All Tier V Combat * Have not received any crafting or gathering materia - it likely doesnt drop ###Confirmed Items * ALL fireworks including limited time seasonal fireworks * Low level foodstuffs * Stat boosting potions * Crafting mats * Furnishings * Clear Demi materia I-III (possibly includes all other demi materia) ###Confirmed NEW Minions * Edda Minion (NEW - May not be in the loot pool currently; apparently they ninja removed the minion) * All Aquopolis Minions ###Confirmed Glamors * High House Set * Griphon Skin Set * Thravarian Bustier Set * Thravarian Bolero Set * Explorers Set * Moonfire Male set * Moonfire Female Set * Survival set * Falconers set * Feathered Wedgecap ##Silver Rimmed Sack * In the Dats- Not yet implemented.

(See treasure rooms below) ###Pomander of lust Damage now scales with level, and gains the benefit of the vulnerability stacks. Attacks now generate aggro. ###Pomander of rage Increased damage against boss targets significantly. is now a viable option for boss combat.

However, very often the other tank just dies, but sometimes they live. Am I missing something here? The same also happens to me - I would use two CDs (Shadow Wall with Foresight, and alternate with Shadowskin with Dark Mind) - sometimes I live, but other times I die. Should I do anything differently? As DRK, I have the following defense CDs: 1) Shadow Wall (30% damage reduction), duration 10 seconds, cooldown 180 seconds 2) Foresight (20% defense), duration 20 seconds, cooldown 120 seconds 3) Shadowskin (20% damage reduction), duration 20 seconds, cooldown 90 seconds 4) Dark Mind (15% magic vulnerability reduction), duration 10 seconds, cooldown 60 seconds I would use 1 and 2 together, then the next TB I would use 3 and 4 "
118,vulnerability,ffxiv,Patch 3.4 Savage Raiding - Week One Analysis,0,55p2ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/55p2ap/patch_34_savage_raiding_week_one_analysis/,2016-10-04 05:18:03,"As we come to a close on the first week of Patch 3.4, I look around across vocal communities like here on Reddit and on the Official Forums, and I see a great deal of players voicing their opinions on the status of Alexander and the endgame raiding scene. I think it it goes without saying that The Creator is the easiest (and also the most poorly tuned) raid tier released in the history of the game, and yet the number of people voicing their approval over this just baffles me. **Why is The Creator poorly tuned?** To begin with, it is the very first week of the patch. Most people have anywhere from 0 to 1 piece of i270 gear. And yet simply through DPSing with i240 gear from Patch 3.2, or i250 crafted (which is still immediately available with very little time investment to attain) many groups are *skipping entire phases and mechanics* simply by DPSing the boss. In every previous raid tier, the luxury of skipping mechanics was reserved to those who had seen and cleared the fight enough to be properly geared, at least in part, with loot *from the same patch as the content*, yet in The Creator, were demolishing bosses and skipping mechanics on the first day. [Theres even a group who has killed The Refurbisher in almost four minutes, for Christs sake.]( URL In A11S, you can skip Whirlwinds, Plasma Shields, GA-100s, and even more Whirlwinds just by damaging the boss, in two-patch-old i240 gear. To make matters even worse, the fact that this is doable on week one renders any gear from this patch pointless. Completionists and people with OCD will still farm the content weekly to get the gear, but gear itself is still pointless; it makes your character stronger, sure, but it serves no real purpose because youve already cleared the content with none of it anyway. The problem of the above, in regards to kill speed, will become even more exacerbated as people grow closer and closer to getting their BiS and full i270 sets. The fights that are already a joke will become even more hilariously so and quickly become irrelevant thanks to the power gains achieve from adding more i270 gear. In previous tiers, even when a character was in full BiS, they could maybe skip one or two things if their raids DPS was good, but BiS in this tier will make the fights completely irrelevant and embarrassing. It confuses me after seeing all of this that there can be so many people who still voice approval over all of this, and then I realize that these cries of joy over the difficulty reduction are from the games casual players. And theres nothing wrong with being a casual, laid-back player, but it concerns me that there are so many people who feel it is within their right to attempt, *and then complain*, about something that clearly wasnt made and tuned with them in mind. Hell, upon checking their lodestones **some of them dont even raid to begin with.** Raiding is, has been, and always will be, an extremely niche activity. Its not for everyone. If youre not really an endgame raider, if raiding just isnt your strong point, then perhaps Savage isnt the difficulty mode for you. Do Normal which is much more lenient and forgiving. It really doesnt get any simpler than that. Its like ""Easy/Normal/Hard"" difficulty options in other games. You want to beat the game, and you want to enjoy the fights and have fun with it, then play it on Normal. Why play the game on ""Hard"" if it's just going to make you struggle or upset you? Why make the other game players who actually enjoy the challenge of the Hard difficulty setting suffer with watered down mechanics and difficulty, just so that you can play a difficulty you probably shouldn't be undertaking to begin with? **But the content should be more accessible** Yoshida [said in an interview]( URL that, for normal, the number of players clearing is far more than we expected, which is really good. As of late October, at least about 50% of players who are actively playing battle classes have completed all four parts of normal Alexander Gordias. This is *Normal* mode; only half of the games active subscribers/players (that are max level) even entered **Normal** mode. If only half of the people who are Lv60 even attempt the normal content, which is already very simple to get into, and mechanically very forgiving, then what good is making Savage easier going to do? Youre not going to entice more people to play Savage and get more clears. Youre just going to do what youve done right now: upset the raiders that were already here before. Not only can you skip phases on Day One, but you dont even get punished for failing mechanics half of the time. In Sophia EX, in parts of Savage Creator, if you or someone screws up you get a Vulnerability stack, but the stack isnt even lethal and barely increases the damage you take. Even at three stacks of Vulnerability, youre only take like maybe 10-15% more damage. Its incredibly forgiving; annoyingly forgiving. During the Lapis Lazuli phase of A11S, when tethered orbs appear, they cant even be triggered by anyone other than their tethered target; any of the other seven people in the raid who werent the initial tether target can just walk through them like theyre not even there. If that type of mechanic existed back in Coil (and in fact it did in Gordias and Midas), anyone touching the ball would cause a reaction. Why do things have to be dumbed down for players who shouldnt be doing this content to begin with? The more laidback, casual players already have 95% of the other content; why cant they just leave the remaining 5% to the 5% of people who want challenging content? Why must they gorge themselves on the entire cake? I mean isnt this why Normal and Savage were introduced to begin with? People complained that Binding Coil of Bahamut was too hard and inaccessible, so starting with Alexander, they added a Normal Mode for people who found Coil too hard, and a Savage mode for people who enjoyed the difficulty Coil had. But no, thats not enough. The people who complained about Coil being too hard, are now here to complain that Savage Alex is too hard, because they still feel they should be entitled to completing that content. But heres the thing: Savage content wasnt made for them. It was made for the people who enjoyed the difficulty of Binding Coil and thought it was fine where it was. Normal is what was made for those people, and Normal is where those people should be going for any raiding experiences that they want. An extremely common misconception people seem to have is that Savage costs too much to properly make for such a small number of people, and that couldnt be further from the truth. Money is spent designing one mode (in the case of FFXIV, Savage mode), and then from there its tuned downwards for Normal. So in developing Savage for a tier, all the art assets, all the models, all the animations, are created with Savage in mind. Believe it or not, once an asset is created, it doesnt cost money to use it again. The cost to create Normal after Savage is mere pennies. Theres nothing new that needs to be created or added; its merely tuning. So what happens now? If Yoshi adds a third difficulty (Normal/Hard/Savage) then its just going to be a repeat again. People who cant do the hardest difficulty will always complain that the hardest difficulty is too hard, because they feel entitled to the content and that it should be within their ability to do it. As long as the best gear (that they dont even need) is in the highest difficulty, people will forever complain. Its an unfortunate reality, I feel, and its a shame that Yoshida and the development crew cant see this. tl;dr - actually read it."
119,vulnerability,ffxiv,When people think having a clear is an excuse for shitty playing.,3,55rkes,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/55rkes/when_people_think_having_a_clear_is_an_excuse_for/,2016-10-04 14:11:44,"This is a rant because after dealing with this idiot I need to vent. Sophia EX learning party, playing healer. Everything's looking good, leader is detailing all the mechanics and the only odd thing that sticks out is the request for cure3 spam which I just let go since I figure I'll just see how badly the healing is needed later on. Fight starts and the first Thunder 2 goes out. Tank eats it and builds a vuln stack right off the bat. I'm thinking ""maybe they're new and didn't know about it, I'm sure they'll dodge from now on"" and even go out of my way to tell them in party chat ""don't just eat the vuln stacks"" just to be clear. We eventually wipe to low dps on the add phase. Fight starts beck up, first Thunder 2 and... they take it straight to the face... again... vuln stack. I stop where I am and start typing out again ""don't eat the vuln stacks"" and end up moving too late and catch the knockback too late and fly off. This is like a minute in and a wipe trying to explain what should be a simple mechanic shouldn't be an issue. So we're prepping for the third attempt and for the third time ""please stop eating unnecessary vuln stacks"". Leader of the group chimes in ""cure 3 ignores vuln stacks""... what? This didn't click for me later... but the leader was having their friend the tank INTENTIONALLY take the vuln stacks rather than simply moving to the side because they both somehow believed that vulnerability (damage taken increased) is the same as infirmity (recovery via healing reduced) and that casting cure 3, as an aoe not targeted directly at the person with the stacks, would bypass the healing debuff. Then the tank tacks on ""well make sure you don't fall off again, thats just as bad"". Again... falling off once while explaining a mechanic is somehow ""just as bad"" as deliberately planning to build vulnerability stacks across an entire fight. So after the tanks comment i give them a flat out ""well fuck you too, I'm sorry I fell off but apparently I had to take the time mid fight to explain how vulnerability works to a tank"" And this is where they drop it. ""Hey, I have a clear here do you?"" to which I reply ""well then shouldn't you know better then?"" ... ""well do you?"" Left the trial and dropped from the group. Edit: I managed to catch up with the leader later on and tried to get an answer from them on exactly what ""cure 3 ignores vuln stacks"" means and it ends up I was wrong... which is even worse. Thinking vulnerability is a healing debuff would at least make a really wrong kind of sense, but he knew exactly how vulnerability works and simply wanted me and the other healer to brute force our way through the entire fight spamming cure3 to make up for the extra damage the tank would be taking. And keeping in line with the theme of this post their argument centered around ""listen I have over 30 wins so I know what I'm doing""."

Let me know if I go into too much or not enough detail, hope this helps those of you that are still progressing. **Phase 1 abilities:** Goblin Rush: Periodically uses this throughout the fight, just moderate damage on the MT. Gobsway Rumblerocks: Raidwide 9k damage. Henceforth referred to as Raid AoE. Gobrush Rushgob: Tank buster, hits 3 times for 8k apiece unmitigated. Henceforth referred to as Tank Buster. Gobslash Slicetops: Tank swap mechanic. Current MT gets targeted for an AoE attack that does less damage the further you are from the boss. Also places a very strong Physical Vulnerability on all who get hit. Henceforth referred to as Prey. Gobsnick Leghops: If you're moving when the cast completes, you get hit by a single target attack for 28k (Tank privilege, anyone?). Henceforth referred to as Blighted. Trap: Activates a non-random trap on the floor. Discharge: Used in conjunction with Trap, places AoEs on the floor that you have to dodge as well as dodging the trap that was activated. Hits for 20k. Frostbite: Northern-most trap. Left and right sides of the arena are pummeled with ice arrows, dealing 20k damage and a Frostbite DoT that ticks for 2k. Impact: Middle trap. All of the traps get hit with a small AoE that hits for 16k and places a Vulnerability Up debuff. Spikes: Southern-most trap. Spikes come up from the floor, giving a bind, a bleeding debuff that ticks for 3k, and a Knockback Penalty debuff. Critical Wrath: Everyone gets targeted for an AoE that does 12k damage. Indicator is a white-blue aoe with outward pointing Arrows. Henceforth referred to as Spread. Bomb Toss: One random non-MT gets targeted for a 100k damage stacking AoE. Indicator is an orange-ish circle with inward facing arrows. Henceforth referred to as Stack. Gobspin Whooshdrops: AoE around the boss, hits for 20k. Indicator is a red downward facing triangle. Henceforth referred to as Out. Gobswipe Conklops: Aoe around the boss with a safe zone in the middle, hits for 18k. Indicator is a green donut. Henceforth referred to as In. Adds: Lameprix Strikedox: Hits for 3k, if he gets near the boss they tether and both receive a 200% damage up stack until the tether is broken. Uses Gobswish Spraymops, which is a 270 degree conal AoE, just like Scrapline from A9n. He starts out with two Raid AoEs, so having an Adlo Deploy up beforehand is actually useful in this fight. Recommend pulling him between the north and the middle traps. First thing he does is Single Charge, and it's either Stack or Spread, so react accordingly. Next up is Trap, triggering the spikes, then it's the one of Stack or Spread that he didn't do. The tell isn't until after the spikes go up, so you need to know what it is before it happens. Following this is Prey on the MT. Unfortunately, this isn't a cast, so he'll follow you. As a result, you have to tank swap *before* the mechanic goes out. Do the swap with OT standing to the side, and have MT run due north. After the swap is a quick Tank Buster, followed by one more Raid AoE, into the next mechanic. 3 Discharge AoEs along the middle, as he uses Trap to activate Frostbite. As soon as the AoEs go off, get to the middle ASAP, because Frostbite goes off about 2s after. Then after a quick Blighted to demonstrate the mechanic, you have the add spawn, paired with In. Since they tether if you bring them together, your OT should treat this like a tank buster and just immediately pull the add away, facing him away for the cleave. **Note that the boss jumps away to do Single Charge. If he jumps to where the add spawns, do not pull the add away or you will die.** While you're burning down the add, he'll do a Raid AoE followed by a Tank Buster, so don't get too carried away with healer DPS. Next up is Trap, triggering Impact. This time the Discharge AoEs light up after he's triggered the trap, so stand in the AoEs until Impact goes off, then dodge Discharge quickly. After a few auto attacks, he follows this up with a Prey. Next up is a Double Charge, which will either be In &gt; Out, or Out &gt; In, then he jumps away and either does In or Blighted, at random. He finishes up the phase with a Tank Buster, then jumps to either the north or south of the arena at random. *Omitting Tank Busters and Raid AoEs, shortened ability rotation is as follows:* ***Single Charge*** *(Spread/Stack)* ***&gt; Trap*** *(Spikes)* ***&gt; Single Charge*** *(Stack/Spread)* ***&gt; Prey on MT &gt; Discharge &gt; Trap*** *(Frostbite)* ***&gt; Blighted &gt; Single Charge*** *(In)* ***+ Add &gt; Trap*** *(Impact)* ***&gt; Discharge &gt; Prey on MT &gt; Double Charge*** *(Out&gt;In / In&gt;Out)* ***&gt; Blighted/Single Charge*** *(In)* **Phase 2 new abilities:** Illuminati Hand Cannon: Line AoE targeting a random person. Unsure how hard it hits. Henceforth referred to as Cannon. Brighteyes: Both healers get marked for Prey while everyone else gets Slippery Prey. When Prey goes off, it hits for about 12k and leaves a fire void zone on the ground. Unsure how much it ticks for. Also leaves a massive Magic Vulnerability on you, then it hits once more about 9 seconds later. Adds: Gobpress R-VI: Does not attack. Instead, only uses the ability Steam Roller, which covers the arena behind it and moves it forward 1/5th of the arena. Steam Roller has two AoE zones: Stand right in front of it and you get hit for around 40k damage with knockback. Stand 1/5th of the arena in front of it and you just get the knockback. Stand any farther and it doesn't affect you at all. This bit is pretty straightforward. To handle Brighteyes, have your ranged stand in predesignated spots away from the melee and tanks. Healers get hit, pass the prey to the ranged and get the hell away from them. Not gonna go into huge detail because this phase pretty well plays itself out. *Ability rotation is as follows:* ***Cannon &gt; Brighteyes &gt; Brighteyes &gt; Steam Roller &gt; Cannon &gt; Raid AoE x2 &gt; Steam Roller &gt; Cannon &gt; Brighteyes &gt; Brighteyes &gt; Steam Roller &gt; Cannon &gt; Raid AoE x2 &gt; Steam Roller &gt; Raid AoE x4 &gt; Steam Roller*** *with Damage Up = phase enrage* **Phase 3 new abilities:** Gobspin Zoomdrops: Boss tethers to one random person and begins spinning toward that player, pulsing out a fire AoE like J Waves from A8s. Tether is picked up by walking through it, not by touching the player. Only way to stop this attack is to get the boss hit by Frostbite. If the boss touches anyone during this it hits them for about 30k. Gobslice Mooncrops: 16k Raidwide AoE with knockback to either side of the arena. Both sides are electrocuted, and stun you for 6 seconds if you step in it, plus a Paralysis that can't be cleansed and a DoT that ticks for 12000 while you're stepping in it. Needless to say, execute this incorrectly and it's a wipe. Lacerate: Buzzsaws appear on the outside of the arena and start slicing anyone in their path for 14k. Their locations are fixed, only hitting where the traps are on the floor, so if you just stay between the buttons, you'll be fine. Adds: Goblin of Fortune x2: Does minimal damage. Spawns with a very potent Vulnerability Down. Is affected by Impact. Massive HP. After 30 seconds, explodes for 20k Raidwide damage and a stack of Damage Down. Hedge Gobknight: Does minimal damage. Spawns with a very potent Vulnerability Down. Is affected by Impact. Not as much HP. Same self destruct mechanism. He starts this phase out with Tank Buster immediately into Triple Charge, and there are only two possibilities for this. In &gt; Out &gt; Stack, or Out &gt; Spread &gt; In. Next up is two Raidwide AoEs, followed by him jumping somewhere and doing the In mechanic and the Lameprix Strikedox add spawning. After the In mechanic, he jumps South and starts casting Gobspin Zoomdrops, so take the add North. Once the tether goes on someone, have to your MT pick it up, bring it to the side, and pop a cooldown. When he gets to the side, have someone trigger the Frostbite trap and make everyone squeeze tight while burning down the add. Following that is Raid AoE, Tank Buster, then he jumps North and starts casting Gobslice Mooncrops. At about 25% cast, have a designated person, preferably the SCH, trigger the Spikes trap. After the cast finishes, he dashes away and does either the In mechanic or Blighted, followed by two Raid AoEs, then the Buzzsaws come up and he does a mini Steam Roller rotation. First up is Brighteyes, plus a Cannon, all while Lacerate is happening, which it does three times. Once Brighteyes hits the second person, the Buzzsaws retract and he does the Out mechanic for Single Charge, followed by Prey on MT and Tank Buster afterward. Then, the dance mechanics from the first phase come back to back. Discharge in the middle while he triggers the Frostbite trap, then he triggers the Impact trap while Discharge AoEs appear on the outside, and you have to stand in the AoEs to wait for Impact to go off. For minimal movement, stand in the middle of two of the traps, then dodge to the inside to avoid Frostbite, then just stay there until Impact goes off. Now the adds spawn. They have a massive Vulnerability Down debuff on them, and they only way to get rid of it is with Impact. Lacerate will be going off as well, so either position yourself properly or just use Hallowed Ground/Living Dead. Before triggering the trap, though, you have a quick Blighted to deal with. Now these adds have too much HP to deal with just on their own, so use either Mage or Ranged LB3 here to knock them out quickly. During the Buzzsaws, he actually starts the repetition of the final phase with the Tank Buster, but the Triple Charge that follows is the one of the Triple Charge possibilities that he did not do earlier, much like the start of the fight. I don't know if there's any hard enrage or anything, I just assume enrage is the second set of adds blowing up because you won't have LB3 to deal with them. **Edit: Enrage reportedly begins casting at 11:20 and finishes casting at 11:30. Don't know what it's called.** *Omitting Tank Busters, Raid AoEs, and Lacerate, shortened ability rotation is as follows:* ***Triple Charge*** *(In&gt;Out&gt;Stack / Out&gt;Spread&gt;In)* ***&gt; Single Charge*** *(In)* ***+ Add &gt; Gobspin Zoomdrops &gt; Gobslice Mooncrops &gt; Blighted/Single Charge*** *(In)* ***&gt; Cannon &gt; Brighteyes &gt; Brighteyes &gt; Single Charge*** *(Out)* ***&gt; Prey on MT &gt; Discharge &gt; Trap*** *(Frostbite)* ***&gt; Trap*** *(Impact)* ***&gt; Discharge &gt; Multiple Adds &gt; Blighted &gt; PHASE REPEATS*** [Shitty SCH PoV](URL"

I don't normally have vulnerability stacks in this zone (I think it's the easiest of the Alex Normals this patch), but I always die to it. Sometimes I see healers trying to heal me, sometimes they're just letting Medica II and the like keep the group up, meaning I'm certainly dead. I tried to suggest that the healers in my last group save ED and Tetra for that part (after we wiped twice around that part), and I was called selfish as a DPS, and told I should leave the healing to the healers. Is there a better way to suggest these things? The community here is generally friendly, and I don't want to be ""that guy"", but I feel like offering advice or trying to (even nicely) correct somebodies mistake in PF/DF is just seen as pretentious and unwelcome."

I have one for Sophia, hopefully these can be added. For Sophia: You must be on the opposite side of the head when Gnosis is cast for every cast. At least person must get hit by every aero 3, and at least one person must get hit by every thunder 3 (not counting execution adds). During adds phase, all adds must die within 5 seconds of each other. Nobody can become a zombie. Everyone must finish the fight with 3 or more stacks of vulnerability. Nobody can die. Party must include 2 tanks, 2 healers, 2 melee, 1 caster, 1 physical ranged. No waymarks/signs allowed. Must not fail sin and punishment mechanic. When Quasar is cast and it spawns meteors on stage, a meteor must be on every corner of the map. And that's all I got."
123,vulnerability,ffxiv,A Sophia EX rant,0,58538r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/58538r/a_sophia_ex_rant/,2016-10-19 04:29:46,"This is actually be three rants neatly rolled into one, so bear with me here. I love this fight, I really do, but the closest I've gotten to a clear was 20%, and even then it's happened only twice. There's only so many times one can do this fight (in my case, it's way over 30 times now) without a clear, and not feel a bit peeved. Apologies beforehand for the wall of text. Rant number one: **Am I the only one who thinks the tank swap strategy is flirting with disaster when done with a PUG?** First things first: I main WAR. Second things second: I don't have a static. Between my FC and friendlist, I don't have enough friends or acquanitances that want to clear savage content--at most, I have two or three friends who want their Sophic weapon and that's about that. It means I've been using Party Finder (which has actually been halfway decent and put me in contact with a lot of cool players in my server) or Raid Finder (which has not--see rant no. 3). It took me quite a few runs to get the proper timing on the tank swap, but I think I can safely say by this point that I've got the timing down pat. I also created readily accessible cooldown macros to better weather the green aura and survive in case the other tank doesn't swap in time. In spite of which, if the other tank is undergeared, didn't use food, or forgot his cooldowns, or had three freaking stacks of vuln cause they liked eating Thunder II, it's a certainty that they'll go down. It hits for 30k for pete's sake: with vulnerability, one's pretty much unlikely to survive it. I'm sick of getting the blame for the other tank dying when I'm doing my part of the swap correctly. Here's where the ""flirting with disaster"" part comes in. Mechanics in Sophia happen in close succession, and each time someone is rezzed, they come back without MP/TP. In the case of tanks, this can be disastrous, because you also come back at the very bottom of the hate list and have very little time to fight your way through ilvl freaking 235 DPS and healers to get yourself back to the tank position. I only realized this when I was raised on the brink of a green aura that killed the other tank and realized that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get Sophia to pay attention to me instead of the healers (a quick glance to the hate list told me I was fourth in the hate list, after the healers and a DPS). In the worst runs, I've realized that when I'm at the true bottom of the hate list, using Provoke only makes Sophia go ""What? Oh, it's you"" and then go back to whomever she was mauling because I cannot do my hate combo quickly enough to climb back to tanking position in time. Each time I've been through Sophia as a RF or PUG tank, hate has been splotchy at best, all over the place at worst. Sometimes it's been my fault for dying. Sometimes it's been the other tank's. My problem here is that the tank swap requires close to perfect timing, perfect positioning, perfect use of cooldowns... and people aren't perfect. Much less when they're complete strangers with absolutely different play styles. Which brings me to rant number two: **Why are people scared half to death at the prospect of trying different strategies?** After realizing the tank swap can be very ineffective if it's not airtight, I decided to get my AST up to ilvl and do an experiment purely for the hell of it: I put up a party finder for a 3-healer run of SophEX. (I'd heard it could be healed solo, which was partially what made me curious about different strategies.) My thoughts at this point were ""if 3 healers can't keep a practice party up, then nobody can"". I didn't even mean to clear it, just wanted to try something different out. I got lots of questions from curious onlookers, about how we intended to resolve this mech and that mech, which was helpful and helped us prepare, and also a few uninvolved wellwishers, which was just nice (thank you, guys!). It took **80 freaking minutes** and two PF to get the party on its feet, but we got one going. We consistently made it through the add phase so our DPS check was definitely okay, and once made it past the second Gnosis (which we always seem to forget about because at that point there's too much to keep in mind). People only died to either the second Gnosis or the tilts, and if they did, they were back on their feet in seconds because someone always had Raise available. Our tank seemed to thrive, as he had three healers mitigating the damage (Virus and Disable helped a lot, as well as Noct Aspected Helios and Stoneskin on top of his own cooldowns); he could stance dance, knowing he didn't have to brace for a tank swap. On our best run we made it beneath 40%, which honestly was much better than I thought our end results would be. We didn't clear it before having to disband because of the hour, but we got some really good feedback on the fight, and actually made new friends out of the experience. On top of it all, *it was the most fun I've had doing Sophia EX since I started banging my head against her very particular wall*. With that said, just yesterday I tried tanking for a PF clear party where, once again, hate was splotchy. The other tank was new to the fight (*...I repeat, this was a clear party. I'll withhold my comment, but it's not hard to read my thoughts*). After the fifth wipe, I offered to either MT without swaps (because by now I know very well when and where to CD to live through the first hit after the buster), OR stay in Deliverance to try and push some more DPS without interruption (which didn't make me very comfortable because the other tank was having a hard time getting his CDs off in time for the buster), OR even switch to AST and try out a 3 healer configuration. I was outright ignored, and I think people thought I was knocking on the other tank's skill level. No reason, just ""don't want to try it"". Why are people so fixated with doing things ""the one good way""? It's as though it's sacrilegious to suggest doing things in a way not yet tried by Mr Happy or Mizzteq (not that I'm criticizing either). Rant number three: **Why don't people know how to use Raid Finder properly?** This'll be a short one. If it's your first go at Sophia, for the love of all that is holy, don't input ""Duty Completion"" on the purpose. Be sensible and respectful of other people's time: use ""Practice"" as much as necessary to memorize the mechanics before changing to DC. If I'm done using RF, it's because people are abusing the ""Purpose"" feature and expecting a carry. **Afterthought**: I'm not done trying to get my clear, nor am I anywhere close to rage quitting. These are just a few thoughts about this fight I wanted to put down somewhere. Off I go now! "

125,vulnerability,ffxiv,"So I was bored in between classes and I'm a nerd, designed a raid fight against a machinist",12,51tvvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/51tvvk/so_i_was_bored_in_between_classes_and_im_a_nerd/,2016-09-09 07:58:04,"If we fight Mide's partner in The Creator... HP: 5,182,900 HP Enrage: 11:40 Throughout the fight, boss does very unpredictable auto attack damage, since he is a machinist and procs randomly. You can however, tell if his next auto attack will deal more damage by looking to see if he has a proc. If the player with aggro move away, he adds a sniper attachment and the damage doubles. Pulling the boss around thus required patience and timing. The beginning of the fight starts against him wielding his gun, in a square shaped arena much like Brute Justice's but the four corners have ramps leading to higher floors. On the NE corner there is a tower like in CT Behemoth. In NW and SW corner there are towers activated by stepping on them like in T8. In SE corner there is a healable robot performing a certain function. In SW corner there is a crate with buffs that must be killed to receive the buff like in Feast. All these will come into play throughout the fight. All damage maxes out at given amounts, and will be lower with rng/defense/magic defense. Split Shot: Basic auto attack. Deals about 4000 damage unmitigated. Happens every 3 seconds or so. Randomly procs Slug Shot. Slug Shot: Deals about 25% more damage than split shot. Randomly procs Clean Shot. Indicated by buff on boss. Clean Shot: deals about 50% more damage than split shot. Indicated by buff on boss. Randomly procs lucky shot. Lucky Shot: deals about 100% more damage than split shot. Indicated by buff on boss. Randomly uses quick reload to use another Lucky Shot right after. Those four abilities exist in place of auto attacks, the following are mechanic abilities. Phase 1: Phases at 82%. Reload: when boss reloads, treat this as a tank buster. It will proc all shots on tank, and combine reload with Rapid Fire and the last hit will be a Reassembled Lucky Shot. The auto attacks will happen every second, 5 in a row starting with split, slug, clean, lucky, and reassembled lucky, because he doesn't follow the machinist rules. Hot Shot/Lead Shot: Will use a prey marker on a target, and randomly uses hot shot or lead shot. If the hot shot cast bar is shown, there is about 4 seconds to shield the target. If damage goes through, boss gets a permanent 5% damage buff. If lead shot cast bar is shown, be ready to regen and heal the target through the dot, treat it like A1S prey. Essentially hot shot is t10 prey, lead shot is a1s prey. Heart Attack: if an party member gets below 20% HP, they will be damaged by their remaining HP -1, leaving them with 1 HP (this is to give healers heart attacks), this happens immediately, at any time during first phase. Leg Graze/Foot Graze: these are like earth shakers, and should be treated as such, with both targets moving away from the party. One player will be bound, the other might get heavied if they don't dodge. Those in between will take massive damage as well as receive the status effects (which side is affected by which status effect is random). The leg graze player leaves a puddle like t13. The bound player must be cleansed, and the player with puddles must not remain in puddles long to avoid heavy. The puddles leave a dot and heavy, dot ticks about 7k, and otherwise the initial damage for both targets is about 3k. Blank: resets aggro and does knockback and bind on target with aggro, as well as about 25k damage. Spread Shot: a cleave. Deals about 120k damage. Must be split by party, large AoE come. Also does splash damage, so party must be in the cone of the attack while staying fairly spread out to not by hit by another person's damage. Head Graze: deals a 21 second silence to a healer, and about 20k damage. There are 6 seconds to deal damage during the cast. Depending on damage dealt during the cast, the damage and length of the silence is lowered. Wildfire: works like allagan field. The damage a person takes from while under the effects of wildfire are doubled and dealt in a large blast radius around that player, covering almost the entire arena. The person marked with wildfire gets a vulnerability up buff as well, taking 20% more damage. Grenado Shot: dragon's rage stack mechanic. Deals about 140k. Fury Shot: this is like Sastasha HM mechanic, a person is tethered and dealt damage to. This targets the wildfire target, but can be intercepted. Damage stops after boss takes enough damage. Suppresive Fire: stuns and slightly damaged targeted player. Bullet Beam: aims a beam at the stunned player, and deals 100k damage. Damage must be intercepted by the Off tank and party to split damage like wild charge or in Thordan. Rotation: Reload, either hot shot or lead shot, foot graze and leg graze and the other hot shot or lead shot, blank, reload, head graze, wildfire, spread shot, Grenado shot, fury shot, either hot shot or lead shot, suppressive fire, bullet beam, wildfire explodes, hot shot or lead shot, reload, foot graze and leg graze and other hot shot or lead shot, repeat, should phase here. Phase 2: Phases at 54% Retains abilities from last phase. Phases can be controlled depending on when turret is killed. If a turret is dead before hyper charge, hyper charge instead becomes a free damage phase where boss summons turret instead and skips hyper charge. Rook Auto Turret: Summons Rook auto turret, which deals heavy single target damage through auto attacks. Must be tanked, and preferably debuffed to deal less damage. If killed, he will resummon it, and place it elsewhere on the field. It has 100,000k HP. If killed he will take 6 seconds to summon it. Must be damaged mainly by magic, as it takes 50% physical damage. Turret Retrieval: resets aggro on turret and places it on a dps. Promotion: halves TP regain until killed. Dismantle: Lowers damage dealt by main tank to 10%, requiring a tank swap or the tank loses aggro. Lasts 12 seconds. Rend Mind: Lowers healing potency of a random healer by 90%. Lasts 12 seconds. Armor Break: raises vulnerability of a random dps, and most damage they take will one shot them. Lasts 12 second Brawler attachment: does a random brawler attachment attack. Gauss round: does splash damage on a random player, about 18k. Hyper charge: increases damage taken by everyone by 10%. If turret is killed, effect disappears. Ricochet: hits all players, closet player takes the most damage, with farthest player taking the least. Rotation: Summon Rook, dismantle/rend mind/armor break simultaneously, either hot shot or lead shot, foot graze and leg graze and the other hot shot or lead shot, blank, reload, gauss round, hyper charge, head graze, wildfire and armor break on different targets, blaster attachment, spread shot, ricochet, Grenado shot, fury shot, either hot shot or lead shot, suppressive fire, bullet beam, wildfire explodes, gauss round, turret retrieval, promotion, hot shot or lead shot, hyper charge, reload, foot graze and leg graze and other hot shot or lead shot, repeat, should phase here. Phase 3: phases at 31% Retains abilities from phase 2, no more hot shot, lead shot, heart break, leg graze, foot graze, head graze, suppressive fire, or bullet beam. Both turrets are available here, and if either dies, the other will self destruct in 8 seconds. Phase can be controlled depending on when turrets are killed. If turrets are both dead before a hypercharge, boss will summon the turrets instead of using hypercharge. Summon Bishop Autoturret: summons a turret that deals Raidwide damage constantly. Must be killed before wildfire/armor break are used. Takes 50% of magical damage. Has 325k hp. Promotion effect lowers MP regeneration by half. Hyper charge effect reflects 20% of damage back at attackers. Table Turner: deals damage on tank equal to missing hp. Cheap Shot: reduces max HP of a random party member by 1k until certain conditions are met. Mega rook Turret: starts charging NW tower, once activated it does massive damage on a single random target, about 22k. Mega bishop turret: starts charging SW tower, once activated it does high Raidwide damage for about 18k. Knight Turret: spawns in NW corner, and heads to SE, and begins to hurt a robot in the SE corner. Knight Turret takes 1% of damage and has 10 million HP. It must be heavied, and stunned so that the robot in the southeast can have time to perform a specific function. Once the Knight reaches the robot, the robot should be healed and shielded so that the knight does not kill it. The robot spawns when the Knight Turret does. Rotation: Summon both bishop and Rook turret, dismantle/rend mind/armor break simultaneously, both mega turrets start charging, blank, reload, table Turner, gauss round, hyper charge, wildfire and armor break on different targets, promotion, blaster attachment, spread shot, knight turret spawns with no cast time, ricochet, Grenado shot, fury shot, wildfire explodes, gauss round, cheap shot, turret retrieval, promotion, hyper charge, reload, table Turner, should phase here. Last Phase: Retains a few abilities. Boss is untargetable for beginning. If robot in SE corner survived, it creates a shield to survive boss's ultimate. Destrudogeddon: deals approximately 24k Raidwide if SE robot is alive. Deals 9.5 million damage to knight turret. Queen Turret: begins pulsing damage throughout fight in NE tower, when lit up after 25 seconds it must be activated. Boss will use heartbreak on target attempting to interact with Queen Turret Tower (only when boss is on field). Boss must be summoning turrets to turn this off. Damage is about 1.5k per tick, when lit up it gains 500 per tick until shut off. King Turret: spawns in middle, and rotates slowly (positionals with it). Will stop randomly and pull in a pawn turret in the direction it faces approximately every 10 seconds. It will do a mechanic based on each pawn that is swallowed. Has 760,256 hp. Pawn Turrets: summons 8 turrets spawning from all directions that attempt to reach King Turret. They are color coded, and static positions so that color blind players know which one does which mechanic. The King turret is guaranteed to devour at least a few, so players must choose which mechanics not to deal with. They have 90k HP each, and are naturally slow but can be heavied further. If they reach the King turret, they will do their mechanic with 50% more damage as opposed to being devoured by the king turret. NE black pawn will explode when pulled in and deal massive damage, and should ideally be killed first. N red pawn will cause fire puddles to target everyone, and will stay on arena for 45 seconds. NW green pawn will turn heals into party damage for 8 seconds. W yellow pawn will give four players thunderstruck, and they must stay away from others, they also take about 10k damage. SW purple pawn will summon chakrams, 1 per wall to do a8s chakram divebombs, about 20k damage. S blue pawn will cause heights and an enumeration on a random target, but since there are no heights they must use ramp, deals massive damage if failed but not one shot. SE Orange pawn places 3 hidden mines on the field. E white pawn will do damaging super cyclone, about 15k. Cipher: zip lines from one end of arena to the other, causes AoEs like Garuda feather AoEs. Untargettable during this, lasts 6 seconds. Rotation: Boss becomes untargetable. Destrudogeddon, both mega turrets start charging and Queen starts pulsing while king and pawns spawn, after first pawn dies, boss does Cipher and becomes targetable, summons bishop and rook turrets, reload, table Turner, gauss round, hyper charge, wildfire and armor break on different targets, promotion, blaster attachment, ricochet, Grenado shot, fury shot, wildfire explodes, gauss round, cheap shot, turret retrieval, promotion, hyper charge, reload, table Turner, repeat until enrage, no Destrugodden, and no king and pawn spawn this time. Enrage is a Destrugodden without the robot. "
126,vulnerability,ffxiv,"I was bored at work, wrote up an idea for what kind of mid-core content they could introduce.",0,525ltd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/525ltd/i_was_bored_at_work_wrote_up_an_idea_for_what/,2016-09-11 08:44:39,"So a new approach to the current dungeon trend, this is an exemption from Roulette dungeons and would have to be selected on a per instance basis. Roulette will only place you into the Normal instance, which is what it currently is anyways. Easy Mode - Rewards are 20 Lore, 5 Scripture tomes: Dungeon overall difficulty has been reduced tremendously from Normal level combat. While no mechanics have been altered, all monster's are automatically impaired with a Defense Down and Vulnerability Up debuff. This is designed for a player to get in and out quickly, which can be mostly used for farming items that spawn from chests. No gil is awarded from monsters. Item level requirement is still the same for Normal mode dungeon. No gear drops from chests, but crafting items will. Normal mode - Rewards are 80 Lore, 40 Scripture tomes: Dungeon overall difficulty is unchanged from what it typically would be on release. No automatic debuffs are applied to any monsters. This is designed for players to spend the normal amount of time as determined through development in the instance, so roughly 20-25 minutes to completion at appropriate item level. Gil is awarded from monsters slain. Item level requirement is based on when this content is released alongside current item level trend. Current dungeon gear will drop from chests, but not crafting items. Hard/Savage mode - Rewards are 200 Lore, 120 Scripture tomes: Dungeon overall difficulty has been enhanced tremendously. All monsters are buffed with permanent Defense Up, Vulnerability Down, Sprint and Haste. This level of content is designed to give players a challenging encounter that will take time to complete, but with a greater overall reward than completing Easy or Normal mode content. Estimate completion time 50-60 minutes. Significantly more gil is awarded from slain monsters than Normal mode. Item level requirement is set 10 points higher than current baseline item level available (so it can't be accessed right out of the gate, something to work towards and once available, still providing a challenge up into maximum item level. So for instance, for 3.4 if they ran with a system like this and the item level is going from i250 to i285, you'd need to be at i260 to even unlock the mode. At 3.5 when the next 24 man tier raid is released and tome gear can be upgraded, the next set of dungeons would be locked behind a i270 wall requiring players to upgrade their current gear, while still working to achieve i279/280. Players will also be awarded a unique Title, automatic Minion drop every run, alongside rarer crafting items. Dungeon gear is after all more about the glamour than the actual usefulness, especially since they're making crafting gear more viable for raiding now. Reason for the idea and it could still be tweaked some, is people's desire for Mid-core content. The highest level dungeon would I think fall in the Mid-core range. Much more difficult than running the dungeon normally, requiring more focus and pushed DPS as you're actually racing the clock towards the end due to the sheer difficulty of the things you're fighting. While also awarding victorious players with something unique to that content for them. This way they could have a design philosophy that goes along the lines of 'casual play involves less commitment types of content, such as Leves, FATEs and Hunts that can be joined at any time, but also leave as needed. Mid-core content falls in at the top of the dungeon chain for increased difficulty, significantly better rewards for doing and completing the content and giving players a sense of achievement due to both working towards unlocking it and clearing it. While hard core raiders can focus on Savage mode 8 man tier content.' And of course for semi-casual players like myself this doesn't effect Roulette at all as it would continue to be listed in the 'Normal' range of difficulty and rewards as it presently is. And yes the tome difference is big for a reason, those who tackle and complete more challenging content -should- be given a better incentive for doing so. I don't believe in participation trophies. Thoughts?"
127,vulnerability,ffxiv,A Possible fix for 'riposte' mechanics.,0,5283xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/5283xr/a_possible_fix_for_riposte_mechanics/,2016-09-11 21:27:35,"It's a tried and tested argument concerning Paladins and Dark Knights OTing: Even if you were willing to give up the utility of a Warrior, you'd still be losing out on 'riposte' style DPS gains for both. Shield Swipe for the Pally, Price, Reprisal, and Low Blow for the Dark Knight. For Dark Knight in particular it is a detriment to their DPSing abilities if they're forced to OT without the benefit of these procs. In order to make sure these procs can still happen, why not have a 'malignant aura' which does small (I'm talking 1% of HP values if that) amount of damage to all characters in melee range of bosses as physical damage. That way, so long as a tank (or a Monk I guess for Haymaker?) is in range, they can still get use out of attacks like blood price and reprisal. I think valid reasons for why this might not be implemented exist. One is the 'debuff', like how Sephirot Hops give you physical vulnerability up. If the aura tick scaled at all with your resistances (as opposed to being strictly an HP%) then you would possibly die thanks to the debuff. Another such example might be Shadow Dragon in NidEX, nobody would have fun being gibbed by a tiny bit of damage. To fix that, just make the tick a fixed % of HP. 1% or something like that. Small enough that it's not really much of a concern to healers. Or even just a fixed 1-10 damage. Another concern might be that DRK's abilities have a sort of flavour which relies on getting hit, the blood price and whatnot. It might not jive well with the 'spirit' of the abilities, but I think you could make an exception if it meant that abilities like Reprisal and Blood Price still got some use while not being the main face-punch-taker. **TL;DR, physical 'aura' around a boss would have the chance to proc 'on block' or 'on parry' mechanics like any auto-attack, while also letting an ability like blood price generate some MP for a DRK** Any opinions on this, or other ideas? Also, apologies in advance if I mess up formatting, I don't submit new threads very often. "
128,vulnerability,ffxiv,Necromancer/NCR Class Concept,0,535kwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/535kwe/necromancerncr_class_concept/,2016-09-17 13:11:19,"Personally, I've been wondering for a while how Necromancer would function in FFXIV as a Job Class, since I loved it's theme/aesthetic in V and Dark Magic has always a REALLY big thing of mine. So I kind of took the liberty of concepting the class as a sort of stack-based ""support caster"" of sorts that uses different abilities on mid-to-long cooldowns to take advantage of a stack system I wanted to call ""Maleficium."" Basically how it would work would be using it's basic ""Dark"" spells to gain stacks of Maleficium. Each casting of a Dark line spell from I-III would grant 1 stack of Maleficium, and once you reach 6 (three guesses as to why I picked THAT number), and you can spend them all on a burst CD that each have varying ""Curses"" as a bit of bonus utility to help raid DPS or deal with varying situtations. Each of the ""Curse"" CDs except for Dark III and Doomsday share the same CD timer so you can pick which one you want to use to fit the situation. Dark: Deals unaspected damage to a single target and grants a stack of Maleficium Potency: 150 Dark II: Deals unaspected magic damage to all targets within 5y of the primary target and grants a stack of Maleficium Potency: 100 Dark III: Can only be used when at 6 stacks of Maleficium. Deals unaspected magic damage to all targets within 5y of primary target, and consumes all stacks of Maleficium.

129,vulnerability,ffxiv,Am I the only one that feels summoner shouldn't be as it was designed in this game?,0,53lhob,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/53lhob/am_i_the_only_one_that_feels_summoner_shouldnt_be/,2016-09-20 13:24:30,"What I mean is: summoner is just a poisoner that happens to summon some primal spirits. In the whole final fantasy series the summoner had the role of blasting the battlefield with powerful spells. Summoner in FFXIV has a tiny cute pet that shots wind magic (because the other two are extremely situational and more suited for solo play) and uses Bio, miasma, ruin... I don't know, but it doesn't feel right. I feel that would have been fit for a Geomancer or a Beastmaster (trap/poison expert with a pet that helps with the damage). When I started the game I chose arcanist because of him becoming a summoner and I imagined me destroying the battlefield with powerful summons. At lvl 30 the disappointment was so big I quit the game for 3 months, completely losing interest in it. Then I picked it up again (maybe at 50 things will be better) but no, nothing different, only more DoTs. I wanted summoner to be cool and mighty. Would some of you have liked SMN to be something else like me? I don't know, maybe a mage that lets the primal power take over his body in order to unleash powerful attacks for a short amount of time, or something like that... EDIT: I guess this will be my first and last post in this subreddit. Most of the comments are like Thymsent's first 3 sentences. I'm sorry if I just found this subreddit and I didn't thoroughly search all the previous topics in order to see if anyone had asked a similar question. Some guy even answered that ""it would be too OP"". What? We're talking about design here not balance. Let me elaborate what I had in mind. Of course you can't just summon bahamut and gg. What I had in mind was a class that used summons to increase their battle power or utility for a short duration (something around 20s) and then that specific summon goes on a long cooldown and you can only use some other primal power that isn't already on cooldown. Something like: Ifrit's power--- your skillset changes to a melee one that deals aoe damage in front of you (a cleave) and some other fiery skills that deal high melee damage. Ifrit's power goes on cooldown for a long duration; after 30 seconds you become exhausted for 20 seconds and can't summon again, so you have to use summoner's filler spells like ruin or other spells until you're able to summon another primal power, and every primal you summon has some special perks you may find useful (maybe inflict elemental vulnerability so that your party deals a bit more with elements, adding that mechanic to the game?). In this way summoner could benefit from a wider set of primals like ramuh and shiva, and give a more solid summoner feeling. My bad for not knowing the lvl 60 spell (which is a cool step in a good direction imho). Sorry for the post then, I'll make sure to only post glamours in the future!"
130,vulnerability,ffxiv,The Basics of the Feast: a Guide,47,4vpiyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4vpiyu/the_basics_of_the_feast_a_guide/,2016-08-02 09:42:34,"I have played feast quite a bit. Im not #1 on the ladder but Im also not terrible. Proof: URL With Season Two starting up more people seem to be interested in queuing again which is great. However, it is very clear that most people have little to no idea what they are doing or how the Feast actually works. I thought making a brief guide on some basics might help newcomers out a bit. So here are the fundamentals that people hopefully understand before queuing up: **Heavy Medal** When you kill someone they drop half of their total medals. The more medals you have the more damage you take. As a general rule of thumb a dps should try to never go higher than 1 stack, and a tank should not go higher than 4 stacks. Any higher and it is extremely difficult for a healer to keep you alive. You can see how many medals everyone has by looking at the scoreboard. If you accidentally close it, you can click on the duty status and it will come back up. Heres the chart with all of the values. Medals Possessed | # of stacks | Vulnerability Up --------------------|-------------|----------------- 100 or less | 0 | - 150 | 1 | 12% 170 | 2 | 24% 190 | 3 | 36% 200 | 4 | 48% 210 | 5 | 60% 220 | 6 | 72% 225 | 7 | 84% 230 | 8 | 96% 240 | 9 | 108% 250 | 10 | 120% **Burst Damage** Kills in feast come from coordinated burst with your teammates. Think about how you can do the most damage in a short amount of time, unlike in PvE. If you dont work as a team, you are going to bad a bad time. Try to come up with a plan at the start on who you will try to kill first and having one person mark the kill target can be helpful. **Pvp abilities** The job/class specific pvp only abilities are crucial to success in feast. Please learn/bind/use them. Tip: Purify, the ability that removes all status effects can be used on party members. Make sure to untarget them if you are healing and want to purify yourself. **Run back if your healer dies** The number of times I have died as a healer while my team stays across the map fighting and all wind up dying is infuriating. Your healer is going to die. Its going to happen. Please play smart and prevent any further medal losses by running back to your spawn. **Supply Crates** There are three types of crates. The defensive crate give the defense buff, put it on one of your dps. It only spawns at the beginning. Offensive crates give an attack bonus. One will spawn at the start of the match alongside the defensive crate. At 4:00 left two offensive crates will spawn on the side of the area. The last kind of crate is the Adrenaline (Pvp Limit Break) crate. This one spawns in the center and will spawn three times during the match. The first time is at 7:00, second is around 5:30, third is around 2:00. There is some fudge on those numbers but that should give you a general idea. The adrenaline crates can greatly affect the outcome of a match. Melee LB is generally considered the strongest and most useful. If properly executed with some kind of CC before and at about 60-70% left on the target, a melee LB should kill him. If you LB a target at full hp, he wont die. If you don't stun/sleep/bind the target he will probably get away from you and it will cancel the cast. **Crowd Control** CC is very strong in this game. Coordinating CC with teammates wins games. After three of a single kind of effect, they will no longer effect the target for 1min (from the first cast I believe.) Stun/Sleep/Heavy/Bind are all on their own DR. Mix them up to really really really piss off people. **Try not to rage** You are probably only going to win half of the time. Sometimes there is only so much you can do to support your teammates. Sometimes people just dont work together. I do believe it is possible to carry in some roles better than others. I genuinely dont believe that anyone out there is trying to be bad and fuck your rating up. Losing is part of the game. Being an asshole to your teammates doesnt help. This can be pretty hard not to do and I have certainly been guilty of this myself. **Undesirable classes** A few classes are much harder to play / dont bring enough to the table in feast. BLM has the potential to be very useful, but most are quite awful. You will be focused and have to kite most of the match. If that is not your playstyle, you might wanna reconsider playing BLM. The other three jobs I would also list here are SCH, NIN and DRK. They arent necessarily bad, just they dont bring as much to the table as the other jobs in those roles. Not everyone will agree with me on this and that is ok. Thats like, your opinion, man. "

Whilst A4S didn't really get any mechanical nerfs, I can see them making some heavy mechanical nerfs to A8S given how heavy on mechanics it actually is so how do you think they will actually nerf this encounter and do you want them to nerf it? I'm thinking punishment stacks not being removed won't outright kill you but will put a vulnerability debuff on players if failed as well as them removing the instadeath from height error/enumeration as well as the instadeath from getting hit by a steam chakram which would give the boss a stack of damage up."

I've read like nearly everything they wrote. But I think this Post helps the Newcommers out. It's a updated explain of the Jobs. **The post was made from Preator21, but got edited duo User responds** **Tanks:** **Paladin**: PLD has tons of defensive cool downs and some pretty strong support abilities but lacks AOE dmg Game play: Very straightforward tank which is easier for newcommer. Take minimal dmg and support your allies while leading the way through content *Pros*: -Tons of cool downs to mitigate dmg (phys primarily) -More newcommer friendly duo to simple combos early on but more difficult later. -Good utility with cover and healing to support people having trouble *Cons*: -Poor AOE dmg (flash blinds but does not hurt foes) -Late tank stance (lvl 30-40 can be rough with leveling gear) **Warrior**: The de facto off tank warrior has fewer cool downs but more health and good dmg. Warrior uses a large pool of health and vampiric attacks to stay alive and generate threat Game play: WAR has a few buffs and abilities tied to their combos which need to be kept up as well as stacks to manage from each combo hit. Once the stacks hit 5 you can use them for a few different defensive and offensive abilities *Pros*: -Highest dps as a tank -Good aggro building abilities and aoe dmg (overpower is really good and you get it early) -Cool downs work out that you can do a fair amount alone if need be *Cons*: -They need targets to function with -Holmgang is probably the weakest of the tank invincibility cool downs, but duo lower cool down it can be cast more often then the others. (compared with hollowed ground and living dead) **Dark Knight**: The heavensward tank which focuses on magic defense and MP management Game play: DRK primarily focuses on MP management for its damage and powering up its abilities. Dark arts gives you some good control over the situation and can be fun but early on learning to manage your MP is necessary as you might run out at the wrong time *Pros*: -Good aoe dmg and threat building tools -The only tank that has a magic resistance Cooldown -Dark arts makes the class more engaging then other tanks *Cons*: -MP management can take some getting used to and makes mistakes a bit more punishing -Dealing high damage can take significantly more work for similar results to a Paladin on single target -Without proper cool down usage DRK can be fragile compared to the other tanks **Healers**: **White mage**: The default healer and most straightforward of the three Game play: High potency heals and regen effects to keep you party up so you can stance dance to do dmg via a few dots *Pro*: -Very high potency healing spells that have long range -Regen effects decrease the need for micro management on healing -Great DPS if you have the MP and time to spare *Cons*: -Lack of shielding forces to predict incomming DMG and pre cast heals.. -MP restoration is harder due to weaker tools for it compared with scholar (Aetherflow) **Scholar**: The de facto off healer SCH is known for providing good DPS while healing Game play: SCH has some very strong shields and a built in off healer via their fairy with high AOE dmg due to their dots *Pro*: -Very strong DPS from dots and bane with a fairy to cover minor healing while you lay into the enemy -Strong shields cast at the right time mitigate huge amounts of dmg before it happens -Not as much mana problems as the other healers, duo Aetherflow and Energy drain. *Cons*: -Fairy commands are not instant and micromanagement can be a pain -Fewer big heals to recover after things have taken a turn for the worse -Low AoE heal if no Aetherflow **Astrologian**: Heavensward healer which brings extra party utility via cards Game play: AST chooses a stance to act as a weaker WHM or SCH while giving the party buffs based off of cards drawn at random *Pros*: -Card buffs can be very powerful and later abilities give some control to mitigate RNG when using them -Strong MP regen abilities make management easier with the added benefit of reducing aggro -Primary DPS has no accuracy caps (dots) which makes end game content easier to DPS through *Cons*: -Cards drawn are still RNG and sometimes you only get spire and ewer (TP/MP restore) -Regen effects and shields are weaker than the other classes with them -Cards are still luck based (especially early on) ***DPS***: **Monk**: Positional focused melee DPS. Super high damage low utility Game play: monk focuses on maintaining a fair number of effects on target by correctly hitting positional and building stacks of greased lightning(more speed/dmg) *Pros*: -Highest raw DPS of any class -Strong AOE and single target when done correctly -Building momentum in fights feels great and engaging *Cons*: -Low utility -Can feel like tons of work to maintain normal DPS amount of damage -Gear is not shared with any other classes on the left side **Black mage**: Caster with great single target DPS, decent AOE and unlimited resources Game play: Black mage works off jumping between 2 phases fire and ice with fire being damage and ice MP recovery. To maintain damage you need to minimize movement *Pros*: -Great single target dps and decent aoe dmg -Unlimited resources mean you can go forever without worrying about management much -Long range and some defensive cool downs mean you can ignore some mechanics at times *Cons*: -Turret DPS, you lose huge amounts of damage by moving or stopping casts to avoid things -Being squishy with the tendency to not move can lead to a fair amount of deaths early on -Low party utility with only a few things to help others **Summoner**: The AOE damage king summoner focuses on dots and a powerful burst stance to do massive damage to groups Game play: SMN spreads dots to multiple targets and manages a pet while using aetherflow stacks to regenerate MP or deal more damage *Pros*: -Highest AOE DPS in the game with spreading dots and powerful aoe attacks -Decent party utility with virus, eye for and eye, and revive being available -Decent mobility and MP management make it a good choice for new content *Cons*: -Burst falls of if no Aetherflow -Needs micromanaging for full potential of Pet. **Dragoon**: The slowest of the melee DPS (But faster then every not Melee DPS) DRG brings some decent utility and a set rotation along with it Game play: DRG manages a few abilities and weaves in off global cool down jumps to maximize damage. The current meta has a set rotation for the class rather than a priority system with the only unknown factor being a random positional at the end of a combo (flank or side) *Pros*: -Good consistent damage from a set rotation -Decent party utility with battle litany and disembowel -High HP and a set rotation can improve survivability *Cons*: -More abilities with animation lock can get you killed if you mistime things (they are shorter then the usuall animation locks) -Leveling can be extremely boring until 26 (impulse drive is better than anything else until then) -Gear is not shared with any other classes on the left side -Kinda punishing if you mess up something (Need some practice) **Ninja**: A support melee dps focused on multiple dots and ninjitsu actions Game play: Maintain multiple dots and effects on the target with periodically lower its defense and maintaining a speed buff on yourself. Extra utility to help others *Pros*: -Strong utility with aggro manipulation tools, slashing debuff, vulnerability, and TP restoration -Decent single target damage from a fairly simple rotation -Supportive skills to help the team out Cons: -Difficult for newcommer duo to learning the different combos -High ping can make mudras difficult to use and cause problems -Lack of AoE dmg **Bard**: A support DPS that works best with casters and focuses on dots and ogcd abilities Game play: Bard focuses on maintaining dots on multiple targets, spamming ogcd abilites reset by them and using songs to support the rest of the party *Pros*: -Strong utility with a particular help for caster heavy compositions -Decent sustained damage when done correctly that increases with additional targets -High mobility when needed although at a cost at lv 60 *Cons*: -lower single target DPS than other jobs -Maintaining dots manually on multiple targets can be difficult -lower mobility at 60 due to wanderers minuet **Machinist**: Heavensward support DPS that focuses on big burst of damage and party utility Game play: Machinist works best with huge bursts(wildfire) followed by sustained downtime until the cool downs come back up. They work best with melee heavy compositions *Pros*: -Incredible burst damage with wildfire -Strong party utility with phys vuln, mp and tp restore, stun, silence, and phys damage down -decent mobility when working with ammo *Cons*: -pitiful damage between the bursts -RNG based damage when ammo is not available -More difficult to do good AoE dmg then other Classes."

It's also very challenging due to the long, crippling status effects and numerous instakill threats - but knowledge of the mechanics can truly make any class viable here, **even solo**. I will continue adding more details and corrections as they are discovered. This list is not exhaustive, as some things are self-explanatory. The goal of this post is to share mechanics which are not immediately obvious or can be used to advantage. **Thanks to all of the comment contributors! This was my first reddit post, and I'm really humbled by all of the helpful comments and friendly messages in game!** **Aetherpool upgrading** * **Aetherpool rating can be considered a stat. As long as you complete your floor set, any gains made are permanent**. This rating is the only attribute which affects your character in the PotD - aside from level. Saved aetherpool progress is separate from your class, weapon, or save file; and stays with you even if you reset to level 1 or change classes. * **You do not have to complete the PotD as the class that obtains the i235 weapon, but your ratings do revert to zero when you obtain the weapon.** It can be obtained once you've completed floor 50 with both ratings rating at 30. * You will need to repeat floors to fully upgrade your aetherpool gear. Your rating is unlikely to increase if the floor level is lower than your current aetherpool rating. * **Aetherpool rating upgrades occur individually for every person in the group when a silver chest is opened.** Whether this affects the weapon or armor is also rolled individually. Upgrades are never guaranteed to succeed, but you have a higher chance when the floor level is higher than your aetherpool rating. This also raises the chance that your rating will increase by 3 or 4. *(Your aetherpool arm/armor flares/brightens, instead of flickers).* * **General Strategy** - Repeat lower floor sets if your aetherpool rating is low. The early floors can be cleared very quickly with a high rating (15 minutes or better, solo), so increasing your rating will be faster than trudging through the deeper floors with a bad rating. Think Lufia 2 Ancient Cave here - the more times you run it, the easier it gets to go deeper. * ***To maximize your chances of successful upgrades, consider progressing both save slots together*** - run floors 1-10 twice, then 11-20 twice, and so on. This is more efficient than backtracking through floors that have nearly no chance of upgrading your aetherpool rating. [The same class or party can be used for both slots](URL since saved aetherpool progress is not tied to any particular save slot. * ***You don't have to lose your progress to farm lower tiers.*** You can use your second save slot as a a throw-away farm slot, while maintaining your first slot for progression. * **Understanding Aetherpool rating** - Your aetherpool rating x 2 is the approximate level of your equipment. For example, if you have aetherpool arm rating of 10, you are effectively wielding a level 20 weapon. This should guide your decisions whether to move forward. If you enter floors 21-30 with a rating of 10, you will be fighting level 35-45 enemies with a level 20 weapon, and you will have trouble with dps checks. Your aetherpool rating will also be synced if its rating exceeds half your current level. **Saving** * **Each save may only move forward or reset.** There is no way to repeat only a specific floor set. * You must complete the entire floor set to save your progress. If everyone in the party dies, or the timer runs out, all progress is lost and you must begin again from the last save. * A fixed party may convert to a matched party, but cannot convert back. The newly formed matched party must continue from the current floor set, using the same jobs. **Experience** * Leveling in PotD does not use any of your current rested bonus, and experience gain can not enhanced by anything, including food or worn items. Enemies inside the PotD give a flat amount of experience every time that is specific to each enemy, regardless of your level difference. * Your level inside the PotD can exceed your class level, and you *temporarily* gain unearned skills that are normally locked behind a quest-wall. * You have the full 60 minutes to run around and level up, but once you move forward you can't go back and keep your progress. When solo, try to maximize the amount of experience by spawning additional mobs before progressing. There is a greater benefit to spending more time on lower floors. Just don't cut your time too close. * Mobs are spawned more frequently while you are moving. If you need to afk inside, make sure your drg isn't running in circles. If you're having trouble keeping up with mob spawns, have your bard stop running around like an idiot. If you're trying to turn spare time into extra xp - get moving from room to room. PotD includes a lot of throwbacks to console games, and this is one of them. * You gain a large amount of job class experience based on your current player level when you complete a set of floors. This amount does benefit from the armory bonus, but not rested or food bonuses. This experience is awarded every time the floor set is cleared, is higher for deeper floor sets, and can yield several levels at the low end, to &gt;30% of a level post-50. Level capped players receive tomestones and coin ([amounts listed in the patch notes](URL **Deadly mechanics** **Floors 1-10** **Palace Hornet:** *Final Sting* - The bee must hold still to cast. Stun it, break line of sight, or have a pet soak the damage if you don't have the dps to kill the hornet fast enough. These will be the biggest hurdle to a solo player, especially before your aetherpool gear is upgraded. **Floors 11-20** **Palace Slime:** *Rapture* - damages everything in range for an amount equal to current HP - this will instantly wipe an entire party. Cast after the second digest (~20 seconds in). Burn these fast or use a Pomander of Witching if you get several at once. Damage can be avoided by running out of cast range or breaking line of sight. **Spurge**: *(L20 Boss)* - Two Palace Hornets will spawn together at regular intervals. Pop succubus form if solo and bring them down fast. Otherwise the damage will overwhelm you, even though the stings are no longer directly fatal at this level. **Floors 21-30** **Palace Skatene:** *Chirp* - Induces a 15 second sleep on every party member in range. Chirp is subject to diminishing returns (15/7/3), and can only be avoided by going out of range or breaking line of sight. Turning away will not prevent the sleep. Due to the numerous wandering enemies with dangerous knockbacks, this can lead to party wipes. **Floors 41-50** **Final Boss:** *Black Honeymoon* - Failing to avoid *In Health* will cause a rune on the ground to illuminate. This ability is a large aoe used after *Cold Feet* and can only be dodged by standing directly under the boss. If all five runes become illuminated before the next *Black Honeymoon*, it will kill the entire party. **All Floors** **[Random weapon-wielding Adventurer](URL - Much higher level than the enemies found on the floor. These yield bonus experience but don't appear to have a higher chance to drop a chest. **Exploding chests/Land Mine traps** - If you don't keep yourself at full health while moving or between fights, they can end a solo journey or kill your healer. Don't run around needlessly during fights, and stay topped off when out of combat. **Healer died! Wutdo?** - Any surviving party member can use the Cairn of Return to revive them. If you've not progressed far enough to activate that floor's Cairn, a phoenix down does work inside as well. **IT'S A TRAP - *Traps affect everyone in range within 30 yards*.** The traps are visible with Pomander of Sight. The detonation radius is very small - you have to step directly on them. * **Mimics** - Mimics can appear randomly from chests, and will cast a 10 minute debuff called pox which applies a minor dot, halts your regeneration completely, and lowers dps considerably. The cast bar says ""Infatuation"". Can only be removed with Pomander of Purity. These are rare, prevent the cast with a Pomander of Witching if you don't have one. * **Impeding Trap** - Causes 30 second pacify and silence, but Titan's attacks are unaffected. Removable by esuna. Echo drops will remove the silence only. * **Toading Trap** - Causes 20 second toad, which reduces max hp, amplifies damage taken, and prevents you from taking any action - even sending a pet to attack. *Not removable - one of the best reasons not to move around needlessly during combat.* * **Land Mine** - Causes approximately 80% of maximum HP to everything in range when stepped on. Stay topped off between rooms. * **Exploding Chest** - Deals 80% of maximum HP to everything in range when opened. Top off before opening chests. * **Luring Trap** - Spawns three random enemies from the floor to attack you. Quickly survey them to address any potential for instakill mechanics. **Pomanders** - You may acquire a maximum of three of any given pomander. *If you can't hold a pomander when a chest is opened, the chest is not lost.* These are kept with a save, and any unused pomanders get carried forward to future floor sets. Any pomanders gained leading up to a a duty failure are lost; but also **any pomanders which were consumed prior to the duty failure are restored**. * **Pomander of Strength** - Boosts your healing as well as your damage, so consider one mandatory for boss fights if solo. * **Pomander of Lust** - Transforms the user into a succubus which gains the *Void Fire II* spell and loses the use of other abilities. *Void Fire II* is a long range area effect attack with a 2.5 second base cast time that does 300 damage and applies a 2 minute vulnerability debuff that stacks up to 5 times. The damage is not increased by aetherpool rating, and it is not increased by the vulnerability stacks. Due to this, pomander of lust should be used by the weakest member of the party, or only for the debuff when solo if your dps is higher than 125. The transformation may be cancelled early by clicking off the buff. Useful on bosses due to the vulnerability debuff. * **Pomander of Rage** - Transforms the user into a manticore which gains the *Pummel* attack and loses the use of other abilities. *Pummel* is an instant casting melee range ability that instantly kills normal enemies. The damage is reduced to 500 on enemies on floors with a knockback ban and bosses. This damage is also unaffected by the succubus' vulnerability debuff. * **Pomander of Safety** - Removes floor traps but does NOT remove chest traps (detonation or mimic). * **Pomander of Purity** - The only way to cure the pox you got from the box. * **Pomander of Witching** - Polymorphs all nearby enemies - these are best saved for encounters with enemies which have instakill mechanics or mimics if you don't have a Pomander of Purity. * **Pomander of Flight** - Reduces the amount of mobs on the next floor. Your worst enemy while solo. When you complete a floor, you must either progress or reset. You can't repeat a floor set for more xp. The more xp you carry forward, the easier subsequent floor sets will be. * **Pomander of Alteration** - Each enemy in a random room on the next floor has a chance to be replaced by a mimic or mandragora - the roll occurs separately for each enemy. The mimic will debuff you considerably, but the mandragoras die in one hit and yield a large amount of experience when killed. **Gelmorran Potsherds** - The bronze chests which contain these may be found on any floor, but are more commonly found on later floors. When obtained in a party, the potsherd is directly placed into a random member's inventory exactly as a potion would be. Like potions, these are not lost if the duty is failed, so parties specifically looking for these would have best results running floors 41-50, abandoning prior to completion, and repeating. **SOLOING SUMMARY** * **Bring Echo Drops** * ***SPRINT*** * If your goal is to get the 235 weapon as quickly as possible while soloing, just go as a summoner and thank me later. *(Getting started - the first 5 minutes are the hardest. There is a fair chance you will get wrecked by a roaming Ziz. Bring a few potions to get you going. Steer clear of everything except sprites and mice, you should be able to get to 4 with a little care. After that you're set.)* * If your goal is to gain experience on a class that doesn't have heals, you get the same experience in a party, and soloing isn't recommended for experience. * If you still want to solo for the challenge or personal preference, tanks are going to have trouble with the DPS checks, and DPS will have trouble staying topped off to handle the traps. Keep in mind that XP is gained to your base class, and inside the PotD there is no traditional gear, so there is very little motivation to enter with a soulstone equipped. Entering as a base class will allow you to sacrifice a few job skills to access to crossclass abilities from any class, with twice as many slots. Every class has access to cure and protect. Your character does still have stats determined by class - though they are invisible - but aetherpool arm upgrades affect healing and attack potency indiscriminately, so it should be more viable than one would first expect. All post-50 skills are tied to the job class, and some classes fare better without them than others. If you find yourself stuck, your aetherpool progress will carry to a party (but not your floor). * HQ potions do drop frequently, but not frequently enough to maintain a full health bar, buy them from the marketboard or save them for the bosses. Use stuns, silences, or Pomanders of Witching on the instakillers. Use Pomander of Lust to weaken a boss and then drop form to heal yourself and continue the fight. * **Consumables** - You can use any consumable item, including those from outside the PotD. HQ potions will drop from enemies inside. A good supply of HQ potions will make classes without heals viable, but they will need to beware traps. Several traps within cause long-duration status effects. If you're a caster, bring echo drops. There doesn't appear to be a potion to remove the 30 second pacify or the 20 second toad. Food will provide a benefit to stats, but not to xp gained. * **Crossclass actions** - Cross-job slots become available at the levels at which they would during normal syncing. * **Chocobo** - is a no go. They may not be summoned here. *On Jenova? Say hi - Character: Steel Arrow*"

I will detail 13 out of the 16 Pomanders you could get and when to best use them (I cannot find any info about the last 3) Strength and Steel: These two grant buffs to damage(and healing) and Defense, respectably. Remember that Tanks and Healers could use a little more defense, and that more DPS is good in the long run. WHM, AST and likley WAR can benefit from the DPS increase. Both buffs last for 8 minutes. Lust and Rage: These two transform the user into a Succubus or a Manticore. The Manticore can kill mobs that can be knocked back while the Succubus becomes one of two player inflicted source of stacking vulnerability up debuffs in the entire game. For that reason it would be wise to save Lust for the X0th floor (bosses) if you have only one, while using Rage on every other floor (remember, the instakill mechanic relies on Knockback for some reason Rage is also useless on damage own flloors.). With that said, Lust can be useful for large trash rooms as well. Fortune: This ups the chance of enemies dropping chests upon death. RNG is still at play, so keep that in mind. Best used when you enter a floor. I must advise against using this with Flight, and sugesst using it with Rage Sight: This reveals the map of the floor an all traps. So if you use this, avoid any red marks. Like Fortune this is best used the moment you enter a floor. Especially when Aflluence was used beforehand. Safety: This disarms all traps on the current floor and thus like the last two should be used immediately upon arrival (or if you're paranoid just immediately) Flight: Not useful for Leveling, but a godsend for grabbing chests and getting through floors 30-50 swiftly. This when used reduces the amount of mobs on the next floor. Use immediately for best results. Affluence: Like Flight, this affects the next floor and thus should be used as son as you get it. Why? because it means that floor will get more chests, which means more chances of buffing your gear an finding Potsherds (RNG still a thing though so keep that in mind) Alteration: Best used when Level Grinding for it changes some Mobs on the next floor into Mimics or Korrigans. The latter giving a lot of exp, but only if you're within range of their shrieks. Either way you get more exp than usual. Witching: Best used when you bit of more than you can chew. This transforms the mobs into either toads, chickens or imps/Kappa. It also makes them sitting ducks Purity: It just removes the otherwise unremovable Pox status (and likely Accursed Pox as well), best used by those with these debuffs Serenity: This removes all enchantments on the current Floor, whether it be Haste, Gloom, or HP decreases. Bear in min that it won't discriminate against positive buffs the floor would provide so if you use it you lose the buffs. Especially keep that in mind if you want the special enemies that spawn only in Gloom. It also appranrly can remove the no-pomander effect from the floor. On a side note, All Pomanders can have a maximum stack of 3, any excess will be returned unless the pomander is used"
139,vulnerability,ffxiv,"PotD, Guide for farming and soloing",3,4u0n8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4u0n8l/potd_guide_for_farming_and_soloing/,2016-07-22 12:33:08,"**Place of the Dead** *What is Palace of the Dead?* Palace of the dead is an area released in patch 3.35 which allows players to unravel the story of Eddas party, a conjurer met in the earlier in the main scenario. The Palace of the dead is located in Quarrymill and currently player must speak to an npc to enter. There are 50 floors total (as of 3.35) and the dungeon is broken into intermissions, where you are allowed to take a break every 10 floors. *How does it work?* After speaking to the npc, you can enter with a fixed party or a match party. There is no difference in difficulty, but entering with a fixed party allows for you to keep pomanders between intermissions and the match party does not. A fixed party also must enter with the exact same player composition to continue. After every 10 floors, where an intermission occurs, progress is saved and all earned progress (In the form of aetherpool arm and aertherpool armor) is updated. You are allowed 2 different files to progress at a time, but as the only actual measure of progress is aetherpool strength, there isnt a disadvantage of deleting your files, other than not being able to continue where you left off floor-wise. *Floors?* Each floor is randomly generated, consisting of rooms which are connected by corridors. Each room will have a set of enemies, and at least one of the following: a treasure chest, traps, and a portal to take you to the next floor. *Rewards?* Tokens from Palace of the Dead (Gelmorran Potsherds) can be traded for minions, a mount, or tier V battle materia. Getting your aetherpool arm and aetherpool armor both to +30 will allow you to get a item lvl 235 weapon of your choice and reset your progess (aetherpool arm and armor rating) back to +0. **Now onto the actual guide:** Most people are doing this for the rewards; so you have 2 forms of rewards, Gelmorran Potsherds and Aetherpool rating. The focus here is on solo play since this is the only thing you can control, and not ruin anyone else play experience at the same time. This also allows for no mistakes to be made by party members which will cripple you. To get potsherds, you can get them in regular chests (from experience, floors 31-49) and you will get one from clearing floor 50. As progress can only move forward, in order to get them from floor 50, you must clear floor 50, then reset your save and get to 50 again. This isnt very effective, so assuming you are solo (so a fixed party) heres what you can do: Due to the mechanics of the dungeon, if you die you will lose all progress in the form of aetherpool rating and pomanders, but not items you obtained. Conversely, pomanders you used you will get restored, but not items you consumed. This is actually advantageous. Since youre solo, you are in a fixed party and keep your pomander between floors. So first things first: Get a file to floor 41. While doing so heres some pomanders you need to save up, preferably 3 of each: * Pomander of Affluence * Pomander of Fortune To make things easier, I would also recommend getting these as well: * Pomander of Sight * Pomander of Rage Heres what each does: * Affluence: This increases the number of chests on the following floor. Obviously needed since we are farming chests for potsherds. * Fortune: This increases the drop rate of chests from enemies. This also is a given since its the only other pomander that can spawn more chests. * Pomander of sight: We can see the treasure rooms, yes. But with this strategy, we arent skipping any enemies, so the more important thing is seeing traps. The reason we arent using Pomander of Safety instead, then its simple. We dont want to get hit by traps that will kill us. But we also do want to activate lure traps, since they spawn more enemies. Using safety will also remove the lure traps, which will decrease the effectiveness of the Fortune. * Pomander of rage: We are farming, so we dont want to waste time actually fighting enemies. This will one shot them unless they have a floor which has No Knockback enchantments, which in that case youll want to carry one of a pomander of serenity just for that. It cant happen for floors in a row though, so chances are not getting it, or only getting one. Heres the general strategy: 1. Go to floor 41 2. Activate all 4 pomanders. 3. ??? 4. When everythings dead repeat for the next 2 floors. 5. Exit (die) and restart for 41. *Caveat:* Affluence affects the following floor, so you will not get any effect on 41. You can get 2 of affluence for this, or go until 44, using a pomander of flight on floor 44. You also cannot interact with chests while you are transformed. This means that if you are killing enemies with rage, you will wait until the enchantment wears off and then collect treasure. More in detail, this is what you are doing: 1. Activate Sight. Look for a path to all treasure rooms and a path to the portal. 2. Use Affluence and Fortune. Use Rage. Clear a path to the portal first, then to all connecting treasure rooms. 3. When rage wears off, sprint to all the chests and to the portal. Keep in mind that moving will spawn more enemies to be careful to avoid fighting at all. 4. Go in the portal and repeat 1-4.When if you have no more sets of pomanders (you can get a rage, sight, fortune, and affluence from a chest to keep it going) then run into a pack of mobs and die, failing the duty. Repeat from step 1. If you do it right, then youll spend about a minute on each floor (dont bother waste time killing more things when rage wears off) and can repeat this cycle every 4-5 minutes. On average, you should expect 1 on each run so this may take about 40-50 minutes to farm a mount and an additional half hour to get all the minions. I recommend, not overriding this save since you have another one you can use for progression. To get a higher Aetherpool rating, you still have to open chests but they have to be silver. There are also some rules you have to follow: Lower floors have a cap on the increases, this means if you have a high rating (circa 20 or so) then you need to open chests on the higher numbered floors, such as 41-50. Second, progress is only saved in a clear. You cant keep dying, like farming potsherd to get progress. Lastly, progress is never reset unless you reach +30/+30 and collect a weapon, so you can keep resetting your saves all you want. So heres the general strategy, assuming you start from +0/+0. 1. Reset both save files. 2. Grab your solo class and enter as a fixed party. 3. Clear a set of 10. 4. Enter using the other save file. 5. Clear a set of 10. 6. Repeat 2-5 until both files are at 50. Then repeat from 1. Obviously, when we get to the higher rating, this will become ineffective, so heres what we will need to do: 1. Get to 41. 2. ??? 3. Get to 49. 4. Either complete 50 and repeat from step 1, or die (and fail the duty) and repeat from step 1. Heres the difference: completing 50 means you save your progress. Your rating will get added and you will have a file that you need to reset. Failing means you lose all progress and can try again at 41. Basically, look at the number of times youre willing to go from 1-50 (e.g. 5). That means, if you are +25/+25 you need to get at least +2/+2 on average to meet your goal. If you meet or exceed your goal, then go ahead and save your progress and start over from 1. Else, dont save your progress and reroll. If you follow the strategy above using 2 saves, then you will have about +23/+23 by the time you reach 50 on both. After that point, you could continue using 2 saves, or just repeat 41-50 with one save. Now obviously, you need to spawn silver chests. Silver chests spawn under the same conditions as bronze ones, so the idea is the as the potsherd farm except for killing yourself. Affluence, Fortune, and lure traps are your friends. Dont skip any enemies and it may be even beneficial to use the pomander of fortune when you get the gloom enchantment. Just keep in mind that gloom enchantment adds sprint, damage up, and defense up to all mobs so youll want to either use rage on that floor or use pomander of strength and pomander of steel to cancel the effects out. Now obviously, both of these strategies assume you are solo, so heres a guide for that: *Im going solo. What do I need to know?* First off, your pomanders carry over, since you are in a fixed party. Second, if you die youll have to start again from the last save point. Phoenix downs and revival skills are useless. Potions are pretty good, but youll not really need them if you plan properly. *Okay. What class should I use?* This is a farming guide. Without beating around the bush, the point is to be efficient. Dont use melee. Thats a waste of time and I doubt you can actually kill all the bosses. Dont use bard or machinist. Simply put, they are the same as melee and simply lack mechanical tools to keep them alive. So far, that eliminate anything but casters, healers, and tanks. Dont use dark knight. Honestly, I dont think dark knight can keep himself alive. Paladin vs. Warrior? Well for either class you might not meet the dps requirements to even finish in time so dont use a tank in general. So the casters and healers are left in the end. Eliminate black mage, this a glass cannon and cant run and cast enough to meet the dps requirements. Eliminate scholar. Not even a joke. If you have the job crystal for scholar, then you need to just get summoner and forget it exists in here. Not only is scholars dps abysmal compared to the other healers, but you dont even have a pet to help with your abysmal dps. Lvl 4 summons eos and 15 summons selene. So heres what we are left with: White Mage, Astrologian, Summoner If you have all of these, then dont make it hard on yourself, use Summoner. It is incontestably the best class in here and this should not have crossed your mind. If you are using the others, toss a regen on yourself before combat and a stoneskin. Then proceed to mow down things on cleric stance. Nocturnal vs. Diurnal? Well you dont have regen in Nocturnal so its up to you whether you plan on actively switching out of cleric and healing yourself. Honestly, just keep using stone skin and potions and its good enough. The rest of the guide assume you are using Summoner, since its the most efficient class to use. Remember, youll want to use the soul stone, as its not worth it to lose the post 50 skills. *Okay. I choose my class. Do I need anything outside?* Echo drops. If you are using casters, then that will be the leading cause of death for you. Only potions and the higher tier variants drop inside so youll need to at least be able to remove silence. *Okay. Im about to enter. What should I do?* So youre using Summoner. First things first, you need to know that pet skills also are learned at certain levels. At level 4 you have Garuda, 15 Titan, and 30 Ifrit. Youre not going to use Ifrit. Except if you somehow messed up in a boss fight and Titan died. You clearly going to use Titan from the time you unlock Summon II until floor 50, and Summon from lvl 4 until 15, when you unlock Summon I. Dont use Titan on sic. Trust me, hes your only source of interrupts and you will need them on the higher floors. He also only has one AoE, outside of enkindle so youll need to use this wisely. DPS wise, Titan is actually better than Garuda until 40 anyway, but at that point, youll die without having Titan so just use him the whole way. **Floors 1-10:** Priority is getting to lvl 4. Dont leave the first floor until you do. Kill everything. Dont skip and dont skip any chests. Dont use any pomanders unless you are capped when you open a chest containing one. When you get to lvl 15, summon Titan and start pulling enemies back one at a time to a safe zone, avoiding aggroing other enemies. Remember that aetherflow is useless until level 8, since you dont have aetherdam trait yet. In the boss room, make sure you have strength and steel active (they transfer to your pets) and put Titan on sic and go to town. Remember lures are your friend so look for them if you used a sight. Also dont open chests or run around while fighting enemies. There are traps on the floor (unless you dispelled them, which you shouldnt unless you were capped) which can first of all deal 80% to you and second, silence, frog, etc. render you unable to fight. Chest can be trapped and explode or just have mimics so just dont open them while youre in combat or arent topped off. And obviously dont walk around not topped off, lest you die to a random explosion trap. I guess you can also watch for bees, but you should have Titan by then so there isnt any danger. Either keep him topped off if youre fighting 2 or just let him die from the sting if you are fighting 1 and resummon him. **Floors 11-20:** Now we have to start applying some actual strategy. Two enemies to look out for and 1 more to be wary of. First is palace slimes. These have an instant kill mechanic, of which at this level you have no way of interrupting. Do not pull more than one of these at once. Youll just end up killing yourself when they use Rapture. Second is the Cobra. When you see the gaze, look away lest you want to be petrified. Of course Titan cant be petrified by this, so its only a danger if Titan doesnt have aggro on everything or Titan is about to die when you get petrified. Lastly are Morbols. They arent really dangerous, but it sucks when titan gets hit by the bad breath, so its best if you stand 180 degrees from titan right behind the morbol and bait it to your side. Since you have Titan, everything is a breeze if you go one at a time. If the room has gloom enchantment, then use your fortune pomander and go to town. If it has No Regeneration, the use serenity pomander and continue about your day. Youll want to use the pomanders of sight on as many of the later floors as possible here since you will need to use lure traps to get some additional enemies without wasting much time. The goal here is to reach 35 before the boss so you can get fester. You will also need to get a pomander of lust. The boss here summons 2 bees which will target you since youre solo and will final sting you to death, so youll need the AoE damage from the succubus. In my rounds, the boss always summoned them twice so youll want to either use it when you see the first target marker on you and kill them and revert, then use another, or get lucky and they are used close enough together to only use one. Issue with using one is that you cant heal your pet while transformed and the succubus only deals 300 damage and is not affected by the damage up you put on enemies. So its best just to have 2. Fire all your stuff in your opener. Use succubus when bees spawn. Two-shot the bees. Put stacks up to 5 on boss. Revert, heal up your pet, spread more DoTs. Use succubus when bees spawn again and just hit the boss with the succubus until it dies. You may end up losing your pet if you dont revert and heal him up since the boss tends to use a few high damage AoE that they dont avoid. Same as before, use a steel and strength before the boss and send in Titan on sic. **Floors 21-30:** Really its just the Palace Skatene (owls) that you have to worry about. They cast sleep, which does affect pets. Either get to 40 asap and use rouse (to make Titan immune) or landslide (to interrupt it altogether) or take the chances and try to kill them before they cast chirp. Things tend to spawn at a much higher rate here so you can get aggroed by something else while you are dozing off. If you somehow got in the situation where you have multiple, then drop the pomander of witching and just kill them. Rooms will tend to start having 5-8 enemies too, so if you somehow aggro multiple then the pomander of witching is your friend. Remember slow and steady wins the race, but heres where time will start becoming a factor. Youll need about 3-4 minutes to kill the boss assuming you are using pomander of strength and you have the basic aetherpool requirements to get here. That means you have about 56 minutes to handle the remaining 9 floors, which means youll want to average about 6 minutes per floor. Now lets say you encounter a room which has 5 or so enemies, no chest and pomander of fortune isnt active. Youve already spent 10 minutes here and youre worrying about time. Because this happens quite often, before you get to 21-30 stock up on pomander of alteration. This will turn a random room on the next floor into mimics or korrigans. Either is good, but heres where you want to watch out: mimics cast pox, which does some dot damage but more importantly stops regen. Either kill these as fast as you can before they cast or use the pomander of purity to remove it. Mimics have a higher rate to drop chests than normal, so they are good for both getting silver chests and bronze. I tend to use alteration on one floor and when I get to the floor use fortune to increase the drop rate further, which tends to guarantee chest drops from mimics. Korrigans give about 3x normal exp, so you can basically replace fighting a group of enemies with one korrigan. Of course, if your group is in a chest room, then youll want to fight them anyway, so I would stock up on pomanders of witching for these scenarios as well. From this point on the biggest challenge is to not spend too much time on a floor so you can finish on time. The goal should be to get to 52 for pain flare. The boss fight is a pushover. Just strength/steel up, send in Titan on sic and dodge the AoEs. The boss here is a hydra, so stay away from Titan or move him when theres an AoE below him. Also he casts fear, but you just stack on him for that. **Floors 31-40:** Nothing really new, so just keep in mind the things from 21-30. Goal here is to get to 60. Again, pomander of sights are good because youll likely need the lure traps to get to 60. Similar for the pomanders of alteration for getting korrigans. Feel free to burn through your manticores, but if the room has No Knockback enchantment, then use serenity. For the boss I recommend first switching to succubus and getting vulnerability up to 5, then continuing as normal. Before you get to 40, stock up on 2 pomanders: Flight and safety. **Floors 41-50:** Since youre already 60 you dont want exp, so start using flight when you get them. On floors you dont use flight, use fortune and start killing as much as possible. Its a race against time at this point and youll want about 5 minutes for the boss. Pomander of safety sees good use here, since you will tend to move around a bit during fights and it will be bad to walk into a trap. Of course you can use pomander of sight as a replacement that you dont have safety on those floors. Use rage when you get them, except when on a floor with no knock backs that you cant dispel and strength on steel should always be active. As always, youll want a strength and steel for the boss. I recommend again, getting 5 vulnerability stacks on the last boss and then reverting. Obviously avoid getting feared and getting hit by anything. Youll spend a lot of time just healing your pet, so keep that in mind. By the time you get to 41, youll absolutely want to only fight 1 thing at a time, so if thats not an option, then just skip fighting altogether, even if theres loot in the room. **Tips in general:** Sustain is your friend. The things hit so hard in the last 10 floor that you might spend more time focusing on healing your pet than attacking, so tri-disaster is invaluable. When you get a hard hitting enemy that you cant DoT up regularly, then just burn aetherflow stacks on pain flare and energy drain and fight in DWT. Potions will be your main source of healing damage in boss fights, since you cant use sustain on yourself. Pomanders are all useful, but not really all of them should be used for all sets. You shouldnt be using flight at all until you are lvl capped and you shouldnt be using safety unless you cant use sight. Dont use safety and sight together, its misses the big advantage of using sight. If you get silenced, other than garuda, you pets can still attack as normal, and you can still use any move that is not a spell (like pain flare, energy drain, fester, etc.) and auto attack. Sprint should be use on cooldown, since youre a caster. Your pet is your lifeline. Just like in regular 4 man content, if the tank dies everyone usually follows suit. Except, here there are no respawns. Okay have fun! "
140,vulnerability,ffxiv,Foe Requiem vs Hypercharge in 3.3 - JP table,30,4monct,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4monct/foe_requiem_vs_hypercharge_in_33_jp_table/,2016-06-06 04:21:06,"crudely ""translated"" and interpreted by me from Eorzean article: URL --- The recast time of Bard's Battle Voice will be reduced from 300 seconds to 180 seconds in patch 3.3. Let's find out the difference in party DPS contribution now with this change. **Previous article on Foe vs Hypercharge in 3.25 - URL * Hypercharge (Rook Autoturret): Approximately 28s of 10% physical vulnerability up. Recast: 2 minutes * Foe Requiem: Debuffs the enemy with 10% magic resistance down. 69s duration from 100% MP to 0%. MP natural recovery is 2% every 3 seconds in combat. * Battle Voice: Doubles the effect of Foe Requiem for 30s. 3.3 modifies the recast to 3 minutes. Here's a table showing how Foe Requiem and Hypercharge affect their respective damage types over time in combat. Hypercharge will be used on cooldown, and Foe Requiem will be used at full MP til bottoming out and repeating. Foe Requiem uptime will be maximized as much as possible in the period of time covered. And for now, let's factor out how much specific jobs/specific party comps outside of the meta would be affected by both Foe and HC. URL When comparing the 3.3 table to 3.25, notice how the lowest the ratio goes is 2.0 at 9 minutes only. --- **my thoughts** for the most part this table just shows how much magical DPS is buffed at certain points vs how much physical DPS is buffed at certain points. foe requiem will always have a higher ratio of (magical) DPS buffed compared to HC's (physical) DPS buffed. that data in itself isn't able to prove much because we don't know good baseline total physical and total magical dps numbers (before foes/hc), but we can estimate. i didn't see anything from the author that was specific/similar, so i'll use an example **Alexander Midas (Savage) Median Performance - DRK/WAR WHM/SCH NIN/DRG/BLM/** (URL * physical dps total: 4001.3 (excluding WAR from both sides) * magical dps total: 2531.7 (excluding DRK magical dmg) * ratio: 1.58~ so with those median numbers, if foe's ratio is 1.58 or better, then it's better equal or better. for the most part, it seems the author had already established that a ratio of 2.0 or lower favored HC, and a ratio of 2.5 or higher favored foe. i believe that the author includes MCH's own DPS into the physical DPS number he uses to establish the red/purple ratios (which i don't agree with; it's essentially double dipping the benefits of HC). if we did the same, it would be 5536 physical DPS; which brings the ratio to 2.18~. i excluded WAR because the author's math (which i haven't really verified) on paean vs HC pointed out that WAR basically benefited near equally from both enough to be able to factor it out. this table and post gives a general idea of foes:hc ratio and a method, and that's about it! things will change **a lot** from fight to fight, comp to comp, and how hardcore everyone is at min-maxing. for example, at the median percentile or worse, healer dps isn't too great and physical dps is pretty dominant. but at higher percentiles or in irregular groups, things can change; healer dps typically skyrockets in the 99th-100th percentiles for example, which would greatly shift things. **tl;dr from my pov** - in your own group, in the content that you do, if your foes:HC ratio for the encounter is higher than your physical dps:magic dps ratio, then foes is better. it's up to you to decide for your own party and the ensuing encounter, if the foes:hc ratio would be greater than the physical:magic dps ratio.

141,vulnerability,ffxiv,Sohr Khai TL;DR,30,4mys51,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4mys51/sohr_khai_tldr/,2016-06-07 22:27:24,"Moglin: kill the Cap'n, push dead moogles out of purple circles. Poqhiraj: stack behind the boss for Quasar so it doesn't hit the walls, drop Cloud Call against the wall. Hraesvelgr: don't stand in stuff. **The Details:** *First Boss: Moglin* Two key mechanics here: - Captain Mogsun - if he is alive and within range of Moglin, he'll tether to him and make him invincible. Take him down ASAP! - @#$*!% Resurrecting Moogles - Moogles of various classes will spawn throughout the fight. They're not too hard to kill, but as they die, Moglin will periodically drop purple AOE circles (kind of like the summoning circles from first boss of Haukke Hard) on the Moogles' corpses. Attack the corpses to knock them out of the circles, otherwise they'll be revived at full health (this applies to Captain Mogsun too). Be advised that if you knock the corpses to the edge of the arena, they can be quite difficult to move again should the need arise. Direct them toward the center instead, if possible. *Second Boss: Poqhiraj* This is a mean-ass horsey. The fight takes place in a pretty narrow rectangular arena and is mostly tank and spank. Here's what to expect: - Destructible Environment - the walls on either side of the corridor can be knocked down in chunks by certain attacks Poqhiraj uses. When they fall, they expose an electrified pool behind them. Avoid standing in it as it applies a nasty DOT. - Jump - Poqhiraj jumps, becomes untargetable as one might expect, and lands at one end of the corridor, dealing party-wide damage. The closer you are to the landing spot, the more damage you take; so get to the other end. - Charge - after landing, Poqhiraj charges down the corridor. This is unavoidable, and has a knockback effect as well. Players hit by this attack will be knocked away from the center of the corridor, so make sure to stand by a wall so you don't get knocked into the pool of electric death. - Quasar - unmarked line AOE with a reasonable cast time. This attack is probably the main reason walls fall down; stack directly behind the horse to keep Quasar from going off to the side and hitting walls. - Cloud Call - one player will receive a purple marker; when the marker disappears, a thundercloud will spawn over their head. This cloud will pulse damage and a vulnerability debuff; fortunately, the radius of the pulse is slightly smaller than the width of the corridor. My party found that the best placement for the cloud was halfway down the corridor, smooshed up against the wall. That allowed us enough room to run by (to get away from Touchdown) without getting struck by lightning. *Third Boss: Hraesvelgr* Surprisingly, the easiest boss of the dungeon (we thought). This fight takes place on a bunch of pedestals surrounded by circles that allow you to jump to and fro. In the interest of brevity, ""Don't Stand In Stuff"" is just about all you need to know here. But let's cover a couple mechanics I noticed: - Holy Breath -- pulse AOE, no cast bar. It'll probably hit you once or twice but just hop to a different pedestal as soon as you can. - Big Bad Pedestal-Destroying Breath -- Hraesvelgr prepares a very big and very noticeable AOE that will destroy two pedestals at a time. I don't know what happens if you're on them when they disappear, but I doubt it's good. NOTE: at one point I got ""stranded"" on a pedestal by this attack and freaked out; don't worry about that. The jump circles will still work even if you no longer have directly adjacent pedestals. - Holy Sprites -- a couple adds spawn after BBPDB. They don't do much besides cast Banish at ya. - Ice Cubes and Dragon Heads -- ice cubes and dragon heads will appear and float around, mostly toward you. Dragon heads will just do damage if they collide with you, but ice cubes will apply Heavy which can be inconvenient if you need to get off a platform. "
142,vulnerability,ffxiv,Weeping City of Mhach Guide (Sort off),26,4n5ywg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4n5ywg/weeping_city_of_mhach_guide_sort_off/,2016-06-09 02:42:37,"*WARNING THIS IS A REALLY LONG GUIDE* Arachne Eve (1st Boss) 1) If you get a red marker on your head go to the edge of the arena she will shoot web to where the marker disappear, the web will come into use later. 2) When she burrowed under the ground she will do 3 different sets of attack, you will only see 2 at the start. 1st one is a 3 wave attack that start from the center of arena just wait outside of the indicator and go into the center after it goes off and you'll dodge the rest, the 2nd attack is when she burrowed back to the arena this attack will happen on one side of the arena immediately after the wave attack and it deal distance base damage. The 3rd one will only happen after the Keyknot phase, she will use quicksand to pull everyone into the middle so stand on one of the web, this attack also deal distance base damage. The next set will be the wave attack and quicksand afterward. 3) When she pull everyone to the top a spider will spawn kill it asap after it's killed the spider will burn a hole in the web allow you to drop back down, assign 2 party to go down and 1 party stay on top, the parties at the bottom should kill the Keyknots asap, the party on top need to intercept the blue orb before it reach the boss, if it reach the boss she will gain a damage up buff making her Implosion attack hit harder, when a purple orb spawn burn it down if it reach the boss she will gain a huge damage boost and you don't want that, you can stun lock it 3 times. For the party on top, don't stand on the web that's green you'll take damage. 4) When she cast Frond Affeared simply look away. 5) When you get a big green aoe indicator on you move to the edge of the arena and don't hit anyone with it, this mechanics works the same way as the one in Void Ark, if you overlap the circle you will be bind to the other person with the indicator. Forgall (2nd Boss) 1) As soon as the fight starts he will revive the 4 adds on the ground and place green puddle on the ground (these puddles is crucial to your win later on, for now avoid it) OT pick up the adds and burn it down, if the adds are not dead after awhile they will explode and deal massive raid wide damage and inflict vulnerability. 2) He will summon a lot of portal on the ground with energy coming out of it you need stand on them, the person on it will get a bleeding a debuff but is very weak so don't worry about it, he will use an attack call Punishing Wave, if all portal are covered it will deal about 2k damage. 3) When he begin casting Void Call tanks go to middle to get ready to pick up ur designated adds, alliance A pick up Dahak, alliance B pick up Succubus, alliance C pick up Haagenti, Dahak post no threat to the raid but it does have a nasty conel aoe with no cast time so dps be careful, When Succubus cast Beguiling Mist stun/silence her if she succeed in casting you'll get seduce and most likely die to her Void Fire IV afterwards or get hit by something else, Haagenti can cast Mortal Ray which only inflict Doom to nearby players so look away if you're close to him, the Doom can be cleanse. Punishing Wave will also happen during this phase so beware. 4) After his ultimate attack the green puddle will finally be useful, from now on he will cast Mega-Death which kills you if you don't have the zombie status so stand on the green puddle to get the zombie status but make sure you're only standing on one green puddle if you're hit with 2 or more you will starts attacking your party members. Sometimes you won't see green puddle on the ground but rather a bunch of green orbs, stand under them to wait for the orbs to pop and you will get the zombie status. 5) He will cast Brand of the fallen on an entire party, when you get the marker on your head gather with your party so you don't take massive damage and become a frog, you can stay close to only 1 party member and still be fine. 6) He will cast Evil Mist from time to time usually after Brand of the fallen to kill the people that became frog, depends on your hp you may or may not die if you're in frog form, it hits about 5k ish. 7) When he cast Hell Wind healers be ready because it will take away 99% of everyone hp so if your tank is the MT heal him first or he will die to his auto attack, Punishing Wave will also happen after Hell Wind. 8) He will mark 3 players with Dark Eruption after the marker disappear it will spawn 3 fire circles continuously under the marked players, simply avoid it and avoid walking into other players. Ozma (3rd Boss) 1) You can fall down, so don't try jumping off the ledge... 2) Sphere form don't do much is mostly just meteors and adds. the meteors will have a big purple aoe indicator on 1 player, simply place it at the back of the rectangle platform you're standing on and gather infront to avoid damage after the meteors land it will become an add so kill it, the adds will cast tornado if you don't burn them down, later in the fight there will be 2 meteors so place one on the back and one on the middle of the left pathway and gather back on the same spot to avoid damage. If the meteors are place too close to each other they will explode (like T9 meteors) dealing moderate damage and inflict damage down debuff. Tanks be sure to grab your adds immediately after they drop if you don't they will run to the other party, don't be that guy. Monk and Dragoon need to be careful here if your adds are traveling thru the middle don't use your gap closer, you will fall off and die. 3) When Ozma change to Pyramid form stay out of the rectangle platform because he will do a straight line aoe down the platform immediately and it will inflict mini, poison and slow you can only cleanse the poison and slow. Bleed will drop on random party member with no indicator and it also hit the players around them so spread out, bleed can also be cleanse. He will put Acceleration Bomb on multiple players and when the bomb is about to explode don't move or use any abilities or else you will drop to critical health or die, the explode time of the bombs are different for each players. 4) When Ozma change to Cube form stay infront of the rectangle platform because he will immediately cast an aoe that only hit the outer area of the arena it also inflict vulnerability. After that all tanks will get a laser attack focus on them so assign your tank to hug the front left or right corner and the melee dps hug the other corner, during this a few orbs will spawn on the linear pathway and sometimes on the center of the rectangle platform healer can take them just make sure u top yourself up before u take the next one they also move clockwise at a fast pace. He will also cast Holy which does moderate damage but knock you back a little so be careful. 5) When Ozma cast Black Hole he will pull you into another area and you'll see a pad and Atomos, you only need 1 player on the pad, adds will spawn during this so tanks grab them. After you kill the Atomos and the light on your pad is still on assign a healer to stand on it while the rest jump down to kill Ozmashade, he will cast Assimilation which can be avoid but simply turning around, if u get the debuff just don't face him until the debuff fall off. After you kill it walk into the portal and you'll be back on the rectangle platform. Calofisteri (Final Boss) 1) Blade will grow on her hair so pay attention to which side is it on, melee dps and OT need to avoid the side with blade on it because she will continuously cleave that side. The blade will switch sides from time to time, she'll cast an nasty attack call Haircut which cover half the arena depending on which side of her hair has blade on it, if you get hit you'll take massive damage and get a nasty dots if the healer didn't heal you up or cleanse it fast enough you will die. 2) She will cast Extension this mechanics have 4 different kind of attacks, before her ultimate attack she will only cast the jail one which will have a purple circle on the ground, don't step on them after awhile they will just disappear, if you trigger it you will get caught and other people will need to break you out if they jail finish casting before you are broken out you will die. After her ultimate attack she will start using all 4 Extensions which include Jail, Hammer, Axe and Spear. Jail works the same but instead of 1 there's 2, Hammer and Axe always happened together, under the Axe is always a safe spot, the Hammer will do a knock up aoe around it, getting hit by any of them will take moderate damage and you will also get a vulnerability debuff. Last set of Extension will be 2 Spears, they do a straight line attack and is always a X pattern through the arena and they always spawn on the side of the arena not far from each other so just stand in between them or find an angle where you won't get hit by it, getting hit by the spears also inflict vulnerability. 3) During her ultimate charging phase, 3 players will be marked and when the mark disappear laser will start chasing them much like Cloud of Darkness laser so avoid other players. Also those Green Orbs you see will begin casting if they finish casting her ultimate will be stronger so burn them fast. 4) When she cast Penetration a bunch of Hammers will also spawn around the arena simply find a safe spot and face away so you'll get push back, if you look at her you'll get drawn in and get hit by 3 Hammers, the safe spot are in between 2 hammer on each side of the arena. 5) When she start casting Depth Charge avoid her front side and also look at where the blade are on her hair and dodge to the safe side because she will also do Haircut immediately after that. MT tank need to position her properly after that to avoid hitting the whole alliance with Haircut later. Congratulation you have now clear Weeping City of Mhach :D (Sorry for my bad English :/) "

But considering the buffs we were given while DRK doesn't have the burst WAR does, but their utility is going to be better after this update I believe. &gt;Warrior can gank people in Feast with Holmgang, and apply Full Swing on top of their Storm's Eye; and Proceed to double Fell Cleave. &gt;While it's a nice contribution to the party dps I think it without a doubt fails in comparison to the utility DRK brings to pvp. DRK has quite a few really good tools in PVP that many seem to overlook. &gt;Carnal Chill: &gt;Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 150 to target and all enemies nearby it. Additional Effect: Lowers target's damage dealt by 40% for 6s. &gt;Enhanced Carnal Chill: Shortens recast time to 60 seconds. Enhanced Carnal Chill II: Increases potency to 180. Enhanced Carnal Chill III: Increases damage penalty to 60%. &gt;Tar Pit: &gt;Deals unaspected damage with a potency of 250 to all nearby enemies. Additional Effect: Heavy +40% for 8s. Additional Effect: Absorbs 150% of damage dealt as HP &gt;Enhanced Tar Pit: Shortens recast time to 90 seconds. Enhanced Tar Pit II: Increases potency to 300. Enhanced Tar Pit III: Increases HP absorption to 200%. &gt;DRK has two powerful AOE skills. One lowers every target's damage by 40 to 60%, this is nothing to scoff at, and can mean the difference between your healer getting destroyed, or your healer surviving, and having a bit of an easier time healing themselves back up. &gt;The other is an AOE Heavy that applies the Heavy at 40%, and heals the DRK by 150 to 200%. Not only is this skill great for getting the DRK out of a sticky situation. It can also be used similarly to Carnal Chill in that you can use it to allow your healer to escape as 40% Heavy on top of them sprinting would easily allow them to escape any melee DPS, or Tank. &gt;That and a 150 - 200% heal is amazing when your tank is trying to hold onto those medals in tight situations where they become the focus of the enemy team. Besides these two skills Darkside also got buffed pretty nicely. Now boosting DRK dps by 20% it makes them a bit more threatening than they were before. &gt;Also since our Soul Survivor skill now applies 10% vulnerability to the target not only is it a pseudo Full Swing, but when stacked with Full Swing you can put a 30% vulnerability onto someone, which could make even another Tank susceptible to getting bursted down. Especially when paired with a DRG's Disembowel, and a MCH's burst. &gt;DRK's overall contribution seems like it is overall much stronger than it used to be. Even if the changes do seem kind of small at first. Credit to u/ShadeX91 for the help with the updated tool tips."

World of Darkness?,0,4ocbqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4ocbqd/savage_world_of_darkness/,2016-06-16 18:26:12,"From a brainstorming perspective, how would mechanics work in areas suited for three, completely separate parties? It's not really 24 man content, but three separate groups cooperating in one piece of content, so one way Savage modes can work is to *enforce* party interdependence. This also means rewarding trollish behavior. For this reason, this content will not be freely queued for in the DF, but require the RF. Example of mechanics would including the vast space in the Five-Headed Dragon arena would become restricted over time. On angra, the platforms serve an additional purpose of infusing player color coding with, as in A5, a debuff that accumulates over time which, like the red/white switching mechanic, will kill you if stacked too high. Only you will be forced to gain a stack after every Mortal Gaze (turn around, avoid; then your color is changed and you must get on the appropriate platform with everyone of the same color in 3 seconds or everyone of that color dies). Moreover, only people of an appropriate color can kill the hourglasses. Adds also use Mortal Gaze, whereas Eyes on Me inflicts a Vulnerability debuff (that stacks) if not facing the mob. These will happen simultaneously: when one add uses Gaze, the other uses Eye. And so on. Any ideas?"

Changed some skill tooltips and added alternative names to *Quake* and *Tornado* for those who feel RDM shouldn't have access to those spells. Fixed typos. Always thought of RDM as a healer/dps hybrid? Well scratch that thought because my ideal version of RDM is a caster/melee hybrid dps. Not convinced? Lets go straight to the breakdown. **General Info** Primary stat: INT Weapon: Rapier or Spell Sabre Equipment Type: Casting Job Outline: caster/melee stances, MP/TP management, high risk high reward, unique DoT-&gt;Finisher combo **Basic Skills** *Sabre Stance* (*SbS*)- Switches the users INT and STR, removes cast times, and enables positional bonuses.

Has a medium cooldown. *Flame/Flame Strike*- The first step in RDMs 1-2-3 combo. *Frost/Frost Strike*- The second step in RDMs 1-2-3 combo. ~~*SbS* bonus: Additional potency when attacking from the flank.~~ removed. *Spark/Spark Strike*- One of the final steps in RDMs 1-2-3 combo. *SbS* bonus: Additional potency when attacking from the ~~rear~~ flank. **New** *Aqua/Aqua Strike*- One of the final steps in RDM's 1-2-3 combo. Drenches the target, applying a debuff that increases vulnerability to lightning aspected damage done by the user for a short duration. *SbS* bonus: Additional potency when attacking from the rear and front. *Blaze/Blaze Slash*- Deals initial damage and applies the *Ablaze* debuff. The debuff will do damage over time on its target. *Ignite*- When activated, targets with the *Ablaze* debuff will explode, removing the debuff and dealing damage to the target and enemies near it. The damage dealt is inversely proportional to the amount of time remaining on the debuff. (less time = higher damage). Enemies cannot be hit by more than one explosion in a single cast. This skills range is unaffected by *SbS*. *Quake* (Alt. name *Tremor*)- The user thrusts his sword into the ground, rupturing the earth and dealing damage to enemies around him. RDMs basic AOE attack. This skills range is unaffected by *SbS*. *Tornado* (Alt. name *Cyclone*)- The user raises his sword towards the sky and summons a storm of wind in a designated area, dealing damage over time to any enemies who enter. This skills range is unaffected by *SbS*. *Bravega*- An ability with a long recast time that increases the partys STR and DEX for a short duration.

Shares a recast timer with *Bravega*. *Blink*- Instantly move to a selected allys position. In *SbS*: Instantly move to a selected enemys position. Has a short recast time. **New** *Dualcast*- Skills will strike twice for a short duration but will have their MP/TP cost doubled. This ability does not apply to DoT skills. Has a long recast time. **New** *Haste*- Grants an attack speed buff to the user. Has a medium recast time. **New** *Refresh*- Instantly restores a percentage of the user's MP. In *SbS*: Restores TP instead of MP. Has a long recast time. **Play Style Explanation** RDM is a caster dps with a melee stance that relies on a basic 1-2-3 combo while also executing the *Blaze*-&gt;*Ignite* combo and keeping the Aqua debuff up. A master RDM will be able to maximize dps by determining which stance is better suited for specific phases in a boss fight while also carefully managing his MP and TP. By default, skills will have a cast time and can be used at range unless stated otherwise. This is basically the 'caster stance' with far range, better survivability, lower mobility, and lower damage. In *Sabre Stance* all affected skills will have their cast times removed, ranged reduced and positional bonuses enabled unless stated otherwise. Additionally, MP regen will be doubled and TP regen will cease. This is the 'melee stance' with short range, less survivability, higher mobility, and higher damage. RDM promotes a high risk, high reward type of play style with *Sabre Stance* and the *Blaze* &amp; *Ignite* combo. Maximizing *SbS* uptime is essential to deal as much damage as possible; however a player cannot stay in one stance indefinitely due to MP/TP limits. Players will eventually have to switch stances sometime during a fight since the caster stance lacks a reliable MP regen ability while *Sabre Stance* halts TP regen. Also, *Sabre Stance* will go on a cooldown when it is turned both on and off, forcing players to commit to a stance during the cooldown time. A very basic rotation would be something like: Keep *Tornado* up. Keep *Ablaze* up. Use *Ignite* just as *Ablaze* is about to wear off. Use the 1-2-3 combo, switching Spark with Aqua to refresh the Aqua debuff (and hit positionals in *SbS*). In AOE situations utilize *Tornado*, *Quake*, and *Ignite*. *Bravega* and *Faithga* are there to give RDM a form of party utility. *Blink* is used to quickly transition between melee and ranged when switching stances. *Dualcast* was added to give RDM a duration of burst for openers and burn phases. It is a very strong skill that is offset by its large resource cost. Using *Dualcast* would force players to switch stances earlier than usual, putting additional stress on MP/TP management and expanding on the high risk high reward playstyle. *Haste* is especially potent when combined with *Dualcast* but also increases the risk of running out resources. Outside of *Dualcast* it's a straight up DPS increase and adds a bit of mobility to caster stance with shorter cast times. *Refresh* is a necessary addition with the inclusion of *Dualcast* and *Haste* to give RDM some breathing room with resource management. It has a very long cooldown so it should be saved for situations where you might be low on both MP &amp; TP from poor management. It can also be used to extend your time in a specific stance. So what do you think of my version of RDM? Leave your thoughts and criticisms below. "
148,vulnerability,ffxiv,Did You Know...? -- Dungeon Edition,294,4igqee,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4igqee/did_you_know_dungeon_edition/,2016-05-09 08:38:46,"I love this game, and I take pride in learning everything about all of the content that I play. Over the years I've figured out numerous little things that I don't think most people know or understand. Of course, many players will know some of these things already. Some may even know most. But I can't imagine that more than a couple of people know every last one of these. So I'm hoping that by posting this, I can fascinate at least some people. I've tried to eliminate things that seem too ""duh"" (e.g. the stack and stun during Cure IV and Cure III in Lost City Hard, or ""you can burn the first boss of Sastasha normal, and the adds won't spawn""), but obviously that is a very subjective matter. I have no idea if this is something that people will enjoy, or if it will be ignored, but I've wanted to do this for a long time, so I thought I'd share. Also, I made this from scratch before posting, so I have no idea if I'm forgetting to put anything especially interesting. If for some reason people actually like this, perhaps I will make another post about 8- and 24-man raids and trials. &amp;nbsp; **** &amp;nbsp; Did you know that in... **Haukke Manor (Normal)**: * ... you can use Monk's Arm of the Destroyer in the first and final bosses to silence Void Fire II, Void Fire III, and Void Thunder III, generating large amounts of extra limit break? * ... the tank can run through the final boss when she's casting Void Fire III and Void Thunder III, and the attacks will interrupt and deal no damage? This applies in other fights as well, such as the first boss of Amdapor Keep, but does not in others such as the last boss of Haukke Manor (Hard). **Brayflox's Longstop**: * ... in the final boss fight, if you're in melee range (including tank), you can run a few steps away as soon as you see it turn and start to cast Toxic Vomit, and it won't land under the boss? **The Sunken Temple of Qarn (Normal)**: * ... if you're about to get hit by a Final Sting and won't survive, and your stun isn't ready, you can run around a nearby corner to break its line of sight and interrupt it? * ... when the first boss casts Mortal Ray, you can stun (or pacify) it and prevent Doom? The stun can be done any time between when the ""begins to growl"" message appears and when Mortal Ray finishes casting. * ... if everyone wants to get done with the dungeon as fast as possible, you can save time by completely skipping the room with two Avoirdupois (face statues) and two panels/doors? The Avoirdupois will reset, and when you reach the final boss door, simply fail the switch. You'll fight 3 enemies, but you'll have skipped 7. * ... on the second boss, Summoners and Scholars are able to Bane their full-strength dots from the Guardian Soulstone over to the Temple Guardian? Even though he has Vulnerability Down, the dots Bane at full strength. * ... the second boss can be stunned if you target the Temple Guardian? This works particularly well on Obliterate (the room-wide AOE), but can also be used when he tries to chase and punch someone. * ... if the final boss targets you for Paralyze, you can step through him to break his line of sight? **Cutter's Cry**: * ... in the final boss, it's possible to avoid The Dragon's Voice by being far away? Standing at maximum attack range, and then stepping backwards during the attack can prevent plenty of movement as a ranged job. * ... in the final boss, Cacophony (the big blue ball) can be dodged by letting it get close to you for a moment, and then stepping away? **The Stone Vigil**: * ... in the first boss, Swinge is a large cone and can be avoided by side-stepping, and there is no need for ranged jobs to follow the boss all the way to the wall? * ... in the first boss (though it's incredibly dangerous to do, and should not be attempted with melee DPS or if anyone is standing near you) The Lion's Breath can be avoided by the tank? If you master the timing of it, you can sidestep it. Same goes for Frost Breath in the final boss. (If you try this and mess up, you can easily wipe the party. :'D) * ... in the second boss, Typhoons will always aim towards where party members were standing, and then curve towards cannons if nearby? This means that when you tank the boss in the doorway, they will almost always land on cannons. Tanking on a side wall, or tanking where it spawns and having the tank operate the cannons quickly between attacks, can prevent this completely. **Dzemael Darkhold**: (edit: I wasn't planning to edit my post to include suggestions left in comments, but this is pretty much one of favorite tricks in the entire game, and I can't believe I forgot to post it.) * ... ""after the second boss, with the magitek circles inside the crystal aoe, if you time it right you can step out of the aoe and back into the circle before the circle resets. This can allow you to break the locks mid-fight without killing yourself."" -- /u/ChromaticBadger **The Keeper of the Lake**: * ... the annoying alarm noise (also found in Castrum Meridanium) can be stopped by muting Ambient Sounds in your system settings? **The Aery**: * ... in the first boss, players can pass the Prey tether? An eager healer or ranged can take care of this mechanic for their melee friends. * ... in the second boss, the mustard gas adds self-destruct shortly after reaching 4 stacks? A skilled DPS or healer can damage them to low health and then let them live until 3 stacks or shortly after 4 stacks, while everyone else stays on the boss. * ... the Diresaur trash enemy (and other monsters that look like him) features telegraphed but unmarked/uncasted AOEs that you can dodge? **The Vault**: * ... when the Vault Deacon trash enemies cast Fire II, you can stun and silence them for large amounts of limit break? Horror Eye from the Gargoyles later can be stunned for limit break as well, especially so by a Paladin. * ... in the first boss, Paladins can cover the Holy Shield Bash target to prevent them from being stunned? * ... in the second boss, the line AOE that creates the portals along the edge always targets a player, and thus if you stand with your back to an existing portal, they will stack? Either way, you can simply sidestep during Faith Unmoving, and there is no need to cover the arena with portals or stand dangerously near the tank. **The Fractal Continuum**: * ... that whole [minotaur thing](URL with Disorienting Groan and the cages? **The Antitower**: * ... in the second boss, the Stardust adds only deal light damage and have no additional mechanic? A skilled healer can top off and/or shield the party when Stardusts are out, and they shouldn't die even if struck by 3 (and in most cases, 4) at once. * ... in the second boss, for the second set of tethers, if you run through the Stardust right as he fires his second laser, he'll ""fly to the same side of the arena as you"", which is the side he's already on and hardly move? * ... the final boss doesn't ever cleave, and as long as the gaze attack is dodged, it's safe to turn the boss towards the black mage's Ley Lines for example? **The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)**: * ... the Wamouras that spawn from damaging the Unfortunate Eggs (walls) spawn with the full enmity table of the eggs? As tank, you can save yourself trouble by ensuring that you have the highest amount of enmity on them. &amp;nbsp; (Lastly, here's a shout out to /u/adiostoreadon for talking about this kind of stuff with me ages ago. Sorry that we never got together to work on this!)"
149,vulnerability,ffxiv,Logged in for the free login campaign and had a really epic shiva run,3,4cahy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4cahy2/logged_in_for_the_free_login_campaign_and_had_a/,2016-03-29 02:02:52,"I stopped playing FFXIV before heavensward came out due to personal reasons but one of my friends who still plays it told me about this free login campaign. It's a bit of a long strong but here it goes. I queued for my favorite fight of SHIVA EX as my White Mage (I've cleared it over 60 times so I knew the fight well) and got into a group of Japanese players as the only English player. I was surprised to see that there were bonus tomes and I felt a bit embarrassed because I was the only one among everyone who wasn't above level 50 but we dove right into the fight. I initially thought that everyone was experienced in the fight but to my surprise, I realized that quite a few of them were doing this fight for the 1st time (judging by the way they handled the mechanics) despite being overleveled. We wiped quite a few times during this fight to nearly all her mechanics. People were getting frozen in boulders, the tank with 8 stacks of vulnerability up thought it was a good idea to provoke, countless people fell to her wave of arrows (mainly the tanks and my co-healer) and I got a bit careless myself due to a bit of stress. However, no one left or gave up even after 30 minutes. I was quite surprised. They were slowly learning the mechanics more but alot of the same mistakes were seen such as not moving to the correct spots during hailstorm and icicle impact . During our clear run, one of the tanks died to arrows and my co-healer got bouldered as he panicked and died as a result. I used everything in my arsenal to keep the tank and myself (along with the only surviving bard) alive and eventually I was finally able to hit LB3 and restart the fight again. The 25% echo really helped in our clear run and the mount actually dropped at the end. Sadly, I rolled a 14 and missed it but it still felt like quite the epic fight. We struggled and forced our way to a clear. BTW : I got to say that the community is still as friendly as ever. Someone invited me to join their FC while I was walking around and despite declining because I was only going to be in for a few days, he was really nice about it. "
150,vulnerability,ffxiv,"To this subreddit, thank you.",66,4ct5ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4ct5ve/to_this_subreddit_thank_you/,2016-04-01 12:20:17,"Some of you may or may not have seen [this thread](URL that I posted a rough month ago. It took a lot to put myself out into the public part of the subreddit, especially when my throw away account's post was filtered out so, I was a bit in the open bring my pain and vulnerability into the internet. None the less I want to take the time to return to the fold and post here to thank those of you who gave advice, encouraged me and took the time to assure me that things would be alright and offer to talk to me if needed regardless of what server I was on. The support was overwhelming and it was a crucial first step on the path to being happy again and I suggest looking at most of the comments in the above thread. A lot of you told me to pursue a new FC, Linkshells and make new friends, others advised moving from Balmung, changing my name and changing my character, which I understood the reason for and I contemplated it, but with some, light debating between users in the comments section, it was clear that action in hindsight? Was too kind of those who had shunned me to feel like they impacted me enough to re-identify myself, spend money just to hide when really? The most powerful statement isn't to vanish but to stand proud and show how happy I am without them. But the advice, regardless if I carried through or not was still appreciated as the intent was to better my mental health and my love for Final Fantasy XIV. When something like that happens? It's daunting to continue alone but with perseverance, it's not as hard as it seems. Finding new friends? It was a concept I never thought I could really achieve in a small amount of time but I did and It was as simple as /tell'ing someone and just talking. I met one person in particular who has helped me immensely rekindle my happiness and has become a close friend and all I did was just open with ""Hello!"". So if you ever feel alone or you feel like you have no one to talk to? Just stop and find someone and just say hello, it may get you no where or find your next best friend. If you're sad or emotionally distraught, it's always good to talk to someone, any one. Don't let the past darken your future, your happiness is important, take care of it and take the steps you need to make sure it continues. Also, I implore you, if you find yourself alone that you should contemplate reaching out to friends who you lost touch with or have been distant from and try and rebuild those friendships, chance are they'll want to. You can never be truly alone, especially in a game like this. Some people prefer seclusion, others are terrified of it, none the less, whether it be here, in game or in the real world? There are people out there waiting to meet you and be your friend so just follow the advice that so many people took to give me and find them; Linkshells, FC's, a /tell to a friendly face, all can go a long way. So long story short, thank you /r/FFXIV for helping me find my happiness again."
151,vulnerability,ffxiv,I know it's a way off but what I want for 4.0,0,4e2d89,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4e2d89/i_know_its_a_way_off_but_what_i_want_for_40/,2016-04-10 04:23:24,"This is going to be a very long post. These are just my thoughts, nobody else's. Let me know what you would like to see in 4.0. --- #More Cross-Class Slots + 3rd Class to Cross-Class From I've mentioned this to people before but I always thought Ninja should have had Archer instead of Pugilist as cross-class. This does mean that we lose out on Internal Release and Second Wind but we would gain Hawk's Eye, Raging Strikes and Quelling strikes. Since this is clearly not going to change, in 4.0, I would like to see all jobs get 2 more cross-class slots (to total 7) and be able to cross-class from one more class. I've even thought about what each job would gain: **Ninja, Monk, Dragoon:** Archer. Hawk's Eye and Raging Strikes would improve NIN DPS by a lot. This would also help the tanks keep enmity due to Shadewalker. The extra enmity from Hawk's Eye and Raging Strikes would just pass to the tank. For DRG and MNK, it's simply for the Raging (and Quelling) Strikes for extra damage. **Bard:** Marauder. Mainly because the cross-class abilities available from Rogue are not great. MRD would give them Mercy Stroke and Bloodbath. **Black Mage, Summoner:** Conjurer. Aero would be another useful DoT for SMN. Not so useful for BLM but as an instant cast, it's something to put up when you need to move if you don't have a Thundercloud or Firestarter proc. Also provides another source for Protect and Stoneskin. Raise on BLM wouldn't be castable in battle, just like it isn't for PLD. **White Mage, Scholar:** Archer. Quelling strikes to help the reduction of enmity. Raging strikes to also help with DPS but also Hawk's Eye for the guaranteed hits because healer accuracy... **Paladin, Dark Knight:** Pugilist. Internal Release and Second Wind. **Warrior:** Lancer. This has the potential to make WAR very OP due to Invigorate though so that might have to be an excluded ability from cross-class (like Goad is excluded for all casters and archer). This does mean WAR can use Blood for Blood which, as a tank, would not be smart since you take 25% more damage *but* would be great when in the OT role for the extra damage done. **Astrologian:** Arcanist. Since it's the only healer without access to Virus and Eye for an Eye. **Machinist:** Pugilist. Since it's missing Internal Release. --- #New Jobs There's been a lot of discussion already about Samurai and Red Mage with a little bit of Blue Mage. Most of us seem to be in agreement that Samurai should be a DPS and not a tank. I also agree with this *but* I can see it as a tank too. If we assume that there will be 1 tank, 1 DPS and 1 healer in the new patch, that would mean one of the colour mages needs to be a healer and one a tank. This poses a problem to me because I cannot see Blue Mage being a healer or tank. I can however see Red Mage be either. Here's how I can see the jobs working: **Samurai as a DPS:** As already mentioned, this is what most people seem to want SAM to be, myself included. It would equip an odachi as it's weapon. SAM would cross-class from LNC and PUG. I would see SAM being based around getting as much critical hits as possible having various cooldown which increase their own crit rate or the damage they do with critical hits. Maybe even having one which guarantees crits for the next 10s or so. Another possibility being having lots of abilities which proc whenever a critical hit occurs. I would also think that they would have an ability like Mercy Stroke and Assassinate which can only be used when the enemy is below 20% HP. For SAM, that would be Shin-Zantentsuken. **Samurai as a tank:** We all know how tanks work so I'll just touch on some of it's cooldowns. It's ""invincible"" cooldown would be in a similar vein to Holmgang in that it would stop HP dropping below 1 and holding the enemy in place however, instead of doing just that, for the duration it is active the SAM cannot use any other abilities. During this time, all damage taken is stored in to a charged attack. While the ability is active, it can be used again to unleash all the damage they stored on to the enemy but at the cost of 40-50% of their max HP. This does mean that before they can use it, a healer will need to heal them up. If they don't, using that will cause them to suicide. **Blue Mage:** This would be a DPS. I cannot see it working any other way, at least not well. It would use a Scimitar as its weapon. BLU would effectively play as a mele ACN in that it revolves around damage with DoT's over anything else. It would have a basic 1-2-3 damage rotation of which its DoT's would be applied at different stages. It would have a stand alone DoT (like Mutilate, Fracture, Touch of Death), one that branches from the first attack (like Shadow Fang) and a third that comes from the second in the combo. It's job quests would be what grants it the various blue magic. All the blue magic would be oGCD. It's level 30 one would be the classic and basic Goblin Punch which does an attack with a randomised potency from a range as small as 50 to as high as 400. At 35, it could game Self Destruct which does an AoE attack at the cost of 20% of the BLU's HP. This would likely share a recast timer with Goblin Punch. One of its later abilities (probably its lvl 60) would be Bad Breath. This would be a conal attack in front of the BLU which would apply all of the BLU's DoT's and lots of debuffs including (but not necessarily limited to) Paralysis, Silence, Damage Down, Vulnerability Up, Physical Vulnerability Up, Magic Vulnerability Up, Heavy and Slow. Enemies which are immune to the status effects will obviously not be affected by them. **Red Mage as a tank:** As RDM is classically known as that all-rounder that can equip a large variety of weapons, I think it should have a shield but instead of a sword like GLA/PLD, it would have either a mace or flail as its main weapon. This would deal blunt damage. As far as I'm aware, we currently only have one job that can do blunt damage and that is MNK (excluding mage auto-attacks, that is). RDM would cross-class from GLA (since Provoke is a must for tanks) and THM. The reason why I say THM is because, being a mage, magic is going to be a thing. One of RDM's abilities would be Drain. It would be a casted spell but at a length too long to fit between a normal enemy's auto-attacks, meaning that it will almost always be interrupted. This is where Swiftcast/Surecast would come in. Drain itself would be a GCD and cost MP to cast but since it has a long cast time, it would be very easily interrupted. RDM would have some short-cast magicks too which can be fit between enemy GCD's. For example, they would have their own version of Clemency as one of their own self heals. RDM's tank stance would also be unique. Unlike DRK and PLD whose tank stance reduces the damage received or WAR's which increases their HP and the healing they receive, RDM's would make their attack have an HP drain ability. It would effectively be a constantly active Bloodbath (maybe a bit more potent to account for the lack of defence/HP increase). It could also get a DPS stance which simply increases the damage done. RDM's ""invincible"" attack would cause all damage taken for a period of time to deplete their MP instead of HP. **Red Mage as a healer:** As a healer, RDM would be unique in that it's DPS would come from physical attacks and expending TP instead of MP. It would have an ability similar to Cleric Stance but instead of switching MND with INT, it would switch MND with STR. Just like AST, it would cross-class form CNJ and THM. RDM could also have en- abilities which have similar (or possible simply the same) effects as the AST cards with each element doing the same as the element the AST cards represent. Being a physical mele damage dealer, it would have a basic 1-2-3 combo for its attacks. --- #New PvP mode Not much to say here. The thing that happened at the end of the 3.2 story. --- Those are a few of my ideas for 4.0. Let me know what yours are."
152,vulnerability,ffxiv,[Rant] Why do players new to Heavensward recently act like they know everything?,0,4fsuqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4fsuqr/rant_why_do_players_new_to_heavensward_recently/,2016-04-21 23:04:01,"Disclaimer: Yes, this is a rant post and yes I got tilted deliberately. Summary: I ran the lvl 55 dungeon to level up my class/job when suddenly I run into this tank. Everything went fine until the second boss, you know, the boss that drops poison and the add eats it. Tank misunderstood the fight, i told him how it really works, he gets defensive and insults. I'm playing since 2.3, have most classes on 60 and of course I know my shit. When I tried to explain the guy the boss, he got overly defensive and insisted that his knowledge of the fight was correct. So of course we all know that the boss is dropping the poison on the ground and, if you run into it, you get a dot which cannot be cleansed by the healer. The tank thought that the ADD was causing this to happen even though the best way for newcomers to handle the boss is to let the add eat the poison so the Boss deals less damage and then kill it at 3 or 4 stacks when the vulnerability is high. This is not the subject of this post, but the rant originates from here. The tank REALLY got overly defensive and I deliberately took the bait. We argued over the course of the way to the next and last boss where I told him that I have no intention to lie whatsoever and that he could believe me. He then continued to provoke and run the mobs into me nearly killing me and also intentionally wiping the boss (not going into the bubble, dieing to the ultimate and the healer getting aggro, killed in the process while the tank got rezzed). I initiated a kickvote, which was denied because he was there with his premade friend, stood afk for 5 minutes until I was the one who got kicked from the instance, unjustified. A report has already been filed by me and this post is also made to let some steam off. Yes, I didn't do anything to deescalate the situation and didn't just ignore that guy, but seriously, I don't see the point in letting someone go with false information and spreading it accros even newer players. I don't want advice on how to deal with this, I just want to know why people can't take advice from obviously more experienced players. Isn't this what the novice network is all about? /rant off"
153,vulnerability,ffxiv,A5S Mini Guide + different PoVs:,34,47l09m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/47l09m/a5s_mini_guide_different_povs/,2016-02-26 07:00:21,"Now that the fight has been out a few days and dozens of groups have cleared it here is a mini guide to help groups progressing that don't feel like figuring things out themselves. The fight is mainly mechanics with a very lenient enrage (A little after 9 minutes is a cast shock therapy that will instakill the raid). Here is the mechanics in order and how my group delt with each. Not sure the best way to divide it so I'll just do it into sections of 4-5 mechanics: **Pull through first Birds** As soon as you pull the boss he grows in size and gains a defense buff. After a few GCDs he will start swipping the MT and applying headache stacks (reduces your damage). At the 4th stack the headache stacks will go away and be replaced with a 10(?)ish second stun debuff. After this he will do 1 of 2 mechanics. He will either target the MT with an aoe that needs to be soaked by the party (like dragon's rage in Thordan), or he will start waving his weapon and do a tank buster (Needs heavy mitigation + it will knock you back). If the OT does not provoke and take aggro quickly enough then the aoe might end up on the stunned tank which will kill them regardless of mitigation. Another thing to note is that the first one is 50/50 which mechanic will happen but after that it rotates. So if you get the aoe the next time in the fight it will be the tank buster and vice versa. Shortly after that he will mark someone with an icon and a prey debuff (you can skip this part and push to the next phase if you get him to 90%). After a short time he will charge at this person. The person takes damage based on how close to the boss they were, so the person with the mark wants to run away from the boss asap and the party needs to make sure to not be in the way of the charge or they will die. If the charge does any damage to the person it will give them a strong vulnerability debuff. Staying far enough away will make it do 0 damage but applying adlo/ss can also prevent any damage. Next the boss shrinks back down to normal. After this he will target 2 players (one and then the other) with icons and after a short time lay a large circle poison aoe where they were standing. You don't want these on the party, in the middle, or on around the green puddle area in the North. After the second aoe drops 2 snakes will spawn in the NE and the SE. These snakes cast a poison debuff on a random target. They can also be stunned and burned down to help prevent more poison. You can also stun a cast they have (don't remember what it does if it goes off but it isn't too big of a problem). Anyone that gets poisoned needs to run into the green puddle in the north to remove it or they will die. To activate any of the 4 puddles you need someone to stand in the middle circle (we have our healers do it). Around this time you need one designated gorilla person (I recommend having a healer do it to not waste dps) to run into the red puddle in the East. Shortly after the snakes die the boss has a cast that drops a spiked bomb in one of the corners and then 2 smooth bombs in the middle. The spiked bomb explodes only out of its two sides towards two corners it is adjacent too. The smooth bombs are a very large circular aoe. To deal with this you have the party move to the corner diagonally across from the spiked bomb then have your gorilla person punch the smooth bombs into the same corner as the spiked bomb. Be sure you are far enough in the corner so that the smooth bombs aoe doesn't hit you. After this the boss will grow again and start casting ""Boost"". Just like in NM you will need to activate the puddles from the center and then enter the purple puddle to the West. You will need to take 2 tics and activate the center twice to turn your whole party into birds. The difference between NM and Savage is that while you are birds and he is stomping the ground there will be spiked bomb patterns to dodge. This first one is pretty easy. One will drop in a random corner. After that another will drop in the corner opposite and 2 more will drop between them. Your party will need to position behind the first one to drop (not too close!) and after it explodes run into the corner it occupied and wait for the other to explode and the bosses boost pounds to stop. After this you can click off the bird to become normal. ___________________________________________________ **Prey/hook through second Birds** Next the boss will put prey on a random target and charge at them again. Handle this just like you did the first one. The only difference is that after he will face one random party member and cast ""gobhook"". To avoid this mechanic you have to be behind him as it is a 180 degree cleave that will one shot anyone. So basically as soon as he charges at the prey person you need to run towards him and quickly get behind him as he casts gobhook. After gobhook he will begin applying the headache stacks to the MT like in first phase. At the 4th when the stun is applied he will then do either the party soak aoe or the tank buster depending on which he did in the first phase (if he started with the aoe then the buster is here. and vice versa). Next the boss will shrink yet again and an golden goblin lion thing will spawn in the SW corner. A tether will appear between him and a dps/healer. He will ignore aggro and chase this person until you get rid of the tether. To do this you activate the puddles and have the tethered person run into the invisibility granting blue puddle in the South. After this have the tank grab aggro on it and burn it down. Afterwards the boss will cast the 2 poison ground aoes like at the beginning of the fight. Be careful because if you aren't quick on killing the goblion add you will get the aoe icons while you are still trying to kill it. This time you want the poison ground aoes on the sides of the arena. After the add is killed and the ground poison aoes are placed have your gorilla person go gorilla. A spiked bomb will drop into a random corner and two smooth bombs drop into the middle. Have your gorilla knock the smooth bombs into the corner OPPOSITE of the spiked bomb (they will detonate after it does). Have the party run towards the spiked bomb and sit outside of it, then take the bombs place once it blows up just like you did during the boost/birds. After this you can get some decent dps in on the boss as he casts several shock therapys (aoe raid damage). He will then grow again and start casting boost. As before your party will all need to go birds and just like before there will be a bomb pattern. This bomb pattern is random everytime but will always consist of 3 spiked bombs. The best way to find the safe spot for these is to think of the arena as a 4x4 grid and know that the bombs will only explode straight up and down and straight left and right. We just marked the person that was best at finding the safe spot and followed him as a group and tried our best to call it out. Like before the bombs will explode, the boost will stop, and you can unbird yourself! __________________________________________________ **Double prey/aoe through enrage** Next the boss will cast a single prey and the party soak aoe at the same time. Shortly after another prey target will appear. After the party aoe goes off he will dash at the first prey target and then the second shortly after. To manage this we had him in a corner and as soon as the first prey target came out we had them run to the adjecent corner as the party stacked on the bosses sides closest to the other adjacent corner pointing away form where the prey target went. After the aoe goes off and the boss dashes we have the second prey target (who was stacked with the group for the aoe) run into the vacant spot where the boss dashed from and the party makes sure to back off a bit so they won't get hit by the return dash to the second prey. After the second prey the boss will cast Gobhook again so be sure to quickly get behind him. After this he will start applying headache stacks to the MT and then do the buster/aoe depending on which one happened last. *Before I do the last adds phases I need to talk about the debuff you get everytime you step into a puddle. If you notice you get a red debuff that last 3 minutes for the first, 2 for the second ,and 1 every time after that. This is important to note because after this point anytime this debuff runs out you will get poisoned and take massive DoT dmg and die. So this is something your group will want to keep track of during the last phase. To help deal with this you will notice that my group all refreshes our timer by stepping into the green puddle and getting a regen before the adds spawn* Shortly after the tank buster or aoe the boss will shrink to normal size and 8 adds will spawn. 2 goblins in the SE and SW corner circles, a large Minotaur creature in the NW corner, and 5 small pack rats in teh NE corner. This may seem intimidating at first but its very simple to deal with. All the adds can be killed at this time besides the Minotaur who will need to be tanked by the OT. What my group does is have the MT pick up the 5 pack rats and drag them to a goblin in the SE. About 5-6 seconds after all these adds spawn the 2 goblins will cast an ability that is exactly like petrifaction from T7. All you have to do is pay attention to their cast bars or watch for their eyes to glow red. These can be staggered quite a bit so don't turn quickly after the first just to get stoned and killed by the second. After the petrifaction mechanic goes off from both goblins and your tank is positioned on top of one of the goblins have your caster or brd/mch LB3 both goblins, the boss, and the pack rats. This will instantly kill everything besides the boss. This trivializes the phase and makes it so that all of your dps minus the one doing the lb can entirely focus on dodging the petrifaction and dpsing the boss. After all of these adds die another 3 pack rats will spawn in the NW corner near where the Minotaur spawned. The large Minotaur add needs to have been pulled into the NE corner where the 5 pack rats spawned (make sure to keep him away from ALL other adds as he will eat them, get a dmg up stack, bellow, and kill everyone). We just let the 3 new pack rats run to the healer, who is behind the boss, and then the warrior overpowers them. Burn them down quickly with aoe on the boss and focus all your dps on the boss. If your OT has the Minotaur in the NW corner at this point a snake (like the ones earlier in the fight) will spawn near him, the minotaur will eat it, it will get poison, and after 8 stacks it will die and your OT can come to dps the boss. If your DPS is good and you didn't have deaths you should be able to kill the boss at this point. If not another add will spawn in the SE corner. This add crits every hit so the OT will need to aggro him quickly and either living dead/holmgang/hallowed or use awarness, but most likely will need to do both staggered out. Burn this add quickly before your tank dies (the add doesn't have much HP). During this time the boss will grow and get defense up. After a while the boss will start giving the tank stacks and then do either the buster or stack mechanics, then he will shrink again. At this point your red debuffs are probably about to fall off so check them and refresh them in any of the 4 puddles quickly. Next another tethered gob lion will spawn in the same spot as before. Handle it just like before. Finally another set of bombs will spawn. This is like the 2nd set of bombs where you will need to stay near the spiked one, have your gorilla hit the other two the opposite direction, and run into the spiked ones place after it explodes. Finally the boss will enrage and cast shock therapy killing the party :) __________________________________________________ **POVS** WAR: URL WHM: URL SCH: URL DRK: URL I probably left out a lot and I'm sure I'm not 100% correct on everything so feel free to ask/fill me in!

154,vulnerability,ffxiv,A couple of A8N tanking questions,2,48uojc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/48uojc/a_couple_of_a8n_tanking_questions/,2016-03-04 10:40:24,"So, I have beaten A8N a few times now, but I have noticed a couple of things other tanks do during phase 1. First of all, I have noticed that the OT will try to provoke the boss off me at the tank buster part. I can only think of a couple reasons for doing this, (1) I have noticed that you can get a stack of magic vulnerability at this part and (2) maybe they do it so that they can use their fresh CDs after you have used yours for the first tank buster. However, this doesn't seem to really be necessary since I have enough CDs (playing PLD) that I can pop a couple each time. Also, with clemency and stoneskin I don't seem to have any issues with staying alive. Any other reason for a tank swap here? Also, a couple of people the first few days after the patch were saying that the tanks should stack during the tank buster of phase 1 to spread the damage. However, I can't tell if it does, or if it will just hit multiple targets like a cleave. Double rocket punch in the last phase obviously does spread, though. Thanks in advance. EDIT: Ok, thanks for all the answers. The one fact that I was missing is that the missiles do magic damage. Without knowing that fact, swapping just didn't make sense to me. The couple of guides I was looking at didn't say anything about this, and I didn't realize from just doing the fight a few times that it was magic damage. Of course, the magic debuff makes much more sense now. I wanted to ask the question to get a little more insight into the fight, which I always hesitate to do because people tend to give answers in an angry tone / downvote people for not knowing things."

We all recognize the need to refresh Goblixer Overgulp when our debuff begins to get close to zero, but this is not a problem as we're near-to killing the boss before we have any need to refresh (save for maybe one of our healers who is on Ape duty). During the phase in which adds show up (Minotaur, Yorn Pigs, Gobledygawkers) we eventually use a mage LB3 to instantly kill the first wave of pigs and the two Gobledygawkers in one go. Problem is, as soon as that LB3 hits, everyone save for the off-tank (who is dealing with the Minotaur at the other corner) suddenly gets varying stacks of ""Suppuration"" (healing down, vulnerability up). With this debuff, we're unable to brute-force it past the next marathon of Shock Therapies. We have -absolutely- no clue what causes this Suppuration. We're not getting hit by the puddles, we're not allowing the Minotaur to eat anything but the snake. We're not getting petrified... As far as we're concerned, we're doing all the mechanics correctly. Once again I reiterate that -none- of us are losing our Goblixer stacks. Many of us are getting this strange Suppuration debuff even when our Goblixer still has a minute left. Does -anybody- have any clue what causes this Suppuration debuff?"

Thank you very much. 1. Does it matter which healer going into green jail? I understand the one that got bombed will have magic vul but I can't find what type of DoT the poison gas is so I'm not sure if it's magic or physical or neutral. Will you take more damage going in with magic vulnerability? 2. Same as first question Does it matter which melee going in purple? Since Alarum is physical i assume any melee is fine but prefer the one with no electrocution debuff correct? Will there be any situation that sending bard/mch in would be better? Thank you again."
157,vulnerability,ffxiv,The Issue with DRK,19,4bov8g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/4bov8g/the_issue_with_drk/,2016-03-24 09:33:13,"*In the early hours of Monday morning on June 22nd 2015, I reached level 60 DRK after enjoying the main storyline and have stuck with it as my main job ever since. I have drawn upon my experience with it and compared it against my vast experience of having played the tank role for years, tackling the hardest content with WAR/PLD successfully in the 2.x series, WAR/PLD in 1.x, and PLD/WAR/NIN in FFXI. With the Feast bringing to light the shortcomings of DRK again, I think it is a good time to bring the issues with DRK up once more. DRK needs serious attention that extends further than PVP because the challenging aspect of it is not rewarding.* #Part I: Establishing the Problem ##DRKs Identity DRKs identity should encompass: High DPS, Magic, and Parry (according to Yoshi-P), but their DPS is marginal, their magic contribution is minimized, and their parrying ability pales in comparison to other tanks. Instead, let us establish DRKs true, current identity. ###1. Living Pain in the Ass Let us begin with Living Dead. Having raided with countless serious raiders and other groups, I am well aware that some believe it is perfectly fine, and some of these players are even healers. These healers are almost exclusively WHM, and AST to a lesser extent. They always have one thing in common, and that is a strong sense of confidence in their abilities. Should an ultimate tank move really require that sense of confidence to deal with? Most WHMs will say, &gt;&gt;I can just Benediction and its no problem. **Was Living Dead really designed around the idea of forcing Benediction to be saved exclusively for it?** I expect certain abilities to exhibit benefits when paired with others, but I do not expect that level of pairing for an ultimate tank move. With the new HP change from the VIT buff, Living Dead has become an even greater concern, and more than ever, it requires the kind of strategic planning that is normally only reserved for Limit Break. The ability does not even give the full 10 seconds due to the fact that being cleansed of the ability with 0 seconds remaining becomes a death wish. Something needs to be done. ###2. The Button Smasher DRK does have the potential to put out the highest DPS while main tanking due to Low Blow, but the difference is marginal and hardly worth the effort considering PLDs buff has now propelled them back into the spotlight. DRK has 9 oGCDs it must use directly pertaining to DPS, 10 during most encounters to ensure optimal DPS, not counting Dark Dance, which could arguably be considered a DPS related oGCD similar to how Raw Intuition and Vengeance are used, bumping up the total by 1. Furthermore, the average cooldown of all these comes to 33.9 seconds, not counting Sole Survivor. We have to adjust this of course because Dark Arts is not used on cooldown, so if we give a generous approximation of 15 seconds, it brings the average to 35 seconds. Compare this to WARs 7 oGCDs (*I believe its fair to have omitted Mercy Stroke from all 3 jobs totals as I did with Soul Survivor*) with an average 80 seconds and PLDs 4 with an average of 40 seconds and the fact that PLDs DoT is in one of their combos, unlike WAR and DRK. Now what does this even mean? It means DRK presses an extra button, on average, once every 3.9 seconds; War, once every 11.42 seconds; PLD, once every 10 seconds. It may not sound like a lot, but it means a relatively decent **DRK is working 2.9x harder than a comparable WAR and 2.5x harder than a comparable PLD just in the number of buttons being pressed.** Finally, remember that DRKs Low Blow has a chance to reset, increasing that number of buttons pressed with each occurrence. It becomes clear that DRK should be getting some kind of large advantage to balance this effort, right? Wrong, apparently. Its merely eating the short end of the stick. ###3. Administer of Medium Punishment Now to make things more complicated, DRKs skill floor rises quickly as the player tries to raise their skill ceiling. What this means is that the more a DRK tries to press all these buttons flawlessly, weaving stance dancing in and other advanced techniques, they brush dangerously close with essentially not having enough MP to bring Grit back up and using Dark Arts on important abilities like Dark Mind. What does DRK actually get in return for all this? About 3-5% more DPS potential than PLD currently (not accounting for Low Blow resets), and less potential than WAR. Now there are some people, seemingly even on the dev team, that mistakenly believe DRK does more DPS than WAR perhaps due to certain parses uploaded to other websites. I am truly sorry to say, these people are wrong. WARs DPS is unsurpassed. You really cannot beat Berserk and Fell Cleave in a game where burst DPS is so important, and this is doubly true in PVP in comparison to PVE. Now, I love WAR. It was my main for a very long time and was doing things with it that a great portion of the community doubted I could back in 1.x and 2.x, and I even still main it for PVP. However, I believe **WAR has stolen part of what DRKs identity *should* be.** DRK is often associated with dealing out punishment to the wicked in large amounts, and Gaffgarion from Final Fantasy Tactics was a great example of this. When you saw him moving on the grid, you knew you were in for some punishment if he caught up to you, which was more often than not. WARs identity is not about highest DPS, not to upset the nation of happy WARs. It is a balanced fighter that brings party utility on the battlefield; it should be combining the DPS of DRK and the mitigation of PLD while also bringing their own unique utility, like Storms Path and Storms Eye as examples. I believe WAR is actually quite close if not already what it should be, but **DRK should be the *undisputed* DPS tank, not WAR.** One day, I believe WAR should get a Warcry ability to increase party DPS, further molding it into what I believe is its true identity. DRK as a concept however, has always encompassed the idea of *high-risk, high-reward,* but it currently lacks the reward by having lower DPS than WAR and lower mitigation than both tanks, except for that one ability, Dark Mind. **DRK has effectively become *high-risk, Dark Mind*.** It is no wonder that I find myself without many peers, instead surrounded by a sea of new and upcoming casual players with great dreams of becoming an amazing DRK tank one day, unbeknownst to the fate in store when they inevitably give up and level something else after realizing the job is not what they hoped for. #Part II: Finding the Solution ###1. Plug for My Original Idea You can skip this part if you have a better idea, but what is my own suggestion for Living Dead? Get rid of it and make an ability that creates a clone of the DRK somehow. This could be a summoned voidsent, pure dark energy in the shape of the player, or even a zombie (*could even keep the name if so.*) This clone would take all enmity and debuffs from the DRK for a duration (6 seconds sounds fair) and auto-attack. When the duration is over, all enmity would be transferred back to the DRK, along with any debuffs, like vulnerability stacks, to prevent players from escaping tank mechanics. This clone could also be treated like a pet for cases like A4Ss quarantine. The DRK would not be immune to damage in anyway, and would still have to dodge cleaves, but this returns the skill of the ultimate tank ability back to DRK, which is the big glaring problem with Living Dead. In fact, the dev team has already started the work for it with the *Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)s* first boss, where I got the inspiration for this idea. Plus, it would look awesome, would it not? ###2. Remember the Golden Rule of Gaming In games, rewards should always match the effort. So, how do you deal with a problem of having too many necessary buttons? Either make them more useful, or remove the excess through redesign of the job. 3.x for DRK has felt like one big, never-ending Beta test. It is as if the development team had the idea, *lets make a tank equal to the other two, but harder to play,* and fell a little short of the equal part. Please consider letting Mage's Ballad affect our MP recovery so that we can slightly increase our DPS with more Dark Arts. **Give us the high-reward.** ###3. Reclaim DRKs identity DRKs identity is currently a joke. Everyone believes that somehow DRK can be decent and is capable of something, but most never even get to witness it. Instead they are presented with players who are simply labeled as bad for choosing to play an *edgy* job and not knowing how to do so. Victimized by the design team for making a job harder to play than it needs to be for what it does. As much as I would love to gloat over these players for succeeding where they have failed, the truth is that these players are willing to take up the role of tanking, which is something that the community always needs. While I am definitely one that would push to keep the difficulty present in DRK, I would love a lot more for my efforts than I am currently receiving. Lowering the DPS checks was a good move, and balancing our gear progression has been implemented beautifully. **Now that Savage content is not about DPS checks anymore, its time to return the benefit of having extra DPS to DRK**. #Conclusion: I think DRK needs some serious love by the dev team. I love the class, and I am thankful every day that Yoshida decided to make my dreams come true when he announced it would be a tank class. There are so many ways you could fix this job, and everyone has their own suggestions. There are going to be countless people that argue with me, but to them I shine the light to see if they actually play this job. Have they seen the pros and cons of it at every level since it came out, first hand? Did they stick with it in Gordias Savage? Are they currently tackling Midas Savage as it? The people who can say yes to everything are few and far between, and the reason is the job simply is not rewarding enough in practice. I personally think FFLogs is barely more than a big ego booster, especially in regards to tanks, but I can tell you right now that on there **as of this writing, there are 1237 recorded WARs who have cleared M1S, 725 PLDs, and do you know how many DRKs there are? ~~104~~ 601**. Granted, not everyone records their wins, my group included, so you can add at least 1 DRK to that number, but keeping all things equal, I would expect the true numbers to rather close to this sample size. (*This point has since been greatly reduced, but I think the fact that PLDs overtake DRKs numbers considerably after the first waves of progression have occurred still stands. Make of that what you will.*) Balance has been lost once again by trying to cater to DRK with content rather than giving it the attention it deserves. The job needs to recapture its identity of high damage output somehow, and Living Dead is becoming a bigger issue than before. The stage is perfectly set for perfect tank balance by having PLD bring extensive mitigation, DRK bringing the pain, and WAR combining both while adding balanced party utility. Im saddened that every patch, I eagerly await news of changes, only to be let down. I no longer expect any substantial work done to my main job until 4.0, but I still keep the hope alive. **Please keep the core identity of DRK in mind. Make it worthy of being called a magic-based tank involving high-risk, high-reward.** *TL;DR: Living Dead should be reworked and perfect tank balance could be achieved by having DRK be the offensive tank, PLD the defensive tank, and WAR the utility tank.* Thanks for reading. -Dylan Edit 1 - Apparently my numbers were wrong on the people who've cleared M1S. Not sure why I had 104 to be honest. Either way, thanks to /u/Jack_U for pointing it out. Edit 2 - Reworded TL;DR because I think it gave the wrong idea to some who literally did not read it. lol."
158,vulnerability,ffxiv,Opinion On: Completely Separate PVP Actions/Skills?,7,46nta8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/46nta8/opinion_on_completely_separate_pvp_actionsskills/,2016-02-20 11:54:43,"As it currently stands, I don't really enjoy FF's PVP because of the sheer amount of skills I need on my bar. All of my current skills + PVP skills is bloaty, and there isn't any sort of organized meta because current class toolkits aren't designed in mind for PVP whatsoever. While the thought of SE doing this is rather unlikely, how would you feel about: Your regular set of lvl1-60 skills not useable in PVP. Each class, in the context of a PVP match, have a designated set of maybe 6-10 new skills. Maybe 2-3 additional skills can be ""Cross-classed"" over from your regular skillset. These skillsets could be distilled versions of the regular skillset, giving each class their particular ""specialty"" within the context of PVP. * For example, a tank class might have a gapcloser, short CCs, a grab, vulnerability-up on enemies, vulnerability-down on self, etc, basically skills that allow it to soak up damage, peel for teammates, basic tank stuff. * A BLM might have a blink on medium cooldown, a binds, a spell that creates areas of aoe slows for a duration, faster casting of all spells for several seconds, or a spell that allows casting during movement for several seconds, making it a class that relies on kiting and range for an advantage. * A dragoon might have a charge move that can ""skewer"" a distance through multiple targets or double as an escape move, allowing it to quickly create distance between it and an enemy And so on, basically skills that put greater emphasis on player mobility and CC, etc. because a lot of pvp is centered around that. If you think, well, ""all these examples can be found in existing skills"", a lot of them function-wise could simply COULD be recycled the existing skills. All CCs would have to have short durations because as it stands CCs are crazy long in FF pvp. In terms of MMO PvP, my experience has been that its all about creating short opportunities to lock down enemies and burst them down. **Tl;dr:** Only PVP skills being useable in PVP (none of your normal skillset), with these skills being tuned to give individual classes specific roles/functions and create greater focus on CC &amp; mobility in gameplay (see * marked paragraph for examples)"
159,vulnerability,ffxiv,A5/A6/A7 tips,48,476cuk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/476cuk/a5a6a7_tips/,2016-02-23 23:22:04,"So I figured I will write this for people having trouble with these as some things can be a little tricky. I recommend trying to figure it out for yourself, which is fun, but if you wanna know here are a few tips (Updated now with A8, can't change titles sadly): A5: -Going into the lightning in the middle will trigger purple/red buffs. -When a bomb appears, trigger the buffs, make a dps go red and make the Gorilla push the bomb to one corner and tank in the corner in the opossite side and direction from it. This will happen several times on the fight with two, and three bombs, always switch the dps doing it as you shouldnt have several stacks of the debuff changing form gives. -To avoid the big aoe that forces vulnerability stacks into the party (happens after the bombs) the whole party has to turn into the bird form (purple circle). The boss will stop moving when casting this so everyone can run into the purple buff. -Burn ads that appears asap. A6: This fight has several minibosses which are pretty easy. -On the boss that has the floor with different grounds height, purple buff should go to the lower ground and red to the high ground. -During final boss use the ice shiva skills to frozen the water fountain that appears similar to the water in A3. Use it to cover from the OHKO the boss does a few moments later of using the shiva ices. A7: This is the tricky one, from time to time the boss will prey a target and put the target into a cage (Jail). Every jail has a different mechanic: -First jail is a DPS only, he must not move until he is out of the cage. Meanwhile every single dps outside should BURN the lock of the cage or that dps will die after a few seconds. (Thanks Cetonis for the update on this mechanic) -Second Jail is a DPS only aswell and the dps inside has to BURN the Alarum that appears of he is dead. During each jail, a doll will appear, STUN the attack it does or everyone will be paralyzed. Also NEVER touch the spikes on the floor unless you are coming back from a jail. After this the spikes will go away and a cat will appear. And pinballs, avoid the ball and make the tank go away from the cat. The cat will throw a heart into the boss. Burn it before it reaches the boss. 2 stacks is a wipe, at least with current gear. After 2 hearts the cat will go away and spikes will be wipe, then two new jails will happen. -First jail is a tank only. You dont need to burn a CD, but if you are struggling, do so. You have to survive. -Second jail is healer only. Heal yourself. If you die, everyone will get poison stacks and is moslikely a wipe. *Healer PoV (Thanks Daerik!) ""A7 Healer cage, one of the four vents in the corners will be glowing, step on it to remove the poison. Heart can be stunned, and heavied, and boss can be pulled to kite it."" Dolls mechanic will repeat and ads will appear, burn ads and deal with the doll the same way as before. Then the cat phase is back, but with two balls. After that BURN THE BOSS. And thats it, hope it helps! I am queueing for A8 atm but queue is slow :p A8: This fight has several phases so I will divide them: Phase 1: A single robot. From time to time he will do a ray (Called MEGA BEAM) that hits by A LOT of damage, pay attention to a white sphere right next to it, thats the direction of the ray. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. -Some spheres like A4 ones will be tethered to players, soak them or they will move to the targets. They hit about 8k. -6 ads will spawn, this is a dps check, kill them all, every single one you cant kill will do an aoe into the party. This will happen twice during this phase, if you are fast enough with the dps you can skip the 2nd ones from spawning. Phase 2: Remember the robots from A6? This is the same. But two at the same time. First you will deal with shiva ice and fire floor robots. Burn them. Nothing too serious going on here. Phase 3: The other two robots. So, ground mechanics repeats here, remember: Purple low ground red high ground. This time you will have 4 white robots being marked into players they will spawn over marked players. Pay attention to the direction each white robot phases as they will dive into that direction just like Thordan knights. If you get hit by a robot, is a vulnerability stack. This is your choice, you can kill the ground mechanic robot first or the robot that summons the white robots. Check what your party has issues with. Phase 4 AWESOME MUSIC PHASE: Here you want to stick together on the boss butt. He will throw 4 ground aoes, then a mechanic similar to Thordan soak-together will happen, same marker and all, you want everyone to stay together to mitigate it. After that the boss will turn around and do a laser beam, you have 3 secs to GET THE HELL OUT OF THE AREA to not get hit. Then he will go into the air and do all the mechanics from the robots, shivas, ground, fire ground, etc. No dps this time around, just dodging. After that it repeats. And its done!

IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE PARTY NEVER GO IN FRONT OF THE BOSS. mechanics include - 1. double rocket punch - standard tank buster, hits about 15k after rampart. PS: /u/Arganas alerts me that it can be split between the two tanks. it can also be solo tanked if one tank goes down with mitigation. 2. flame thrower - small conal aoe for moderate damage in front of boss. 3. rocket aoes - sends out a number of rockets that leave orange telegraphs on ground, avoid or get vulnerability up. 4. apocalyptic ray - boss turns around and unleashes huge attack similar to mega beam. relocate behind boss 5. long needle - arrows point at marked target, party needs to stack to share damage. 6. super jump - spread to avoid large aoe damage (thanks /u/Aikaparsa) 7. ultimate attack! - the robots untransform and unleash a flurry of moves. they include -main robot's j-kick for room wide damage -onslaughter's mega beam -vortexer's shiva circles -two robots throwing rocket aoes and landmines -brawler's double cannon -red and purple floor debuffs after dodging all the aoes, stack for the double cannon to mitigate room wide damage. after this epic display, rinse and repeat until victory!"

I was ninja at the time, so I would blow all my cooldowns and hop in. But I ran into a problem with the lag that happens every day at 9. Sometimes I would freeze for seconds at a time and end up having to eat an explosion. So I equipped some vitality gear and put my hp to just over 16k in case I'd happen to get hit by two bombs in a row. This worked until RNG decided I'd take 10 more damage than my max HP. So I went WAR. I'm not the most geared, but I do have the thordan weapon and void ark gloves. The rest is 190 with a 180 chest. I equipped slaying accessories, opened in deliverance, and right before I hop in the gobtank, I'd pop up defiance and have 17k hp. I can take all bomb hits safely in case I end up not having enough time to pull the bomb away from the party and get away from it myself, and I don't even have to worry about Blitztrahl (sp?) when I blow up the gobtank. The best part, though, is when we'd get to the final phase. right when the last soldier dies, I blow up the gobwalker and, since I'm already in Defiance, provoke the PLD's Widow and Overpower it. PLD pops Hallowed as per usual at 5 stacks, but goes into Sword Oath at this time, and I take over tanking the widow, and it made it IMMENSELY easier on the healers because they didn't have to keep someone with 5 vulnerability stack topped off for the prey mechanic. And, being WAR, I don't even lose too much dps. In fact, my aoe is actually stronger than when I was on ninja. I don't know if this is new per se, but I've never seen it around and wanted to spread the word for people."
162,vulnerability,ffxiv,"Tanks, Mitigation, DPS, &amp; The Meta",206,41wckh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/41wckh/tanks_mitigation_dps_the_meta/,2016-01-21 08:00:36,"This post has been kicking around in my head for awhile now, and I finally sat down to write it. As a bit of background, I've been tanking in FFXIV since the last beta. First as PLD and as WAR since Second Coil. I've since levelled DRK and enjoy the differences in all three. Something I've seen here lately is a backlash to the ""current"" meta, wanting tanks to ""tank"" and not supplement DPS in any meaningful way (this also applies to healers). The thing is, though, that I've been looking at the encounters in FFXIV and can only come to one conclusion: *this was the intended meta and a deliberate game design choice*. **The Halcyon Days of 2.0** The first thing that anyone remembers from 2.0 launch was how Warriors were ""bad""; they lacked mitigation. In fight that required two tanks, double Paladin was preferred in the contemporary meta. Worse, most fights were considered ""solo-tankable"", partially due to the lack of ""hard"" tank mechanics and PLD's vastly superior mitigation kit. First, let me talk about the WAR kit at the time, most important of which was Inner Beast. This was the WAR's single most important skill -- it was a 300% self-heal of whatever damage had been unleashed. This should have been the first clue that tanks were meant to deal damage and equip at least some STR accessories. The higher a WAR's STR, the more damage they could deal and the higher an Inner Beast would restore their own HP. Obviously, this did not work out; the community rightly confirmed that the amount of mitigation required in the 2.0 endgame was simply too much for a WAR to survive the initial hit oftentimes. On top of the fact that they lacked any mitigation outside of Foresight, healing was also an issue. With Defiance, it meant that healers had to spend more MP to keep a WAR topped off. An MT WAR was meant to supplement this with liberal use of Inner Beast, but timing and player skill were also an issue. The game was still new and most people were playing by other MMO rules, which meant tanks must be mitigation machines only. I still remember Bokchoy trying to convince people that WAR *could* contribute meaningful DPS in a raid environment here on Reddit. He was unsuccessful at first. **""Soft"" Tank Mechanics or ""The Meta was Intended""** Now, let's get back to game mechanics. What do I mean by ""hard"" tank mechanics? Forced tank swaps. Before the EX primals, all tank mechanics were ""soft"", in that the game design was encouraging the usage of two tanks and for tanks to swap with each other at certain points. Let's look at the endgame content in 2.0: the relic quest bosses (Chimera and Hydra), the HM primals, and Coil. At this time, stun resist wasn't nerfed and used by the community to help with fights such as Ifrit. It was probably also meant to be used on Chimera too, to interrupt all of the voices. Here, and with Ifrit, the most likely intended setup for an 8-person group was WAR as MT and PLD as OT. This was so that the WAR could open with Unchained and Berserk for large hate and DPS gains and the PLD could use Sword Oath for DPS and be able to interrupt all necessary spells, since Shield Bash did not have a cooldown. But this didn't happen, on account of the fact that ""tanks weren't supposed to DPS"". And since they couldn't put out good damage, they simply made it solo-tankable in the case of Chimera. For Ifrit, the safest option was still to run two PLD so that the OT could watch for stuns rather than the MT tanking mechanics as well. But before 2.1 even hit, there were many Ifrit groups which simply had the MT PLD handle mechanics, interrupts, and manage hate. Hydra, with its recurring adds, remained a two-tank operation. But because WAR was undervalued and lacked mitigation, it again fell to two PLD. Here, WAR would have been an ideal OT, since they can grab hate quickly on the adds and help burn them down. Since WAR has large HP pools and some physical mitigation, they could still withstand the stacking mechanic with a PLD in order to eat the timed cleaves. The fact that Inner Beast healed 300% damage given would also have been beneficial after eating a cleave, since the WAR could step out of the way and use IB to regain their lost HP. But again, why bother with all that when you could just take two PLD? The DPS check required of Hydra wasn't that strict, anyway. Garuda HM had the Sisters -- Chirada and Suparna added to the mix. Here, the OT was probably meant to be a WAR with their aggro generation and DPS capabilities. Neither sister hit particularly hard either. But even before full darklight was a thing, people were solo-tanking this as well. The MT PLD could simply pick up the closer sister and burn some CDs while the DPS burned the closer sister down. A BRD was usually brought to farms in order to Shadowbind the further-spawning sister. By the time the Bind effect wore off, the party had already killed the closer-spawning sister. And then there was the legendary brick shithouse wall of 2.0 -- Titan. This was the first proper DPS check for fresh-faced adventurers. And their first dose of reality. Many groups could not pass the heart phase without Limit Break shenanigans. It also meant that DPS was a priority here -- and two tanks were actively detrimental to this, according to the meta of the time. But I'm going to argue that there's proof that even Titan HM was intended for two tank parties. Mountain Buster. Ye olde Table Flip of yore. The amount of HP damage that Titan did should have been a hint that there was an intended tank swap. With mitigation or without, the damaged tank was supposed to back off and let the topped off OT take over for the next round of battle. But this didn't happen for one reason: PLD mitigation was good. *Too* good. A single Rampart was enough to survive the hit and subsequent attacks with competent healers. PLD having three CDs ready for three mountain busters (Rampart -&gt; Sentinel -&gt; Hallowed Ground), meant that tank swaps were superfluous. In fact, they were also a net negative, even if you had two PLD, because ""tanks weren't supposed to DPS"". Since it was therefore single-tankable, most groups opted to bring a fifth DPS to help with damage output. Now let's look at Coil. Here it's a bit more obvious they wanted two tanks. Caduceus split, making two tanks required. Turn 2 had Vulnerability Up stacks which needed to fall off. Turn 4 had double dreadnoughts and many adds. But the interesting one in my opinion is Turn 5. Twintania had the first ""medium"" tank mechanic to encourage tank swaps. Infirmity with every Death Sentence after the first phase. What happened was PLD's mitigation prowess coupled with Lustrate and Benediction simply bypassed this intended mechanic. Again since DPS was such a huge priority, people simply dropped the second tank and took five DPS. Since Dreadknights spawned from the same area, the PLD MT simply had to position Twintania correctly and still be able to stunlock the Dreadknights. But what if people had picked up on the intended meta? That tanks (and healers) should be active participants in the DPS race? Tanking wasn't simply about taking the hits and managing hate, at least in FFXIV. How do I know this? Because as early as 2.1 we started seeing those ""hard"" tank mechanics. Garuda EX required both the Sisters to be separated *and* Spiny Plume management. Titan gave a stack of Vulnerability Up every time he did Mountain Buster. Ifrit gave stacks of max HP down with every Incinerate. This *necessitated* two tanks, and people (specifically WAR and SCH mains) started to experiment with DPS techniques. The changes to WAR were definitely needed to make it competitive with PLD. But there's another thing that happened in 2.1. Hate generation was *increased* for tanks. I remember doing Turn 2 and DPS had to ""hold off"" on attacking for a bit to make sure the tanks could get hate on the nodes, after the death of the Slashing Defence Up node. This also applied to other fights, depending on your tanks and the DPS in your party. But in hindsight, it shows that tanks were already meant to be equipping at least one or two DPS accessories to supplement their threat generation. The increase that happened in 2.1 was both to rectify the developers' mistake in their reading of the community, and to help facilitate the current meta of the time. **""But Tanks (and Healers) Shouldn't be DPS!""** There have been some really well-written posts about how some tanks (specifically PLD mains) do not want to be DPS-in-tank-clothing. They want to be brick walls. I can understand that sentiment. But there's two things to consider in FFXIV, which sets it apart from other MMOs. Here, almost every GCD used by all tanks are *by design* damaging ones. The only exception to this pattern is Flash. Threat generation is also generated entirely from these attacks. Our enmity gains are from the combos which also do a significant portion of damage. Even a DRK can maintain hate via their DPS-centric Dark Arts enhanced Souleater combo, because damage means threat. In addition, with the release of Heavensward, the development team has been very clear about the intention of tank (and healer) DPS design. The kit given to all three tanks is overwhelmingly on the side of giving DPS options: *Warrior* - Deliverance, Fell Cleave, and Decimate are all *overt* DPS attacks. Over half of the 3.0 kit is designed to deliver significant DPS. Even Equilibrium and Raw Intuition have DPS uses -- Equilibrium regains TP in Deliverance and Raw Intuition grants a stack of Abandon/Wrath, which allows the Triple Berserk Fell Cleave opener to even exist. Out of the two, Equilibrium is the more important DPS supplementiser -- it gives WAR essentially unlimited TP. In 2.X, WAR ran out of TP very quickly since Fracture was a large DPS gain but also caused a huge TP drain. *Paladin* - Here two out of the five skills gained are DPS moves. Goring Blade adds a healthy amount of DoT damage to their arsenal, and Royal Authority has excellent potency. With 3.1, PLD also saw a change in how Shield Swipe works -- it's now oGCD and has a 15 second cooldown, making DPS even higher than before. *Dark Knight* - Like with Warrior, DRK's kit has two sides to it: utility or increased DPS. Salted Earth is a crazy DPS increase without Grit, but in tank stance it still does good damage and helps maintain AOE hate. Plunge is an oGCD which does some nice damage and also works as an equivalent to Holmgang and Tempered Will negation of movement. ~~Sea Urchin~~ Abyssal Drain is ridiculous damage on large packs of enemies, and also a significant self-heal. Sole Survivor is both a mitigation help (with the HP return) but also a DPS increase since it restores a chunk of MP. Carve and Spit can either be utility (to regain MP if the situation is dire) or is outright one of the more damaging attacks in the game. This argument applies to healers as well. WHM gets Assize, which owing to this duality the dev team has seen healers and tanks, either deals damage in Cleric Stance or gives a strong regen without. SCH gets Broil to supplement DPS. AST have their cards which directly buff their party's DPS. When you look at the kits provided by 3.0, the idea that tanks are supposed to be ""brick walls"" are clearly not the developer intent. It simply is the same meta that was intended from the beginning, but far more overt. **Mitigation Woes or ""How the Balance Went Whack""** Even as someone who enjoys the ""current"" tank meta, there are problems. The largest of which is that Fending Accessories are garbage. They stink to high heaven. People complain when they drop in Savage. And they should because Savage has its own problems, but mainly because DPS checks are much higher than Coil ever had. Tanks cannot roll ""Need"" on slaying accessories that drop, though they can still buy them. In Coil this was less of an issue, because DPS checks weren't as severe. This means that a tank could buy slaying accessories to supplement any fending drops that occurred in Coil. In addition, shit isn't hitting as hard (proportionally) as they did in Coil. Perhaps it was meant to alleviate the millions of gil tanks spent on melded accessories during 2.X. Perhaps it was because Savage simply wasn't as thoroughly playtested as Coil. Regardless, ever since I had three i200 left side pieces, I was running full Slaying in Savage the whole time and had no survivability issues. I stay in Deliverance for all of AS3, except for tethers during adds (and at the end as the stacks build up). The biggest problem though? How encounter design shifted from soft enrages to hard enrages over the course of Coil. They have become *particularly* severe with the release of Gordias Savage. In First Coil, all bosses had soft enrages. Even Twintania did not hard enrage and wipe the raid after a certain point of time. (This allowed for the amazing solo WHM clear by the by!) Even in Second Coil, soft enrages were still the norm. Only T9 had a hard enrage, and honestly it was a very generous amount of time. Final Coil still mixed soft enrages (such as in T10) with hard enrages (T13). But Gordias Savage is All Hard Enrage All The Time. With soft enrages, people who give mitigation priority can still clear. It might be a bit tougher than simply beating the enrage, but it lets more people clear overall. The difficulty lies in the increase in healing requirements but still encourages better DPS. It just lets people who were 99% of the way see a clear. Hard enrages, on the other hand, are heavy handed and personally soul crushing. I'm not sure why encounter design shifted so drastically in Gordias Savage to phase out soft enrages as mechanics. This, coupled with other bizarre design choices has made Gordias Savage clear rates abysmal. This really should be another post, but there are three reasons for this. One, crafted gear was purposefully nerfed. Next, secondary stats were also nerfed into the ground. Finally, the way loot drops in Gordias Savage is less than ideal to encourage progression. Throughout all three Coils, pieces dropped randomly. You could get the i90 tank chest in T1, but the i110 and i130 chests both game from T9 and T13 respectively. With Gordias Savage, all gear drops the same way: Accessories from A1S, Feet, Belt, and Hands from A2S, Pants and Head from A3S, Chest and Weapon from A4S. This is less of a problem, but accentuated problems people were already having with the difficulty curve. In Coil, perhaps some of your DPS could get their Chest or Pants pieces in earlier turns, which would help push DPS in later turns. This just exacerbated the DPS check issue in Gordias Savage, which is so severe that the accepted strategy for clearing A4S is *ignoring mechanics entirely* since it's less of a DPS loss to resurrect half the group than it is do deal with Nisi. **3.2 and beyond** This finally brings me to 3.2. I'll be honest here: I really like the meta. I feel that the innovation FFXIV brought to the MMO genre was the legitimisation and encouragement of tank and healer DPS. I like figuring out how to squeeze that last bit of DPS out of a fight and figuring out how to maximise my DPS without sacrificing my survivability. It made me a better player and made me work with my healers. It added extra strategy to fights. It made gearing less boring for tanks. It let me help carry people in difficult fights, or speed up dungeon runs. With the talk of ""adjusting"" tank DPS, I'm worried that the dev team is finally giving up on their intended design. I do agree that gearing has been unfair for tanks -- no other role needs to balance two main stats, nor do they need to buy three different sets of accessories to progress easily (fending, slaying, and melded). Another thing I've read here off and on recently, is that if you want to DPS you should roll a DPS. If you don't like tanking for the sake of it, you don't really love tanking. This is the furthest thing from the truth. I love tanking and being the guardian of the group. I just like being able to contribute to the DPS check in a significant fashion. If they nerf tank DPS, I'll still be a tank. But I think the community meta will simply shift back to not wanting WAR in their parties. It would also invalidate much of the skills *all* tanks gained in Heavensward. I'd hate to see it all go to waste. How would I fix things? A few adjustments to PLD's toolkit would alleviate some problems: * Grant TP recovery from Shield Swipe use * Divine Veil should be activated by *any* heal the PLD receives (self-heal or otherwise) * Clemency should either be oGCD, have a CD and cost no MP, be oGCD and cost MP, or retain its cast bar but not be able to be interrupted * Sheltron should either have a timer (2 seconds) so as not to be eaten by auto-attacks, or be the only way to block a magical attacking * Sword Oath should lower TP costs across the board This still doesn't account for how encounter design relies on DPS checks, less mitigation, and hard enrages, but it would help. **tl;dr 1:** Tank DPS was encouraged by developers from the very beginning by ""soft"" tank mechanics, but ignored by the community on account of PLD's overwhelming mitigation superiority in 2.0 **tl;dr 2:** All tank classes have been given *explicit* DPS skills in Heavensward, to make design choices clear. **tl;dr 3:** Balance is definitely Whack since Gordias Savage, in terms of mitigation, gearing, and specifically tank accessories. This is a combination of things which simply make the problem worse than it ever has been **tl;dr 4:** Nerfing tank damage isn't the answer, adjustments should be made to PLD (and DRK) to help with TP management, and encounter design should not revolve around severe DPS checks, so much that mechanics are ignored (A4S sacrifice strategy)."
163,vulnerability,ffxiv,The Diadem observations | Guide,78,3w0o05,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3w0o05/the_diadem_observations_guide/,2015-12-09 13:22:06,"Edit: As of this moment and since Diadem is pretty much dead right now am gonna hold off adding stuff to the guide. But when 3.2 comes out and if I see that its alive again I'll continue to add more stuff to the guide. The map been updated with more locations for buried chests ***An observation on the Diadem*** - This guide will be about **Diadem HM** &gt; &gt; Seeing that there is still no guide (unless there is one that I couldn't find in the search function or in the dreaded official forums) I took the liberty of making a guide with my observations in the Diadem and I hope you would share with me your observations. **Also should I be wrong about any method in this guide please let me know (Except Dino Island) would pleases me to correct the guide so that the experience would be better for all of us.** &gt; &gt; **Wall of text INC**. &gt; ________________ - First I would like to clear something about **Dino Island** farming in dino island is a bad idea, yes the Rank V (Easterly Sanuwa) and Rank IV (T-Rex) are tempting to kill but keep in mind that the Sanuwas have a push back ability resulting in DPS doing less damage which causes them to die at a much slower rate so much slow that killing another Rank IV or V is much faster and not just that, the area is cramped which means if a Star rank pop and lets say (**Brachi**) it would be difficult not to avoid getting aggro from other mobs which may result in a wipe or getting killed which means no credit. With that said, lets begin the guide. ______________________ **Fresh Tracks and messages:** - Fresh tracks is the ""NM Pop method"" after successfully killing a mob you basically start to gain points which are indicated by ""**Party Messages**"" that means other parties will not get the same message as yours. In 3.2 they will make it so when your party gets fresh tracks and you pop it , you instantly get claim on the NM. **Party Messages**: - The messages that you should mostly be aware off are these: 1. You feel a foul presence **nearby**. 1. You feel a foul presence in the **immediate vicinity**. 1. You feel a foul presence right **on top of you**. Nearby means you are 2 messages away from getting tracks , immediate vicinity means you are 1 message away from getting tracks and on top of you basically means that the fresh tracks appeared untop of a party member so beware if 1 member is on a starting area or on another island it might pop on him, when you pop them it will 100% spawn an NM (Star rank). Now I do not know the exact amount of Kills you need to advance through each stage but keep in mind that ""**Lower Rank mobs will give you less points towards your next stage if killed with multiple parties.**"" And we still do not know what SE means by ""**Lower Rank**"" , does it mean Rank 3 and lower? Rank 4 and Lower?. **Zone wide message**: - * The Air is thick with **murderous intent**. The message means that an NM has spawned in the zone , it could spawn literally anywhere (Including caves) ~~with the exception of the landing zones~~, when this message appears I would suggest that only 1 person of your party (a DPS if you have 1 Healer , or a Healer if you have 4 DPS) to go out and search for the NM, it is basically a treat from SE, when you find it make sure to shout for other people with the location and order them to stop pulling more mobs. **Buried Chest(the exploration part of the diadem)**: - Finding a buried chest and popping it will give you more points toward the fresh tracks for messages, they are hidden in each island, either under a bush or beneath a big mushroom. suprisingly these can give a SHIT ton of points so much that getting 10 results in getting this message ""**You feel a foul presence in the immediate vicinity**"" so as username [--Flare--](URL says getting 10 = a free star mob which means a free gold chest, although the only problem with these buried chests is that they act the same way as the Crystals found in the zone , anyone can see them , and anyone can pop them BUT, they do have a timer that I still do not know should someone figure this out let us know.Also it appears that some of the buried chests are golden ones (In HM) according too username [defucchi](URL so that more than enough reason to search for them. And here is the map I made for their locations , keep in mind it isnt complete yet and should you want to edit it feel free to do so and let me know if you find new locations so I can update it. [Buried Coffers Treasure Map](URL - Marker Color | Location ---|--- **Red** | On the island and on the same level as the island. **Purple** | On the island but on higher ground. **Blue** | Inside the caves. ___________ **Methods of farming Diadem HM:** - Now before I begin I believe that separating into 3 groups on each island isnt good, reason being is that if you separate you risk someone else having tracks on another island and popping it before you can reach it due to killing normal mobs while they popped their NM, the other thing is that you will be killing mobs slowly resulting in less chance to spawn a gold from a normal mob , as well only having 1 set of track for each party because the mobs take a long time to kill. Square-Enix have stated that killing lower rank mobs reduces the points you get for spawning tracks ,they didn't say it eliminates them therefore the methods below mostly consist of a zerg fest of 4-7 parties although it can work for 3 party formations. **[Triangle of Doom (Poison,Sleep and Paralyze)](URL :** - This is an effective method for farming for Gold chests and Tracks, what you do is basically start at the small Island kill the two Rank V Pterandons in it &gt; move to the left island and kill all the mobs &gt; then jump into the south side of the Celphies/Pelicans island , the benefit of this method is that the mobs are all Rank IV and Above which means you will be getting a shot at both getting tracks , getting a Gold off a Normal Mob , and getting more silver chests (Silver contains 210 gears), the only downside though is that the mobs are rather annoying , The Pelicans have [Poison ,Paralyze ,Sleep and Petrify Breath , The Celphies have super petrify (easily dodge-able just dont face them) , Paralyze (cold stare) and Vulnerability up (Can be cleansed , SCHs your party will thank you for using selene). With 5-7 Parties you can get about 8 NMs to spawn of this method but it requires alot of groups mainly at least 7 or 8 parties. [Evidence](URL **[Up and Down we go!](URL :** - The method is good for parties that want to Pop tracks and get many Silver and Bronze chests , what makes this thing shine is that the upper Island have a high chance of spawning ""Territorial Mobs"" which spawn from the chests. The upper island consist of 3 Rank V (two Pteranodon and 1 Tree). Its still considered a good Island, sadly I didnt record how many NMs we spawned doing this method, but each party can spawn 2-1 depending on luck getting those Territorial mobs. **[Isle Keepers and Celphies Land](URL :** - Pretty much like Dino Island, not so bad of an island until someone decides 2 Celphies and 1 Isle keeper makes things go faster and better , only pull 1 celphie at a time dont have more than one unless your group can handle 2 , when the celphie is about to die (20%-15%) HP pull another , having 2-3 Isle keepers is good as well as long as the tank actually tank them. Dont have much to say about this method other than it works, and healers cleanse the vulnerability up debuff. **[Pelicans and Celphies](URL :** - Pretty much like above not going to add more to that just beware of the pelicans debuffs. **[The Northwest Island](URL :** - Now according to username **[kingofgame981](URL ,This is the JP method of farming diadem , they focus on killing as many rank IV and III they get alot of bronze and silvers doing this method , what peaked my interest in it is that if each party can spawn 1 NM , that means a full group in diadem (9 Parties) can theoretically spawn 9 NMs , get a chance to have a 210 piece to drop off a silver chest , as well as a chance for a gold to spawn of a rank IV. Nothing too add to this method read his comment and you will see what I mean. And it would be a good method should SE decide that Spoils will be used in Relics. _____________ _____________ **Weather in Diadem :** - There are two special weathers in the diadem ""**Hyperelectricity**"" and ""**Umbral Wind**"". The first spawns Rafflasia clone monsters in each spawning area (T6 Boss) it has a chance to drop a **""Proto Ultima exoplating""** which can be traded for **""Ultima Horn""** not much to say about the second weather other than that Easterly Sanuwas will spawn on each starting Island, their special drop is still unknown during this weather. ____________ **Community Observations:** - &gt;[Zerosuitconner](URL **Fresh Tracks can spawn on party members , therefore it can spawn in landing zone if one used return.** &gt;* It'd be handy to add that the ""right on top of you"" message spawns fresh tracks on a random party member wherever they are in the zone. We had a pop-up right after a tank raised at our spawn and he got the tracks. This resulted in a Brachiosaur spawning on our landing zone and no parties believing us. Will upload screenshots later when I'm at my pc. &gt;[MikalMirkas](URL **(Theory on how points count)** &gt;* IIRC, NMs do not contribute to tracks. I believe that there are 5 messages each 5 points apart, and the point value that you gain on kill is the rank of the enemy divided by the number of parties involved in combat. I'm not certain on the rounding but knowing SE, it truncates. Lower Rank mobs means mobs rank I to III, IIRC. IVs and Vs get split in half per party and idk about I to IIIs because lolhm. **tl;dr don't touch other party's shit because of rounding** Diadem HM's niche is for as many NMs as possible. Normal is bleh. Diadem EM's niche is for as much loot as possible since enemies are squishy and you can faceroll a bunch. Decent for farming for the Pegasus / farming Steel spoils. Gold chests have a guaranteed i210 piece in them in HM. Silver's yield looks to be around 5% (anecdotal eyeball estimate) per i210 piece and Bronze looks like 1%. &gt;[Limefield](URL **(Hunting hawk of a silver or bronze)** &gt;* Unfortunately I have no proof to show you, but I have seen the Hunting Hawk drop once in normal mode Diadem, either from a bronze or silver chest. I wasn't aware of how rare it was, because it was early in the patch, so I wasn't paying enough attention to tell which one. But I can say with 100% certainty that it was NOT a gold chest, because those I did keep an eye out for. The drop occurred at the northern island cave if that matters. ____________ **Unsolved Mysteries** - 1.~~Do Star rank mobs give points toward track messages.~~ (need more confirmation, for now they dont) 2.How much is the decrease in points when killing lower ranked mobs with multiple parties. (So far it seems like the lower ranks are 1-3 , and it seems like killing a mob with multiple parties splits its points into how many parties killed it or got credit for it) 3.Does the special weather enemies have a higher chance to drop gold chests. 4.~~Is there any condition for Hunting Hawk or is it literally just anything with a stupid drop rate? Also , in Live letter Part XXV, Yoshi-P got a hunting hawk off a silver chest it could be rigged to showcase it but further investigations are needed, report if you see one.~~ **Check Limefield comment above! and check the Live letter XXV at [Link](URL 5.Accroding to this [image](URL it appears SE wanted divide the NMs into normal NMs and HNMs (High notorious monsters) so far we have not seen an HNM unless they mean that Rank Vs are NMs and Star ranks are HNM. _________ **TLDR version:** - Do not farm on Dino Island in HM its a waste of your time.

164,vulnerability,ffxiv,Machinist - My Thoughts on the job and what it needs.,0,3xtad1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3xtad1/machinist_my_thoughts_on_the_job_and_what_it_needs/,2015-12-22 19:24:40,"Hey everyone, I havent really done a big post like this before, but I thought I would share my thoughts on where I think machinist stands right now and what I think the job needs. Now, to give some context; Im a machinist main that knows the class pretty much inside and out, I often discuss these things in great lengths with other MCH mains in my FC and we have all reached some similar conclusions about the job. This post isnt to moan or complain about the class - because I love Machinist - I think its an incredibly fun class and I love how it plays - this post is more about my thoughts on where the class stands and what I think it needs - as well as just some other thoughts I have. My issue with the class as it stands. One of my biggest problems I have with the class right now is that we are supposedly support DPS (Yes ik ik, Squeenix be like there is no support dps - but there totally are) yet our support is honestly pretty lacklustre, its certainly not worth the dps penalty we take for being support dps in my eyes. Sure we have our MP and TP turrets, and that is a pretty powerful support element in itself, but I dont think thats worth penalising us for seing as our DPS is actively penalized when we are using the turrets. There is also the matter that other DPS classes get support too, Dragoon gets Battle Litany, which in my opinion is the single best support ability in the game, Ninjas get Goad and Vulnerability up, Monks get...m-mantra?...ok you got me on that one, Summoners get Eye for an Eye and Virus, Black mages get Apocatastasis and can cross class eye for an eye and virus (granted, less potent versions). The point is, I think the MP and TP turrets are only worth the same as the rest of the abilities these other classes get, and I dont think having MP and TP regen is worth our innate DPS penalty for being marked as Support DPS. Of course - Machinist has some other support abilities, The first one Ill tackle is Hypercharge. Hypercharge isnt even half as good as Ninjas Vulnerability up, yet, its on a far longer cooldown than that ability - yes, there is the factor of having your turret buffed as well, but in the grand scheme of things a buffed turret does not make a massive difference in a raid situation, the Hypercharge debuff is the part that really matters - which is either a 5% physical or 5% magical damage increase, only half the potency of a Ninjas Vulnerability up debuff and only for a single damage type. Frankly, Hypercharge is weak sauce compared to Vuln-up, once again, being support DPS you would expect us to have actual better support than the full dps, but that is certainly not true for hypercharge, so what about the other two abilities we get... ...The other two abilities being, Dismantled and Rend Mind. These two really confuse me. Ok, so, we get EITHER a 5% physical or magical damage dealt reduction on a single target on a 90 second cooldown. Meanwhile on summoner virus does 15% reduction to strength, dexterity, intelligence and mind on a single target with the same recast time (90 seconds). So, the support dps, which has its dps penalised for having support abilities, a 5% reduction in one stat, whereas the full dps has a support ability which, for the sake of argument (granted, not all enemies will use all 4 stats) can have a 60% damage reduction? Im sorry but Virus definitely takes the cake on that one too. So, to sum up, Machinist has a worse version of Ninjas vulnerability up on a longer cooldown, and an ability that pales in comparison to virus on the same cooldown. I would of course be 100% fine with this, because we get our group MP and TP regens, if we werent penalized by having all around worse off dps when we are given a reduction when our regens are active anyway, its like we are penalized twice. To re-iterate what I said earlier, I dont think the TP and MP regen is worth the reduction, and the rest of our mediocre support isnt either, were still only slightly better off support-wise than the rest of the dps classes. The second major issue that machinist has is the lack of any kind of defensive ability. Machinist is the only class in the game that doesnt have any form of self defense, every other dps class gets something. Ninja gets shade shift, kiss of the viper+mug and can cross class keen flurry and second wind (a very good self heal), Monk gets second wind and feather foot along with fists of earth, Dragoon gets keen flurry, life surge, elusive jump and can cross class foresight, bloodbath and second wind (yet they are still commonly found tanking the floor :P), Summoner can use energy drain (I wont count physick spam as a self heal xD), Black mages can use manawall and manaward (once again, I won't count physick spam), which, although not a self heal its better than the nothing machinist gets, the obvious comparison to Machinist is Bard, even Bard gets second wind and featherfoot (granted featherfoot is usually pretty useless without the monk trait). So where is Machinist's form of self heal or defense, did the dev team just go: oh woops we forgot their self-heal lol? It seems very strange to me that this is the only class in the game with no form of self defense. So, its all well and good saying these things, but how would I recommend fixing it? This is the fun part which I have been looking forward to doing. I think there are two ways of ironing out machinist - the first way is to remove all support and make it a full on dps, the second is to increase the support - I think given that MCH is supposed to be an alternative to BRD the latter option is a far better choice. So here are my ideas on how to improve the class and make it the true support dps that it deserves to be. Put rend mind and dismantle into one ability and change the recast time on it to be 60 seconds. (this opens up a slot for a new ability) You would obtain this at lvl 50 (when you get dismantle) Decrease the cooldown of hypercharge to be 60 seconds (the same as Ninjas trick attack - which applies the vulnerability up debuff). Heres a new ability: This ability would be activated like hypercharge and would differ depending on which turret you have out. High intensity scan (Rook Autoturret): increases party critical hit rate on a single target by 10% for 10 seconds. Wide-beam Scan (Bishop Autoturret): Increases party critical hit rate to targets within in a 10 yalm radius of the turret by 3% for 10 seconds. This ability would be on a 90 second cooldown. I think this would fit well with the current MCH abilities - seeing as the flavour of machinist is already more around sabotaging enemies that buffing allies, buffing allies is Bards thing - Machinist is more about using technology to bring enemies down and I think this ability reflects that, it also brings a little more importance to turrets - which is something I would love to see. You would get this ability when you would have gotten rend mind, So level 56. This next idea comes from my good Machinist buddy Finnea. Merge foot graze and leg graze to change depending on whether or not you have gauss barrel equipped. Without gauss barrel the ability is leg graze, which gives the target a 40% heavy - this suites not having GB equipped because you can kite the target while its struggling to keep up, whereas when you do have GB equipped the ability is foot graze - which binds the target - more fitting for when you are standing still and you have less mobility. both last 12 seconds (8 in PvP) just like before and you get this ability at level 10, the same as leg graze. This opens up another ability slot to put something else in...Oh! how convenient, that slot could have a self heal, its like I planned it this way or something! New Ability: Siphon Rounds: Loads firearm with five rounds of siphon ammunition. One round of ammunition is used each time a weaponskill is executed. Siphon rounds absorb 25% of damage as HP (up to a maximum of 8% HP per-round) No more than 5 rounds can be loaded at a time. This effect can be used with regular rounds. Duration: 30s. Recast time: 120s Obtained at level 22. (possibly a little swapping around of the lvls you obtain abilities may be needed with this one) I think this would add a very interesting way of self healing - its not instant like second wind so you have to use it skillfully, you wouldnt be getting the full effect if you did it just spamming split shot, at its best this could be a 40% self heal, at its worst it could be pretty useless and weak for a self heal. So, these are my thoughts on what I would love to see given to Machinist - it would make up for any shortcomings the class has in terms of DPS while not making it unbalanced, it capitalizes on the support flavour the class already has rather than just copying bards style. Of course these are all just my recommendations on what I personally would like to see - you may be completely different in what you would like to see, and if so please discuss it, half the point of this is to get some good Machinist talk going on what people would like to see. Just to re-iterate, I do love Machinist as a class and I think it is pretty competitive as it is, I just think it needs a few tweaks to truly bring it up to where I think it should be as a support dps class and truly compensate for its innate damage reduction for being a support dps. Please give me any feedback or other ideas you have id be interested in hearing them, lets let our machinist voices be heard! :D *Edited for spelling/grammar "

This is all written from my memory. **Trash**; Focus on the Incubator's; they spawn new bombs that instakill you **Trash before the final boss**: this is one big room with walls, you'll probably have to make sure the walls stay up, focus on the incubator and the Giant which has a lot of HP. First Boss: edit /u/smurfalidocious It's basically the first boss from Aery, only instead of killing the things you leash Prey to, it turns them into constructs. If you DON'T leash prey, it makes formless constructs that give the boss a Damage Up buff and are a BITCH to kill. **Second Boss**: See those orange smokes? Kill the adds on them, otherwise there will be more and more that overwhelm you. The adds do not hit hard but they need 2GDC's to die and if they do not die fast enough explode for raid wide damage worth about 5K. The easy thing is the adds tether to you as soon so stand in the smoke, attack a monster and destroy it when it's on you. Besides that the boss charges, to stop those you have to destroy the two canons. TLDR; Kill orange drops on orange smoke, kill cannons The **last boss** is easy to burn. After a while adds spawn. First just a grey and regular bombs. Focus on the grey because he does a strong attack. The second time he summons there's a third kind of bomb, the Remedy. When this bomb gets near the Grey one they tether and explode doing high damage, probably wiping the party. To get them away from each other this bomb must be attacked to be knocked back, so two people keep them away from Grey and two other burn down the Grey. In our party the BLM and PLD worked on the Grey and the BRD and SCH worked on the other ones. When the grey ones die the other bomb also dies without doing damage. That is the main gist of the final boss, after he comes back he gives magic vulnerability up stacks which we didn't have any problem with ourselves. TLDR; Grey bomb takes priority, play football with the Remedy "
166,vulnerability,ffxiv,Condensed guide to Arboretum,24,3sa9fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3sa9fp/condensed_guide_to_arboretum/,2015-11-11 02:52:36,"There seemed to be good response to the quick write up i did for Pharos Sirius (Hard) and someone agreed with the notion of doing this for Arboretum too. In my opinion there is nothing to note about the trash i the instance, just burn it down, with a competent tank and healer you can do big pulls. My party was not in full esoterics and it was no big issue. **First Boss**: This one is pretty straightforwards; burn the boss, dodge the aoe's. AT times he spawns several Malboro's which is an indication he will be starting his own attack which is a spinning Bad Breath. It is important you notice is he goes clockwise or counter clockwise to not get hit by it, it is random and if you're hit by it you'll have a big chance of dying. The second round he does this attack there also will be adds that must be burned down, the ones that aren't killed fast enough will explode and do raid wide damage. **Second Boss**: This boss is a giant bee, you'll just start hacking at it until you notice there are bees summoned around the area. These cannot be targeted but will give you AoE's which you must dodge; sometimes they mark up a player that is target for all the AoE's, other times it is completely random, the last AoE is a huge double column AoE that has no ground marker which means you'll have to pay attention to how the bees are aligned around the area. Lastly there will be a part where targetable adds span and tether to the boss; this is a dps check where the boss will do raid wide damage that gets stronger every time. Burn down the bees and nothing is wrong. For us it did the AoE 2 times before everything was killed. **Last Boss**: The first noteworthy attack is a big AoE which you only can dodge from being around his hitbox, you have time to run towards him so it shouldn't be an issue. After that he'll summon Bulbs that are reminiscent of the ones in T6, these will place ground AoE's that once stepped in to will give you a stackable magic vulnerability up debuff. So avoid those area's of all costs. At the same time he'll start casting an attack that will charm you after which you run inside an AoE and get the debuff. To avoid being charmed you need to look away from the boss, be aware that the cast time is rather short. Besides this there is one more room wide AoE that hits for about 4K that we healed through. TLDR; enjoy the music of the dungeon."

Pharos Sirus (Hard) Luminary: Other than a few hard-hitting attacks, the biggest issue in this fight are the tethers. If you happen to get tethered, take the tether to one of the birds/spiders on the outside of the ring. That tether will turn the spider/bird into a hostile add with very low HP; just kill it and move on! 5th Order Be Gu This one took me a few tries to figure out. Throughout the fight, Be Gu will jump up and smack the ground, releasing gas. This will spawn adds. The adds use the hate system from A1; as in, hit it first, you get all the agro. Drag that add over to the gas, kill it there, and the add will block the gas, preventing new adds, and you won't blow up! (if you leave the adds alone they'll blow up doing raid wide damage. This is bad! [obv]) Later, the boss will throw out bombs that he tethers to, and go nuts and charge all over the place. Just dodge/eat it and beg your healers for heals. Destroy the bombs and you're back to basics. Progenitrix This dude reminds me of Genie from Aladdin. Fight starts super easy, just burn him and the adds down. Once at 10% he'll start self destruction, burn him down more and the fight is over! JUST KIDDING LOL. Adds will pop back up with a vengeance, just burn them down and the boss will return. With more of a vengeance. The boss gives out stacks of burn, acting as a soft enrage. Adds will spawn as well; Grey Bombs and Remedy Bombs At this point, some of this is conjecture. My thoughts on the fight that are not 100% confirmed are marked by ** Remedy bombs will fly over toward the grey bombs. If they get close enough they'll tether, giving you even more stacks of burn and raid-wide damage. You can play keep away by smacking the remedy bomb away with attacks. From the name, one would think that the Remedy Bomb cures Burn, but from what I could tell it will not tether to the boss or interact with anything else. (Thanks to Insentia for pointing out in the comments: ""You are supposed to heal trough it, it's basicaly a soft enrage timer: If the dps sucks really badly (like... is completely abyssmal) you're gonna die once the damage gets too high to get outhealed (which is going to take forever for geared up parties).) So long as you keep the remedy bombs away from the grey bombs, you should have no problem clearing the dungeon! Yaaay! Now, let's go depopulate a forest.. Saint Mocianne's Arboretum: A side note, every boss in here hits Pretty Hard (tm). Before mitigation, bosses will hit you for around 3-5k damage. Spicy! Rose Garden(? I think? I'm tired lol..) This annoying giant malabro will send out little seedlings to do persistent aoe damage. Note that they continue on for about 10 seconds or so, so do not run back in thinking it's safe! On top of the above, the boss will rotate with his frontal ""Badder Breath"" cone. Just rotate with him! After the first round of this, the fight will continue just the same, except with adds(tm) during the rotation/aoe phase. If adds don't die, bad things happen(tm). **Pretty sure it's just damage, there may have been a debuff.** Kill the adds, take out the trash, and then meet my favorite boss of the patch.. Queen Hornet Again, she hits hard. The biggest issue during this fight is the bosses ""Ally"" and ""Aline"" abilities. -Aline will put Prey on your party members, and then the bees flying around the outside of the ring get really pissed off (tm) and throw AOEs out like they're free. Seriously, Unlimited AOE Works. Duck, Dive, Dodge. Keep moving and keep your eyes open! Ally works a bit differently; instead, the bees will line up in a row and intersect each other, hitting everyone in their path. If you're hit by both, expect to take around 9k damage. You can somewhat safely take one if you have to, but the easiest way to avoid it is just to run to a corner and chill out for a second. There's some adds and things, but whatever, not important. Belladonna: Oh man, so this stuff is crazy, and I'm not a 100 percent sure on this, but whatever new stuff and I'm just giving out pointers and this isn't a guide so.. Anyway, sorry, been awhile since I've slept. Belladona will shoot out small children that seduce you (no, not a joke, being serious). **As far as I can tell, all you need to do is to turn around and face away to avoid it, but our DRG says 'lol no it still hit me'. Your mileage may vary. Other than that, there's some gold puddles that spawn underneath the children; when you're seduced by Belladonna, you run toward one of them and the gold puddle causes Magic Vulnerability Down. Other than that, the boss fight is pretty easy! And there you have it! I hope this helps you some, if your stuck on a fight or just curious. Happy patch day~! "
168,vulnerability,ffxiv,Void Ark cheat sheet,12,3sdk0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3sdk0m/void_ark_cheat_sheet/,2015-11-11 16:52:09,"Unlocked Void Ark as soon as I could tonight and just finished my third run. I can say I'm fairly confident in being able to clear it now, so I figured I would pass some knowledge along for everyone else. I'm still working on boss names, so I'll just label the important parts as they are: **Raid start**: The first few sets of mobs are trash mobs, simply avoid aoe and tank'n'spank your way through to the first boss **First boss**: - Primary attacks deal cleave damage. MT should face boss away from raid - Avoid Body Slam aoe. Will cause massive damage and knock back anyone hit - Tail deals an aoe cone move that will cause paralysis. Avoid this if you can - Randomly, a player will have a green orb over their head. Keep away from the raid party and run on the outside edge. Boss will follow you and drop water bombs in it's wake. - Watch for *Electric Whorl*. When this move is charging up, group immediately under boss to avoid raid-wide aoe which will cause Electrocution and Paralysis. - When adds spawn, burn them immediately - There is a phase similar to the orbs in World of Darkness. Random members will get stunned and thrown against the wall, or sucked into the middle under the boss. The players in the middle will have to burn the orb, while players on the outside burn 3 orbs, and players will be cut off from each other **Forward Ventilation Room**: - I'm still a bit confused on the specific mechanics here, but the main point is to focus the Pagan Knots first, then the remaining adds. Two waves of Morbols will spawn near the end, focus the Pagan Knots then the Morbols, followed by remaining adds. - This room is primarily a healer check, as there will be a ton of status effects and DoTs to clear up **Second boss**: - There are two main points of focus: The tree in the middle or the big boss - Each of the two main focus points will be immune to a certain type of damage. If your target is immune to your damage, focus the other one. The damage immunity is either magic or ranged dps, and will randomize between the two - Adds will spawn throughout the entirety of this fight. They *must* be taken out. Otherwise, the tree in the middle will sprout roots to swallow the adds and enter and enrage phase. This happened during my first clear, and we were sure to wipe out the adds on sight from there on out - The big boss will begin charging a move called *Smashing Stomp*. This is a room-wide aoe that will one-shot any player hit. To avoid this, group up behind the opposite side of the tree - Players will randomly have green orbs with aoe circles around them. These players should get to the outside and avoid hitting other players with the aoe acid that drops - At random intervals, the ground will rumble and break. Move away from the ground before it breaks, as the roots from the tree will swallow you, dealing damage over time and preventing any actions from taking place - Once the tree is around 5%, you can use LB to kill it and the big boss after it dies **Third boss**: - First of all, huge pain in the ass. Probably the most frustrating fight in the raid - Will raise tentacles and slam them to the ground, dealing massive damage to anyone hit. You can avoid this by going between the tentacles or distancing yourself far enough away - Four pole adds will spawn and stand in place. Not sure what they do as of yet, but best to burn them and not find out - Boss will vomit in a frontal aoe without warning. The vomit will constantly stack poison on the target unless they move away - A room-wide aoe poison will fill the floor. Get on the pads to avoid the poison damage and the boss's follow-up aoe - Adds named *Foobar* spawn on each pad in two waves. Boss is invulnerable during this phase. Burn adds immediately, otherwise boss will swallow the adds and regurgitate on entire party - Orange orbs will spawn near the end of the fight. If these are not tanked, they will explode after a short period in a room-wide aoe, dealing a ton of damage and eventually wiping the raid **Last boss**: - Overall an easy and relatively fun fight. Be sure to enjoy this one - Deals a massive frontal line aoe called *Sickle Slash*. Easily avoided by going between the aoe markers - Marks a random player with a grey orb. Group on this player to minimize damage from her divebomb - Casts room-wide *Petrifaction*. Avoid this by looking away during the cast - Will eventually split into three parts: Her main body and two snakes. One tank from each party should split up the snakes, breaking their tether. Third party will take main body away from the snakes. - Towards the end, jumps up and casts several large aoe circles. Not easily avoided, but do your best. Each circle will apply ""Vulnerability Up,"" and can stack In essence, that's about all you need to know. I may have gotten some *specific* mechanics wrong, or maybe left one or two very minor details out, but this is pretty much it. Follow this cheat sheet and you shouldn't have an issue clearing Void Ark without severe outside circumstances. Here are some **VERY** important tips to remember: * Have fun! This is a game, first and foremost, and the developers put a lot of work into this content. Don't worry about raging if someone screws up. This content is only a day old. * If this is your first clear, be sure to watch the cutscene for the quest following this!

I main BLM and have been using it for expert roulette since the end of early access. Today, however, I finished leveling AST and decided to escape DPS queue hell and go in as the healer. I've had my share of terrible tanks, terrible healers, and terrible DPS - but nothing quite so heinous as tonights experience. I knew during the first trash pull that it was going to be a long ride; what normally would be cleared in a matter of moments dragged on about 3x as long as normal. This was the first HALF of the first room - not even a large pull. So, I resigned myself to long fights and set myself up with an extended time Royal Road and an Ewer card held, knowing that MP management was going to be a problem with such a slow group. We got through the dungeon to the final boss, albeit incredibly slowly. Tank was good, never had aggro problems- DPS were a DRG and a MCH. While both were slow, the MCH is the cause of my frustration. We wiped twice- the alarums weren't being killed, and between their paths and the land mines, there was nowhere to go and we kept getting tons of stacks of vulnerability debuffs. Tank had 6-7 stacks during one of the wipes. So the MCH chimes in with 'I see the problem now, bad healer.' I responded, not so subtly, with 'says the slowest DPS I've ever seen.' The next several lines of the chat log were him whining 'I've been running out of TP and popping all the buffs.' --TP was never a problem, I was watching. I'm not entirely unconvinced that he wasn't just auto attacking- though, either way, at level 60 you should know how to play your class. I tabbed onto several enemies during the course of the fight- at no point could I even find him registering on the threat meters. We inevitably wiped again, he got snippy and left. We refilled the slot with a BLM and had no problems on the final run- alarums were killed, dodging was easy, and there were even no fatalities. The sad part is that this DPS probably has no idea how bad he performs and defaults to blaming other people when the parties fail. I got what I wanted out of the run- got my daily tomestone bonus, capping me for the week and even got a few bonus pieces of gear to turn in to my GC and recycle for ventures. So, my question to you, Reddit: What is the worst thing you've encountered in a party? How did you deal with it? Did you just put up with it, say something, leave the group? What do you do when you see drama going down elsewhere in a party that you're not personally involved in? Do you play a job that is prone to blaming and shaming, and if so, who does it usually come from? "

Anyway on to the actual point. Anytime I read about people thinking how Red Mage might work, it always bugged me how...varied and indecisive responses seemed to be overall. Everybody seemed to want something different from the job in terms of role, design, abilities, etc. Should it be a DPS? Should it be a healer? Should it make a new role dedicated to support? Should it switch between roles? Should it be part of that speculated ""job fusion"" system? And so on. And I couldn't help but feel that all of these subjects were missing the point. I'm no expert in any field, but I posit that these kinds of roundabout discussions were the result of people trying to classify Red Mage based on what it should traditionally *do*, not on what a Red Mage actually *is*. To clarify what I mean by this distinction, I'll use other jobs as examples to try and show my point first. We'll start with White Mage. Traditionally speaking, what is it that White Mages iconically *do?* Through most Final Fantasies the White Mage is a back row fighter with access to healing spells. They'll also usually have some kind of buffing or support potential. Now let's look at Paladin. Traditionally speaking, throughout Final Fantasy games the Paladin job has been a job that fights on the front lines, has access to basic healing spells, and usually has some kind of protective role for the party via abilities like Cover or maybe even having access to defensive buffing spells that the White Mage doesn't have access to. So far so good. Both of those things were pretty well translated into FFXIV. But let's try a different angle. Black Mage. Traditionally speaking, throughout Final Fantasy history, what has a Black Mage done? The Black Mage typically served the purpose of exploiting elemental weaknesses in monsters that had them, and providing more situational, but much higher potential damage than the more consistent, physically-oriented, fighter-based jobs. The Black Mage's role in the party was to deal with very specific threats quickly, occasionally providing minimal utility through debuff spells such as Blinds or Poisons. Black Mage, in terms of its ""traditional"" role, didn't make it into FFXIV. They scrapped the situational elemental burst damage and weakness exploitation that Black Mages were ""traditionally"" known for. But people haven't complained about this because, while Black Mage doesn't do what it's traditionally known to ""do,"" it still *is in essence* what people traditionally think it is *is.* What I mean by that is, what a job ""is"" is a much more broad and vague definition of the job, but is ultimately more indicative of what kind of fantasy that job allows the player to experience. As long as a job's design captures what the job ""is"" then it will still *feel* like playing that job, no matter how the job ends up specifically playing mechanically. Going back to White Mage and Paladin, what White Mage and Paladin ""are"" is simply ""mage who focuses on healing"" and ""warrior who focuses on protection."" Both what the job ""is"" and what it ""does"" translated well into FFXIV's MMO game systems. The Black Mage example reinforces this most, I think. What a Black Mage ""is"" is simply ""elemental mage who focuses on damage."" The Black Mage in FFXIV doesn't mechanically play like a traditional Final Fantasy Black Mage, but it does still encompass that overall essence, and therefore still feels satisfying by providing that same kind of fantasy to the player. You're still the ""offensive burst mage."" They were able to change what the job *does* without interfering with what the job *is*, and it still came out as a satisfying way to fulfill that ""Black Mage fantasy"" to the players while giving the job a better fit within the MMORPG game systems. Now trying to build off those examples, let's give Red Mage the same treatment. Traditionally speaking, what does a Red Mage in a Final Fantasy game ""do?"" It has access to reasonable amounts of both physical and magical damage, as well as reasonable supporting utility. It's typically used as a ""filler"" job to adjust on the fly in a turn-based system and supplement any problems that may come up. It's never the *best* option, but it can help out with any situation should your more dedicated roles not be completely up to the task on their own. ""Jack of all trades, master of none."" So if that's what Red Mage traditionally ""does,"" then what actually ""is"" the Red Mage in terms of escapism? To me, most simply, the essence of the Red Mage is ""fighter who can also use magic."" I've noticed some people get so hung up on what the job does mechanically that they don't think there's any flexibility in how the job can be changed to fit FFXIV's systems, but still ultimately *feel* like playing a Red Mage. To me, there's only three things that the Red Mage really and truly needs in it's design. 1. It needs to use a sword. 2. It needs to cast spells. 3. It needs to have some kind of support utility. Anything else more detailed or beyond that is open to interpretation. I feel that as long as it hits those three categories, it will still *feel* like playing a Red Mage. So rather than, say, try and make what it *did* in FFXI shift over to FFXIV and try and force FFXIV's systems around to make that old playstyle work, how do we make a class within FFXIV's systems that fulfills the basic requirements in terms of fantasy fulfillment? There's still lots of ways that it could go, but personally, the way I'd like to see it go is if it worked similar to a melee-ranged Bard or Machinist. A DPS class with access to buffing spells for raid utility (drawing from previously unused White Magic spells that would benefit DPS such as Haste or more utilitarian things like the infamous Refresh), and its main damage source being use of the ""En-element"" spells (drawing from the Int-stat), causing its autoattacks to have various extra damage effects depending on the element, as well as weapon skills that augment or alter those effects situationally. For instance, Enfire gives a flat magic damage boost per autoattack but continually drains MP, Enaero makes your autoattacks apply a DoT, and Enice makes your autoattacks apply a resistance-down/vulnerability-up debuff, and you have weaponskills such as one that applies your autoattack effect to anything in an AoE and one that doubles the potency of your next autoattack's elemental proc. There would, of course, be more variety than that, but I think that conveys the basic idea. This, I feel, would come together nicely into a a front-line fighter whose main damage comes from a combination of swordplay and spell use with a high range of utility options available to it. It doesn't have to be a pure support. It doesn't have to be a healer/DPS hybrid. We don't have to make entire new game systems just to make it *play* exactly like it did in the older games. We just have to make it *feel* like it did in the older games, but within the new systems we have set up. And regardless of how they design it, it's very possible for that to be translated into FFXIV in a variety of ways yet still feel satisfying. You just need to be more flexible in terms of what you think the job is capable of playing like."
172,vulnerability,ffxiv,New Warrior (and player) Could use some tips on tanking,1,3on2mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3on2mn/new_warrior_and_player_could_use_some_tips_on/,2015-10-14 08:39:54,"Greetings! Amynta Ironheart (Odin EU) here. First off, let me say: Really enjoying the game and find it very refreshing from other MMO's, I'm a real big fan of the crafting and the whole 'you only need 1 character' thing. I recently hit 50 (wahoo) and have not looked back on choosing Warrior (levelled everything minus arcanist to 20 in trial). However, I must say - as I've gained abilities I've noticed my tanking prowess to increase, but I feel some rotations are a bit clumsy. So just wondered if a few of my veteran Warriors could weigh in and tell me if I'm doing it right? I will say, I have tanked in most MMO's - druid, warrior and paladin in WoW, Lancer in TERA and Warrior in Wildstar, to but name a few. I am comfortable in the role and enjoy it. Okay, my confusion. My confusion, mostly, lies in the 2 abilities that combo off maim. I find it clumsy having to might swing and maim, twice (replenishing a buff that doesn't need it) in order to apply the 10% damage reduction and the slash vulnerabilty. And then having to repeat the process to maintain them. Am I supposed to keep these up? And should I start with this (maximising on increasig damage to boss, and minimalise my damage taken) or go straight in with butchers block, to grab a solid aggro before debuffing? What does a traditional rotation look like? Mine, currently, is gain 5 fury through the cooldown (forgot its name) close distance and once in range pop the ability that removes the damage reduction on stance and throw my axe, pop damage steroid and commence into first maim combo, applying damage reduction debuff, then either butchers block combo if party often pulled aggro, or proceed to 2nd maim combo and apply slash vulnerability. Stun pretty much on cooldown, unless I'm saving for specific abilities and use 5 fury attack on cooldown. Fill any space between refreshing debuffs with butchers combo and use cooldowns as needed. Pretty simple really, my only gripe is that double maim combo. Is it worth using un-combo'd? This has been the only thing I've questioned. So, brothers in arms. Am I discracing all of us or am I just missing somethig obvious? Feel free to add me, if you are on Odin, its nice seeing orange names!"
173,vulnerability,ffxiv,"DRGs in A2S, when do you use AoE?",5,3psa7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3psa7b/drgs_in_a2s_when_do_you_use_aoe/,2015-10-23 02:43:10,"Hi there fellow dragoons! My static is currently progressing on A2S, and we're trying to figure out ways to deal more damage. Simple math shows that Doom Spike will deal more damage per GCD than my single target rotation if it hits at least three mobs, and more damage per TP spent if it hits five or more. There are obviously opportunities for that throughout the fight. But spamming it all the time drains TP fast, and then I'm left with no TP to do my main rotation properly on things that need to be single targeted. So I'm trying to figure out a way to use DS as much as possible (moar deeps), while still maintaining a minimum required amount of TP to last me through the fight. Here's what I do currently: * Wave 3: AoE until I'm down to 500 TP, then Invigorate, then AoE until at 500 again, then finish whatever's left with 1-2-3 (usually nothing). * Wave 4: I have our bard sing me TP song for this. AoE everything until about 300 TP, then finish off whatever's left. * From this point on, pop Invigorate as soon as it gets off cooldown every time; this leaves me with just barely enough TP to kill everything important with single target rotation. * By the time last wave (9) hits, I'm back at full or nearly full TP. AoE down the soldiers/snipers, try to hit as many other things as possible. I'm interested in what other people are doing; specifically how you interact with the vulnerability up stacks from the walker. Obviously your single-target DPS is going to get boosted much more than your AoE - but is the difference worth losing a chance to hit 4-5 mobs? Is anyone AoEing wave 8, and if so how do you manage your TP around it? Just to be clear, I'm not asking anyone ""teach me how to DRG"", I just want to learn how other people play the fight and see if I can pick up some tactics. &amp;nbsp; For reference: Our party composition is PLD / WAR / WHM / SCH / BRD / SMN / DRG / NIN (in walker). I'm at ilevel 200 (eso weapon of course), currently doing about 1400 - 1450 DPS over the entire fight. I would like to push it consistently to at least over 1500. &amp;nbsp; Thanks for any answers!"

175,vulnerability,ffxiv,The Heavensward guide to Coil,338,3itgeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3itgeo/the_heavensward_guide_to_coil/,2015-08-29 15:37:43,"I've met a few people who'd like to go back and try their hand at the Coils of Bahamut. This is a great idea! That content is definitely worth seeing, and with a full level 60 party it's easy to breeze through at least the first two thirds. Which brings me to the first point: if you've never done the Coils and you want to try them, **get to 60 first and avoid the Duty Finder.** You want to recruit a full party through PF so you can turn off the level sync. Ask for help with an ""unsynced discovery party"", mention that you've done your homework, and hopefully your PF will eventually fill. I'll join if I see it. It's a fun change of pace. (Clarification: If you want to do it the synced way, that makes me very happy and I hope you have a great time. I'll help if there's anything I can do. Unfortunately I can't really recommend it to people any more because of how unlikely it is that they'd find 7 other players with enough time and interest.) About that homework though, you don't want to use old level 50 guides. They are way more complicated than what you'll actually be doing, and learning them is a bigger investment than we're aiming for here. This is why I'm writing this post, I figured I'd try to write down the simplest possible spoiler-free strats that can get an okay-ish level 60 group through the Coils. All turns can be solo-tanked unless noted otherwise. ------ **Turn 1** Difficulty: Dragonskin Map. ADS: Burn burn burn. Caduceus: Burn burn burn. The boss will split in two. Keep burning. -------- **Turn 2** Difficulty: Neverreap. After killing the first miniboss, go either left or right, left is probably less annoying. Keep killing nodes until you reach the Defense node. The arena is tiny, but try to spread out as much as you can. Someone will soon get a debuff called Allagan Rot. They'll need to run into someone else to pass it on before the timer reaches zero. Then that person will do the same when the counter runs low again, and so on. You won't have to do this more than one or two times. Actually you might even be able to kill the boss before the first debuff runs out? Please tell me about your experience. -------- **Turn 3** Difficulty: YOLO Just do it. -------- **Turn 4** Difficulty: Dragonskin Map Pull the things; AoE the things. -------- **Turn 5** Difficulty: Alex 4 (story) Put your Focus Target on Twintania. Don't ask, just do it. Kill the adds, then watch what happens over your head. Red marker means share the damage with a friend. Blue marker means stay on your own and have the others kill the thing that traps you. Actually you'll probably skip before the first blue marker. Twintania flies away. Spread out, try to find Twintania when she prepares to charge so you can dodge (or run into her, that seems to work well). Raise the people who got knocked into the wall. If there's no-one left to raise, try again, you'll have better luck next time. Snakes spawn, kill them, divebombs happen again, snakes spawn again. When you're done with the snakes, go have a picnic in one of the the dark blue circles Twintania dropped (they're called Neurolinks) because she didn't expect you to kill the snakes so fast and she won't be back for a while. When she finally appears again, stay in the link until she does her big attack, then spread out in all the arena. You're now in phase 4 (where were the other three? Yeah I know). **Twisters** are like normal circle AoEs (think Titan or A1), except there's no ground marker. And they one-shot you. Keep and eye on your focus target, and when Twin casts Twister, run in some kind of circle so you don't cross your own path nor anyone else's. People will die to this. Raise them. Knights will also spawn. Kill them. At some point the twisters will stop, all that's left to do is finish the boss. -------- **Turn 6 (Second Coil Turn 1)** Difficulty: Neverreap. Tank the boss in the middle. Ignore the Dark Matter Bulbs except the ones that spawn in the middle, these need to die. Break vines by running away from each other (the closer you were at the start, the easier, so try to keep a stacked formation by default). When someone gets a yellow mark on their head, try to stand on the other side of the boss so you don't get swallowed. Kill the bees. At some point Rafflesia will cast Leaf Storm. This means no more yellow marks or bulbs. Instead you'll have more vines to break, and Dark Matter Honeys and Slugs will spawn. Leave the honeys alone, and let a healer tank the slugs (which you don't want to damage too much) while everyone keeps burning the boss. -------- **Turn 7 (Second Coil Turn 2)** Difficulty: Neverreap. **Cursed Voice** will put a triangle-shaped debuff on some people. When the timer reaches zero, they spit out a petrifying cone in front of them. Try to aim it in a direction that makes sense (out of the arena, away from teammates). **Renauds** are unkillable unless petrified, and even then you don't really need to bother killing them. Really, just pretend they aren't there. They do take up a lot of space for something that isn't there, but at least you can't get more than four of them at the same time. Kill every other type of add. **Cursed Shriek** will put a circle-shaped debuff on someone, when the timer runs out the debuff will petrify *everyone*. That's okay, just wait it out. **Petrifaction**, which is used by the last add and then by Melusine herself near the end, will petrify you if you're looking at the caster. -------- **Turn 8 (Second Coil Turn 3)** Difficulty: A4 (story) The boss never leaves the middle of the arena, and there are four half-circles on the ground along the edges, in each of these half-circles a tower can appear and do stuff. Put the ""A"" ground marker in the north circle, the ""B"" marker in the west circle, and the ""C"" marker in the south circle. Choose two ranged/healers, call them gofer 1 and gofer 2. When a tower appears in A, gofer 1 will go in there and stay until they get **one** stack of debuff. When a tower appears in B, gofer 2 will go and stay for **two** stacks. When a tower appears in C, the main tank will go get **three** stacks. (Note that sometimes you'll still have stacks when your tower spawns again; just go in anyways.) Your basic formation should have everyone spread out (but stay out of the tower areas). When someone gets an orange circle under their feet, they're going to die; raise them^(yes that's how little fucks I give). The tank will keep the boss turned south and no-one should be in that part of the arena because ouch. When an add spawns, kill it. When red landmines spawn, step on them to trigger them (Yes really. That's even part of the original strat), taking care not to get pushed into a tower field. The boss will eventually cast Allagan Field on someone. You don't want that person to take too much damage. The healers should shield them, and if that person gets an orange tether to the boss someone else should grab it. -------- **Turn 9 (Second Coil Turn 4)** Difficulty: Mechanics remain among the nastiest in the game, luckily you now have a *lot* more leeway with numbers. You can still go in with no experience and get your clear quickly, but only if a majority of your party knows the fight through and through. There is very little that's cheeseable in this fight. I'll still try to simplify where I can, but this is mostly the same strat you'd use at level 50, meaning you can supplementing this with reading old 2.x guides. **Stay spread out in the first phase, avoid the center.** The tank will explode once in a while so people should never stand too close. Red marker on your head after the boss jumps on someone means everyone should stack in the middle to share damage. Red or orange marker at any other time means a meteor is going to drop on you. Go to where you want to drop it (not too close to an ally or another meteor), wait until the marker disappears, and move out. The boss will become invincible and three people will get green markers. Those are meteors as well; drop them away from each other and from the other meteors. **Golems will hatch from the green meteors;** if you look closely they each glow with a different color. The tank will grab the green one, a DPS (or the offtank if you have one) will grab the red one, while the blue one will naturally go to the healers. All other DPS will focus down the green one first. Keep all three golems separate, and have them ""eat"" the meteors by moving them close. **Make sure all meteors have been eaten before you kill the last golem.** After this, you'll get 6 meteors in quick succession, followed by three more golems. My suggestion is to spread out along the edge and drop meteors as they come, keeping an eye on everyone else so you don't accidentally stack two. You then drop the golems near the middle, in the centers of the three circles that the devs conveniently drew on the ground for you. When you're done killing the new golems (same as before), **stack up in a position a few meters away from the center** (near the outer edge of the inner circles; you might want to put a ground marker here so you don't lose it when the ground drawings disappear later on.). The tank should stand separately because the boss will join back in by AoEing them. A giant-ass tower will fall in the middle of the arena. If you're under it, you'll die. If you're too far from the center, you'll get pushed into the wall and die. After the tower disappears, the boss will call and add which you will kill (surprise!). When it dies, the add will drop small puddles of light. **Don't go in there just yet.** The people who get a purple (not red!) chain debuff will need to step in a puddle in order to clear it. The phase alternates towers and adds until the boss casts Bahamut's Favor, which signals the start of the last phase. **So yeah, phase 4.** The first important thing is fire. When someone gets an orange tether to one of the dragons flying outside the arena, that's a fire AoE coming to them. **You'll need to alternate how you deal with fires.** The first one is ""out"", meaning the target stays away and eats it alone. The second one is ""in"", meaning everyone stacks on the tank and eats it. Then out again, and in again. There are four fires per cycle. (There are a number of possible complications with how fire works, but just know that someone can die mysteriously.) **Immediately after each fire comes a thunder.** Someone will have a purple-ish debuff on them. That person needs to move away from the group so their debuff doesn't hit anyone when it explodes. After the first fire in, people should start spreading around while leaving the middle of the arena free. They'll be conveniently spread out for the fire out. Someone will get a red marker and go to the middle. The others will wait until they've dropped two black AoEs on the outside of the arena, then run to the middle to help share damage. (Then it's the last fire in. Remember?) After this, **the other half of the phase 4 cycle is divebombs.** You could probably skip it by killing the boss quickly enough, but since people will be dying left and right it most likely won't happen. Anyway, now's the time to have a side discussion about divebomb marking. &gt; I'm setting this part aside because you only need one divebomb marker, so you should try to recruit someone who already knows what to do. If you do want to try it for yourself, here's what you need to do. During the first half of the cycle (when you're doing fire ins and outs), you'll need to look at the positions of the dragons flying around the arena, identify the pattern, and place the A and B ground markers accordingly so people can use them to bait the divebombs in safe directions. It's not as complicated as it sounds: face your camera to the north corner of the arena, pan clockwise, and place A between the first (which might be exactly north) and second dragon you see. Place B to the side of the third dragon. Hopefully the A and B markers will have been properly placed along the edge of the arena. **Everyone should get close-ish to A for now.** Someone will get a divebomb marker (same as in T5), that person should run to A, then run back to the middle when the marker disappears. **Everyone else should move to the other half of the arena,** and the person who gets the second marker should run to B, and then back when it disappears. That's it! the boss will cycle these two blocks until you kill her. -------- **Turn 10 (Final Coil Turn 1)** Difficulty: A4 (story). Having two tanks is recommended. The basic formation is spread out, avoiding the front (massive cleave) and back (massive tail cone) of the boss. Adds called Sons and Daughters of Imdugud will spawn at set points in the fight while Imdugud himself takes a break (meaning both tanks are free while you kill them). The tanks should each grab a pair of adds so Daughters stay away from other Daughters and Sons stay away from other Sons. People will sometimes get red markers on their head with an assorted debuff. Healers should shield them so the followup attack does 0 damage. Scholars and nocturnal ASTs can use their AoE shield to cover everyone at once. As the fight progresses you'll start seeing more and more of the actual main mechanic, which can be summarized like this: lightning will fall and hit a few people (with splash damage, that's why you stay spread out), giving them a vulnerability debuff. Then something will happen that requires people to share damage. If you were hit by lightning, stay away. If you weren't, go help. There are two possible share-damage mechanics. Usually, someone will get a blue marker on their head, and place themselves some distance behind the boss. Able-bodied party members will stack between the boss and the target to absorb the incoming charge. The rarer mechanic is a lightning tether that'll tie someone to the boss. That person is going to explode in an AoE that must be shared with 1-2 others. Once in a blue moon you'll see the tether and the charge at the same time, but with no lightning fall. In this case have 1-2 people help with the tether first, then everyone else help with the charge. -------- **Turn 11** Difficulty: Bismarck EX. Two tanks are **required** here. Another vanilla turn where the strat is basically the same as level 50. **Place the three ground markers (A, B and C) around the center of the arena,** in places that'd correspond to Kaliya's back (A), left side (B) and right side (C) if it were actually in the middle. It's not really there right now; that's okay, the markers will only matter in the phase 3. **The two tanks should always stand in front of the boss together,** while the rest of the party will be in melee range (this is *required* in order to deal damage in the phase 3), preferably stacked neatly under the tail although this isn't necessary. Kaliya will deploy a field under itself that'll hit you with Heavy if you step inside its hitbox. This makes T11 one of the few fights where that target-lock feature thing is useful. Blue AoEs will start as soon as the fight start. **There's a ""right"" way to dodge them that'll become very important in phase 3,** so get used to the dance now: * dodge the little cone to the left, * dodge the big AoEs to the closest side, * get back in position after each AoE and before the next. **When you see/hear Kaliya fire two shots into the air, look at your party members.** If you see a target marker on someone, it's stack first, then spread. If the marker hasn't appeared yet, it's spread then stack. Each cycle, Kaliya will stun the MT and **use a skill called Secondary Head** that'll give them a special debuff. If the follow-up attack hits them, they die. The OT should Provoke during the Secondary Head cast, that way the debuff will land on the MT but the attack will hit the OT. The MT can then Provoke again as soon as their stun wears off (or the two can swap roles until the next head, it doesn't make any difference). **The phase will end at 60%** and Kaliya will run to the center (careful that it doesn't run you over), deploy an instant-kill field, and go AFK. Three adds will spawn: an egg-shaped one in the south, a cube in the northwest, and a sphere in the northeast. The egg will slowly move counterclockwise around the arena; the tanks need to each grab one of the other two adds and match the egg's movement (if two adds get too close to each other you're hosed). Meanwhile most of the party attacks the sphere (some people should stand close to it to help share some damage) while a caster and maybe another ranged attack the cube. **The goal is to kill them at the same time** (+- 10 seconds at most). **A thunder debuff** (the same as T9 phase 4) will randomly appear throughout this phase, so try not to get your mates paralyzed. Once the sphere and cube are down everyone switches to the egg (you need to be next to it to deal damage), kills it, then **everyone goes to A** except the tanks who move to the opposite side. Phase 3 is made up of mostly the same stuff as phase 1 (AoEs, spread/stack, secondary head) with **one very big difference: tethers.** Two people will be tied by a blue/black line. Two other people will be tied by a green/red line. If you're tethered and you move too far away from your partner, you'll stack vulnerabilities and eventually die. Same if you get too close to a member of the other pair. The two tanks can only ever be tied to each other, if you were worried about that. When the tethers are being established, they'll appears between the boss and each target, instead of between the targets. Use this time to identify what's going on and react accordingly (it helps to spread out a bit so you can see who's actually tethered). * **If the tanks have a tether,** the other pair stay in A (i.e. behind the boss) * **If the tanks don't have a tether,** that means two pairs of DPS/healers. The pair with the green tether go to B, the pair with the blue one go to C (notice the colors match). Everyone else should also be standing exactly on one of the markers. Yes, I know you're a melee and you want to be on the diagonal. I'm a monk too. But seriously, if this is your first time, just forget positionals and stay in place. The little dance you learned comes in handy here. It allows you to always dodge in the same direction as your partner, and to never get too close to the other group. The stack/spread mechanic needs to be handled a bit differently now. If you're tethered, just stay with your partner on spread, it's not a big deal. The people without tethers will need to move around on stack to ensure that the damage gets shared. -------- **Turn 12 (Final Coil Turn 3)** Difficulty: Alex 4 (story). Two tanks are recommended. Place the three ground markers east, south and west of the middle (close enough that melee can hit the boss in the middle from one of the marks, but no closer). The position is a bit finicky so leave it to an experienced player if you can. MT pulls the boss to the middle, then stands to the north (where there's no marker). **Swap tanks after each Revelation** (tank buster, with a debuff that will kill you if you eat two in a row). If you only have one tank, that's okay, you just need enough DPS to reach phase 3 before the second Revelation. **Phase one:** when the boss casts Blackfire, healers must stand in B, DPS in C and OT in A (or whatever arrangement your group uses; if you have no OT send in the MT instead). Stay on your marker until a black flame spawns under you, then move away (don't touch the flames after this). Some people will get white AoEs around them, use them to hit the flames and debuff them, then you can kill the flames with an AoE sneeze. Kill the Bennu where it spawns. If you get a second one, it's cleaner to kill it away from the first one's corpse - but I'm not sure it matters at this point. **Phase two:** have the two healers stand close to each other and away from the rest of the group. If you only have one healer, send a ranged DPS with them; I'll call them ""the healers"" anyway. At the start of the phase someone will get a funky green-or-purple debuff; they need to pass that debuff to a healer by running into them (unless it's on a healer from the start; then awesome). The boss will regularly cast Flames of Unforgiveness, and every time he does the healers need to run into each other to swap the debuff during the cast. They'll take damage when the swap occurs, then again at the end of the cast - it's going to hurt a bit. Meanwhile, someone will get a blue marker, and drop it some distance away from the boss but not too far either. It'll create a blue AoE that'll eventually condense into a small ice pool. The boss will then spawn a red fireball tethered to someone, that person should run into the pool, grab the buff, then run into the fireball. Everyone else should stay the hell away. (Alternatively, an experienced player will volunteer to handle getting the buff and intercepting people's fireballs.) **The next phase** starts when the boss goes invincible. The Bennus will come back to life, and then come back to life again after you kill them, and the whole thing will be kind of underwhelming because you'll only have 1-2 of them, 3 at most compared to the 4-5 the fight is tuned around. Every time you kill a small Bennu, try to move the others away so they don't get buffed when it revives. Not that it's a big deal if you don't. **When you're done with the Bennus** the boss will come back into the fight. Bring the green/purple debuff to the healers again, they'll handle it like in phase 2. Ignore everything else, and finish the boss. If your DPS is slow you'll be treated to an unremarkable AoE phase and the cycle will rewind. -------- **Turn 13 (Final Coil Turn 4)** Difficulty: Alex 4 (story). Two tanks are recommended. Put the A marker right in the middle of the arena, it'll be useful. The moves which the boss uses in phase 1 are actually used throughout the fight: * Megaflare is a cute little dance. Stand somewhere other than behind the boss, drop AoEs, move out of them, then the people with a white marker (all of them, and only them) meet on A to share damage. In later phases one or two towers will also spawn. Someone needs to stand in them so they don't explode. * Earthshaker targets two people who get markers on their heads. These people should each move to the edge on one side of the boss, drop their three puddles, and come back. * Gigaflare is used on phase transitions, and as part of the final phase cycle. It hits everyone and it kind of hurts. Phase 2 begins with an add, which you kill where it stands. Orbs will spawn with a tether to someone; anyone caught in their blast will get a stack of stuff. Try to intercept orbs so that the stacks aren't all on the same person (2-3 is okay, more hurts). If your DPS is slow you might see a Megaflare in this phase too. When the boss flies away, stack in the middle of the arena (conveniently there's an A there). The boss will reappear somewhere outside of the arena; home your camera in on him. When the red divebomb marker appears, do nothing. When the green marker appears, run straight toward the boss and pray that enough people in your party will be performing the actual strat instead. This is followed by a Megaflare, same deal as usual. Wreck the adds as they spawn. The Pain of Meracydia (green) will switch between being immune to physical and magical damage; just wreck it too. After this is a second divebomb-&gt;megaflare phase (same deal) and more adds to wreck (yeah Twintania is an add now). Finally, the third and final divebomb-&gt;megaflare is a bit different because there's no green marker anymore. That was Twintania and she's indisposed now. Just get moving on the red marker instead. After Megaflare, go chill out in the Neurolink, shield up, watch the fireworks and prepare for the final phase, which is similar to the first one with two key differences: * The boss now uses Akh Morn, the ultimate tank buster. If you have two tanks, they can take it together for manageable damage. If you only have one tank you'll need to grit your teeth here. * Every Megaflare and Earthshaker will come with a pair of tethers. The tethered people will cause a whirlwind, pushing everyone around them straight into the wall. It's easiest if the tanks can grab the tethers, but if not just deal with them intelligently. -------- DISCLAIMER: I haven't tried all the cheese strats I mention. Feedback and suggestions are highly appreciated and I'll keep updating this post if needed. EDIT: Edits, also redid T12, assuming solo tank this time. Reworded a certain sentence so even those of you who can't read can enjoy a salt-free experience."

177,vulnerability,ffxiv,HW's EX Primals: A BLM Retrospective,0,3f3tsn,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3f3tsn/hws_ex_primals_a_blm_retrospective/,2015-07-30 11:34:02,"Just thought I'd pass on my experience over the past month, and hopefully pass on some wisdom for any BLMs struggling with the new EX Primals. BISMARCK When Bismarck dropped, parties in PF steadily increased-- i155 on my first day of unlocking it, but by the end of the week it had jumped to i165-i170. Which was frustrating, as I was hoping my EX Roulette weapon (Baldur's Rod) would carry me through to get the Expanse Rod/Polearm, but this was not the case. I steadily grinded my way to i170, buying the Law gear and upgrading as needed, but I was still struggling. So what I did was always focus down the East bird add first. If procs weren't on my side, it takes a full ARR rotation to kill the first bird add, and when I Blizzard 3 the second bird add, it was usually around 50%-- this is also roughly when Dragonkillers are up. Toss another Thunder, maybe Fire3 &gt; Fire if it's not dropping, but it's really best to be at full MP before getting on Bismarck, so after the Thunder on Bird2, I spammed Blizzard or Scathe whilst getting into position. My Chitin rotation served me well: Enochian right before getting on his back &gt; Ley Lines &gt; Fire 3 &gt; Sharpcast Fire&gt; Fire 4 &gt; Fire 4 &gt; Fire 4 &gt; Firestarter&gt; Fire 4 &gt; Swiftcast &gt; Flare (you can use Fire IV again, if you have the MP for it) Later on, the Swiftcast &gt; Flare became unnecessary, if DPS was good throughout the party. If I Swiftcast &gt; Flare, and the Chitin is still around 10%, then it's probably someone else in the party not carrying their weight. Next up we have snake adds, and this is where my DPS always plummeted. I stood in the middle of the map, so tornados always jacked my day. Enochian would fall off before being refreshed at all and I was singled out by the parsers for my micropenis DPS. And then some kind soul informed me that if you stand on the patch of green where you get on Bismarck's back, tornados wouldn't hit. And they didn't. So my DPS improved and snakes were no longer an issue. You still have to watch out for waterbombs, but Manaward mitigates some of that okay. Weather phase, my party always killed the birds in this order: Middle &gt; Large &gt; Small. Typically, the tank that isn't getting on Bismarck's back can handle the small add on their own. The important thing is to watch the Turbulence/Whaleback stacks. IT IS NOT SAFE TO GET ON HIS BACK WITH ONE SECOND REMAINING. Stay off until the debuff falls completely, then get on and wreak havoc. Another important side note: even if nobody can get on his back due to stacks, it's still very important to use the Dragonkillers every time they're available. And you'll want to melee LB3 the Corona as soon as feasibly possible. RAVANA So this was supposed to be the fight where us BLMs shine, and it is-- we have it so easy, seeing as we don't have to deal with Seeing Wings/Left/Right and all that nonsense. But still, PF being what it is, it still took me some time. So as the tank pulls, cast Thunder and move into your normal rotation. You really don't have to move from the starting point at all until Ravana jumps and you move mid, then spread out for the purple puddles. When he lands, toss another Thunder as he starts Liberation. For some reason, I've noticed Ravvy's hitbox likes to swivel a couple times before deciding on how he wants to stand, so the Thunder lets him get situated before you join the group at his butt. No need to go full Enochian here, as it just falls off during his Ifrit charges. Feel free to do some auto-attacking here since you're so close to him. Another thing-- after Liberation cast goes off and he jumps, step forward and stand where Ravana jumped. When his clones drop, there's a wide explosion as each one drops, and those drops cause Vulnerability. So once he vanishes, step into the spot in the exact middle of the arena to avoid this. Don't start charging when one clone drops-- SPRINT AFTER THE SECOND CLONE DROPS, and that way you won't accidentally catch Vuln with your guesswork. Next up is Warlord Shell, and by now all your CDs will be back up and I recommend blowing them all. I'd save Raging Strikes though, as Butterflies/Ghanas are forthcoming. You should be refreshing Enochian just as Ghanas the drop. Toss a Fire 4 (or a Fire, if you need to refresh AF) at a butterfly, then move on and try to get a hit on each Spirit Ghana until Moon Ghana shows up, then go to town. Hopefully, your melees will be bright enough to pick off the Ghanas with low health, while you can burn down the Moon Ghanas since their HP pool is larger, and you don't want your cast times getting interrupted by trying to kill a Spirit Ghana that is already being taken care of. Next up, we've got Prey, so just hang out after Laughing Rose and be ready to pass it to the tank, if need be. After four waves or so, get back into Umbral Ice, move to your stack spot for orbs, and as your team carries the orbs around the edge, Scathe the shit out of Ravana. For Swift Lib, go to town on him again, but keep an eye out for the sword indicators. If you don't have one, head to D/unmarked before the cast finishes or you're getting a Vuln. Handle Swift/Final Lib accordingly. Then the mechanics will repeat with another Warlord Shell, so break the shit out of that and handle the rest as you did before. For the last Scorpion phase, Ravvy should be around 10-15%, so pop all your cooldowns, Fire IV him into oblivion and enjoy your new totem. I was having some trouble with Swift/Final Lib, but Klife Kepler's SNES-style Youtube tutorials were a godsend. I generally gravitated towards BC as a quad, since it's so close to the start point (ie, minimal movement), and it was my go-to spot for Shiva, but I actually cleared it (multiple times) by going AD. No matter your quad, just be sure to never, EVER stand anywhere remotely in front of Ravana, or you'll surely get a Tapasya to the face, and that's never fun. I hope this helps a few folks. With Bismarck, my failures were my own, and I did research and course-corrected. With Ravana, though despite the fight being easy on BLMs, melee isn't as lucky, so just bear that in mind and be kind. Take care of each other out there!"

180,vulnerability,ffxiv,So many oGCD abilities...(DRK related mostly),0,3g6z43,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3g6z43/so_many_ogcd_abilitiesdrk_related_mostly/,2015-08-08 10:34:52,"Hello. For reference I am still technically a ""new"" player (I only played the first month of ARR and returned a few weeks ago), I have Monk at 50, Ninja at 51, and now DRK at 55. This isn't so much a complaint but more an inquiry of how to manage the issue. I find that at on my highest lvl character (my DRK) that there are just a slew of oGCD abilities that make the rotation feel more garbled than have any sense of flow. I'm a tank class and I enjoy tanking as DRK so many of them make sense such as defensive CDs. To my (admittedly not so great with names) memory I have... - Foresight: 20% physical reduction - DRK 20% reduction - DRK 30% reduction - Awareness: 15% reduction of chance to get crit, I believe? - Convalescence: Increased healing potency on me - Magic vulnerability reduction by 15% - Bloodbath: Heal a little bit based on damage dealt - Stun for 3 seconds - Cone damage AOE - Some Jump skill which just does damage All of these have varying (and in some cases the same) CD times of course, but it just feels like bloat... When I get in to a dangerous situation as a tank, I'm going to feel like I want to pop a defensive CD. The problem is I have like a jillion of them, and also that some of them seem better than the others. For example, 30% damage reduction sounds much more likely to save me than a little bit of healing per hit. Heck, 30% damage reduction is more likely to save than 20% damage reduction (I don't understand the redundancy between these two skills...). Why not always just put them together for a 50% reduction? How do you make the discernment between when you need 20% or 30% reduction, or when 50% reduction might be of better use? How do I even know when 15% reduced chance to crit me is even going to be effective aside from just popping it whenever it's off CD on a boss? It just feels like...a bloated amount of choices that muddles the flow of my button presses through any given encounter, and none of the skills seem to have enough situational integrity within the design of the skill to make it obvious that there is a certain moment that this skill is best popped. It feels like ""well here's your skills and like, read 'em, and then go wild"". The stun and the cone damage seem to have their obvious situational uses. The stun for...a stun. The cone damage for AoE tanking. However these skills do **damage**, which would seemingly make them useful popped whenever possible as well. For fights with strong DPS checks, damage is never bad, so I count these as being in the muddle too. One might say it's good to always have options so you can always pop *something* but in a lot of cases it makes more sense to pop &amp; stack multiple CDs together, since FFXIV doesn't appear to allow ghosting however, you can only pop maybe 2 (maybe 3 if I didn't play on a server that gave me high latency) before you're interfering with your GCD rotation. It feels like there's just one moment where I have to pop 10 oGCDs all at the same time just to put them back on CD before resuming my normal rotation. For the record, I'm not counting Dark Arts, I just think of it as a cold blood without a CD so it's automatically always used before the combo finisher. I felt like I had this issue with Ninja as well. The mudras especially just feel so janky and clunky, especially with some sort of inherent ""lag"" where sometimes the presses don't register at the speed I want them to, so I either bunny hat the mudra or pick the wrong one to save face. This goes for Kosetsu as well, even that skill feels like it activates oddly on its own schedule without any regard for consistency. At least aside from that I only felt like B4B and Internal Release were the only 2 CDs outside of the mudra combos that gave had a purpose and it was clear that I wanted to pop them as much as possible, or save them for burn phases coming up soon. With the DRK it just feels like I have a ridiculous amount of spells all bearing somewhat similar utility (live longer) that I don't know how to differentiate which is best used without just saying ""f it"" and using all of them at the same time in a moment where survival is key. So basically, I'm asking essentially two separate questions with the same end goal in mind: to figure out how to properly manage the litany of oGCD CDs I have. 1. This question is aimed at other DRK players. Are there ""best"" combinations of defensive CDs out there or certain rhythms that are best played at that help to manage all those CDs? 2. The is aimed at anyone, does anyone else feel somewhat ""overwhelmed"" by the amount of skills that are seemingly necessary to optimize a rotation? I mean it's not impossible, I'm still doing it, just feels really tiring that's all. How did you overcome it or maybe it never felt like too much to you in the first place...? Any advice would be great! Thanks for reading along with me."

The other part to this is more asking for opinions; I'm an i190 ninja trying to decide if I should get in the Gobwalker or go as an i180 summoner (Hive weapon) and have our monk get in the Gobwalker. It worries me that we wouldn't have any melee if I went summoner and he got in the car, but from what I've read Vulnerability Up + Bane is just too good. Thanks! "

183,vulnerability,ffxiv,Diabolos - Warrior of Darkness,0,3hk3wg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3hk3wg/diabolos_warrior_of_darkness/,2015-08-19 17:52:00,"I was bored so I thought I'd post this here.... Diabolos Diabolos is angry about is only appearance in Lost City and the fact that he doesn't have a triple triad card so he teams up with the Ascians which merge him with the warrior of darkness. Diabolos rides into battle on his mount, Fenrir, who is equally as mad about the same issues. Players much first defeat Fenrir. * Phase 1: Diabolos will cast nightmare once a minute, causing all players to fall asleep but one DPS. Players will be outlined with darkness and a timer starts. The DPS must kill the outline to free a player from the Nightmare. Any players not freed from the nightmare will be cloned in darkness and Fenrir and Diabolos become immune until all clones are defeated. Healer clones will heal Fenrir and Diabolos. Clones will use all abilities of a party member smartly, including benediction. * Fenrir will be the only one targetable during phase 1. Fenrir Mechanics: * Eclipse Howl: Deals raid wide damage, places determination down on four random party members that lasts 60 seconds and can be esuna'd. * Lunar Bite: 4 Hit tank buster that must be tank swap halfway through. * Eternal Darkness: Fenrir will run to the middle of the arena and howl at the moon. Players must locate the moon to see what phase its in. Then they must stand on one of four matching tiles on the ground to avoid being killed instantly and replaced with a shadow clone. * Lunar Roar: Has different effects based on the moon. New moon - Damage heals Fenrir Waxing moon - Damage is reflected back to the attacker. Full Moon - Heals damage instead of heal. Waning Moon - Heals reflect back damaging caster. Lasts 10 seconds. * Moon Shift: Fenrir changes the phase of the moon. * Phase 2: Upon reaching 50% Diabolos will dismount Fenrir and become targetable. * Fenrir will repeat the same mechanics, but Diabolos must now be tanked by the Off tank and has a few new abilities while continuing his nightmare cast. A tank swap is still required for Lunar Bite. * Noctowave - Used during Eternal Darkness. Knocks back players pulsating three times. * Noctoshield - Places a stoneskin like effect on Fenrir. Mitigates and reflects either magical or physical damage. * Pain - Selects four players. Each player receives a mark, after three seconds and orb is dropped on the player, pulsating an AoE that applies vulnerability up and high damage. * Phase 3: When Fenrir reaches 10% he appears stunned. Diabolos must then reach 50% before 20 seconds passes or he will heal Fenrir 50%. If Diabolos reaches 50% before Fenrir reaches 10% he will heal full instantly. Diabolos will fly into the air and cast eternal nightmare. Everyone, including Fenrir will fall asleep. Diabolos will then consume fenrir and heal his missing health. Then all 8 players will start glowing black and a copy of each of them will appear, looking exactly like your character, glowing black. Allies will no longer become targetable, only healable through AoEs. Allies can now receive damage from friendly fire. The clones must be killed within a time limit or they will consume and kill their copy instantly and multiply in strength. * After the clones are defeated, phase 4 triggers. Diabolos re-enters the arena with new mechanics. He will now cast Nightmare every 45 seconds. For every clone alive more than 10 seconds he will then receive a permanent damage boost. * Chaos strike - Applies a random amount of vulnerability stacks on current target ranging from 1-5. * Demi - Removes a random percentage from the raids max HP ranging from 10-90% * Eternal Slumber - Places an DoT on a random party member. Every 3 ticks the DoT increases in potency, gaining a stack. It can be transferred to other players, lowering the stack by 1. Cannot be removed. Persists until party wipes. * Darkness - Fills the arena with blackness with two safe spots. Then sucks in the party and launches them in random directions. Shortly after the darkness explodes dealing damage. Players with the DoT must go to one safe area, players without it must go to the other."
184,vulnerability,ffxiv,FFLogs Help - Need raw logs for testing!,102,3idfo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3idfo6/fflogs_help_need_raw_logs_for_testing/,2015-08-26 05:42:11,"Hello everyone. This is Kihra, the creator of FF Logs. I am working on improving the accuracy of the ffLogs.com site, but to do that, I really need raw logs for testing. In order for the site to ""git gud"", there are a number of issues I need to address, and to do that, I need raw logs from folks. Here are some of the raw logs that I need: (1) Machinist Wildfire - I need a raw log file where a machinist uses Wildfire so that I can verify that the code I added for this works correctly. (2) Astrologian Collective Unconscious - I need a log file where this ability is used to Regen. (3) If you have a raw log file that fails to recognize bosses (e.g., Oppressor is miscategorized as a trash fight), I need that file to try to figure out why this is happening. (4) If you have a raw log file that fails to recognize players but categorizes them as NPCs instead, then I need an example of that also! (5) If you have a file in a language other than English that is malfunctioning, I could use that also. (6) Target Dummy Tests For various classes, I need to understand how DoTs interact with various buffs and debuffs. If you just plain know the answer to the question of how your own buffs/debuffs affect DoTs, then you could just say that here in the responses. In order for DoT/HoT simulation to get more accurate, I need to have a clear picture of which debuffs increase DoT damage and which don't, and the best way to see that is with DoTs applied to a target dummy both before and after debuffs. Allow the DoTS to tick some before applying the debuff and re-applying the DoT. (7) Ravana Test I need a static to do some tests on Ravana. It is my belief (from eyeballing logs) that DoTs actually update ""live"" in response to Ravana's increased/decreased damage phases (meaning ACT is probably computing incorrect results right now on this fight), but in order to test that I need someone to do a test where you put the same DoT up both before and after the increased damage phase, so I can see if the expected tick amount changes or not. Ideally this test would be done without putting up a zillion DoTs, e.g., just have one person put up their DoT, and then we could see what the result is. This test could be uploaded to the site, so I don't need a raw log file for it. (8) Alexander Floor 2 Test I need to understand how the Vulnerability debuff that the Gobwalker puts on mobs affects the expected tick amount of DoTs. This should be a fairly easy test. Basically I just need a log where a single person applies his DoT repeatedly to the same mob while the gobwalker adds Vulnerability stacks to the mob, e.g., so just Apply DoT and let it tick! -&gt; Apply Vuln -&gt; Apply DoT Again and let it tick! -&gt; Apply Vuln(2) -&gt; Apply DoT again and let it tick! -&gt; Apply Vuln (3) -&gt; etc. Again, this test could be uploaded to the site, and I don't need the raw log file. (9) Alexander Floor 3 Savage Test I need to know the severity of the reduced damage and healing debuffs on players. If you know the answer to this, let me know. (10) Anything else! If you see any other bugs, issues or glitches besides the ones I mentioned above, feel free to let me know. Thanks in advance. The only way this site is going to get to the point where the DoT/HoT numbers are really reliable is with help from the community. Without test files and help, there is only so much I can do on my own. :) "
185,vulnerability,ffxiv,Question for Level 60 Astrologians,5,3bmqtq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3bmqtq/question_for_level_60_astrologians/,2015-06-30 23:53:44,"Hi everyone. So, I recently got Astro to level 60. As of current, my item level is 163. My PIE is 530 = 12,626 MP. I find that I am running out of MP pretty quickly during the final bosses of the new dungeons, especially Fractal. I am actually sometimes holding a Ewer just for the last boss of Fractal to be safe. Last night I ran with my 3 friends; Paladin, Bard, and Summoner, and I completely ran out of MP towards the end. I was in Nocturnal Stance. Granted, the fight lasted a lot longer than usual because the DPS wasn't very good. I don't think either of them got over 750 DPS. That boss has quite a bit of AOE damage and having to Exalted Detriment the debuff off requires quite a bit of MP. The DPS did get hit a few times with a vulnerability debuff too, so that lead to some extra shielding and healing. In general I feel that when I run things on WHM it is a lot easier to manage my MP than it is for Astro, but it could just be because I'm new to the class. I am using LA as much as I can. Is anyone else having similar problems? Any input would be appreciated. :) Thanks! "
186,vulnerability,ffxiv,Why Dark Knight Is Bad,6,3btw0a,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3btw0a/why_dark_knight_is_bad/,2015-07-02 12:52:30,"This is gonna be long. **INTRODUCTION**- To begin with, I'd like to start off by saying a bit about myself and my experiences. I was a PLD main in A Realm Reborn and cleared all of coil as a main tank. I had been looking forward to DRK ever since I saw a concept art picture on some wiki page somewhere. When Heavensward finally launched the first thing I did was go to Ishgard and pick up DRK and rush to 50 and ended up reaching 60 with DRK on the 23rd. I find the job extremely fun to play. I have geared up to i180 and cleared Bismarck EX and attempted Ravana EX as DRK on top of doing every new dungeon. I've been seeing a lot of people who seem to have the idea that DRK doesn't suck or haven't seen evidence of such claims, so I'd like to help people see reason and prevent the ignorant thralls from convincing anyone that this job is acceptable in its current state. I'd like to say that DRK would have been *alright* if this was still 2.55. However, with the new PLD and WAR abilities on top of what they already had, DRK doesn't stand a chance in its current state. Before I go off into a rant about all of DRKs abilities and how they compare to PLD and WAR, I'd like to say what DRK is good at: **DARK KNIGHT IS THE KING OF THE DUNGEON.** DRK has magnificent AoE abilities that can dish out solid damage and also help with mitigation to keep you alive whilst you whoop upon the asses of all who stand in your way. Using *Dark Arts* (DA) with *Dark Dance* grants 20% evasion on top of 30% parry for 20 seconds. If you combine this with DA *Dark Passenger* you also blind all targets hit for 15 seconds. So pretty much for 15 seconds you become a god who cannot be touched by the worthless mortals flocking around you. Then there is DA *Abyssal Drain*. Empowering this AoE 120 potency attack causes it to heal for 100% of damage dealt, and from my experience with around i170 it heals for about 300 for EACH enemy. In a group of 5-6 enemies thats pretty much curing yourself while doing 600-720 potency worth of damage. Using *Blood Price* allows you to spam this for 15 seconds without running out of MP. Last but not least is *Salted Earth*. This lovely little ground placed AoE DoT has a potency of 75 and lasts 21 seconds. Its pretty significant damage. Okay, that may have been a little biased, but DRK is hella fun in dungeons. (when its not bugged) () ONWARDS! I am going to separate the three tank jobs into three categories to discuss and compare: Mitigation, Utility, and Damage. **MITIGATION**- For the sake of making this shorter I'm just going to compare PLD and DRK for the mitigation section since they both fill the main tank role. *PALADIN*- SHIELD OATH GRANTS 20% DAMAGE REDUCTION * **A SHIELD**: Chance to mitigate every physical attack on top of parrying. * **Rampart**: 20% damage reduction for 20 seconds. 90 second cooldown. * **Sentinel**: 40% damage reduction for 10 seconds. 180 second cooldown. * **Bulwark**: 60% increased block rate for 15 seconds. 180 second cooldown. * **Sheltron**: Blocks the next physical attack and restore MP. 30 second cooldown. * **Hallowed Ground**: Impervious to most attacks for 10 seconds. 420 blaze it. 5 good defensive cooldowns on PLD on top of a shield. Not gonna explain much about this, speaks for itself. Everyone already knows PLD is the master of getting hit. I did not included the ones that can be cross classed, but for the record PLD has improved *Awareness* and *Convalescence* and WAR gets improved *Foresight*. *DARK KNIGHT*- GRIT GRANTS 20% DAMAGE REDUCTION * **Shadowskin**: 20% damage reduction for 20 seconds. 90 second cooldown. (Rampart clone) * **Shadow Wall**: 30% damage reduction for 10 seconds. 180 second cooldown. (Sentinel clone but worse) * **Dark Dance**: 30% increased parry rate +DA 20% evasion rate for 20 seconds. 60 second cooldown. * **Dark Mind**: 15% reduced magic vulnerability +DA 30% reduced vulnerabilityfor 10 seconds. 60 second cooldown. * **Living Dead**: 10 second period to ""die"" then another 10 seconds of being unable to go below 1 hp. If you don't get healed to full you die after the 10 seconds. 300 second cooldown. So let's talk about this. PLD and DRK both take passive 20% less damage. Alright cool. But then PLD also has a shield that can block extra damage AND has better cooldowns. PLD's *Sheltron* is a guaranteed block every 30 seconds. This is amazing. *Sentinel* is just flat out better than *Shadow Wall*. Then there is *Dark Dance*, which is fine and dandy for overall mitigation throughout the fight (even though parry sucks), but is too unreliable and insignificant to actually rely on. *Bulwark* offers a higher rate of mitigation and a higher potency than *Dark Dance* (blocking prevents more than parrying). Also, for *Dark Dance*, correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think evasion can effect raid bosses. *Living Dead* is an awkward version of *Holmgang* that forces a *Benediction* or extreme healing for a longer cooldown and less utility (Yes, I know it lasts longer. Not worth). And last but not least, *Dark Mind*. This is actually pretty good, but only if there is significant magic damage. Hopefully there will be in Alexander. We shall see. Summary: DRK and PLD are similar but PLD has better cooldowns and the added perk of being able to block (which is huge). I often see people say DRK can mitigate just as well as a PLD, which is just statistically incorrect. Can they get by? Sure. Are they as efficient as a PLD? No. The only time a DRK can outshine a PLD is if it is a magic heavy fight. **UTILITY**- I'm going to show what PLD and WAR can offer compared to what a DRK can offer. *PALADIN*- * **Tempered Will**: Cures bind and heavy and prevents knockbacks/draw-ins. 180 second cooldown. (DRK has no ability like this) * **Rage of Halone**: Reduces targets strength by 10% for 20 seconds. 3 part combo. * **Spirits Within**: 300 potency max attack (scales with HP) and a silence. 30 second cooldown. * **Shield Swipe**: 6 second pacification after blocking an attack. On GCD. * **Flash**: 12 second AoE blind. * **Cover**: Redirect physical damage on target player to the paladin for 12 seconds. 120 second cooldown. * **Clemency**: 1200 cure on target. 50% heal on self if cast on party member. 3 second cast. * **Divine Veil**: After being healed, all nearby party members get a shield for 10% of the PLDs max HP for 15 seconds. 150 second cooldown. PLD gets a 10% strength down debuff (most encounter dps is physical), various tools for protecting their party and themselves, and a bitchin' heal. It can't be spammed or anything, but I've heard that sucker heals for 4-5k. PLD brings a lot to the table. PLD can also cross class *Stoneskin* for even more additional utility and mitigation. Blinding and pacification are generally ineffective against raid bosses though. *WARRIOR*- * **Storm's Eye**: Reduces slashing resist by 10% and healing recovery by 20% for 20 seconds. 3 part combo. * **Storm's Path**: Reduces targets damage by 10% for 20 seconds. 3 part combo. * **Holmgang**: Draws target towards user and binds both. Most attacks cannot reduce health below 1 hp. 180 second cooldown. * **Equilibrium**: 1200 potency self heal or 200 TP self heal. 60 second cooldown. WAR has less abilities that bring utility, but they are crazy good. *Storm's Eye* is a great debuff and having the tank use it can boost a NINs dps. *Storm's Path* is a great overall 10% damage reduction. Equilibrium is a crazy good heal and only on a 60 second cooldown. That's pretty short. *Holmgang's* utility is however more or less useless against bosses though. *DARK KNIGHT*- * **Delirium**- Reduces targets intelligence by 10% for 20 seconds. 3 part combo. * **Reprisal**- Reduce targets damage by 10% for 20 seconds. Can only be used after parrying an attack. 30 second cooldown. * **Dark Passenger**: 15 second blind when used with **Dark Arts**. 30 second cooldown. * **Plunge**: Gap closer. If this counts. 30 second cooldown. This might seem alright at a glance, but let me tell you why all this sucks. *Delirium* gets overwritten by *Dragon Kick* because *Dragon Kick* also reduces blunt resistance by 10%. So if your group has a MNK *Delirium* is going to be useless most of the time, and last time I checked most groups have a MNK. I know mine does. Onto *Reprisal*. At first I loved this ability. It was everything I thought *Shield Swipe* should have been (before it got buffed, it was useless before). However, I then realized that in a single boss scenario its unreliable and inconsistent. The only way to amend this is to stack as much parry as possible to get plenty of procs, but that is a horrible idea. Parry is shit. Now is the extra shit I added to try to make DRK look better, but its really not. *Dark Passenger* is useless against bosses and not even worth the massive MP cost of using it with *Dark Arts*. Then there is *Plunge*. I love *Plunge*, its fun, but not actually that useful. Just convenient for the user. In terms of a heal, the only real heal that DRK can bring single target is a DA *Souleater* finisher which only heals for around 1000. Summary: PLD and WAR have great utility and heals that can help the entire raid while DRK has only a few and are useless most of the time. **DAMAGE**- I wanted to go into more details with this but I'm going to keep it short because this post is getting really long. WAR does more damage than DRK and can sustain TP much longer. DRK runs out of TP in 3 minutes while WAR can keep going with *Equilibrium* for 8+ minutes. Also I've heard that PLD can pull numbers close to a DRK in *Sword Oath*, I have not seen this yet though. DRK can probably do more damage as main tank than a PLD can, but at great cost to overall utility and healer strain. DRKs damage is also highly dependent on the ability to manage MP. Which is determined by how useful *Blood Price* can be (number of hits by boss) and if there is a target to use *Sole Survivor* on (20% mp on kill). Perhaps an add. **CONCLUSION**- The best combination for tanking is still PLD/WAR, simply because DRK cannot compare to either. PLD takes less damage overall with blocking, more ways to mitigate damage, and brings more utility than a DRK. WAR brings more DPS and utility than a DRK can, and half its utility can't be used as off-tank (cannot proc *Reprisal*) even though its useless most of the time anyway. DRK *can* manage content but its vastly outmatched in every way by the other two tanks that it becomes pointless to bring one. I wouldn't even consider a DRK for Alexander Savage unless there is a magic heavy fight like Ramuh or something. DRK also excels in group/AoE scenarios but for the for most raid content this isn't relevant. **EXTRA SHIT**- I would go into what SE could do to fix DRKs issues, but this is way too long already so maybe another post. If you disagree with anything or have ideas of your own I'd like to hear it. I made this for purely informational purposes so people could see the differences and reality about the current state of this job. May be a bit biased because I'm annoyed, but the differences are true nonetheless. Does your static have a monk?

Only ran through it once. **Floor 1**: 1. DPS drag and kill at least one add under each missiles to shrink them down (location is marked by a laser). 2. Second boss show up after 2(?) minutes, and has to be tanked on opposite edge of the arena 3. Both bosses need to be killed at the same time (~15 second apart). **Floor 2**: 1. There is 7 waves of enemies , with two vehicles (blue magitek gobwalker) 2. Magitek pilots can drag bombs away and debuff tougher enemies with ""vulnerability Up"" debuff. Use one at the beginning, and another later when the first one run out of energy. Drain ability only works on enemies's magitek. 3. Red Magitek Gobwalker need to be killed first (Vulnerability Up debuff). Doll Second (healing taken debuff) **Floor 3** 1. Human -&gt; Hands -&gt; Tornado phases are repeated twice, then it's the final phase. 2. **Human phase**: Avoid running in front of the boss, and spread out to avoid unnecessary splash damage 3. **Hand phase** Stand in the middle of the room to avoid the huge knockback AoE (will happen near the beginning of the phase). Tanks soaks the cleave together until a second hand appears. Offtank pick it up and point it away. 4. **Tornado** Kill every adds before they reach the edge (stunable). The single tether need to be taken by tanks and kited away. When two players get opposite debuff (negative/positive), they have to spread out. Same debuff mean stack in the middle. 5. Final phase: Mix of previous mechanics, with a ""tank swap"" (every 4-5 stacks) **Floor 4** 1. Every mechanics in this fights cause splash damage to nearby players. Spread out, avoid unnecessary movement, and don't soak more mechanics than you can take. 2. **In phase 1**, focus one leg down (the other is healed during transition), and let your tanks soak most exploding energy balls (if MT can keep aggro). When the legs release steam, stun them. 3. **In phase 2**, the little adds give stacking debuff that automatically kill you after 4 stacks (split dps and keep them away from each other). When someone get targeted by 3 tethers, try to intercept at least two. 4. **In phase 3**, keep your healers away from each other (they both have a contagious debuff) , keep your main tank in front of the boss (he will be targeted by powerful aoe), and be extra cautious with splash damage when you run near anyone. The move that follow Discoid (Perpetual Ray) is a ""tank buster"" that gain more hits as the fight goes (uses defensive CD)."

190,vulnerability,ffxiv,Not as TLDR as the TLDR Alexander guide but still sorta TLDR guide,55,3ckfwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3ckfwg/not_as_tldr_as_the_tldr_alexander_guide_but_still/,2015-07-09 02:38:07,"[Google Docs post here](URL Sorry if some of the info is wrong, but I've done the best I can! :) **THE FIST OF THE FATHER** For the first area, focus the main guy while leaving the OT to take the adds elsewhere to be ignored. Just burn the main guy down ASAP. For the boss fight, the first pair of Alarum can be taken away from people and killed anywhere. When the second boss joins the fray, it must be taken by the offtank to the other side of the arena. They must be tanked separately. Alarums have a different aggro function. Much like how the Renauds work in T7 in that they will have normal aggro behavior until someone hits them, which a line tether appears and will stick to them until either it or the target dies. This means that when they spawn, the DPS need to smack them at least once then they are free to drag them wherever they want. Note that if no one tags them, more than likely they will go straight to the healers. If you see one wandering around, that means a DPS didn't properly hit them (thanks /u/Angry_Robotics). Then on, the Alarums MUST be killed so the AoE they drop on death covers the two small lasers that appear on the arena. They start blue, then go red when a missile is fired. They're thin and vertical. If the missile hits the AoE dropped by an Alarum, it will deal no damage. Otherwise it's a wipe. You get four Alarums per laser phase; you only need two to die in the correct places as there will only ever be two lasers. The bosses do targeted AoE attacks as well as line AoEs. Avoid all AoEs. When the two bosses fly up, get as far away from their impact points as possible, or you'll likely die. Both bosses need to die within about 15 seconds of each other. *** **THE CUFF OF THE FATHER** This encounter isn't a boss, but a few waves of adds. There will be two goblin magitek armour machines that can be manned by players. Ideally send your lowest DPS there. Currently, the magitek armours are bugged and won't recharge (skill #5). I think the skill was supposed to work on mechanical adds. I found it easier to take one strider and leave the second one for when the first runs out of energy. **EDIT:** May not be bugged, reddit user said ""Use electroshock (strength down), then Recharge on non-mech mobs in order to regain ability points."" Need clarification on this. You can use Recharge on the red tanks when they're around 15% hp to regain some energy (thanks /u/Liaku). The magitek armours are used to stack vulnerability on adds and CC them. They also pull the bombs with the #4 skill. Use them to move the bombs away from the group, they do a large AoE when they explode. Approx 3.3k damage on a DPS, as well as a slow and stacking vulnerability. If you get out of a magitek armour, it WILL disappear. Only get out of it if it has run out of energy and you need the other one, or it's wasted. Not sure if they respawn. Use the magitek armours to stack vulnerability on the larger adds (can stack up to 5 times). They also have a cone AoE which causes Insanity on the goblins (not the machine adds). Move the Goblin Hardhelms and Hardminds away from the other adds, as they have an AoE -vuln buff (thanks /u/Sapphidia). Focus the red magitek armour as they stack vulnerability on their target. Then focus the Jagd Dolls (thanks /u/Bojack316). Try not to be tanking a Gobwalker and a Jagd at the same time, the incoming damage is insane. In the second to last phase, one tank should take the Gobwalker and the other the big spider and the Jagd. Burn the Gobwalker, then the Jagd, then the spider (thanks /u/Fencedude). *** **THE ARM OF THE FATHER** This encounter is a weird water boss thing. It starts in human form. Human &gt; Hands &gt; Tornado. Does that twice before entering the final phase. Human phase involves a lot of splash AoE. Spread out and make sure the people who get marked are spread out, as they will deal splash damage. After that, AoEs will appear under some people. Stay away from the front of the boss if you're not tanking. Hand phase. As soon as the boss enters this phase, everyone must stack in the middle. BUT, the tanks must stack together and face the hand AWAY from the group, as it cleaves. Need both tanks to take the cleave damage. The knockback only happens once at the beginning of each Hand phase. After a short while, another Hand will spawn. Offtank needs to take the second hand and face it away from maintank and the group, as it cleaves too. After the hand splits, the cleaves will start putting a blunt resistance down effect on the tanks, so the damage will ramp up quickly if they're not killed fast (thanks /u/jbniii). Tornado phase. The boss turns into an invulnerable tornado, so don't attack it. Kill all adds before they reach the edge of the arena. Stun and Heavy will work on them. Targeted AoEs (like WHM Aero 3) cast on the tornado will hit all of the adds if timed correctly just as they spawn (thanks /u/SchiferlED). If someone gets a tether on them, a tank must intercept the tether (which may take a second or two) and then take it away from the group, as the following attack causes splash damage. Two players will get a link with a positive or negative sign above their heads. If both are positive OR negative, the players must stack together near the middle, as the same charge will cause a knockback from each other. If the two charges are not the same, the players must spread out as far as possible as they will be pulled to each other. Final phase: boss will be in human form, but there will be mechanics from the previous phases mixed together. I remember seeing AoEs that looked like the middle of the Tornado and pos/neg links. Just burn the boss down here. Tanks should switch after 4-5 stacks of a vulnerability debuff (thanks /u/jbniii). *** **THE BURDEN OF THE FATHER** Quite a difficult encounter. Start by focusing one of the legs (doesn't matter which). The other leg does not need to be attacked, as it will heal once a leg dies. It does need to be picked up by a tank though, so it's not attacking a DPS/Healer (thanks /u/Sky_Armada). All attacks do splash damage, so make sure you stay spread out at all times. I believe the legs don't have a back or flank (but attacks count as back/flank damage) so melee can spread out quite well. One tank and a DPS will be taken into a Quarantine area. The add must be killed before the tank dies. You will be sent back to the boss when the add is dead. If someone gets a blue mark on them, it means they will be the target of slow-moving honing energy balls. These do splash AoE damage when they hit someone. The offtank and a beefy DPS must try to intercept these without them hitting anyone else. Healers can also take them if they time Stoneskin and their heals correctly (thanks /u/SchiferlED). When the legs release steam, they become stunnable. Stun them ASAP to reduce the damage of the boss's random laser attack. An instant stun meant about 2.2-2.5k damage per laser, no stun meant about 6-7k per laser (thanks /u/GravDragoon). When the first leg dies, DPS the boss's face thing. It does an attack that I believe may decrease in damage if more damage is dealt to the boss during this phase, but I don't know. It doesn't do much. The Jagd Dolls that spawn must be spread out and tanked by DPS. The Dolls do an AoE that stacks a debuff. On 4 stacks, the target explodes (thanks /u/Vierkin). There should be no more than one Doll attacking a DPS at any one time. Focus these down ASAP (thanks /u/13Sins). Second leg is a repeat of the first, apart from sniper turrets appearing. The turrets will attach three tethers to one target. Two of these tethers must be intercepted (just stand between the sniper and the target) or the target will die. Final phase, the core is vulnerable and you must kill it to kill the boss. Healers get a red or blue debuff (Judgement) with 5 stacks. Moving too close to each other will pass the debuff to others. It pulses for 3k damage, so you only want it on the two healers max (thanks /u/EliAscent). Make sure you stay spread out. As the stacks of Judgement decrease, the damage dealt decreases (thanks /u/-Ocean-). There is also a tank buster mechanic. Tanks must ensure they save their defensive cooldowns and that healers are ready to heal the tanks. The skill fires after Discoid and has no cast time. The damage dealt by the tank buster increases on each cast (thanks /u/nazmataz)."
191,vulnerability,ffxiv,FFXIV: DRK and It's current Issues and Possible Solutions,21,3cuwml,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3cuwml/ffxiv_drk_and_its_current_issues_and_possible/,2015-07-11 09:47:09,"So, we have all heard the numerous complaints and issues related to DRK and what is exactly keeping them at bay compared to its brothers. However, what we are not seeing much of is people actually trying to think of possible solutions to the issues. While these are obviously not fool proof, they are more or less just the pros and cons of what is essentially at the heart of the class and what can be done to make it more viable in either slot. Pros: * More overrall Mitigation than WAR * Great DPS for a Tank, Still behind WAR, however. * Best AoE Threat Management * A wider Range of Resources to Draw from (MP/TP.) * Best Magic Defense out of the three Tanks * They are effective both as a MT and OT and as such as jacks of both and functions well on both Cons: * While having more mitigation than WAR, their E-HP (Effective Health Pool) does not entirely make up for the gap. * Their Hallowed Ground Variant is noticeably much more gimmicky than both HolmGang and Hallowed. * They do not excel above what the other tanks currently do better in their respective slots. (PLD MT/ WAR MT.) * Their utility is far too restrictive and brings little to the table at the moment. Nothing if there is a MNK in the party comp. * Their mitigation tools, while effective, are restrictive and counteract each other. * While a great DRK will always have MP, they still suffer from TP much sooner than the others. So, what or how exactly can we go about getting out possible solutions to the job? Let's examine the cons. First off is Living Dead. We all know how gimmicky it is and how bug-littered it appears to be. You just benedictioned that DRK, but yet they still died. You healed them to full, yet they still died. Clearly, some type of translation went wrong or the skill itself is flawed. How, then, can we fix the issue? Please take this as a grain of salt since these are obviously not 100% fool proof solutions but at least they are proposals that can spry ideas. What if, instead, Living Dead gave a counteractive Debuff instead of instant death dependent on how much total hp is healed? An example. Say a DRK is at 1% H P and they are healed up to 90%. They would then receive say a 10% total HP penalty to their health pool for 30 seconds if that total HP is not healed and would receive a debuff called Shambled Corpse. Or something along those lines. This would keep a DRK from flat out dying and it would still have a negative outcome if it is not treated properly. (Such as Holmgang holding you into place for a set amount of time.) An alternative would be instead of an E-HP reduction a vulnerability up that would read Weakened Corpse. Where the Drk would receive a penalty to damage received based off the amount of HP they did not get healed. (3% for every 10% not healed.) The next issue with DRK is that they do not excel In one area where the other two do not already. How then would they ever fill a slot or why would we take them over them? Simply, utility. These come both in Delirium and Reprisal. As of now Delirium does not stack with Dragon Kick. There is no real reason for this and it makes their utility totally obsolete if there is a MNK in the PT. It does not even add the blunt resistance down that MNK offers. Now, what if Delirium instead read as such. Reduced Targets Int by 10% Increases Magic Damage Dealt by 10% Stackable with Dragon Kick but has a limit of 15% INT reduction. What this would do is make them viable with or without a monk, give them an affirmative trade off similar to a Warriors Storm Path but making them have an effective Foe's Requiem for the casters in the group. This also fits them flavorfully since they are the more magic orientated job out of the three tanks. I see very little downside to adding this new perspective. This would help not only their OT and utility but make them viable for all groups that could be interchangeable regardless with or without Warrior. The DPS offset that Warrior has over DRK could also be mitigated by this one utility by offering that M.Atk + Bonus. It would effectively make them closer to equal grounds, similar to how trick attack with NIN puts them on the same field with MNK. Now, whats the deal with reprisal? Awesome mitigation tool, but its completely restrictive to being in the MT position + a parry restriction. Aka, its total RNG. There have been solutions such as put it off the parry restriction. I say, keep it on but add alternative measure to proc it as an off tank. Something such as a Combo Chain with Dark Arts that can lead or always leads to a Reprisal being proc'd. What, exactly, I honestly have not quite figured out yet or have any ideas for. Right now this is more utility that could be used by DRK that could cement their usage in a group. If they had some form via Dark Arts to make it proc more frequently that wasnt 100% restrictive to parry but allowed them to still use it in the OT position. Their mitigation tools if we look at them are actually close to on par to PLD in terms of pure mitigation, the only issue being that that mitigation is very selective unlike PLD. Each CD seems to have a very unique niche use for different situations while both WAR/PLD are usable in almost every situation. While it does make the class look flavorful it also severely hinders some of their mitigation tools. My solution is to extend Dark Arts more not only into their attacks but branch more into their mitigation selection. We already have this in tools such as Dark Mind and Dark Dance and it is much more used in their offensive kit, despite being a tank at heart. If we could extend Dark Arts to also have an alternative effect on more of these mitigation tools, or have hem altered to include just Pure Damage Reduction (Similar to Shadow Skin.) it could help counteract this. While I understand some could see this as niche and pointless, or even overpowered, the effective would be something small like 5% damage reduction when you go Dark Arts  Dark Dance. Or Dark Arts  Any Defensive CD gets 5% more flat damage reduction. This wouldn't be a tool you would be using in the OT position and if you are in the MT position you should be using the majority of your Dark Arts on your defensive CD's. Another alternative is Dark Arts  Salt the Earth so the Dark Arts bonus would reduce the targets damage dealt by 5%. Am I saying adding any or all of these at once? Of course not. These are merely ideas to help stimulate a creative process. I will admit, I feel that DRK in the right hands already has amazing mitigation and personally I feel that in some cases they are even better than PLD. The majority of the player base seems to disagree, sadly. Also, the MP cost - Mitigation variable has to be worth it so it would naturally have to be adjusted properly to actually meet the trade off for the MP cost. What exactly do I mean by their mitigation counteracts one another, however? Well, first off, you just popped Blood Price to recover MP. You also used Dark Arts + Dark Passenger. Suddenly, all of your enemies attacks are missing and your Blood Price had zero effect and your MP just crashed. You are punished for improper timing on your CD's. While this is a skill/learn to play related issue no other tank has tools that directly counteract each other in such a form. This is a purely DRK restrictive problem and I honestly cannot think of a way to fix it unless Blood Price was changed from whenever damage is suffered to whenever an enemy attempts to attack you, regardless if the attack hits or not. It's hard to see how we can really fix these issues or if they are just a part of the DRK lifestyle/skill cap. Lastly, we have the TP issues. DRK cannot even do a full 3 Minute parse because they typically run out of TP by the 2:30 mark. While this is also subjective to actually fighting, where they would be splitting that TP cost with MP related skills, they can and do still run dry in some encounters much sooner than others. They have no reliable means to regen TP unlike Warriors and Paladins. This is again a Dark Arts related price tag. Instead, similarly to my proposal on the tank related moveset buffs, depending on the physical attack you use you also get a slight amount of TP regen'd depending on the skill you use. This would essentially be a MP to TP conversion so when you are running low on TP, but abundant in MP, you can spend a great deal to convert it. This would not be overpowered and would still require a lot of skill and forethought to properly utilize but it also would not hinder them in any form. The TP regen would naturally need to be above the TP cost of the skill or set to a strict limit of something around 100-150. Nothing major, but enough to be noticeable and help in an elevated/drawn out fight. Am I claiming that my solutions are 100% positive with no drawbacks? Or not entirely broke or infallible? Not at all. But I am seeing so many complaints regarding DRK but no real solutions being put out by the community. I made this thread not as a DRK is bad. but as a collective outlet for people to actually try to think of reliable fixes. To those reading or curious on Dark Knight and afraid to try them out. Don't be. They are still extremely reliable tanks and off tanks in all encounters. Do the other tanks fulfill respective rolls better? Sure. But that doesnt mean the job is horrible. It has its problems as every new job does at its release and it will get better. I personally find it to be an astounding job and I want to see it excel more. I do not wish for it to see another Loldrg stigma where people just get the idea that the class is bad due to improper usage. "
192,vulnerability,ffxiv,Our tank's unique strategy for Ravana EX--does it work?,0,3d1nwm,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3d1nwm/our_tanks_unique_strategy_for_ravana_exdoes_it/,2015-07-13 06:09:07,"My static group and I have been working on Ravana EX. I already have my clear but most of them don't so we're trying to get the clear. I'm not very well-versed in the tank-specific mechanics of the fight dispite having 10 clears. Our tank is committed to a few strategies and I was wondering if these would actually work? I'd like to know in advance so we don't waste time getting to that phase only to wipe because of a theory. So here are the two strategies: 1) I have cleared Ravana EX (and farmed) in a solo tank party. Our party only has 2 tanks (PLD mt), 2 heals and 4 dps. Right now our WAR OT is really just dpsing (since there's no tank swap mechanic), but yet our group is still party-soaking the Blinding Blades. This makes hitting positionals somewhat difficult or frustrating, and occasionally puts the party at risk when he doesn't move back in time for Tapasya. Is this risk necessary or should both tanks just be soaking? 2) This is the big one. For the part where Ravana puts out two prey markers and then three large purple AoEs, our tank's theory is as such: He says that basically he will stand on A with one prey mark on him. The person with the other prey marker will come next to him. He will then use Cover on them and use Hallowed Ground through the dives. My fear is that this will not work. Even if it ignores the damage (which I'm not sure it will) won't the tank AND the person he covers also get 4 Vulnerability stacks in the process? This could be troublesome considering they may have stacks from an earlier phase. I've proposed that we do the standard where people run their preys to the tanks and the un-preyed players spread away from them, but he seems set on the idea that he can just cover the other person and Hallowed Ground through the entire phase. Will this work? "

I've thrown together this little handbook to help you in turning those bumbling Illuminati's weapon against them. We'll go over the basic functions of the Gobwalker, and how to use them effectively. Each Gobwalker comes stocked with an Energy reserve of 1000 points to spend as you will. **1. Heavydoom, 100 Energy:** This sucker will take the giddy-up outta pretty much anything you nail with it. Unless it's bigger than you. Really though, while slowing enemies down might be useful in a pinch, most of the time you're just delaying their inevitable doom at the hands of your companions. Not entirely useful. **2. Cracklyplume, 150 Energy:** This baby right here will fire out a nice little cone of zap-your-arse to fry the brains of any little critters unlucky enough to be standing in front of you. While it won't work on other machines, it'll pretty much completely shut down those gobbies for nearly 30 seconds with one good jolt. Applications include stopping large swarms of soldiers from mauling your skirt-wearing buddies, stopping **Hardminds** and **Hardhelms** from buffing their allies, and generally just having fun filling some beastmen with 50,000 volts of ""hold it right there"". **3. Meltyspume, 10 Energy:** See this button right here? It's all worn down for a reason. You wanna be pointin' this gun at whatever it is you think ain't fit to live anymore and hittin' this button as many times as you can. As many as five times. These super-heated shots will wear through the target's armor, stacking up a vulnerability debuff up to 5 times. Particularly useful for bringin' down those big honkin' **Magitek Gobwidows** they'll be sending your way. If you ain't doin' anything else, you *should* be makin' yourself useful and firin' this baby at somethin'. **4. Stickyloom, 0 Energy:** May not seem like it, but this here is the most important button on this hunk of junk. This'll fire out a grapple to latch on to whatever you're pointin' it at and drag it right on over to you. Yeah it works on the gobbies and it's always a riot slingin' those little jerks around (heck, it's even somewhat *useful* to nab those **Snipers** over into the waiting arms of your pals), but your real target you gotta be watchin' out for is the **Bombs**. No, not those Bombs. Literal bombs. Explosives. They'll be hurlin' them down into the battlefield every now and again, and it's your responsibility to nab those suckers and yank 'em away from everybody before they go off. Now the range ain't too great on this thing, maybe a couple dozen yalms, so make sure you're close enough, and keep an eye out for them bombs. **5. Recharge, 0 Energy:** Huh? What fifth button? OH, that one. Yeah I mean it does... something. Pull up next to one of them other Gobwalkers after it's disabled and you can nab about **150 Energy** from their tanks, but to be honest once you're outta juice you're better off just ditchin' your ride for a new one. That's about all you'll need to know to drive one of these things better than those gobbies probably ever imagined it could be driven. Oh, and don't forget a helmet. Safety first. Please don't operate the Magitek Gobwalker G-VII under the influence of mead, sleeping potions, or Wedge's suggestions."

195,vulnerability,ffxiv,Alexander: Gordias (Savage) - Predictions,0,3dlsv4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3dlsv4/alexander_gordias_savage_predictions/,2015-07-17 18:40:25,"Predictions for the Savage version of Alexander. Definitely, accuracy requirements will be high, with A1 being the lowest, permittable with current ""standard"" gear (full Law, some Alex NM). Damage up, HP up, defense up for all mobs. But what specifically mechanically? We know with Second Coil and all Primals that SE designs these fights by building the whole encounter, then paring down mechanics and numbers as they reduce the difficulty for lower tiers. That is, when originally designed, T7 had double Shriek on top of double Voice, but the one Shriek was removed for ""normal."" **A1 - The Savage Fist** *Faust*: Tanking adds near Faust will cleave the tanks. However, Faust will gain a stacking buff that redusces damage taken and increases damage dealt. As in T1, killing an add near him will leave pool that removes this debuff, with one pool per. Killing adds while meeting the dps check will become the real training dummy. *Oppressor*: Begins similar to Normal, with a split occurring 1.5 minutes into the encounters, and each Oppressor possessing that much HP. As soon as they come close to one another, they receive a tether reducing damage dealt to them, while also applying a stack of determination, as with Shiva. This will happen after every jump, so tanks will take increasing damage. Oppressor standard mechanics continue but with a debuff inflicted on the maintank, which as with Mog Ex stacks up, forcing a tank swap every *N* stacks. Before the split, when Oppressor spawns adds, two missles will also spawn, but Oppressor will not jump afterwards, rather joins his good friend 0.5. Each of these adds must be pulled to each missile as normal. After the split, each Oppressor will continue to spawn 2 adds, and there will be four missles, forcing each dps to pull the adds to them and dps them down. Oppressors will cast their attacks into the room during this period. On your toes! After each jump, each tank must swap with the other and pull them back apart. **A2 - The Savage Cuff** Add phases come faster, adds have more HP, and hit harder. It will be necessary to use the Gobwalker during this to manage the bombs placed, as there will be at first one, then halfway through two bombs in the arena at once and until completion. It will be further necessary for the Gobwalkers to use the other skills to stun adds (Jagd Dolls) and use Recharge to sustain themselves through to the end. Damage priorities will continue as normal. **A3 - The Savage Arm** Trash aoes leave puddles; and these don't go away. Watch where you put them. *Living Liquid*: As before, Liquid begins as Hand, however from here phase transitions will be random save for they will not repeat back to back. Thus, you can get Man &gt; Hand &gt; Man &gt; Hand &gt; Twister &gt; Hand &gt; Man, etc. Hand now has a proximity tether which stacks a vulnerability down buff on split. Maintaining distance will require a 90 distance at minimum, whilst other mechanics are also in play. Twister tethers now doubled, but with the following caveats: two tethers of the opposite (repelling) alignment will relink if the affected players remain near one another after the repel; similarly, two tethers with the same (attracting) alignment will continue to bind if at least two of them are not dispelled. Finally, adds will not be bindable, but merely slowed. These mechanics continue until 25% during which Liquid assumes its final configuration and just murders everyone. Naw, just kidding. Instead, every 10 seconds, Liquid pulses a aoe that inflicts water damage over time. This counts as a soft enrage on top fo the hard enrage of a time limit. **A4 - The Savage Burden** *Arms of the Manipulator*: Each arm must now be separately tanked. Allowing either to get a steam off imposes a 4s silence (left) and pacification (right). Managing these two will be the duty of the first phase of the fight. During this time, mechanics of the final phase will be in play during the entire duration, with both unavoidable add damage, adds spawning that must be burnt to a hot crisp, and orbs that must be separately absorbed by players. Any player eating two orbs will not only receive a vulnerability debuff, but it will double in duration and stack up. Balancing who receives these debuffs through the fight will be the major mechanic for the rest of the players until first one arm, then the other, go down. Tank swapping the arms after each Quarantine will become necessary. *Quarantine*: As before, the tank without main leg aggro and one dps get sucked into the pipes abroad for a two on one tango to the death. Just you and them, mano e mano e mano ... *and their **GUARDS**!* *Manipulator*: Once both arms are down, the Manipulator will become vulnerable, and all attacks will have double potency against the party. This lasts for 1 minute, before the Manipulator rebuilds its arms, restarting the fight at Phase 1. Rinse and repeat. Are you ready to be somewhat inconvenienced by my terrible ideas?"

197,vulnerability,ffxiv,Seize PVP Job Overview (Patch 3.05),70,3eh826,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3eh826/seize_pvp_job_overview_patch_305/,2015-07-25 05:09:45,"Now that the new PvP mode, Seize, has been out for a couple of days, here is the general impression I've gathered on the performance of the different classes. Primarily, this is an evaluation of how the classes fare at level 60, moreso than their direct impact to success in the new mode which relies mostly on human factors than class compositions in DF. **Tanks** *Paladin* Paladins role as a lockdown tank remains mostly the same in the new PvP mode. Touting a spammable GCD stun with the longest duration of all melees (4s vs 3s of other tanks, 2s of melee dps), a 1s oGCD silence, and a vulnerability debuff in full swing, paladins work well at locking down priority targets and allowing your party to burst them down. Additionally, shield bash and cover allows for you to peel for the healer, allowing them to free-cast without interruptions when being swarmed by melees. Divine veil, clemency, stoneskin, testudo, and tank LB round off the survival utility provided by the paladin, allowing for healers to survive a melee LB if used appropriately. Despite its utility, paladins own damage potential has also been boosted with the addition of royal authority, allowing for an unexpected large of amount of burst, coupled with flight or fight, full swing, spirits within, and circle of scorn. Hallowed ground, despite its long cooldown, allows you to charge into large groups with little risk for either stun-duty or potential burst, assuming you back out before it expires. However, sword oath loses a lot of its auto-attack potential due to the fast hectic nature of people running around in PvP, while being in shield oath sacrifices a lot of the damage potential of the paladin. Overall, its a very versatile class depending on how you intend to play it. *Warrior* Probably the strongest tank of the bunch at the moment, being capable of winning any 1v1 fight on the battlefield. Berserk + Full swing into double fell cleaves pretty much guarantees a kill, while being able to use holmgang / brutal swing to keep the target in place while you cleave them or your party bursts them down. Storm's eye's slashing resistance and healing debuff makes it even easier to burst down high priority targets. Mythril tempest is an amazing skill for locking down a crowded group of defenders at a node, and can also be used as a peeling tool for healers. Thrill of war and tank LB allow for healers to survive melee LB if used quickly enough, while an oGCD stun also allows for interruption of LBs even in the middle of a GCD combo. Additionally, the ability to quickly switch to defiance + equilibrium allows you to gain an upper-hand in duels, or to provide you with some more HP buffer as you run away from death. However, despite their high damage and lockdown potential, warriors struggle a bit in the mobility department, and are more easily kited than other melee jobs. The lack of a gap closer means that theyll be relying on using sprint + enliven / deliverance equilibrium when chasing down or keeping up with sprinting targets. *Dark Knight* Ive been seeing a lot of derp dark knights in PvP, but the class on its own offers a lot of potential. Dark arts + souleater offers a strong, consistent damage combo (mp permitting), while DA carve and spit offers a large amount of oGCD burst. Abyssal drain, salted earth, and dark passenger provide a lot of pseudo-ranged AoE tools, but admittedly AoE damage is not very strong in itself in PvP due to its lack of burst, and the prevalence of AoE heals. However, the strongest tool in the dark knights arsenal is undoubtedly plunge, being a gap closer with 200 potency on only a 30s cooldown. Coupled with the consistent damage from DA souleaters, dark knights provides the utility of the tank classes (3s oGCD stun, tank LB, tar pit 40% AoE heavy, carnal chill AoE 10% damage down) on a mobile bruiser chassis. Additionally, having access to delirium and dark mind allows for the dark knights to deal with magic classes (read: summoners) effectively, using plunge + sprint + enliven for additional chasing potential. Living dead is also extremely powerful, as even if you dont get healed back to life youre given unrestricted movement while under its effect, effectively allowing you to get revenge kills even if you lose a duel. **DPS** *Monk* Monks reliance on positional requirements for the maximum potency is a notable disadvantage in PvP, thus hampering monks ability to provide high damage burst relative to its dragoon and ninja brothers. However, the niche of monk in PvP is not as a high-burst melee dps, but rather as a mobile CC-machine with tons of utility, while still having access to the melee LB for assassination potential. Shoulder tackle is a gap closer with a 2s stun on a low 30s cooldown, shared only by plunge of dark knights. One ilm punch is an amazing utility move that removes buffs on targets, proving to be incredibly powerful against scholars, summoners, and tanks that charge into the fray with cooldowns up. Feint (20% slow), dragon kick (-10% int), and somersault (-30% spell speed) cripple DPS casters and healers, while arm of the destroyer is also an AoE silence that completely locks down grouped casters. Axe kick also provides an AoE pacification against melees and tanks. Monks, along with dragoons, have access to fetter ward, which provides them with CC immunity for 9s, allowing you to melee LB priority targets with impunity following a shoulder tackle. *Dragoon* Dragoon burst remains extremely powerful in the new mode, being supplemented by the addition of battle litany, blood of the dragon, and geirskogul. Like monk, having access to fetterward allows for guaranteed LBs on priority targets, while spineshatter dive (60s cooldown), dragonfire dive (120s), and elusive jump (180s) provide a lot of mobility to the dragoon when theyre up. Jump provides an additional ranged oGCD burst tool can that be boosted by power surge and BoTD to 390 potency, and weapon throw allows the dragoon to stick to running targets, allowing for dragoons to maintain their melee advantage over ranged. The recent patch that boosted fang and claw / wheeling thrust potency from 100 to 200 when positional requirements arent met allows the combo to be a net damage gain even against turning enemies, while impulse rush allows for positional requirements to waived entirely for consistently high damage. Dragoons can opt to start with an initial disembowel combo to provide the 10% piercing debuff on targets, or go directly into a full thrust + life surge combo if the target can be bursted immediately, allowing for a degree of versatility in combat. However, it can be difficult to maintain the BoTD buff at times due to the stuns and sleep, effectively making you a 2.0 dragoon in PvP. Additionally, people seem to like targeting dragoons first for some reason. *Ninja* Ninja was one of the strongest dps classes in the 2.0 PvP modes when it was released, but the addition of a positional requirement to Aeolian edge, and the waste of two post-50 skills to enmity-reduction abilities had me initially anticipating them to fall from favor. However, ninja remains a powerhouse in PvP, potentially being the stronger of the three melee dps in the new seize mode. The mudras of ninja not only provide a ranged damage tool, but offer an oGCD burst tool that can be additionally supplemented by kassatsu. The addition of armor crush allows for mudras to be used exclusively for damage ninjutsu, whilst maintaining the important huton buff mid-battle. Dancing edge functions similarly to storms eye, providing a 10% damage boost to slashing attacks, while also reducing HP recovery of the target. Coupling this with suiton + trick attack, duality, dream within a dream, and kassatsu allows for insane burst within a small time frame. Shukuchi being on 60s cooldown, and usable without a target, allows for it to be used as both a gap closer and an escape tool, while the traited overwhelm PvP skill provides a second gap closer with a stun on a 60s cooldown. This allows for ninjas to overwhelm and LB priority targets, finish them off with ranged mudra (if they survive), and escape using shukuchi extremely easily. However, the lack of fetter ward means that ninjas are also more susceptible to being interrupted mid-LB, or killed after LB due to being stunned by tanks. *Bard / Machinist* Im not familiar with these classes, however from what Ive seen they do really well in the new mode as both attackers or defenders due to being ranged. *Black Mage* Not as much of a god as they were in slaughter, but still a very versatile and powerful class. The new enochian + fire IV allows for insane amounts of damage to be pumped out in a short time frame, but comes at the price of easily being disrupted and losing enochian access if focused. However, if youre allowed to turret in your ley lines with fire IV, people will be dying very quickly to your high damage barrage, sustained by manadraw in PvP. Additionally, AoE sleep and bind remain extremely powerful tools that can be paired with the mage LB to great effect, and even in less favorable scenarios the 2.0 black mage rotation is still very potent if youre allowed to turret. Black mage also has a variety of self-peel tools if theyre being focused, such as blizzard 1 40% heavy, blizzard 2 AoE root, aetherial manipulation, and both manaward and manawall. Nevertheless, the cast times of their spell, and their lack of mobility when shooting off spells are extremely unfavorable conditions, especially given how fast pace and dynamic the new PvP mode is compared to the tiny arena of slaughter. *Summoner* Definitely the strongest dps class for PvP at the moment. Aside from their insane immediate burst in the form of tri-disaster + fester + ruin II (weaves) + painflare + energy drain -&gt; painflare, the DoTs can be baned to a huge group of people for large amounts of ticking damage, of which can be extremely difficult to cleanse due the sheer number of DoTs being applied. This provides a large strategic advantage to the summoners group in a large-scale clash, unless healers use their LB to purify the DoTs. Meanwhile, all of their high-damage tools can be used on the move, allowing for unparalleled in-combat mobility in conjunction with free sprints. However, the major disadvantage of summoners is their heavy reliance on aetherflow stacks for any meaningful impact, meaning classes such as monk, paladins, and astrologians pose somewhat of a threat to them. **Healers** *White Mage* The addition of more accessible instant-cast heals, tetragrammaton (60s) and assize (90s), provided the white mage with a lot of utility and healing power in PvP. Additionally, asylum provides another ground AoE HoT in addition to sacred prism, both of which provide a strategic advantage to your group when fighting over a contested node. The clumped fights that occur in the new mode also allow for cure III to shine in certain environments as well, while the strong HoTs of regen and medica II boosted by divine seal lets the white mage to heal their party even when being focused. White mage also has access to repose, blizzard 2s AoE root, stone Is heavy, fluid auras knockback and root, and holys AoE stun, making up a plethora of crowd control abilities and utility that can be used to assist your party, or as tools for self-peel when youre being targeted. Despite this, white mages fare the most poorly without a co-healer in their party, simply due to the lack of spammable instant healing tools outside of HoTs. A white mage is extremely easy to lock down compared to the other two healers, and even if they dont die, their party is no longer receiving any healing as long as the white mage is being pursued. *Scholars* Scholars did not change much post-50, however they remain extremely strong as PvP healers, and a skilled scholar is still impossible to kill without coordination. Lustrate remains as the strongest healing skill in the game, being able to instantly burst heal anyone back to full on an oGCD instant cast. The presence of a fairy serves as a consistent non-stop healing factory, and allows for scholars to provide healing to teammates or themselves, in addition to lustrate, even when theyre being focused down by melee or interrupted by ranged. Adloquium is an extremely strong skill that prevents cast interruptions as long as its up, and can be used on melee LB targets to prevent OHKOs, following which lustrate can then be used to top them back to healthy levels of HP. Deployment tactics is extremely powerful for spreading eye for eye or crit adlo to your entire party, providing an extremely powerful effective HP advantage in combat. Scholar has also access to blizzard 2 for an AoE root, aura blast for AoE knockback, and traited virus to reduce incoming burst. I strongly considered scholars the best healer (compared to white mages) back in 2.0 PvP, and this opinion hasnt changed in the new seize mode. *Astrologian* Despite the controversy of their viability as a healer in PvE content, astrologians are extremely powerful healers in PvP. This is due to the fact that they have access to high potency heals in both benefic II and helios, while still having access to shields via nocturnal stance, and a spammable instant cast heal in aspected benefic. Additionally, its possible to pre-shield parties right before battle, and switching to diurnal stance to stack the regen as well (or vice versa). Aspected benefic in nocturnal stance essentially serves as a 260 potency instant-cast adloquium, while essential dignity is an instant-cast heal that reaches upwards of 1000 potency on a 40s cooldown. The recent buff to lightspeed has made this skill the most powerful healer-cooldown in PvP, allowing for all heals to become instant over 10s, whilst also reducing their mp cost by 25% with no potency loss (150s cooldown). Stella provides a ranged 40% heavy, celestial opposition provides a 2s AoE stun, while retrogradation is a completely overloaded skill that heals and esunas party members, while damaging and dispelling enemy buffs. In addition to this, the main feature of the astrologian, their cards, has a significant impact in PvP as well. Balance or arrow used on a fever / high DPS during their burst rotation is simply insane, while bole serves as a great buff for tanks or dps charging into the frontlines, and spear is really strong due to the long cooldowns of PvP abilities. Ewer and spire are less powerful cards to draw, but can be useful as well in drawn out fights. Feel to to discuss or critique any of the points outlined above."

Well, I wanted to compile a comparison between the different sects and the other two healers *all together*. I've seen plenty of Diurnal to WHM comparisons, and Nocturnal to SCH comparisons, but this time, I'm gonna go ahead and do a WHM:SCH:Diur:Noct comparison and see who is, indeed, the best healer while also showing the problems AST has with direct comparisons.  Diurnal-----------Nocturnal--------WHM -------------SCH Benefic----380---Benefic----399--Cure ------400---Physick-----400 Benefic 2--620---Benefic 2--651--Cure 2-----650--- Helios------290---Helios-----304---Medica----300--- Asp Bene--790-------------------Regen-----1050- ------------------Asp Bene--525------------------Adlo---------600 Asp Heli---640--------------------Medica 2--700--Whisp Dawn-700 ------------------Asp Heli---294-------------------Succor------300 Ess Dig----~700-Ess Dig---~700--Tetra------700---Lustrate----600 ----------------------------------Assize-----300---Indom------400 ----------------------------------Cure 3-----550--- ---------------------------------------------------Embrace----300 ----------------------------------Benediction-All--- Coll U------1200-------------------Asylum----800--- ------------------Coll U-----10%--------------------Sacred Soil-10% Disable-----10%--Disable----10%--Virus------15%---Super Virus-15% -----------------------------------Divine Seal-30%--Fey Illum---20% Arrow-------10%--Arrow------10%--PoM--------20%--Fey Wind----3% Bole---------10%--Bole--------10%-------------------Fey Cove---20% Spear--------20%--Spear------20%------------------- Balance------10%--Balance----10%------------------- Ewer---------30-----Ewer-------30--------------------- Spire---------30-----Spire-------30--------------------- Lumi Aeth----80----Lumi Aeth--80-----Shroud----80----Aetherflow--20% Light speed---25%-Lightspeed--25%------------------ -------------------- -----------------------------------Energy Drain-7% -------------------------------------------------------Fey Caress---60s --------------------------------------------------------Silent Dusk--40s ----------------------------------------Eye 4 Eye-180s--Eye 4 Eye-120s ----------------------------------------Repose-----30s---- Synastry------120s--Synastry----120s---------------------  Now, I didn't go into DPS because the devs pretty much said that they don't want healers to DPS, though I can assure you that SCH blows everyone out of the water and can continue healing via the fairy. Cure/Physick are slightly more powerful but cost more mana than Benefic. That's fine. Cure 2 is more expensive then Benefic 2, but more powerful for Diurnal, and barely less powerful for Nocturnal. Same thing for Helios and Medica. Regen is much more powerful than Aspected Benefic in Diurnal and is cheaper but lacks the initial up front heal. Adloquium is better than Nocturnal Aspected Benefic normally and extremely so with a crit. Medica 2 and Whispering Dawn provide the same healing potency, Whispering Dawn providing it faster and 100% cheaper but for only about 1/3 of the time. Aspected Helios is cheaper and more efficient. Lustrate is the clear winner for being able to be used 3 times a minute if need be (sometimes as many as 9 times a minute) for the next line. Assize does damage and refreshes some MP on a 90 second CD while Indomitability can be used every 30 seconds for Aetherflow. Cure 3 still has no equal. Embrace is still the single best thing in the entire game for a healer because it's free, every 2.5 seconds, and you can do it while in Cleric's Stance. It basically makes all your Physicks turn into Cure 2s or is a constant top off machine. Benediction is invaluable for Holmgang and Living Dead recovery. Collective Unconscious roots you to the spot and keeps you from doing any action, making it extremely situational. Even though it heals more than Asylum, it's worse because you can still use Medicas and Cure 3s while Asylum is up. Collective Unconscious is also on a 90 second cool down, meaning you can get 3 Sacred Soils out in that time. Disable versus Virus is iffy because 9/10 times people will use virus only for a single big hit like Gigaflare or Nerve Cloud. Also, is 15% stat down equivalent to 10% damage reduction? But the other 1/10 times it's used on adds so that's a good 10 seconds of less damage to the OT, which is way better than one attack being less. The biggest thing AST lacks is a good ""Oh Shit"" button. Divine Seal and Fey Illumination are great in those clutch moments when the tanks are taking hella damage. Fey Illumination even effects your co-healers so even though it is 2/3 as powerful on twice the CD, it equals to about the same. Now, let's talk about cards for a minute. The fact that each card only effects one person pretty much reduces their effectiveness by 87.5% and the fact that you can only ever get one at a time lowers that by 83.3% so they are actually only about 2% effective for the whole 8 man raid for only 50% of the time. Royal Road alters these numbers a bit, but it also means that you have twice the CD time to wait between cards. So although I grouped Arrow with Presence of Mind and Fey Wind, they are all extremely different. Fey wind effectively has 1.5% haste buff for the whole raid (3% haste x 50% uptime = 1.5%). Best case scenario for Arrow means 1.25% haste buff for the whole raid (5% haste x 50% uptime x 50% card availability to Royal Road and Expanded = 1.25%). Now Arrow single target on self versus Presence of Mind means 5% haste buff for just yourself under perfect conditions (10% haste x 50% uptime = 5%) versus 2% haste for just yourself reliably (20% haste x 10% uptime = 2%). If you multiply those AST figures by the before calculate 2% of the time, you will see that there is virtually nothing gained by cards at all. Shroud is 400 potency every 2 minutes, same as Luminiferous Aether, which is about 4000 MP. Aetherflow is 20% of your mana every minute which is about 5000 MP every 2 minutes (which will be altered depending on gear). Aetherflow wins. Lightspeed is a good ability now and it offers enough to make it a stand out thing. Energy Drain returns about 7% of your MP if it hits, which is about 3 cures worth of mp each without any natural recovery ticks of MP, so it's good in a clutch if you are lucky with your attacks. Fey Caress is great for those stupid splash damage vulnerability downs you see in places like Neverreap and Pharos Sirius. Silent Dusk is great if your fairy listens to you and there are no bards, ninjas, paladins, machinists, or monks during fights like the chimera or ADS in BCoB T1 (it's not really reliable, we all know this). Eye for an Eye is a huge benefit that AST is missing. Not great for reliability, but definitely effective over a period of time for lessening the damage output of a group or boss. Repose... well... it exists... Synastry, another solid ability for AST. Great for when both tanks are taking damage during a phase. Split hands phase, each has a Jagd Doll phase, .5 and Oppressor both tank bustering phase... Definitely a solid ability. So basically, for an extremely flawed system of minor buffs, you trade great healing potential and mana sustainability. AST is a band aid class. If something minor is going wrong, they can fix those problems. The other two healers are full first aid kits. They can bring parties back from the brink of death. That's a little over exaggerated, but you get the idea. TL;DR: AST needs buffs. EDIT: Formatting Nightmare: Trying to Fix."

I've co-tanked with level a 60 PLD and a level 60 DRK in the extreme primals and dungeons. At this point it is clear to everyone that WAR and PLD are a step ahead of DRK. That's not to say WAR and PLD are perfect -- they have their own minor issues that need tweaking. Basedon my experience and that of my FC-mates over the weekend, I think these tweaks should be made. Other tanks let me know your thoughts. **For WAR:** * Add a new effect to defiance that grantes a chance (10-20%) on a parry to gain one wrath stack. This does 2 things: (1) makes parry more desireable, and (2) mitigates the damage loss from the wrath nerf by making IB and steel cyclone happen more often. * The other adjustment is to increase the duration of the storm's path debuff from 20 seconds to 30 seconds. This allows for the increase in skill useage to not offset debuff upkeep by too much. * Finally, because IB will be used more often as a result, the healing compnent of IB should be reduced from 100% of the damage to 50% of the damage and a threat modifier added. **For PLD:** * Shield Swipe refreshes the duration of the rage of holone debuff. * Parry stat also increases block rate. **For DRK:** (needs the most changes) * Add a 10% HP increase to grit stance and chance (10-20%) on parry to regenerate 5% MP. This should help give breathing room to healers to offset their squishiness and help reduce reliance on MP restoration combos and open up more emnity and dps combos. * Allow blood weapon to be used in grit, when used without grit the attack speed bonus is increased (15-20%). This will stop DRKs from getting gibed when dropping grit to access this skill. * Reduce Reprisal's initial cooldown to 30 seconds and the trait to 15 seconds. It cannot be stacked with a WAR's storms path. Reduce the potency from 210 to 180. * Add blunt damage vulnerability (cannot stack with dragon kick) to Dellerium. This allows for more DPS from a monk if one is in the party. * Reduce the cooldown on Shadow Wall from 180 seconds to 120 seconds. Edits: formatting "
202,vulnerability,ffxiv,Reply to Bow Wizard from a real live bard,0,3at5ck,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3at5ck/reply_to_bow_wizard_from_a_real_live_bard/,2015-06-23 18:31:06,"This is a repost of my comment to the thread, but I felt op of said post was so wrong and unfounded it needed its own thread. /endisclaimer Unpopular opinion here I'm sure. Source: Main bard for a long time. First off, this game has the holy trinity. There is no room for sole support, or even 50% support. If any bard says they would rather have a 50% decrease of dps from a song than 'cancel a cast', or not minding lower dps for utility, I feel like they arent a great bard to begin with. The bottom line is 99% of fights have dps checks, and if they aren't pulling their weight, wipes will ensue. In my static, I often topped dps in coil, if not second once I 'mastered' my job, not all that long ago if I'm honest. That takes a shit ton of work, but it's worth it and I enjoy it. The devs do alot of balancing for a reason, and if played correctly I feel like all jobs can be, situationally ofc, somewhat equal in dps (notice SITUATIONALLY). This isn't 11 (great game but,) they don't want unbalance jobs and no want for them in parties (loldrg, lolpup etc ) I'm sure plenty of good bards have desired/requested more dps capabilities, myself included, which is prolly why 4/5 of our new abilities are dps based. Because the devs do listen. Prolly more than any other mmo. They didn't put these changes in for the lulz. Saying that no bard or very few want more dps is literally a lie. Are your pants on fire now? Or do you just not know any other bards and are delusional? I feel like you think you're speaking for the majority of bards, but you aren't. The minority are the ones bitching, the rest are waiting for balance and theorycrafting . EA is essentially a beta test. The games has been playable for 4 days for hydaelyn's sake, calm the hell down. Also, as far as canceling a cast, why would you? I mean, do you even know what stutter step is? I feel like if you gave other classes a shot, you wouldn't have as much difficulty with this change. Sometimes yes, you have to cancel, but I've found in the majority of times I don't need to. It's also a matter of learning mechanics as well. I'm sorry you like to run around going pew pew and can't do it now. But literally every job has big changes to their play style. Once again if you played other jobs you'd know this. And not to mention, from the time I hit 52 until capped, I've noticed a huge difference in cast times due to stacking SkS. Cast times are negligible compared to the with i130, and I don't even have good gear yet. So mostly I am quite mobile still. I do think it needs some fixing, and is prolly getting some as I'm typing. IJ imo is either bugged or incorrectly translated in the tool tip. Reseting timer on the dots implies, to me at least, that the original dots would remain; however, after testing, as soon as the buffs fall off you, or the original dots (not sure exactly) they return to normal pot. The tool tip should say it refreshes the dots if that is not the intention of the skill imo. Also, I would like to see WM cast time lowered bc it feels awkward in heavy dodging fights. It feels like there was supposed to be stance dancing, and it isn't all that viable atm. But as previously stated, they are still getting the kinks out, so until they say ""fuck bard take it as is,"" I will be patient, and practice retaining mobility in lieu of bitching. tl;dr Bruh, do you even stutter step, you spoony bard? Hot fixes inc: (Please look forward to it) Just saying. Edit: I feel like you guys don't understand sarcasm at all. The original post I responded to was put in a format that made it sound like they were speaking for all bards, or at least all good bards. It was also in response to another post, which is exactly what I did. I'm snarky. I realize. That is my personality. It's enate and I can't help it. And if you dislike me for it sorry not sorry. That does not give you the right to put words in my mouth, or be hypocritical because you disagree with me and downvote me hell. I care nothing for internet points. So do what you want I'm not going to back down on my opinion, as I'm sure you won't either. The post in question rather made me mad as I do not like people spouting an opinion about my most beloved job, all but stating that if I don't agree I'm not good. I never once stated I spoke for all bards, and if implied, was done so sarcastically. Which I guess is beyond most of those who responded. You see how heated you got when you thought I was being condescending and speaking for everyone who matters? Well that's how I felt. It doesn't feel good, ya? To those asking for numbers or something. I literally said multiple times in various comments here and there that I had just hit 60, and anything I've said is passing observation with minimal testing. I also never said I disliked support or mobility. Spoiler alert: that's why I main it too. I played COR in xi because I love the challenge of maxing dps while still being a 'bro'. Warden is fun and Im currently testing on it as I've yet too see any concrete info on the coverage. The main point of the post was that in my opinion, mine, and maybe other people, that waiting and testing would be best rather than freaking out on launch day. What since is it to freak out on/before launch day of an mmo that hotfixes often? I bet many of you will love the job more when you test it. I have, personally lost zero to no mobility stance dancing besides the cast time of WM, and with Fey I can cast it and run that second and not interrupt and stacking SkS. If you do not think that it is logical to wait til things are working as intended or you test, I feel like you ignore logic and anything you say is irrelevant. I know this is rude but this is my opinion: stupid people are not worth my time. What I've seen: -- At, iirc, at current ilvl151, my highest and only parse was only like low 700. But I'm still not sure if dots are calculated right yet. And as i said before I have insomnia so I'm functioning at less than 50%. Tomorrow (rather later today) after I get rest I shall try again til satisfied. -- Warden works on: healing down, vulnerability up, silence, prolly sleep but not sure. Untested, but implied that any pot debuff (heals, attack down, magic vulnerability, magic attack down etc) will be affected by this, thus we can sermise its intended to be used on party members who you know are about to be hit by something. The cast time with the duration does not make me feel like you can use it like stone skin in battle on all members in 8-man with one bard, but possibly before, or at least on tanks. -- Warden does not work on: pacified (warrior ability) Bismark's stun ability when he rams the island, gaze abilities (at least on the two I tested), knock backs. -- Sch fey with SkS stacked gear makes me able to play in WM with mobility of no WM and may be a legit strat for dealing with sudden burst of dodging to those who like to keep WM up as much as possible. -- Opinion: It occurred to me that bard may be working as intended, and the fact that playing in WM opposed to not is so close to each other in current parses may be SE's way of letting you chose your playstyle. Could be why SW is able to be done w/o WM when it appeared as though we needed it. I might be 110% wrong idk. Just my shower thoughts. -- Opinion: SkS may be the the main stat on bard to stack with crit second. Dots are a huge amount of bard's dps, which is why falling off even for a second or two or early clipping buffed dots is a huge dps loss. Irrc, SkS affects your dot ticks, right? I could be wrong. -- Opinion; alternate option to above state as working as intended: Either tool tip is wrong for IJ or not working as intended because once the buffs drop, so does dot damage ticks. This is easily tested on a training dummy in WM since there are no AAs. Just read the amounts of the ticks for equal amounts of time, write down add up prior to drop of CDs, add up after, compare. I haven't done the math myself but this is how I imagine the formula would work in my head. I might be wrong. I hate and am bad at math. Will test tomorrow. The reason I think it is wrong is because, to me at least, reset implies same dots with buffs, refresh implies new dots with current buffs. I could be understanding it incorrectly. This could be a massive dps increase if you can keep your opener dots up for a whole fight if no jumping or boss vulnerability. Like I said idk if I'm misunderstanding the intention of the skill or its bugged. I will test bard ad noseuum tomorrow. I am reposting the theorycrafting section in its own thread for others since no one will see on this overly downvote thread, going to bed for a long ass time, and then I shall respond to thoughts and opinions people who have valid point and aren't simply commenting because they don't like me or how I think. I am now done with this post, and unless you have some logical input and aren't sheple'ing the same response in so many words I'm gonna ignore you. Because if you can't read properly, browse comments before copypasta-ing the same response when I've clarified or addressed it in another comment, I give &gt;0 fucks about what you have to say. K bye tl;dr2 I know and admit 95% of my faults often. Disliking me for faults and raging without reason is rude, and not how reddit downvote is supposed to work. Also mini theory craft. "

I have done some theorycrafing for bard that I've started since I haven't seen what I discovered elsewhere. I need people who are willing to help grind numbers with me, or input their thoughts and findings here. Credentials: I main bard. Capped 50 in 1.0, Mained whm from 2.0 til mid to late 2.1, just before second coil. I did this at the behest of my FC leader for our static. I prefer dps/support rolls instead of full support/heals. I switched to bard at above stated time because we lost our bard/fc leader when he stopped playing due to irl reasons. We rep'd heals and I have been a bard ever since. Clears in all 2.0 as bard, most when current and those that weren't were because of game boredom/and a few month or two long breaks and not skillcap.

The cast time with the duration does not make me feel like you can use it like stone skin in battle on all members in 8-man with one bard, but possibly before, or at least on tanks. - Warden does not work on: pacified (warrior ability) Bismark's stun ability when he rams the island, gaze abilities (at least on the two I tested), knock backs. - Sch fey with SkS stacked gear makes me able to play in WM with mobility of no WM and may be a legit strat for dealing with sudden burst of dodging to those who like to keep WM up as much as possible. ~~- Opinion: It occurred to me that bard may be working as intended, and the fact that playing in WM opposed to not is so close to each other in current parses may be SE's way of letting you chose your playstyle. Could be why SW is able to be done w/o WM when it appeared as though we needed it. I might be 110% wrong idk. Just my shower thoughts.~~ not valid. - Opinion: SkS may be the the main stat on bard to stack with crit second. Dots are a huge amount of bard's dps, which is why falling off even for a second or two or early clipping buffed dots is a huge dps loss. Irrc, SkS affects your dot ticks, right? I could be wrong. Skill speed stacking is extremely noticeable now so I feel like if you stack enough you can effectively play constantly in WM and have non WM mobility. ~~- Opinion; alternate option to above stated as working as intended: Either tool tip is wrong for IJ or not working as intended because once the buffs drop, so does dot damage ticks. This is easily tested on a training dummy in WM since there are no AAs. Just read the amounts of the ticks for equal amounts of time, write down add up prior to drop of CDs, add up after, compare. I haven't done the math myself but this is how I imagine the formula would work in my head. I might be wrong. I hate and am bad at math. Will test tomorrow. The reason I think it is wrong is because, to me at least, reset implies same dots with buffs, refresh implies new dots with current buffs. I could be understanding it incorrectly. This could be a massive dps increase if you can keep your opener dots up for a whole fight if no jumping or boss vulnerability. Like I said idk if I'm misunderstanding the intention of the skill or its bugged.~~ user error a la me. &gt;URL WM &gt;URL W/o - &gt;I made a post about this yesterday but it didn't pick up traction. Under WM, cross-classing Feint has no cast time. Its a 120 potency attack and it still receives the 20% damage boost. Aside from being able to use this while adjusting for any AOE damage, it may also be more worth it to use in instead of Heavy Shot when both BL and ME are up in order to fill in both oGCD attacks without delaying your next GCD. Might help ya with further theory crafting, since most people aren't aware of the skill. Awaiting opener on above for more clarity. Also super excite. Edit: Please do not downvote because either you not like or agree with me. I am trying to theorycraft which is 100% helpful to bards, even if I'm wrong on every at least I'm trying to get the ball rolling. Us bards need it right now lol. Edit2: I'm sorry for the absence. I'm in the hospital currently. Got tired of stress of not sleeping and noped myself up there in the middle of the night. I'm not dying as far as I know. Been here like an hour with no doctor so I feel like 75% sure I'm fine and will be at 100% No updates or gaming for a few days. If someone wants to take over awesome. If not, oh well. Take care all :)"
206,vulnerability,ffxiv,Is it still too soon to have concerns over DRK's place in raid level instances?,0,3b14au,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/3b14au/is_it_still_too_soon_to_have_concerns_over_drks/,2015-06-25 13:08:27,"The three things that job does best aren't reliable/as useful in raid instances as comparable tank abilities. Self Healing doesn't scale hard enough and doesn't help you actually survive tank busters, just -maybe- help you recover afterwards. This is the same lesson that was apparently never learned with 2.0 WAR, even though DRK is miles ahead of that job in terms of ""viability"" it still carries some of the same flaws. Magic Vulnerability down is nice, but the majority of tank busters are physical as is the majority of damage in the game (Autos) Parry/Evasion are inconsistent and horrible forms of mitigation in raids compared to flat damage % down or something like PLD's shield which is both omnipresent and more powerful I also see some people asserting that DRK is the ""Magic tank"" (With its one cooldown that stops magic? Ok). Tank Busters in existing raids - T13 Flatten: Melee T9 Raven's Beak: Melee T10 Critical Rip: Melee T9 Dalamud Dive: Melee T9 Rage of Bahamut (Nael): Melee Death Sentence: Melee Plummet (T13 Storm of Meracydia): Melee T4 Dreadnaught Cleave: Melee Swipe (T13 Pain of Meraydia): Melee T1 Hood Swipe: Melee T7 Tail Whip: Melee T6 Bloody Caress: Melee T13 Ahk Morn: Magical T9 Raven's Ascent: Magical Also, I know the fight is a joke but try taking DRK into the Odin instance sometimes and make note of how often you actually have a ""good"" cooldown up to stop his tank buster move compared to PLD or WAR. I'm not saying DRK won't be able to clear raid level content, it probably can just like even 2.0 WAR could clear raid level content. The problem is that it basically just looks like it's going to be an unintended ""hard-mode"" where it's going to be more straining on both the tank and the party members involved as they try to progress with a tank that doesn't MT better than PLD nor OT better than WAR and seemingly doesn't even fill a niche other than ""Maybe does a bit more DPS as MT compared to PLD and has some AoEs to throw around"".

Deliverance and Defiance can be switched and the remaining stacks will change to those of the according stance i.e. Wrath and Abandon will be retained and swapped while switching stances. * A new AOE that looks like an Earthquake. * The new buff shown on the HW trailer named ""Raw Intuition"". Guaranteed a Parry while being attacked in front, but guaranteed a crit damage if attacked from other angles. * A crystal ""taunting"" move. * BRD * New song ""Wanderer's Minuet"", affects self only. While singing this song BRD can't move while attacking, can't Auto-attack but can fire charged shot and increase damage dealt. Charged shots probably means that all of Bard attack will have cast time. * Wanderer's Minuet will not consume MP and acts like a stance. * New attack called ""Sidewinder"". Increases effect of already applied DoTs. * NIN * Doesn't get a new stance. Huton will be longer. Will have more positionals. * New Enmity Manipulation skill. * SMN * Tri-disaster renamed to Tri-bind. SMN will have a brand new Tri-disater spell which is expected to apply Bio II, Miasma, and Bio all at once. * No new pets, but existing pets will have more actions. * New skill ""Bahamut Trance"": Infuses the power of Bahamut to the caster, certain actions will yield ""Bahamut Stacks"" which can be spent for ~~Akh Morn~~ some high potency attacks. * WHM * A new AOE Regen called ""Asylum"". * Stone 3, Aero 3. * Some new instant less-powerful-than-Benediction heals. * MNK * A new stack called Chakra that can be stacked up to 5, and can be consumed to deliver a high potency attack and restore TP. * A way to switch stances without attacking. * High potency attacks that consume Greased Lightning. * AST * 2 stances: Moon Reading and Star Reading. One is WHM-like and one is SCH-like. * Cards drawn are random. You can use a drawn card immediately, or put that on hold and draw a second card and add the effect of the first card on top, or discard it to draw a new card. * There will be 6 cards: a Haste card, an Attack Power card, a Vulnerability Down card, an Omni-cast card and 2 more cards. * MCN * Manually reload (likely to be on GCD), has casting time and can reload up to 5 bullets. * A instant oGCD ""Quick Reload"" which instantly reloads 1 bullets. * DRG * A new buff called ""Blood of the Dragon"" that triggers some 4-stage combo after Full/Chaos Thrust. * A high potency attack that consumes Blood of the Dragon. * Jump animations will be adjusted. * DRK * Will use MRD and GLA cross-class skills. * Has a gap closer and a ranged attack (shooting black laser from the sword) * A Grit Stance for tanking and a Dark Stance for DPS. Dark Stance consumes MP and unaffected by Ballad. Grit Stance will buff Accuracy. They might have recommended that DRK should stance-dancing more often by building hate on Grit and switch to Dark and so on. * SCH * New skill called ""Dissipation"" that ""consumes"" Fairy to increase magic potency. * A skill called ""Deployment Tactics"", that enhances Adlo and make E4E AOE-ish. * A skill called ""Emergency Tactics"", that affects Adlo and makes it instant heal instead of the shielding effect. * A skill called ""Indomitability"", enhances healing potency. * BLM * Fire 4 and Blizzard 4. * Enochian: 30 sec buff that allows caster to cast Fire 4 and Blizzard 4. * Ley Lines: Ground AoE spell speed buff . Only works on the caster. * Sharp Cast: Forces the next spell to proc. * PLD * A finisher combo from Riot Blade. * A finisher combo that inflicts DOT. * A new blocking attack. * New action: Divine Veil: Sets a protective barrier around the target where if the target receive cures while under the effect, other nearby members will also receive a barrier effect. Shout out to /u/Raven_C, /u/zryn3, /u/Aresaka for catching some skills I missed. TL;DR: You get a stance, you get a stance, you get a stance, everyone get a stance while NIN crying in the corner for not having any stance."
210,vulnerability,ffxiv,Environmental Damage or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Make the Dungeon Work for Me,17,325a8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/325a8h/environmental_damage_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/,2015-04-11 04:19:49,"Up until you hit level 50 some dungeons will include environmental damage or effects. Notable examples include the slowing slime in Toto-Rak and the noxious puddles in Aurum Vale. These are bad environmental effects and you, rightly, are taught to avoid them. Things begin to change once you start arriving in some of the level 50 dungeons that were later introduced. There are a number of detrimental environmental effects that affect any player or mob that is hit by them. Here's a list of the ones I remember off hand. Halitali Hard Mode - During the first segment of the dungeon you will find spiked balls that hang from the ceiling and drop into the ground periodically. They deal damage to all targets underneath them, in a smallish circle, as well as apply a damage vulnerability debuff. Use these to your advantage as a tank and position the mobs underneath it while avoiding being hit. Ampdapor Keep Hard Mode - There are vines throughout the dungeon that behave exactly like the spiked ball from Halitali hard mode except that instead of a circle it's more of a rectangular area of effect. So tank, do what you need to in order to position mobs under it without getting hit. Keeper of the Lake - This is the dungeon that my experiences led me to write this post. In the final segment before reaching Midgardsormr there is a Garlean gunship that fires AoEs at one of your party members. You only have a few precious seconds to get out of this AoE. From all my experience in KotL it seems that many people do not realize that this AoE damages both your party and the dragonkin mobs that you're fighting. The dragons and Garleans, after all, aren't friendly to each other so this shouldn't be a surprise. Unlike the Halitali or Amdapor environmental damage this one cannot be handled solely by a tank. Unless the target of the gunship is already near the mobs it is unlikely that the tank will have sufficient time to move the mobs into the AoE to take damage. Ranged dps and healers, help things go faster by standing close to the tank so that mobs will end up in the gunship's AoE. Square Enix has started including beneficial environmental effects in their dungeons. Going into Heavensward keep an eye out for things that might make your life easier. Edit: I had forgotten about Sunken Temple of Qarn HM. There is a room with spike traps. These spike traps will damage any mobs standing on top of them. It will not affect the bats, bees, or other flying monsters."
211,vulnerability,ffxiv,A List of Do's and Do Not's for World of Darkness,98,2yuhvw,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2yuhvw/a_list_of_dos_and_do_nots_for_world_of_darkness/,2015-03-13 09:34:39,"**General** *Do's* * DO have fun. * DO use the alliance chat to communicate plans and who's main tanking bosses. * DO watch other parties if you're a healer. * For Bards: DO use Foe Requiem if you don't need the MP for Ballad, the effect helps casters in all three parties. It won't lower your DPS. Unless you're doing 1000 DPS but not per second. *Do Not's* * DO NOT let anyone ruin your fun. * DO NOT have fun at the expense of others. * For Tanks: DO NOT fight for hate. If another tank has a boss or an add, switch to DPSing or wait for another add to spawn. * For Bards: DO NOT waste MP on Foe's if it's already on the boss, your White Mage might need a Ballad in the future. * DO NOT use the Alliance chat to repond to your party members, or spam information only beneficial to your own party. * DO NOT assume everyone is an expert, even when 3.0 comes. **Garms** *Do's* * DO try to stun or silence Voice of the Ram *Do Not's* * DO NOT tank the Garms in the tiny center area of the arena, with all the damage pits, there's not enough room for you _and_ the melees. * DO NOT stand too close if you are a Bard or Mage. **Angra Mainyu** *Do's* * DO set your focus target on Angra Mainyu (Or the main tank if you're a healer) * DO kill the adds, they deal raid-wide damage to all alliance members if not killed fast enough * DO turn around for Mortal Gaze. Turning around for a few seconds is a lot less DPS loss than dying and getting the resurrection weakness or running to heal Doom (unless you're a Bard) *Do Not's* * DO NOT finish your cast bar before moving to dodge once the fourth Final Hourglass has been killed. Surviving &gt; Damage * DO NOT stand in the same color as your current Brand debuff for Double Vision. There are few excuses for having a second stack of Brand of the Sullen or Brand of the Ireful. A third will likely kill you. * DO NOT stay in the Level 100 Flare or Level 150 Death circles. Yes, having a specific amount of people in there will prevent the effect from happening, but you cannot count on there being enough communication and understanding to save you from it. * For Dragoons: DO NOT use Elusive Jump when bound by Level 100 Flare or Level 150 Death to see if you can escape it. You'll wipe half your team when the aoe moves with you. **Queen Scylla and Xande's Clone** *Do's* * DO silence Ancient Flare and Ancient Quaga. Stun also works. * DO help kill the side portals, less adds means less effort. * DO kill the middle portals first during Xande, they spawn Jormungand, a much tougher monster to take down quickly than the Thors. * DO OPEN THE CHEST. It is not skippable. *Do Not's* *DO NOT yell at people to ignore the chest. It's _not skippable_. **Five-Headed Dragon** *Do's* * DO avoid the indicated AoE attacks. * DO stand in the poison, if the big poison blob spawns, it's gonna hurt everyone. * DO keep WHM Stoneskin up on whomever you can when the dragon casts Heat Wave. It will block the initial hit and thus avoid the Pyretic debuff on your party. * DO kill the Prominences, their attack is bad news if you were looking forward to being healed. * DO prioritize the heads over the body. You don't want all five of them casting Discordance. * DO trade the line from the little red dragons between players. This is done by making physical contact with the person you're passing to, not just intercepting the line. *Do Not's* * DO NOT run away from other players if you get targeted with a purple marker, that attack splits the damage with everyone it hits. * DO NOT take actions when you have the Pyretic debuff. Don't even walk. Don't cast, don't attack, don't walk. You take damage for every frame of animation you're not standing still. Healers, resist the urge to cast Medica or Succor. * DO NOT stand in the middle of the raid with the yellow marker over your head. Make some effort to run to the edge of the arena. In all likelihood, the resulting tornado is going to hit _somebody_, but you can try to reduce the number of people affected as much as possible. **Atomos Prime** *Do's* * DO gather under the Howling/Moaning/Roaring Atomos when it starts casting Shockwave, it's a knockback in all directions. * DO step on the glowing pads, this helps your other parties stay in the fight when they get knocked off. * DO Focus Target your group's Howling/Moaning/Roaring Atomos, even if you're a healer. You'll be ready for Shockwave easier. * DO fall off the platform if you're the target for Black Hole. If no one gets swallowed, White Hole never gets cast. * DO pay attention to who is marked for Black Hole, even if they jump off the platform, you can still get swallowed up if you're between them an the Howling/Moaning/Roaring Atomos. * For Summoners: DO have Titan ready. The chance that your tank will get swallowed up by Black Hole or knocked off by White Hole/Shockwave is high, and having something to steadily hold the hate of the Soldiers can be very helpful. *Do Not's* * DO NOT stand between the Howling/Moaning/Roaring Atomos and the Black Hole target, you will get sucked in even if they fall off the platform. * DO NOT ignore Shockwave, there's no guarantee that the other parties are stepping on their plates, and you might not have a chance to get back up. **Cerberus** *Do's* * DO make sure everyone knows whether they're doing ABC (A for Adds, B for Belly, C for Chains/Cerberus) or All-DPS-In for the strategy. Yes I know All-DPS-In is really strong, but if a group decides on ABC, then the alliance needs to be prepared for it. * DO grab the adds if you're the tank for the job. Regardless of strategy, a few healers will have to stay outside the belly to keep the main tank alive. These adds can wreck their faces. * DO watch out for Hounds out of Hell, that blunt resistance makes a difference if you keep getting hit by it, especially if you've been eating Tail Blows. * For Summoners, DO consider summoning Titan in the belly for All-In strategies. Having something to tank the Unknowns can help a lot. * DO wait until Re-awakening is somewhere near half its cast time. Cerberus is immobile during this time, so it's an opportunity for all 24 alliance members to get some damage in. * DO stoneskin and Adloquium the main tank when Cerberus casts Ululation, it'll help prevent the Abandonment debuff. * DO go keep your Main Tank company for the Abandonment debuff from Ululation, as funny as it is to have Cerberus chasing your Hysteria'd tank. * For the main tank: DO Cover someone standing with you for Abandonment, to save them from a cleave. *Do Not's* * DO NOT stand in the purple bile if you are not under the Mini status. You will die, and I will laugh. * For melees, mostly: DO NOT stand in the middle of Cerberus's rear, you will most likely not make it out of the Tail Blow cone, as it's a very short cast. * DO NOT stand alone for the Abandonment debuff applied by Ululation, you don't want to run around under the effects of Hysteria. * DO NOT DPS the Unknown in the belly. You're just wasting your time, they vanish when all of the Stomach Walls have been killed. **Cloud of Darkness** *Do's* * DO stay in range of your healer. If your healers are both on the west side of the arena, and you're stubbornly staying on the east, don't be surprised when you don't get healed right away. If your healers are anything like me, they won't make the effort to move all the way to the one person they can't reach. * For tanks: DO watch the main tank. If Feint Particle Beam or 0-Form Particle beam hit a target, they apply a stacking vulnerability debuff. Combined with Cloud of Darkness's already high auto-attack damage, this is bad news for both the tank and the healer. If this happens, it's time to switch main tanks. * DO run away from the group if you get marked for Feint Particle Beam. Run far away. Don't stop running. Pretend you're Forest Gump. * For healers: DO focus target the main tank, even if he's not in his party. Cloud of Darkness does some nasty damage to tanks, especially with her debuff. The tank's healers can have a difficult job, especially if neither of them is a Scholar for clutch Lustrates. * For healers: DO toss a Regen on the main tank, multiple Regen sources stack together! * DO make an effort to stand in the circle for the Meteor Particle Beam. A party member being hit by it increases the limit break gauge by a nice chunk. (I'll cover this more in the Do Not's) * DO stand in front of the Dark Clouds and Dark Storms to apply a potent Heavy to them. * For Bards: DO consider Foe Requiem during the Cloud and Storms phase, the damage buff can help down them quicker. * For tanks: DO Focus Target Cloud of Darkness, even if you're not main tanking. You need to see whether or not she's gaining stacks from the Dark Clouds and Dark Storms, if that number reaches 5, it's your time to shine with that glorious palisade Last Bastion. * DO use the limit break at 3 stacks, it's possible to get two level three limit breaks off in one fight. *Do Not's* * DO NOT assume someone else will take care of the Meteor Particle Beam, especially the ones right in front of her. The tank should not be relied on for this spot, because he's already taking damage from Cloud of Darkness. * DO NOT ignore the Shadowlurkers. It is not a fun time when their attack goes off, potentially using Bad Breath on a quarter of the arena. All it takes is one action to boop them on the nose and send them back into the Void. * DO NOT be anal about ""one person per meteor"" for the Meteor Particle Beams. Yes, the damage is static and not split between the people in it, _however_ it's better to have two or three people in one circle than for everyone to run out of the circle and the whole raid get damaged because of the ""one person per meteor"" rule. Not to mention, having at least one person from each party guarantees all three parties get the Limit Break gauge boost. **I hope this list is helpful for those struggling in World of Darkness. Feel free to comment with additional Do's and Do Not's.**"

I did my Nexus farm when Nexus was the highest tier for relics and I don't remember really having many problems with people in trials. Sure, you had some people who would ignore mechanics because they were full Soldiery/FCoB doing trials meant for people in level 50 greens/quest blues. When people did this, I didn't run into many issues. It's not like I was seeing lots of wipes and near-wipes because people wanted to tunnel the boss and ignore red circles. I just finished my Zeta; the grind isn't bad at all for those of you not at that point yet. The hardest part wasn't grinding Shiva, Garuda, Leviathan, and ST to complete the atmas. The hardest part was dealing with people in Trials. I saw lots of almost-wipes on Garuda because people wanted to ignore the sisters, then a double Mistral Shriek + an AOE from Garuda could kill a lot of people. I had one near-wipe where we beat the boss only because the Paladin at the end somehow killed Garuda before she killed him with 300 HP left. Shiva was just as bad. I saw loads of people stand in front of her then die to her frontal cleave in sword &amp; board. There were tons of people who would just stand in icicles then die because of the vulnerability debuff stacking too high. Was I just getting bad apples while farming or has the mentality while farming just gone down the drain?"

I have Asperger's syndrome, so I don't fit into most social groups, which makes this game difficult at times. I play because I enjoy the challenge, and it's something my girlfriend and I can play together. That being said, I violently dislike the people in my raid group. I joined this group during SCoB, after my previous group broke due to a married couple's personal drama and a couple people quitting the game. The new group was all from the same FC, while I had my own that I was ""leading"" so my girlfriend and I could have our own house together. I had cleared T8 before I joined them, and they were on T9 golem phase at the time. I was a tank main, but switched to DRG since they had a PLD already and were solo tanking the fight. It was an uphill battle, as they hadn't established a good layout for their meteors, and we spent a good month or two getting nowhere. When we finally progressed into Heavensfall and Divebombs, it was a great feeling and morale soared. At this same time, patch 2.4 dropped so echo was introduced into SCoB which helped us even further. We started to consistently get to Divebombs, and a clear seemed on the horizon. This is when trouble started to occur. One night, we were having our typical problems which Divebomb phase, but things got a bit heated. I messed up a Divebomb and got chewed out by the BRD pretty hard. We did eventually clear that night and everybody felt great...except me. They noticed I wasn't cheering on TS with the rest of them and asked me what was wrong. I aired my frustration about being chewed out for a mistake during the run and that it felt unfair due to our SMN getting hit by Lunar Dynamo most runs and never got called out because (from what I'd experienced with them before in runs of other content as well as SCoB) he was in their FC so could do no wrong. The conversation went nowhere so I tried to end it and move on to avoid unnecessary drama, but the night ended with everybody feeling bitter. Time and the raid group went on, with us moving on to FCoB. Our old PLD quit so I got a friend of mine who had joined my FC in as our OT as WAR while I became the MT as PLD. We are currently in T12 and I'm seeing the same issue beginning to happen again. Their attitude towards us both, as the tanks, has become very exclusively hostile. I see people in the group making mistakes daily, even on content we have on ""farm"". Our BLM screws up T11 tethers almost every time they get them. Our MNK sets off Black Fires in T12 giving us vulnerability stacks. However, the ONLY time anybody gets called out is if it's a tank issue, or a perceived tank issue. It's gotten to the point now where I've logged out during raid twice in the last month because I would rather not progress than deal with the hostility. I want to leave, but my buddy wants to stay and I'm torn on whether to deal with it, find another group, or quit raiding period. What should I do? **Update**: Thank you everybody for your opinions, advice, and insights. I've decided to quit this group and to take a break from raiding to figure out what I want to do in 2.55 and beyond. For now I'll continue enjoying this amazing world with the friends who make this game and my life awesome. Be excellent to each other and party on dudes!"
214,vulnerability,ffxiv,Voidsent Analysis: Ahriman,37,30wceq,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/30wceq/voidsent_analysis_ahriman/,2015-03-31 17:02:11,"//CLASSIFIED DOCUMENT// The Ahriman (Varieties: Smolenkos, Angra Mainyu) are a species of voidsent present on Eorzea. Like all voidsent, the ahriman do not naturally occur on Eorzea, but are transferred here by natural or arcane processes. These creatures, according to studies of the voidsent hierarchy, rank at the fourth or fifth rungs. This indicates considerable danger and strength associated with the Ahriman, even in comparison to other voidsent. An Ahriman appears as a chocobo-sized or larger winged (commonly described as ""hideous"") creature. The majority of the creature consists of one massive eye, underneath which lay a large mouth. Its skin is tough and leathery, like most voidsent (Imps, Snurble, etc) Ahriman have two large wings, which are perpetually flapping to keep the horrid creature from touching the ground. These wings are similar to other voidsent; Batlike, though the wings also appear to be capable of interacting directly with the unseen currents of aether that flow throughout Eorzea. This explains the ease at which the creature stays afloat and may explain why they are only seen in areas of high aetheric energy. Additionally, the ahriman have two long flexible arms, two fragile looking legs, and a long, muscled, tail. The limbs are rarely used, especially the legs. The arms are presumably used to aid in feeding, while the tail is used primarily for balance and steering during flight. Ahriman are rarely seen on the ground and appear to prefer flying at all times. Its singular eye has presented in various colors, though most commonly with a yellowish iris and reddish sclera. The coloration of the eye has been noted to correspond to the strength of an individual Ahriman - More colorful/ornate eye coloration indicates greater strength and danger. While it would be obvious to any casual observer that the Ahriman eye is an extremely capable sight-organ, it should be noted that it is believed that the eye of an ahriman has the ability to see arcane energies that are invisible to most lifeforms. This is thought to assist the ahriman in movement through the void and aid in seeking magical sources in our world. The creature's mouth is lined with razor sharp, triangular teeth. The creature's tongue is often seen moving wildly in the mouth, apparently in anticipation of the next meal. Cursory research has indicated that a hungry ahriman will consume any organic matter it is presented with, but has a preference for live meat. Further research indicates that biomatter is more likely to be a delicacy or ""treat"" to these creatures, for they continue to readily seek magical emissions regardless of hunger level. It is not currently known what the true purpose of this attraction may be. It is thought that the ahriman, being from the void, may require these magical energies to survive, but there have been no reports of ahriman ""willingly"" leaving our world and returning to the void. The effects of depriving an ahriman from magical energies is unknown, and research continues at this time. Ahriman are not often thought to be intelligent, due to their violent behavior and insatiable hunger, but research indicates this belief to be false. Larger, more powerful ahriman have even been known to speak in complex sentences understandable by Eorzean natives. The large ocular structures of the ahriman indicate a substantially advanced nervous system - it is not surprising, then, that their intellect would also be sufficiently advanced for vocal communication. When an ahriman is known to speak, they are rarely heard speaking any concepts that do not tangentially relate to their own hunger or power. Reports indicate that minor ahriman in proximity to a singular, more powerful variation of the ahriman species will unite under its ""leadership"" towards a common goal. It is unknown if the cooperation is due to shared ideals or simply based upon fear of their larger kin. Scholars have explained that an ahriman gains entry to Eorzea by focusing their essence in the eyes of lesser animals. A small mouse may be a sufficient vessel for one or more of these voidsent to manifest. The manner by which these creatures are able to do this is unknown. One of the stranger theories that scholars have proposed is that these creatures are able to reproduce at will upon absorbing adequate magical energy, via shedding tears from their massive eyes. These tears eventually become new ahriman - presumably copies of their ""parent"". Sightings of ""baby"" ahriman have been confirmed. If this reproduction theory is true, or even possible, is unknown and research continues at this time. An ahriman in combat is a frightening sight. Its wings beating rapidly, it seems to be able to direct aetheric energy in a manner that allows the creature to utilize earth magics. They have also been seen to use other types of magic and seem to have uncanny arcane talent, including the ability to emit paralyzing energy from their massive eyeball. Luckily, ahriman tend to be relatively fragile in comparison to their more sturdy voidsent cousins. Adventurers are encouraged to aim their attacks towards the eye in particular. Due to their intrinsic connection with magical energies, the ahriman are especially vulnerable to curses and hexes. There have been reports of adventurers utilizing enthralled ahriman as mounts. These enslaved creatures are not known to be violent while under the curse. Though their demeanor upon release may be easily predictable. Caution is advised around ahriman both ""enthralled"" and wild. This type of voidsent is incredibly dangerous. Their intention (if one exists) for being in our world is still unknown. It appears as if they are simply here to cause as much havok as possible whilst filling their bellies with flesh and aetheric energies. Research continues at this time. Information contrary to the above analysis are to be reported to chief metabiologist, [Redacted] of [Redacted] Free Company. //CONCLUSION: High inherent threat [Note: Magical abilities, razor sharp teeth, Aggressive behavior]. Moderate value [Note: Ahriman organs and flesh are useful as magical components]. Likelihood of weaponization: Moderate [Note: Vulnerability to curses allows ahriman to be used as unwilling soldiers or in coordinated attacks]. Risk: High [Caution advised].// ((Previous reports can be viewed here: [Snurble](URL [Spriggan](URL [Goobbue](URL . )) Edit: Feel free to comment what creature you'd like to see in the future."
215,vulnerability,ffxiv,T10: Question about the Tether+Charge mechanic and priority system,0,2vckzp,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2vckzp/t10_question_about_the_tethercharge_mechanic_and/,2015-02-10 09:23:02,"Hi guys, My group has been stuck on T10 for almost a week now and we've been practicing at least 3 hours a day. We seem to get close but then wipe to a silly mistake in the last phase. As usual, the biggest issue is the tether+charge combo and the priority system. I've read many suggestions of how to set up a priority system, mainly numbering DPS 1-4. The problem with this is most people in my group don't see it in time and there is confusion/hesitation, sometimes too many people go in for tether, other times not enough. I'm trying to figure out a more fool-proof way to make it past this mechanic without mistakes. What if we have the following DPS in our group: DRG BLM BRD &amp; SMN. These DPS will be assigned 1 buddy, so for example: * **DRG (1st priority with mic), buddied with BRD** * **BLM (2nd priority with mic), buddied with SMN** If the DRG gets a tether/charge, he will immediately say **""BRD go to tether!""** If the BLM gets tether/charge, he will say **""SMN go to tether!""** Of course, the remaining people with no vulnerability debuffs will go in to soak the Wild Charge. Do you think this will help? Am I missing anything? We've been really frustrated and our sessions have probably been too long, as toward the end we start making more mistakes and feel fatigued. Any tips are appreciated. Thanks!"

I kinda don't wanna drop classes I like them, instead just make it so you need 1lv 50 in order to unlock (and they start lv from 50).* **limit break**. *First off the cast is kinda sucky and gets me hit by aoe's,* how about instead of waiting to cast you just need to hold down the limitbreak btn for a GCD. and having more than one LB. how about each class gets 2~3, and to pick u press the LB, then a class/job skill which then determines the lb. **Lv 1 base action , Lv 2 base action with effect, lv 3 stronger base action with effect.** **DRG/LNC** * LB &gt; ""Piercing Talon"" = lots of spears fall from the skies to targeted location and deal AOE dmg.* ~ Stun to all targets hit. **SCH** * LB &gt; ""Succor"" = Sheild for 50%of current hp for 5 seconds.* ~heals party for 20% of hp then sheilds *..... ill add with credit suggested onces i think fit well.* And another idea, being able **conserve LimitBreaks** * Press LB for 1 GCD = your will use 1 limit and use a lv 1 limitbreak action. * Press LB for 2 GCD = your will use 2 limits and use a lv 2 limitbreak action. * Press LB for 3 GCD = your will use 3 limits and use a lv 3 limitbreak action. Since the current max is 3 this could be used in a way where 1 party member uses a lv 1 , and other uses a lv2. **Summoner!** I want the *egi* to be more epic, and not a lol pet. **Get rid of enkindle** *, there Signature abilities should be more epic.* * Make the Summoner LB the new Enkindle. * They would then have 3 LB's (at least right now) &gt; limit breaks ..... each class gets 2~3 * However it therefore can't be picked in the moment like the others as the summoned pet in a way is your LB selection. *IDEAS!* * ifrit. Large aoe leaves fire puddle that puts 5?sec burn dot on any mob that goes into it for the next 10sec, * titan late cone in front that outs vulnerable down on allies, up of enemy's, ( to face you pick where it starts then the direction from that point). * again any good ideas ill add with credit **problems I see with smn** * difficult to comeback after dead * and pets *can* die easily * pets lack an epic feel * not using your pet is a dps loss * Difficult to amange pet abils on hotbar *since each pet has 4 unique abils* **FIX** So I want smn to have 3 abils that change if she has a pet summoned, * No Pet = **Dot expelling Nuke || Dot Utility/Buff || Aether Summon** *names are my weakness , along with formatting :)* - All of your ACN Dots brought down to 4seconds left after doing half it's total potency damage to all mobs within 2yalms. ( dots with less than 4 seconds left are bought up to 4 seconds left ) || 2min CD - (garuda will no longer have contagion) , all Dots on the boss are extended for 10seconds || 50seconds CD - This make the next ""Resurrect"" or ""Summon 1,2,3"" cost no mp and happen instantly!, after 1 press it goes on a 0.5 second refresh after which dispelled the summoned aether to regen 40% of total mp . After it has been used || 2min 20 sec CD ~ but is reset if you die. ( this should help them comeback after a death ) eg * **Ifrit** = *cone aoe fire breath -dot dependant potency || dot Re-applier || Aether Reallocation* - As well as this with no pet all your attacks are unexpected. but once a pet is summoned all your attacks deal in it's respective element. (Ifrit fire || Garuda wind || Titan earth) to make things more fun with no pets you have increased Piety ,then each primal gives it's own bonus when used * Titan 20% less dmg taken. Ifrit when hit mob gain fire vulnerability up. Garuda Movement speed +20% **Aether Reallocation.** * like the no pet ""Summon"" pet but mp regen is at 50% *using the smn on the current pet active will reset there 'aether supply' -but at a penalty *- so what I forgot to say before is that each pat will only be summoned with enough aether to remain for 5min.* Now I want this so that people are promoted to change the primal they use. **Penalties** : * x2 primal primal's buff not re appied. * x3 they do 10% less DMG, and 'aether supplied' for 3 minutes instead. * x4 they do 50% less DMG and only 'aether supplied' for 2 minutes. * - and after this ""that"" primal is un-summon-able for 5 minutes.

I just completed a Toto-Rak for one of my relic books, but not without complications. I had a member in there who had the Z title, so it was obvious he had a Zeta weapon on one of his jobs. The run is slow and steady, no wipes, etc. We get to Graffias and this is where it started to go downhill. Our first pull, neither of the dps swapped to kill the adds, nor did they swap to kill the tail when the skin fell off. As most of you know, if you don't kill the tail, a bunch of poison spawns on the ground and can get strenuous on your healer, especially if you don't kill the adds. So we wipe. On the run back, I ask why nobody swapped to the tail to kill it (especially since killing the tail gives a vulnerability debuff to the boss). the &lt;Z&gt; person proceeded to flex his epeen and say ""Don't need to kill the tail. Just burn boss."" I tell him that the tail leaves poison on the ground, plus killing it gives the boss the vulnerability debuff. He links his Zeta weapon, and says ""nuff said."" By this time, I've had it with his attitude, and start a vote kick. We end up kicking him and replacing him with someone that had no problems killing the tail (and even the adds), and we killed it next try no problem. Moral of the story: Just because you may be further along in the relic questline (or even done with it and you have your Zeta), that doesn't mean you have the reason to be pretentious to other people. Having a Zeta weapon doesn't mean you get to be a bonafide badass and ignore mechanics *especially when said mechanic increases your damage done to the boss*. &lt;/rant&gt;"

Or is it a guarantee that only 1 person of the pair can be chosen for the missile and thus they can remain stacked on top of each other? I've been watching videos and some groups remains stacked, while some makes an effort to move away from each other while maintaining maximum distance before getting vulnerability from tethers. It would be useful to know if we can just remain stacked and not risked moving too far from each other. "

People also don't know you can force interrupt einherjar and that you can esuna every single debuff, which is upsetting. I assume the trial releasing in 2.5A will share similar mechanics, that'll be fun. Can't wait for people to start facerolling themselves with that. I wonder if the Odin Trial will drop odin themed weapons. Off the top of my head a Gungnir for dragoon would look pretty nice.

I just had some questions to maximize my DPS as warrior. During T10, I only provoke during vulnerability down charges and take a critical rip and then the other tank takes it back. What I do is start the fight out of defiance. DPS by rotating between Storms Eye and Butchers Block and keeping fracture up. I use Berserk and internal release right off and keep brutal swing on cooldown. I use vengeance to take the first charge damage and we don't see a second. I then turn on defiance during overcharge, infuriate and steel cyclone both adds and overpower once. Then I butchers block the daughter and rotate butchers blocks between them while popping Thrill of battle and Convalescence. I use Inner beast on 5 stacks. I then Unchained, Berserk and rotate storms and butchers on the boss and then drop defiance after pacification. I'll be close to pulling threat then so I rotate between Storms Eye and Storms path at this point keeping fracture up. When I have to tank I pop defiance and provoke butchers block, tomahawks until its in melee range again and then infuriate getting ready for critical rip to inner beast. The MT takes it off and I only drop defiance if I have vengeance or Thrill+Conva up. I can't pull threat so I have to rotate between Storms eye and Storms path the rest of the fight with fracture. Is there anything I can do different on that fight to up my DPS? I don't drop defiance during adds. I just recently acquired potions, when is a good time to use potions in a rotation? What's an ideal DPSing rotation? During turn 11 I haven't had the practice to stand at the flank and time resonance to stack with the tank. So I never really drop defiance during that fight. What can I do to maximize my dps on that turn? I haven't tank t12 100% yet, what are some tips for maximizing dps on t12 and general warrior tanking t12? Ive learned if I use vengeance about 5 seconds before revelation its up for every revelation. I can only really time that for the first two. Whats your general rotation on picking up bennus? Thanks for your time! Man-Moding Ftw. Gear wise I use Str Ring, Ruby Melded Ring, Shiva Vit bracelet, Ruby Melded Earring and Vit Dreadwyrm Necklace. "
223,vulnerability,ffxiv,Cloud of Darkness Guide,0,2t1r6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2t1r6h/cloud_of_darkness_guide/,2015-01-21 00:31:19,"Most of WoD is easy enough if you get a group who is halfway capable of holding their own. The biggest hurdle, appropriately, is the final boss. I'd like to use this thread to put together a simple guide of tips to help people take down the Cloud. 1. CoD can be pushed via DPS. You can skip phases. You probably won't, but you can. 1. Any time CoD moves around the ring, she fires a massive laser through the center of the area. When she disappears, immediately move to the sides. This attack will give a vulnerability debuff 3. Throughout the fight, CoD will spawn comets that mark off small areas in regular patterns across the area. AT LEAST 1 PERSON has to be in each comet area before the comet reaches the ground or suffer extensive raid wide damage. The person in the comet area will take a hit, but this can be split among as many people standing in the area when the comet falls and becomes negligible with just two or three players. 2. A random player will get targeted with a floating marker. After a few seconds, blasts will start falling from the sky chasing after the target player. The blasts move toward the player at running speed, so sprint if it gets too close. Each blast adds a vulnerability debuff and it will kill you quickly if you let it. The player targeted should start running a lap around the outside edge of the area, away from all other players because those blasts can and will hit anyone caught by them. 4. During the next phase, worm adds will spawn around the area. Hitting them once or twice causes them to disappear. ~~I'm not actually sure what happens if you don't DPS down these adds because my group was able to handle them quickly. Someone want to chime in here?~~ The worms add many debuffs like Morbol's Bad Breath to anyone standing too close to them. Stay away and let the ranged DPS handle. Thanks /u/Alkling 5. After the worms, the floor of the area will light up and cloud and storm adds will start spawning. These MUST be killed quickly. They slowly make their way toward CoD and if she eats them she gets a damage buff for her next, raid wide attack. Too many and she will wipe you here. The clouds can be effected by Heavy but not by Bind. 6. After the cloud phase is down she will do a raid wide attack that will hurt. AOE heals and protection are important. 7. Next phase she will spawn 3 clouds in a triangle formation. These clouds have a box shaped outline around them and each party HAS TO get in the box. A, B, and C have their own cloud and this should be marked ahead of time. After a few seconds the box will go up and make it impossible for anyone to enter or leave until the clouds are either dead or explode. The raid will survive one of these exploding, some might survive two, none will survive three. Kill em quick. 8. Almost immediately after the clouds in boxes phase, many comets will spawn all around the area. If you aren't ready for this, you will wipe, probably multiple times. Everyone needs to spread out right after the clouds in boxes are down and each comet MUST be taken by at least one person. It may be prudent to save the Healer LB3 for this phase if your alliance screws up. 1. After the big sequence of comets ends, comets will start spawning along with clouds and storms. Comets must be taken by at least one person and clouds and storms must be killed before they make it to CoD. Ranged DPS is key here, prepare to get a workout. 2. After this, the phases just start repeating. This bitch has a LOT of health so prepare for a slog if your DPS isn't up to snuff. Ideally DPS LB3 should be used but like I said, you may end up using that Healer LB3. I'll make edits to this as more people add their input. I'm not the best at writing these things out, but I wanted people to have something so that they're not going in blind. Good luck!"

Frontal cleave that is actually a flame thrower that persists after its telegraph disappears for about 5 seconds. Dont run back in front of it after the cone disappears. Itll mark someone with crosshairs as a target and place 4 liquid hell like floor AoE DoTs (as close as possible) in their direction. Towards the end of the fight, the boss will have two liquid hell lines persisting at once. Lastly, hell randomly target someone with a splash AoE that also leaves the same floor AoE DoT. *Pre 3rd Boss*: Nothing interesting about these adds. *3rd Boss*: Persisting mechanics include: Straight line AoEs in line with the boss that come in succession of: large middle lane, triple small lane, double small lane immediately between the previous three; Inner and Outer Circular AoEs centered at the boss  youll never want to be against the edge of the arena next to the boss or furthest away or you wont dodge these; Randomly targeted circular AoEs. After smacking the boss around, he becomes invulnerable and tethers an add, bringing it to life. ~~The tether is nothing but a visual representation.~~ &gt;The first add gains the buff if it's tanked too near to the boss (the tether will thicken). If it's pulled away the tether thins out and becomes more transparent. First add cleaves. When the add is at 50%, one of the flying adds from the first boss is now targetable and carrying a canister. Burn this flying add. When the arena glows blue (if you have the boss focus targeted, you can see its cast bar) interact with the dropped canister to erect a very small circular force field that gives you absolute invincibility  so do not worry about random AoEs or cleaves the initial add throws at you. Unlike the doors from The Lost City of Amdapor, it is not necessary to time the interaction with the canister so that you avoid the AoE properly as it speeds up upon interaction with the canister so that you will indeed survive. Kill the initial add. A second add will be tethered. &gt;It gains a buff from the thick tether if it's tanked too far away which will disappear if you tank it closer. Boss will throw out a fire AoE that grows in 3 parts and erupts the sections in the order that they appeared. ~~Take care as to not let the add be hit by this AoE as it gives it a vulnerability down (in other words, resistance up  takes less damage).~~ At 50%, the same thing happens as the first add. Thanks to vote4petro! **Wanderers Palace (Hard)** *Pre 1st Boss*: TONBEWWIES SHO SHAD! ;A; *1st Boss*: Throws unavoidable splash damage at random party members. Will launch Sacred Spears into the ground at random locations. Burn these down as they deal raid wide fire damage and apply a stacking debuff that increases damage taken from fire. Occasionally charges at party members and knocks them back. Targets a random party member with a telegraphed circular AoE that both pacifies and silences. Lastly, it has a large conal cleave that will target a random party member, you will want to be mid to close range to dodge this. *Pre 2nd Boss*: Sacred Standard is a totem pole that buffs all enemies inside it. Always drag enemies out of it to fight them. No need to break the Sacred Standards. *2nd Boss*: Summons little totem poles that give different status effects upon entering their area colors and appear to be random upon each entry into WP. There are 4 colors: green, red, teal, and purple. While their effects random between from WP to WP, if you figure out what the color does within the instance, it will stay consistent for the rest of the fight. *Pre 3rd Boss*: FWEE LE TAWNBEWWIES ;A; *3rd Boss*: Dont stand too far away because he targets a random member and uses a wide and long distance cleave causing stun and magic resistance down and youll need to be close enough to avoid it. He applies a debuff on a party member called Rotting Lungs  simply do not get hit by his melee circular cleave called Rot Gas. He will periodically drop Sacred Standards beneath him. Move him out of its area effects. Sometimes, instead of a Sacred Standard, he drops a Sacred Idol which will continue to give the boss the same effect as Sacred Standard does even when moved outside of its visual effect area. Merely burn this down as it has massively less hp than Sacred Standards. Doom will randomly be cast upon party members and, similar to the siren in Pharos Sirius, healing the party member back to max hp will remove the debuff. Lastly, he spawns adds which have very little hp and are easily burnt. *Post 3rd Boss*: VENGEANCE!! - by Dentere **Amdapor Keep (Hard)** *Pre 1st Boss*: Tentacle rape They smack ya with vulnerability up, dont-ya-know? *1st Boss*: The boss has many targeted aoe type attacks and his basic attacks cleave. There are 4 statues, do not damage them -- neither yourself or with the boss attacks and cleaves. They are your friends! Be somewhat near them so that they are accessible but not close enough that his aoes will harm them. When someone is targeted overhead with a red laser, they need to immediately Line of Sight (LoS) the boss with a statue so that it soaks the laser. This move builds stacks on the targeted member and will eventually kill them around 4+ stacks. *Pre 2nd Boss*: Eorzean adventurer, Warrior of Light, tree climber... did you ever know... that you're my hero? *2nd Boss*: HUGE CLEAVE! Later in the fight, the cleave will cause confusion and youll act brain jacked and smack your teammates. You can negate the damage and the confuse effect by looking away from the boss as it casts. ~~Hug him like hes a lala so you can dodge him like hes not a lala.~~ When boss becomes untargetable and stealthed, kill the Luminescence, enter its bright field and youll obtain a (de?)buff that when the timer runs out, you emit light around you in a small cone. Once again, hug the boss like hes a lala with this (de?)buff and shine the light on him to illuminate him and make him targetable again. Some adds spawn but they have teeny hp. Towards the end of the fight, hell split himself in two. &gt;On the second boss in AK, [redacted name] the Entrance cone AoE that confuses you appeared to be sight based. We were all able to just turn around and face away when it went off to avoid the confusion. -tpark88 *Pre 3rd Boss*: DEEPS ALL THE THINGS. Coolest arena ever, might I add. *3rd Boss*: Periodically becomes invincible and tethers an add(s) while he charges an AoE that gets larger over time so burn the adds ASAP before the AoE covers the whole arena. He also throws spinning scythes like the second boss of Haukke Manor (Hard) but instead of knock back it gives a vulnerability up debuff. Also small lane AoEs will be telegraphed by swords appearing at the edge of the arena. Little slimes will be dropped on members, binding them in place and the boss will ready a cleave at them. Break them out and they can also target the slime themselves. Cankerous Gobbet is the most dangerous slime, burn it asap. Blackout is his raid wide damage. GG2EZ4MEBBY Edited 1/21 4:02 PST"
226,vulnerability,ffxiv,World of Darkness tips,38,2u4k3v,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2u4k3v/world_of_darkness_tips/,2015-01-30 08:42:28,"Another quick thread like this, now that I've been through this thing god knows how many times. This is less about core fight mechanics and more about things not everyone might have picked up on or small things to make the raid go smoother, though I'm basing it mostly on what people don't seem to know in my runs. Please let me know about any corrections or other helpful information; just editing things in, read the comments to see who helped out with what. *Garm* * You can avoid the paralysis like you do with any other Chimera; Voice of the Dragon hits far but can be outranged, Voice of the Ram is point-blank. Both can be stunned/silenced, shields (including Manaward) that reduce the damage to 0 will block the paralysis. * The second batch of adds is a test of tanks' ability to remember that they have those aggro skills and they can use them to make the monsters stop killing healers. Extra credit if they actually stack everything for AoEs. **Angra Mainyu** * Focus target the boss. If at any point in the fight you realize the boss is not focus targeted, smack yourself with your keyboard. As far as I can tell, the Doom debuff is decided when the animation goes off, not when the cast bar reaches a certain percentage, so don't just assume you're going to get hit, and don't turn back towards him before you see that you've dodged it. * During hourglasses, position yourself to DPS facing away from the boss (a 90 degree angle is fine, as far as I can tell) so you can ignore your all-important focus target bar. * Daewa's casts (Paralyze, Eyes on Me) can be stunned/silenced, Eyes on Me being especially important. You can LoS Paralyze by running through it if you're close enough, but not by turning away. Healers, someone can get paralyzed during this part. Please Esuna/Leeches me. * The red part of the AoE is behind him, and the blue part is in front of him. Tanks need to keep his positioning stable. *Queen Scylla* * Kill the gates or don't, but whatever adds pop up, stack them with the boss. If nothing else, killing the big gates in the second part helps. * Ancient Flare and Quaga can be stunned/silenced. * If anyone has video proof of being able to wait out the chest, I'd love to see it. **Five-Headed Dragon** * If you have a purple marker, stack with at least two other people, though the more the better. Don't run away from everyone. * When the boss sucks in a deep breath, if you have a yellow marker, run away from everyone as best you can because the dragon is going to sneeze on you. This won't kill anyone with decent HP, but interrupting half the raid isn't helpful. * Dragonfire Fly will wait a short while before doing unavoidable damage and applying an HP/resistance down debuff . You might survive two applications, but three will most likely kill you. Avoid this by passing it to someone else through physical contact (your character to theirs, not the tether), who is then obligated to follow the same mechanic. If you have this and you are running away from me trying to steal it I will be very sad. * Someone has to stand in the poison puddle to prevent further slimes from spawning. If you are targeted by an AoE while in the puddle, suck it up, because at the end of its duration it will spawn the giant slime and its Silence explosion even if you've been standing there the whole time. I learned this the hard way. * Heat Wave is a raid-wide AoE that applies the Pyretic debuff to everyone. Pyretic lasts 5 seconds and makes you take constant damage if you do absolutely anything at all. This may or may not kill you, but I've seen people die to it almost every single time (once a Ninja had 37 HP). Just prove to the world that you are capable of holding still for 5 seconds to save your healers grief, since everyone is likely spread out. If Heat Wave is shielded, Pyretic is not applied. *Atomos* * Step on the glowy circles to activate other groups' platforms. You don't have to stay on them afterwards. * You can avoid being sucked in by jumping off the platform, though Atomos will still suck people in based on your position. Try not to jump off right away so people can figure out who they're running away from. * Shockwave won't push you off the platform if you're standing directly under him. **Cerberus** * Make sure tanks know what their job is. Whatever method is chosen (ABC, all DPS), if no one starts dealing with Wolfsbane adds, shit's gonna suck. * Lightning orbs are spawned well before their line AoEs pop up. Try and position yourself to dodge prematurely so you don't get trapped in a cluster of them. * Ululation causes Abandonment, a 5-second debuff that will hit you with Fear (Hysteria) if you stray too far from other party members. This happening to the tank is especially not fun. Healers should Stoneskin/Adlo if possible, but if you're concerned about this not happening, someone with 100% physical reduction can hang out with the tank while it's up before running away. **Cloud of Darkness** * Other alliance's healers should help heal the MT when possible in this fight especially. Outgoing damage is considerably large, and a single stack of her vulnerability debuff can cause big problems. * Only one person is needed for each comet. You can put more in to split the damage and build LB but the damage is small, and making sure there are enough people dealing with all the mechanics is more important. If you are a melee person, you probably don't need to be in there with someone ranged while clouds are up. * Use melee LB3 as soon as it's ready. You have time to build another one, and maybe even an LB1 afterwards. You can save it for emergencies (with tank LB3, 12 stacks barely even hurts), but this doesn't do much good unless the other parties do the same thing. Better to maximize DPS and minimize time to make mistakes. * The amount of time you have to get into a hexagon for Hypercharged Clouds is fairly generous. Don't freak out and assume you need to stay in the closest hexagon, because even one Particle Beam going off is massive damage for everyone. Just pay attention (there's a giant text box announcing it) and use your movement skills if necessary."
227,vulnerability,ffxiv,The terrible guide to Final Coil of Bahamut,327,2u8028,http://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2u8028/the_terrible_guide_to_final_coil_of_bahamut/,2015-01-31 05:29:46,"The Final Coil of Bahamut is a great place for gear, story, and ERP. It is where the bourgeois gather and talk about getting the Dreadwyrm Ring of Fending 5 times in a row and how much summoners are unwelcome. However, the fights are amped up, taking you and your unstable roster to the limit. Take this seriously because 2.5 will last for another 2 years or so, so you need to be the best of the best so that you can finally have the DPS to take down Shiva EX, or even Urth's Fount if you're REALLY pro. **Preparation:** You must first beat the Second Coil of Bahamut (guide can be found [here](URL You're welcome). Hunts have been released for the first time this patch and are easier to get into than ever. By doing hunts, you can get carboncoat, carbontwine, ventures, and a wind-up succubus (which is BiS so make sure you get a couple of these in case you throw them out). To join in on the hunt, go to any zone and look for key words like ""early"" and ""puller"" and ""wtf"" and ""homoerotic."" This will let you know that a hunt has just concluded. Trade with everyone trying to teleport away to keep them there and ask them to join their party. They will accept. Follow people around and arrive late until you get fed up and craft your gear instead. You'll also need 5 or 6 bards on backup for one of the primary mechanics of the FCOB. You'll also need food and potions: you can get mega-potions of strength NQ as a leve reward from Mor Dhona (CUE MARKET CRASH FOR EXPOSING SECRETS). As for food, the only way that I know is to go around offering handies until someone gives you some. I've also heard that you can buy eggs somewhere, but I think that's a myth. Similar to ST, avoid World of Darkness because that minion is not going to drop. Also, consider finishing that Brayflox NM farm group that you started forever ago because it has BiS for glamour, and you need all the deeps you can get for this. **Turn 10:** There are two mechanics that are part of this fight that aren't even part of the boss. The first is bard instability. You'll get a bard that will quit your static as soon as you get into FCOB. This is where you'll need your backups. Run through them until you seemingly find the backup with the worst damage; that one has the most to prove. His voice will also be weird in your voice chat; don't worry, his voice is BiS. The second will be that you have to find someone who has gotten past the trash but not beaten the boss. There are people out there who can sneak past the adds and IT'S NOT YOU SO DON'T EVEN TRY DEAL WITH IT. You'll need to find someone to skip this. This mechanic will take a while so be patient, but also flip your shit and talk about how you've been thinking about quitting because of roster instabilities. Once you get someone to skip trash for you, get your initial party back together and get to the boss. Maahes will be waiting for you. Your tank will start the fight without protect; make sure your healers are to blame. The boss has two frontal cones: one in the front and one behind. These simulate all of the directions that Taco Bell can come out of you; stop eating Taco Bell. Avoid both. Eventually, a blue marker will appear over someone. This means that Imbagod is going to charge someone. You'll need to raise them. If it's a healer, wipe it until it's not a healer. The boss will leave behind some electricity that really hurts, so when you disconnect later in the fight, make sure that you're not standing in it. The boss will give birth on da flo; most groups are chauvinistic and kill the daughters first. Kill the children and Im2gud will burst and come back and do the same shit mostly. Some lightning will come down and hit people so make sure they're in their designated spots that you should have assigned and that I should have told you to do but didn't because I didn't watch the video on making this guide. People will basically stay in their same spot the entire fight until lightning comes down when they'll run around and group up for whatever reason and you'll wipe. Keep going until the stars align and no one gets hit by anyone else's lightning. After a while, the boss will give birth again and then these Lannister children will incestuously give birth to even more children. Wait until all six are out (DONT START KILLING ANY OF THEM UNTIL THE LAST GROUP SPAWNS) and then use AOE LB on 4 of them, because your tank will tactically lose hate and 2 of them will run at the healer who will run to the outer circle. Kill all of them blame your healers for any deaths that occur. The final phase will come up. It will also go tether + lightning into either tether + charge or lightning + charge. If you ever get tether + charge, wipe and try the fight again until you get lightning + charge. Tether + charge will kill 2 of your people while lightning + charge will only kill one; effectively halving the mana that you use!! This is the only way to do this. Keep raising and use tank limit when the boss gets too many stacks. The floor will close in around you and you'll realize that the bard you got didn't have enough damage so move on to a different one until you win. **Turn 11:** There's some trash that hurts healers a LOT so you'll need to have two healers, a tank, and idc. A monk or something. Just not a summoner. All of those people will go to one side, kill everything there, return back, and go to the other side as well. Don't return too early and you'll have to wait 15 minutes to clear another side. The rest of your party can deal with their connection issues or texts from their nosey girlfriends asking about what they're doing right now like what? are we married now or something? fuck. Kali-ma will be at the end. The boss has 3 moves: Nerve gas, sloppy seconds, and some color coded bombs. You'll start the fight and everyone in your group will immediately be at half hp because they STILL after all this time can't grasp that the boss will do a frontal cone auto attack first. Both of your tanks need to be Siamese-twinsing it in front of the boss. Nerve gas will come out and give everyone vulnerability; just heal through it and blame the healers if you die. Barofield will drop right under the boss and kill your d/cing dragoon after like 10 seconds. Keep doing damage, spread out, and raise the people that get hit by the blue bomb. Also a tank might die but whatever you have 2. At 60%, the boss will summon some adds. Have your not-summoner hit the square one while your monk autoattacks the circle one because Goad never went out. You'll also need to raise your bard because he was standing on the wall when the adds came out. This part is going to be kind of hard to do with 7 people because let's face it, your dragoon isn't coming back. Anyway, just kill shit and dodge lasers. There will be this high damaging paralyze that's going to hit the group that may complicate things, but just be better and it won't be an issue. The boss will explode and your healer should have been stoneskinning people, but he wasn't so raise the people that he neglected and make sure he knows that it's his fault. Your scholar will be pretty quiet here because he could have virused, too, but he forgot so he's just gonna let your WHM take the heat. Some tethers will come out. If the tethers aren't on the two tanks, it's a wipe. Just redo the fight until you get nothing but tank tethers. If you enrage, get a different bard. **Turn 12:** This fight is a real challenge with your shitty bard; you'll definitely cycle through a lot here. Phoenix will use a tank buster called Revelation that's going to kill your warrior because your healer didn't heal hard enough. Make sure they know this. Some small birds will pop up through the fight that need to be taken way too far away from each other. Also your tank will start pulling them away way too late so some might die on the way. Oh well, concentrate on your dps numbers because that's what matters; everyone ELSE is fucking up but not you. Phoenix will eventually spawn some black fires; don't touch it because you don't know where it's been and you don't want to catch what it has. It'll spawn some white fires to subdue the black fires and just leave an overall bad taste in your mouth and remind you about 3/5th of some shit that you heard about in high school. You'll probably wonder if SE caught on to this, but never voice your concerns. Anyway, finish the urban fires off and keep doing this until 80%. A brand will go out and it will just be WAY too much for your healers to deal with but don't let them get out of this shit; this is their responsibility. A blue fire will target a melee every. damn. time. and drop a giant aoe right under Phoenix. Quickly make your tank pull Phoenix really far away for every blue fire. A red fireball will come out and your bard will need to sprint to get to it because he forgot. Try to get him a Goad only to see it go out on the not-summoner. You'll want to slow your damage on Phoenix until you get LB3. This'll be at about 6 bennus I'm assuming (Idk, I'm still on turn 8.) LB3 them all and then ???. Once the add phase is done, Phoenix will come back and drop a burning ring of fahr. Someone needs to be in this and it can't be your healers because they just have a lot on their plate right now with the gas prices being so low and they're on weight watchers AGAIN. I would not recommend putting your bard in the ring because he's just going to die anyway. About this time, a tank will be forgotten about and die to Revelation so make sure your other tank is ready to pick it up. Just keep the damage up, replace your bard if the damage is too low, and he'll be done with. **Turn 13:** This fight was kind of a mistake by SE; they forgot to add echo to it so it's actually not possible right now, but fuck it you can try, right? Megaflare will come out and some markers will come down indicating who is going to be sacrificed. Then Earthshaker will come out and your bard is going to get confused on which marker was which, so he'll run to the middle and put his goop all over everyone. This is pretty much as far as you can possibly get right now; without echo, you can't survive the gigaflare. Someone in my group said that the fight becomes easier if I buy a LOT of gil and then start reselling that gil to people, so I'll probably have to try that. Congratulations on your clears! You've earned it!"
