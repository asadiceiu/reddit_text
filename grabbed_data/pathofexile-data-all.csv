2,vulnerability,pathofexile,I dread the return to normal crafting...,1,hkbn34,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/hkbn34/i_dread_the_return_to_normal_crafting/,2020-07-03 13:16:34,"So, a little about myself as a player of this game. I've participated in about a dozen leagues. Usually getting up to the point where I could comfortably run t16 maps, thinking ""okay, tomorrow I'm gonna tackle the big bosses!"" and then putting it off until next league. In Delirium I managed to beat the Simulacrum, but it was too exhausting to continue playing. One thing that was always completely enigmatic to me was crafting. No matter how many guides I've read or watched, it was the only thing that *always* appeared like pure gambling. Throwing currency at an item and metacrafting it until you get lucky and hit those t1-2 mods that you wanted. Yeah, sure, lock that one out, increase probability of this, use fossil for that. In the end rolling 6 good mods is still not feeling any more feasible, least one just goes imprinting and slamming all day long. And it wasn't a big problem to ignore it. Most of the stuff you need for red maps - even as a noob - is okay-ish stuff for up to 5ex (Like The Perfect Form with 6 links or a good weapon). However, one thing that I noticed in this league - I almost always adjusted my build to the items, not the other way around. Because it was impossible to craft something superior to the cheap items on trade, without having to spend dozens of Ex. But this league? It's different. I have an evasion chest with 4 red and 1 blue socket. I've crafted it myself with the stuff I actually needed on it, instead of scouring the marketplace for hours daily in the search of an item that is just good and cheap enough. And what's worst about it - it's fun. It's fun to make your own amazing items that you couldn't drop. That aren't on the market or that would cost 50ex in any other league. Why is that bad? Cause it's likely to go away. And then it's back to just buying whatever is offered, simply because it's impossible to grind up the insane amounts of currency one needs for metacrafting as an average player. A single-attribute chest with 5 off-colors? HA, that's 5,000 chromatics on average. A ring with vulnerability on hit, 2 high resistances, melee damage, life and AoE? Yeah, that would be 1 mirror plx It will be fun while it lasts, but I think we all know that it will fall prey to the ""we can't have too many nice things, or people would have too much fun. Good items should be unobtainable to 99,99% of the playerbase"" argument, that many will drape in ""It unbalances the game"" (because getting one-shot by a random crit at 67k ehp is balanced) and ""then good items wouldn't be anything special anymore"" (Read: ""Then I can't be one of the few ones who have good items and feel superior to others"") It's really, really frustrating, but nothing about it will likely ever change."

Atm my build is level 92 and it clears maps well enough, and it has taken down Shaper and A5 Awakaner but the dps was less than ideal (more so Shaper as the area was more degen than anything else by the end of it) I'm happy I pushed it this far but I would like to know if there are any obvious upgrades I can make besides more life and such on some equipment.

I love Harvest and hope it will change the way we craft items in the game even if it doesn't stay on the same way it is at the moment. As per Rule 10: Steps might be a little fuzzy since I crafted it last week 1. Buy Elreon Steel Ring base 2. Regal and fill prefixes, remove any suffix 3. Craft Cannot roll caster mods. Augment speed for attack speed (guaranteed) 4. Slam Warlord's exalted, hit T1 Multi luckily which saved me any reroll. 5. Augment physical mod for garanteed vulnerability 6. Augment/Remove lifemodifier until T1 Life 7. Craft phys damage to attacks I had mostly all the crafts myself, total cost of the ring was \~12ex (mainly the base and some crafts) Im sure this could be done in a better way, im really happy with the result nevertheless, and enjoying been able to actually craft good gear and progressing your character and not throwing currency at a base randomly expecting some half decent result.

I want to work in Ryslatha's Coil, but doing so will mean I have to retool my resistances pretty much from the ground up. I'm wondering - if I'm already going to have to do that, should I take this opportunity to change some other stuff too? Assailum - I have a +40% damage Puncture helm but I haven't really crafted anything on it at all besides life. I know Assailum gives insane single target damage on bosses, I know it's a bit clunky to charge. The real question is what the heck do I do with my leftover 6 link? Right now I have a bow with Puncture and Lioneye's Vision with Split Arrow. Maloney's - I have a damage over time multiplier + physical damage over time multiplier quiver I crafted. I've seen Maloney's used with Ensnaring/curse on hit vulnerability, otherwise I am currently crafting up a ring trying to get the same. Rain of Arrows - This seems to be a thing, I'm using Split Arrow as mentioned. I don't really know the difference here, what the advantages or disadvantages to using it would be. It seems that if I'm freeing up a 6 link, I could pitch my chest and use something rare/crafted instead, and work this in? My setup otherwise is Ballista Totem/Maim/Multiple Totems/Ensnaring, Malevolence/Flesh &amp; Stone/War Banner, Dash/Second Wind/Blood Magic/Enduring Cry. I know all this can do with some tweaking, it's just been working so I haven't messed with it yet. Now is the time. Basically, I can swap in Ryslatha's, fix my resists, call it a day, or go a little harder and change up to something different, and I am ok with selling basically anything on me. Currently I'm having problems with survivability and single target DPS. Clear is fine, but could always be faster. URL"

My name is Nawul and I need help with my Self-Curse Doryanis Prototype Occultist build. Im at level 85 atm, the build seems pretty good but I need suggestions on better path/items/skills. The build revolves around Curse Effectiveness and self-cursing with Conductivity, the ascendancy choice is pretty obvious, its Occultist because of curse effectiveness, extra curse, better clear and helps me capping Chaos Resist (+60% via Withering Presence). Heres the POB: [URL I already have all the items besides the Shield. I can reach -277% Lightning Resistance with 2x Thread of Hope, 1x Immortal Flesh &amp; Conductivity, with a few adjustments and new clusters I can reach -350%+ but I dont know if worth it losing a few damage/EHP nodes for it. The build ends on Lv.96, I know its high but for me its pretty chill to get there. I have 1.079m Arc DPS with no Awakened gems and theres a few items missing in POB (Helmet, Boots, Both Rings, Flasks). Tested with Shock Nova the damage seems better overall, 2M on Nova and 1M on the rings, 3M with good positioning. The DPS is pretty nice when I equip the Cowards Legacy belt (+50% Curse Effect on You) + Pain Attunement, but EVERYTHING will hit you like a truck (boosted Vulnerability 100% uptime on you), and because of the +50% Curse Effect on You when Im cursed with Ele. Weakness my resists drop near to zero, its terrible. I have a pretty cool Determination Watchers Eye for the unaffected by Vulnerability but I cant find space on mana reservation for it, even if I found other curses (from mobs or map itself) would make me REALLY squishy. I would like new suggestions from build pathing, items, ascendancy, everything! Feel free to criticize and suggest anything you want, im having a blast leveling the build and I really want to make it work and ill probably play in standard with it after the end of Harvest. Im in love with Doryanis Prototype and I really want to exploit the item. About Ventors Gamble, yea I know this is the best ring for the build but theyre like..20ex with good resistance rolls and -20\~25% Lightning Res, so...it will take some time. Thanks for reading until now and lets theorycraft! See ya mates!"

All mods self farmed (physical, life, resistance mods) As per rule 10, these are my steps: * Get yourself a Warlord ring, whatever ring it suits you the better. In my case, I found my self this one after defeating Drox. I needed the chaos resistance. * Spammed Alteration Orbs until I hit T1 cold resistance (needed the res). On the augmentation and regal, I hit two random affixes (I don't remember correctly, but one was fire damage per endurance charge (prefix) and the other one a suffix easily removable through harvest) * Blocked the suffixes with a random one and spammed augment life - remove/add life until T1 flat life. * Removed the crafted mod. Without removing the fire damage per endurance charge I blocked the prefixes with the bench (I put flat mana), then augmenting physical damage. Here you have a 100% chance to gain the Vulnerability on Hit mod as there is no other physical mod as a suffix. * Removed the mana crafted mod. Removed the fire mod with Harvest and then I put ""Suffixes cannot be changed"" to make sure that with the augment physical - remove/add physical spam I don't remove the Vulnerability mod. Spammed until T1 flat Phys. * Blocked prefixes again with a random craft, spamming add/remove-add fire until I hit T1 fire resistance. * Crafted minus mana cost on top of it. * Done! Some points about my item: * Yes, it can be divined until everything is its top value. I didn't want to spend time on this, too lazy to do it. * Why no Steel ring? They are expensive. Maybe if you the base and slamming it with a Warlord's Exalted Orb then scouring it down to make the same process would be cheaper. It didn't matter to me. * Why no critical multi on it? I needed resistances. I'm on my way to craft another Warlord ring that will have crit multi."

This is the most recent installment of this subs playthrough of the official Path of Exile Gamebook/CYOA book. We play as Weylin of Ezomyr, an ex-arena gladiator, chosen to traverse the Lords Labyrinth for our chance at becoming Emperor! Every day at Noon EDT, Ill post the latest series of events and choices that you all get to vote on and discuss. [Part 18 is here.](URL Yesterday, we were outplayed by none other than Captain Reviro, the man who has slaughtered countless Ezomytes. Deciding that action is our best choice here, the majority of you decided that we should swing out against another mirror to try to catch him. [The relevant pages are here.](URL --- You lash out at Reviro. More glass falls to the floor. Wind whispers behind you, and you barely duck in time, the wide-bladed legion sword whistling past your ear. You spin, but hes already darting behind another pillar, reflections morphing and merging. Ahh, and when Im emperor, Ezomyte, I will finally fulfill my duty. My legions will burn you out, a cleansing wave of fire to consume your wretched hovels, to drive your screaming children into our waiting swords. He laughs again, and an army of red-cloaked lunatics laugh with him. You sense the sudden blow before you see it, barely raising your weapon in time to block. Your hands sting from the impact, and all around you, a multitude of madmen dart away, leaving you a moment to gather your wits and harden your resolve. Its past time this butcher was sent to the chopping block. --- **CAPTAIN REVIRO** DEFENSE 12 | DAMAGE 2 | LIFE 10 &gt; As the first to reach the Mirror Maze, Reviro has had time to accustom himself to its trick and is more than willing to use them against you. When Reviro attacks, take an INT Skill Test at Threshold 10. &gt; If you pass, you see Reviro coming. Add 3 to your DEFENSE for that turn. If you fail, you are momentarily confused. Reviro gets +4 To Hit for that turn. &gt; In addition, if Reviros To Hit roll exceeds your DEFENSE by 4, you take an additional 1 DAMAGE from being blindsided. *If you win this battle,* **turn to 140.** *If you fail,* **turn to 293.** --- Alright gang, this is gonna be either very close or very swingy. Our INT Defense is our best Defense, but is still a mere 4. Well need that boost from the Skill Tests, which is admittedly almost impossible to fail with our bonuses, but the real saving grace (in my opinion) is that by default, he only deals 2 damage and we deal 3! If you want to read my interpretation of the rolls, that is the next section. If you want the shorter, official passage for the result, skip ahead one section. --- The Butcher of Ezomyr whirls around you, copies twisting and merging in their silvery prisons. Patterns of movement start to appear, when Reviro strikes out from your left side. Your buckler flashes out to meet his elbow, not in time to fully deflect his blow, but in time for a flash of surprise to cross those evil eyes. That gives you enough time to pierce the joint of his plated armor, an animalistic growl issuing from his gritted teeth. In a moment, he darts back from you, melding with the furious army of duplicates. Once more, the sounds of his heavy boots stomping against the fine flagstones bounce from surface to surface, filling the air. The fakes are almost getting easier to identify, and you can gauge your immediate surroundings enough to guess where he could come from. As luck would have it, you werent totally unprepared, but his style leaves you on your back foot, as a mix of slashes and stabs drives the edge of his blade along your ribs. You refuse to allow him the pleasure of hearing your cries of pain, and channel that emotion into a brutal stab that slides into his bicep. A deep growl becomes words scraping between his teeth, Im going to rip your damned arms from your shoulders, vermin! Youre not making it out of this! A headbutt catches your temple and leaves you reeling just enough time to lose him in the mirrors once again. You clear your head and wipe the trickle of blood from your brow, before noticing the blood on the floor. The trail leaves a noticeable path, less easily reflected in the thousands of mirrors between pillars, and curves off to the left. The hundreds of legionnaires around you seem to watch you with a predatory hunger, but you can identify pain in their glares. On a hunch, you take a chance. From your still, defensive stance, you rush down the corridor, following the trail of blood, to find it end before an image of Reviro. You know its the real one when he whirls around to face you and raise his blade in surprise, but your Needle drives itself straight through the front of his cuirass and into his vitals. He stomps on your foot and grabs your arm, inadvertently twisting the blade inside the wound; you realize its intentional, hes trying to damage your weapon with his own body, like a shark to a fishermans rod! You press your weight into a full shove, toppling him back into a mirror, silvered glass crashing down around him and yourself. Your weapon slides free, red with his hot blood, but with no obvious signs of damage. Captain Reviro tumbles backwards, blood following him, before settling into a crouch. He snarls at you once more, but its cut short as confusion crosses his face. He looks down at your feet, and you risk a glance. There, just behind your left foot, is his wide-bladed legion sword. You look back, and can see his mind twisting in on itself to formulate a way to save himself. Before he can, though, you stop it all short by kicking the blade backward and lunging your blade out. It catches him squarely in the shoulder, and before he can try to twist away, you withdraw and stab again. The second lands in his arm, raised in defense, and you feel the bone of his forearm crack. A howl of pain, barely human, issues from his mouth before he falls backwards into the broken mirror. A flurry of emotions overcome you. Rage. Glee. For a moment, this monsters own madness seeps into your mind, and youre consumed by his vulnerability. Vengeance for innumerable innocent people guides your hands and feet and lungs as you strike out again and again, deaf to his cries, blinded by hatred, bellowing every curse your people have invented. You are left panting and alone in the maze of mirrors, surrounded by hundreds of butchered legionnaires and wild-eyed Ezomyte gladiators, their hair dripping with sweat, arms tense and twitching, body spattered with dark blood. --- *Here is the books write-up:* You swing at another battered image of Reviro, and more silvered glass sprays out onto the floor. You curse at the miss, but most of the mirrors are gone now, the once pristine room a shattered mess of prismatic destruction - a mad alchemists exploded laboratory. You circle, trying to spot the elusive butcher of your kin amidst the chaos. Crunching footsteps sound from behind you, and you lift your weapon to deflect the incoming blow. Reviros much slower now, the punishment youve given him taking an obvious toll. Sweat drips down his rage-contorted face and he charges at you, a desperate move, risking all to tackle you to the ground. You both land heavily, weapons flying across the room. Reviro raises a fist to crush your face, and with a surge of adrenaline you buck your hips up, toppling him to the side. Slowed by his armor and injury, this legionnaire struggles to push himself upright, and you seize the brief opening. You eel over on top of Reviros back, trying to get your arm around his neck in a chokehold, his red cloak bunching beneath your legs. Before you can complete the grappling move, he flings an armored hand in front of your forearm, keeping the choke from fully engaging. He wriggles desperately, hsi free hand pounding against the side of your leg, but its like the buzzing annoyance of a gnat. Shifting your weight, you bear down even harder, forcing his gauntleted fingers back into his own throat. He gags and coughs, clutching futilely at your wrist, but theres no room for mercy in your heart. This beast, this monster, killer of hundreds of your countrymen no. Wraeclast will not miss Captain Reviro. You flex your arms even harder, muscles and veins popping out along your skin, ignoring the bite of metal armor into your flesh. One of the few remaining mirrors reflects your struggle back at you, your blood-streaked features quivering with the effort, your gaze locked on the hated Captain. His pupils roll like a maddened dogs, seeking escape, but his time is done. Reviros face turns purple, his eyes bulging fro their sockets, the tip of his tongue protruding from his mouth, and with one final heave, you yank backwards with all your strength. A sharp crack reverberates through the room, vertebrae snapping under the immense stress, and Reviro goes limp beneath you, legs twitching in his final death throes. Panting, you twist his head viciously to make sure, turning his face skyward even as his chest remains pressed to the stone floor. Wearily, you climb to your feet. No matter what else happens in this labyrinth, at least youve brought your people some small measure of satisfaction. --- Well, that was intense. In total, we ended up passing the INT test every time, but he rolled reasonably well, only missing twice. I held back on using our Flask, since our Defense was so low, but he never beat our Defense by more than 1 and hit us twice. Also, I double checked my rolls, and we never rolled a 7, which is a shame. In total, we killed him in four attacks and took **4 damage!** --- *The battle with Reviro has driven you past your limits, yet still youve emerged victorious. You may increase any one ATTRIBUTE by 2 points, OR any two ATTRIBUTES by 1 point each. You also gain 2 ASCENDANCY POINTS.* You search the corpse for anything useful and find a healing potion tucked away in a belt pouch. You quaff it down without hesitation. To the victor goes the spoils. *If your LIFE is below 10, restore it to 10. Otherwise, gain 3 LIFE.* **Turn to 39.** A rumbling noise filters into your weary ears, and you look up from Reviros corpse to see a section of brickwork shifting to the side, another of IZaros hidden doors. You leave the room of broken mirrors behind and make your way into a roughly excavated passageway, pick and shovel marks visible on the walls. Iron-barred cells appear once again, dotting the corridor like plague sores. Your nose wrinkles at the stench filling the air - clearly the inhabitants are no longer among the living. The tunnel opens a touch, turning into what seems to be a small antechamber. A voice sounds all around you, the mad architect of this nightmare trial issuing another proclamation. Two have fallen, yet four remain. A true emperor stands alone above pretenders. Ascend with precision. You wait to see if theres more, but it seems Izaro is dispensing with his usual loquaciousness. Looking around, you notice a wooden door on the other side of the room, obviously the intended exit. Further examination reveals a small opening in one cell, barely visible behind a pile of decaying bodies, just big enough to crawl through. With a resigned sigh, you consider your choices. It sure would be nice to see the sun again. *If you would like to go through the door,* **turn to 277. If you would like to explore the crawlspace,* **turn to 218.** --- And thats a wrap for the Butcher of Ezomyr! We gain another level of power! **As before, in the comments, leave a note of which Attributes and Ascendancy points Weylin should take!** Example: A1, A2, two points in INT! Since this is, again, a critical choice to make, I will skip tomorrows post to give you all time to vote and discuss Weylins progression. Last time, the consensus seemed to be that you would want to mainline Dexterity and use it for everything except defense, but maybe you should at least boost INT a little, since its our second-highest stat and best candidate for Defense? Its not my choice, though! And, of course, we need to pick which path we are taking once more. A wooden door could be anything, but that crawlspace is a bit intriguing. Perhaps a shortcut? A darkshrine? You decide! **Door or Crawlspace?** Cast your votes, and I will see you all in two days! [View Poll](URL"

18,vulnerability,pathofexile,Why I enjoy this league and why you should too,1,hhfeft,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/hhfeft/why_i_enjoy_this_league_and_why_you_should_too/,2020-06-29 00:35:14,"This perspective is from someone who made it to red maps in one week, and currently has **100 hours played**, which averages 5 hours per day (but I would argue my idle/research time makes it 4 hours actually played). I have played since legion, strictly in SC. I am not a casual player, but I am **not the .1%.** **TLDR;** If you don't like crafting, this league is equivalent to standard. If you have never crafted before, give this league a chance. Before harvest, I **never** crafted. I at most chaos-spam rolled some 20% resistance rings and sold them for some profit (30 to 60C), and giggled at calling myself a crafter at that time. Crafting felt like gambling and statistically unprofitable, and trying to make my items was economically a wrong choice, given it was cheaper and quicker to buy them. I had **never slammed** an item, it seems like a waste of a precious exalt. Now comes in Harvest, the crafting League, and boy, I am **loving it.** Imagine being able to craft almost any item you want in a **guaranteed** fashion as long as you grind it out (while playing the game and having fun). I currently was running **t12/t13** semi-juiced maps to level up (berserkers die in juiced t14/15 :( )and this was my experience: &amp;#x200B; * With the seed buff, I gained \~20 seeds per map, which means every \~11 maps I got to harvest my 9 fields. * I bought bases for almost every **reforge**, which I try to cycle quickly (but I don't) but it has allowed me to truly be a crafter and sell items. I have been flipping lab enchanted helms for multi exalt profits. I have been making hunter life belts for 100C profit and could probably make more if i committed to finishing the belt. My most casual sales are astral plates earning me 50C+ profits. * I have crafted my chest, my belt and a ring. Hunter belt with life, life %, and overwhelm! Ring with melee dmg %, life, and vulnerability on hit, chest got lucky and hit triple res and armor %. It feels amazing to have gear **I crafted for myself**! It fills me with pride. * I have poedb pinned and I probably spend 20% of that time played looking at it. This is an acceptable and fun thing **for me. I love learning how to craft and what I can craft.** * I phys slammed my belt for a guaranteed overwhelm, I yolo'd annulled my ring for a 60% chance of hitting something I didn't like. This is **was so much fun** and more importantly, statistically appropriate. &amp;#x200B; There are definitely some negatives regarding this league compared to others, but we have enough of those posts I wont make mine any longer. Hopefully this reminds the community that **this league has fun potential!**"

Took me a couple of evenings of killing Dishonoured Queen &amp; resetting the damn Mud Flats. Everything except shield comes handy for my bow bleed glad, especially jewel and body armour for pseudo-7 link split arrow shenanigans. The bow is decent in terms of dps, allows to save couple of points by not pathing to Resolute Technique. Boots is actually not that bad either: RoA triggered by bow attacks provides reliable source of curse on hit. I went myself with vulnerability and LGOH.

22,vulnerability,pathofexile,I spent a month farming to fund my dream build. Here's the result.,1,gfmzg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/gfmzg5/i_spent_a_month_farming_to_fund_my_dream_build/,2020-05-08 15:19:02,"Hello, for once I've made a build on my own worth posting. Thanks to the stay at home orders, and my school semester coming to an end, I've had an ungodly amount of time to grind out currency this league to fund my dream build. What build could that be? Is it a max block champion? Nope. Is it a herald stacker? Nope. It's less powerful than those things, but it's 100% more memeier. That's right. I'm the one and only Headhunter Saviour Flicker Strike Trickster. Here's the POB. While it still has a lot of room to be min-maxxed, I still have it at a comfortable spot for where I want it to be. URL So why trickster? Swift Killer and Weave the Arcane, mainly. Not spending Mana means I can go nuts with the reservation. Swift Killer helps out with frenzy charge generation which is crucial. The power charge is just bonus dps. Also, I need a lot of crit for the saviour to proc the minions, and the shadow has stupid amounts of crit nodes. Ghost Dance and Escape Artist add a little survivability. Why am I not using Solstice Vigil and Shackles of the Wretches with self curse temporal chains? I decided to go Zerphi's Heart for Soul Eater and Meginrods Vice (to cover the strength cost), with a corrupted vulnerability on hit. I just roll Temporal Chains on my maps to get the added buff effect. I opted for Zephri's Heart for Soul Eater because I think it's funny that my character can take up the whole screen and teleport. With Flicker Strike you're moving so fast through the map you get a lot out of your maps without self curse temp chains anyways. I was running Kaoms Roots but then I learned that Unwavering meant you can't evade. So I dropped them for elusive tailwind boots with a life roll. The saviour is obvious. It's funny as hell watching 2 clones of me flicker enemies. Farruls Fur was my choice for the chest piece. Nice life, armour, and evade. Gaining the Frenzy Charges on gaining cat's stealth makes frenzy charge management easier. Free Aspect of the Cat aura is also really nice. Pretty much all of my resists come the skill tree, alira, and my rings and helmet. This build is held together by a string. Regarding my flask setup, I have an instant life flask with bleed removal, lions roar, crit cinderswallow, A diamond flask I still need to roll, and atziris promise for chaos res. This build is STARVED for chaos res. I have 6 auras. Pride, Precision, Dread Banner, Aspect of the Cat, Flesh and Stone, and Herald of Purity. This took me forever to figure out. This is only possible because the build doesn't spend mana. Precision is at level 1 because I don't have enough reduced mana reservation to level up. I added an inspired learning because they're cheap this league and it stacks with headhunter. I have Cast When Damage Taken Immortal call as another defensive layer As for my golem, I went with an ice golem for the crit chance and accuracy. Haven't actually pobbed the other golems so maybe there's a better choice there. To proc Soul Eater, I went with Vaal Haste. Zoom Zoom. Finally, I have second wind with dash as an oh shit kiting skill. I didn't go with leap slam + endurance charge on melee stun because I'm flickering through the enemies, dash is really just for big oh shit dodges like getting out of bearer circles or when I open a strongbox and didn't read it first and I see Detonate Dead. So how does it perform? Delve- Flicker Strike in delve is a wild ride. Sometimes you stay on the path, sometimes you go off far into the darkness. It's a bit turbulent. But I'm 300/500 on End Game Grind and I don't think I've died in delve yet so that's a plus. I'm around delve 200-300 which isn't that far though. Maps- where this build excels. Can NOT do reflect maps. Reduced phys maps are also kind of a drag. I roll my maps until they either land Temporal Chains or Nemesis. With delirium, loads of extra rare monsters spawn. You can pretty much just hold down left click and clear half the map if there's enough density. Bosses- I've cleared Hunter and Redeemer so far, haven't procced Warlord or Crusader yet. I already had those two killed from my previous character. I uh, sort of did Sirus. I wasn't used to flickering sirus and so my first attempt at AL1 took ALL my portals and 15 minutes, but, he died. This build has one advantage in the sirus fight- locking on to sirus in the last phase. I never lost him and so I never got off-screened by the DIE lazer. 2 of my deaths were to lag. 2 of my deaths were me not paying attention to ground effects. I can't remember what the fifth death was. I killed regular elder, it took all my portals which was my fault because I forgot you were supposed to stand in the circles not avoid them. It's a bit tricky because there's a lot of adds in the last phase and a lot of degen and you can easily flicker in the wrong spot at the wrong time if you mess up. I can kill elder guardians just fine. As for shaper guardians I've only done Chimera and haven't found the other 3 maps yet with this build. Phoenix and Hydra shouldn't be an issue though, minotaur is gonna be... rough. I haven't tried atziri or uber atziri yet I've cleared a few uber labs. The only issue with lab clearing on this build is the Izaro's reflect minion, if you're not paying attention you can flicker into him and die instantly. UE and shaper I haven't tried yet. I don't know the UE fight and couldn't even do it on my cycloner. I still have to learn the fight. Shaper fight I think it possible but would take for fucking ever because I won't be able to flicker while he's shaper beaming. That's about all I have for this post. This was fun to make and it's fun to play with."

I learned from a hardcore marauder (character DuneMarauderII on my account) that I had no patience for trading, and from a witch (BreachDuneWitch, same) I made following a build guide that the fast pace of party play that comes from following Meta was not for me. I also learned that I had time to comfortably play one character in a league, however, and so, an idea was formed: I would play one character per league, on my own pace, and I would create my own character, and see how far I would get. I chose to create all melee characters, as that was most familiar to me from my hardcore characters, and I built characters to fit the archetypes each class would suggest. I now present those characters here: the idea and inspiration behind the character, the skills they use, and the playing style, and number of challenges completed by them. I will not present the items and skill trees used, but will note the stats I prioritized when looking for items and building the skill tree. I will also note the weapon type I built them around. I didnt trade for items (and for the later characters, built my characters in SSF league after I discovered its existence) and didnt plan out my skill trees too much. The skill trees have been reset, in any case, and I didnt record what they were back then. **Characters:** **[LegacyDuneTemplar: 23/40 Challenges, Inquisitor](URL [Website Profile Here](URL *Where there is uncertainty, I shall bring light.

To keep the idea I also tried to use conductivity, curse on hit and Herald of Thunder, which was great fun but Haste and Hatred felt a lot more comfortable to play, probably due to being faster and the cold damage being safer to my character. Multistrike was required due to the auto-targeting. I heard melee was changed so Multistrike isnt as required but I havent played since the change. How I played it was to rely on the defensive layers including the holy ground to boost the high health regeneration, and basically leap into a pack of monsters, target the biggest one with the static strike hit and hold your ground until theyre all dead. Ancestral Warchief works as a stim for longer fights and boss fights. Cast when damage taken I liked to keep at higher levels because I figure the defensive pop-ups they trigger arent required in easy fights anyways.

I didnt have a chance to optimize her or work out some of the other mechanisms I wanted to run. Im not even sold on having frenzy as her main attack, I just used it because it sounded like itd fit. I wanted to create a frenzied berserker-style character, taking advantage of (and following the flavor of) the frenzy charges that are so easily available to the Ranger from her side of the tree.

In this character you can see part of my building process, where nothing is really planned out  Id just meander and play around with the skills and stuff.

Howard, Conan the Barbarian* The barbarian is a staple of pretty much every fantasy game world around. The mostly naked, heavily muscular savage swinging a 2-handed sword can be found in pretty much every RPG and really doesnt have much variation. Here in Path of Exile, while the Marauder does have other builds and magic around, I decided to go for a classic. Other influences is King Kaom from Path of Exile, the Barbarian from Diablo 2, and the Juggernaut (Bitch!) This is also the first character where I discovered Solo-Self-Found, 2 leagues after its introduction, and all my characters from this one forward will be in softcore SSF.

This is also why I went with an Axe, I know Conan went with a sword but since the Barbarian in D2 and King Kaom both had Axes, eh, why not? Off with his head! I found that with this character, since I didnt need Leap Slam to proc fortify, its better to leap slam out of trouble instead of to the biggest mob. Also, since theres portion of the attack that does the most damage, and the damage is in front of the character, I just started damage from the edge of a group of mobs and cleave my way through. Juggernaut is an aptly-named ascendency because the mentality for this character is pick a direction and dont let anything stop you. I didnt like Abyss league though. The abyss cracks that showed up in-game tended to break the tempo of play, and the Abyssal Depths were really annoying to get through when all I planned on doing for that night was like a map or two. This was also an issue with Zana randomly showing up too. **[BestiaryDuneScionII: 19/40, Ascendant: Elementalist + Juggernaut](URL [Website Profile Here](URL *Noblesse Oblige* The scion is special with her unique starting location in the middle, so I really wanted a character that would take advantage of that, branching her skill tree in two directions from her starting point. She also utilizes all three elements as her damage. I also wanted her to use a sword because DEATH uses a sword to collect nobles and a scythe for peasants. This might not actually be true. I read it somewhere. Regardless, swords are associated with nobles so that was the weapon I chose. I was also inspired by Fiora from League of Legends, another noble-born swordswoman. I really tried to make a rapier work but any sword with high damage worked for me.  Defensive Emphasis: Health, Evasion, Dodge, Cold Damage, 2 Golems  Offensive Emphasis: 2-handed elemental sword, elemental penetration, critical strike and damage.  6L  Wild Strike  Added Cold  Multistrike  Elemental Damage  Added Fire - ///  6L  CWDT  Immortal Call  Summon Stone Golem  Summon Ice Golem / Blind - ///  4L  Vengeance  Herald of Ash  Arctic Armor  Herald of Ice  4L  Leap Slam  Fortify  Ancestral Protector  Faster Attacks  4L  CWDT  Frost Bomb  Assassins Mark  Blood Rage In hindsight, Juggernaut was probably the wrong choice for a second ascendency, but I really wanted some mitigation for the hits that evasion couldnt avoid, but I dont think it did anything. The idea behind it was that if I was hit, thats when Id want the mitigation anyways. (Further evidence of me feeling my way around without any planning) Blind seems like a decent defensive layer but I never found an empty gem slot for it. I really enjoyed having two golems running around it gets kind of lonely out in the wilds of Wraeclast. I really liked Wild Strike. It was really impressive to see and the damage was high as well, being the first character to emphasis critical strikes. How I played her was very similar to the Templar, leap-slamming into the middle of a mob and focusing down the one with the highest HP. However, the defensive emphasis is different for her. The cold damage and the frozen ground meant she could dodge in and out of enemies so it was very much a hit-and-run feel, where you leap slam into a group of enemies, attack, leap out, attack, leap back in. I tried to make flicker strike work first, being very inspired by Fiora, but I just couldnt make it work as comfortably as I wanted. I really liked Bestiary league. It may be because I grew up with Pokmon, but the increased crafting options was really important to me as a non-trading player, and the more deterministic way to craft something beyond relying on RNG to get the mods I want really helped a lot. The slower pace, which I remember being a big issue for many players, did not affect me as much as I already play at a much slower pace than the Meta. **[IncursionDuneDuelist: 22/40, Gladiator](URL [Website Profile Here](URL *Hed a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin, A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin. They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the thigh. And he rode with a jewelled twinkle, His pistol butts a-twinkle, His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.  Alfred Noyes, The Highwayman* Oh if only I could build a pistol and sword-wielding character! The dashing swordsmans a great standard fantasy character but Ive always been partial to the duel-wielding pistol-and-sword variant that seem to pop up as outlaws in fantasy stories. Whats common to both, however, is high charisma, a distain for authority, and being both skilled and flamboyant with their chosen weapons. In this spirit, I wanted to create a rapier-wielding swordsman. What I ended up creating was basically a Roman gladiator. Certainly, he had none of the charisma of the dashing swordsman and the fighting style is much more direct and less flashy.  Defensive Emphasis: Health, Block, Armor  Offensive Emphasis: 1-handed physical sword, attack speed, increased damage while holding a shield  6L  Reave  Melee Physical Damage  Multistrike  Maim  Ruthless - ///  4L  CWDT  Vulnerability  Tempest Shield  Blood Rage  4L  Riposte  Stun  Reckoning  Endurance Charge on Melee Stun  4L  CWDT  Immortal Call  Flame Golem  Increased Duration  3L  Herald of Ash  Hatred  Ancestral Protector  3L  Leap Slam  Faster Attacks  Fortify Reave was not what I wanted when I started building this character. I started off trying flicker strike, but like the previous Scion, I just couldnt get it to work properly. Thus, Reave. There was a change in gems which I noticed this league that allowed me to run both Reave and Vaal Reave with the same gem, which was great. Starting from the edge of a pack, Reave to the center. Then use Vaal Reave as a stim to get out of a large pack, or put down Ancestral Protector as a stim for harder single mobs. Im actually really surprised I got so far with a character during that time, summer 2018 was a crucial quarter for me and Im surprised I managed to find time to play Path of Exile. Incursion league had the same problem for me as Abyss league, that of the extra instance that takes me out of the tempo and momentum that Id developed by doing the map. I enjoyed the completed ruins that you can then choose to do. I liked being able to choose when to do the completed pyramid, but the individual rooms popping up randomly wasnt for me. **[DelveDuneWitch: 22/40, Necromancer](URL [Website Profile Here](URL *Awake O Dead, for there can be no rest for ye beneath the earth. Let the splintered bones burrow from the grave pall. Let cold fingers grip time-worn blades, and unseeing eyes survey the fields of slaughter. For your time has come once more. And the dead shall walk.  Warhammer, Spell of Doom* The witch was hard to make a melee character for, but I was inspired by the Death knights of Warcraft lore. I wanted to take advantage of the witchs Necromancer flavor, and she ended up pretty drastically different from any of the other melee characters. Thematically, shes still a melee character using blade flurry, because shes using a melee weapon, but she really is much more dependent on her zombies than wading into battle like the other characters. Totally felt like a Necromancer General though.  Defensive Emphasis: Health, Zombie Defensive Line, not really melee  Offensive Emphasis: 1-handed Melee Damage, Zombie Offensive Line  6L  Blade Flurry  Infused Channeling  Concentrated Effect  Maim  Melee Physical - ///  4L  CWDT  Bone Offering  Desecrate - Convocation  4L  CWDT  Immortal Call  Vulnerability  Enfeeble  4L  Chaos Golem  Raise Zombies  Blind  Minion Life Support  3L  Arctic Armor  Herald of Purity  Hatred  3L  Leap Slam  Faster Attacks  Ancestral Warchief I loved playing this character. The animation of blade flurry is your character pointing their sword at the enemy. With the zombie AI following your attacks, it was basically your character pointing at the enemy and commanding your army of zombies to go attack. It was also really nice not being outnumbered all the dang time. I expected this character to have trouble with bosses, anticipating the zombies and summons to die quickly to bosses and it becoming a one-vs-one situation, but this didnt happen too often. In fact I think this is the character that handled bosses the best, with the zombies soaking up much more damage than I expected before dying, leaving my character free to do damage. What was also important though was to use the zombies as a meat shield. Mentally, I thought of them like the offensive line, and my character being the quarterback. It was important to keep them between the high-damage dealers and my squishy character  this was hard to do in delve, as you needed to keep moving forward. Delve was an interesting league. I talked a bit about some of the older league mechanics requiring you to go into a new instance in the middle of a map or something, breaking your momentum. Delve didnt break momentum, as you chose to start and stop it. I loved it. I also loved being able to go either sideways or downwards and choose to go towards something. This sort of deterministic, less RNG-based grinding was incredibly helpful as an SSF player. This character also shows how little attention I pay to patch notes and stuff: A more thematic, and probably even stronger skill would be Dominating Blow. And, in fact, this was the league changed Dominating Blow to make it incredibly popular! (Relatively speaking) However, I had tried dominating blow in earlier leagues, didnt like it, and didnt realize it had been changed. Missed opportunities! **[BetryalDuneShadowII: 7/40, Assassin]( URL [Website Profile Here](URL *Back in the old days, when he was on nights all the time, hed known all the shades of darkness. And sometimes you got darkness so thick that you almost felt you had to push your way through it. Those were nights when horses were skittish, and dogs whined, and down in the slaughterhouse district the animals broke out of their pens...Light only ruined your vision, [then]. It blinded you. You stared into the dark until it blinked. You stared it down.  Terry Pratchett, Thud!* For the final character for this set I wanted to continue what I had started with the witch, creating unorthodox melee characters. The concept for the shadow, following his theme, would be some sort of ninja assassin. I was also influenced by my old assassin character from Diablo 2, so I had this character use dual claws. Ultimately, I wanted to aim for some sort of ninja-Wolverine, striking from stealth with extreme brutality and then disappear again. I didnt get a chance to finish this character, and while he was fun to play, he never really got the feel of either a ninja or Wolverine. What he did feel like was animesque, the You are already dead sort of character.

In the boss fights, the time it took to max out the stacks, and then move to a new spot, was short enough that I wasnt taking too much damage. However, the defensive layers for this character were still appreciated, especially with the use of cold to slow down enemies so theyd last longer along the charged dash route. Charged Dash is the reason this character felt like he was in an anime, as he would be able to relocate quickly, do a lot of damage and be behind the mobs that were trying to reach him in the first place! Thematically, Holy Relic and Herald of Purity didnt really fit this character, but the extra life regeneration and damage, along with the distraction they provided was really useful. Over the rest of the league, had I had time, I wouldve tried to replace them with something more thematically appropriate, but until then I kept them. Betrayal League was a bit of a mess to me. I still dont get how its supposed to work. It was fun though, I always enjoyed the fights against the rogue exiles and the Betrayal fights seemed to be more interesting versions of them. However, with the interrogate or kill mechanic, I just randomly chose one every time. No idea whats happening. **Conclusion** I had a lot of fun playing my seven characters. While they werent Meta at the time, and certainly not optimized, I still got pretty far along where I wanted to be in terms of the challenges, with 5 of the 7 reaching high enough to get a Challenge Trophy and doing maps well into the Reds. Some developmental issues that prevented me from advancing further include just not having enough time to play. This comes in the form of not being able to grind to get better items, which as the Leagues went on would be mitigated somewhat by the League mechanics. It also came in the form of doing the masters daily quests. For a playtime of about 30 minutes a day, most of that time I would do the (old) masters quests, and thus not grinding optimally for either items or XP, as I would quickly out level their instance. (For posterity, the old masters created their own instance of a level that was correlated with their level. They would give you a short quest in this instance which, when completed, gave you extra masters XP.) Choosing to ignore the masters starting with my Witch was a great decision. The League mechanics that I enjoyed the most were the ones that didnt create an instance in the middle of play. In a sense all the League mechanics were optional in that you can choose to ignore the NPC, but their rewards made them hard to not do in the SSF realm. Abyss league was the league that perhaps had the easiest to compare: I liked seeing the abyssal cracks and the box that showed up at the end, but having to go into the Abyssal Depths became incredibly annoying later in-game, even though I realize there was better drops there. The choice to start a League Instance like in Delve was fantastic. Focusing on melee allowed me to pick up each character faster and generally direct how they would develop over the league easier than if I had to focus on something else, although I do admit the most fun and the most excited I got was seeing my Necromancer-Witch become viable over the course of the League. She was the most unorthodox character I made and strayed from the rest of the melee characters template. For the next few leagues, I think Im going to complete the Ranger and Shadow Builds, using some of the newer mechanics and gems and skills. After that, depending on when Path of Exile 2 comes out, Ill remake the earlier characters with better skills possibly. Things off the top of my head, the Templar build could really use the Herald of Purity and Smite. Someday Ill finally figure out how the new masters work. Push deeper into the endgame as well. Certainly a lot of playing left to do! Thanks for reading."

This was also an issue with Zana randomly showing up too. **[BestiaryDuneScionII: 19/40, Ascendant: Elementalist + Juggernaut](URL *Noblesse Oblige* The scion is special with her unique starting location in the middle, so I really wanted a character that would take advantage of that, branching her skill tree in two directions from her starting point. She also utilizes all three elements as her damage. I also wanted her to use a sword because DEATH uses a sword to collect nobles and a scythe for peasants. This might not actually be true. I read it somewhere. Regardless, swords are associated with nobles so that was the weapon I chose. I was also inspired by Fiora from League of Legends, another noble-born swordswoman. I really tried to make a rapier work but any sword with high damage worked for me.  Defensive Emphasis: Health, Evasion, Dodge, Cold Damage, 2 Golems  Offensive Emphasis: 2-handed elemental sword, elemental penetration, critical strike and damage.  6L  Wild Strike  Added Cold  Multistrike  Elemental Damage  Added Fire - ///  6L  CWDT  Immortal Call  Summon Stone Golem  Summon Ice Golem / Blind - ///  4L  Vengeance  Herald of Ash  Arctic Armor  Herald of Ice  4L  Leap Slam  Fortify  Ancestral Protector  Faster Attacks  4L  CWDT  Frost Bomb  Assassins Mark  Blood Rage In hindsight, Juggernaut was probably the wrong choice for a second ascendency, but I really wanted some mitigation for the hits that evasion couldnt avoid, but I dont think it did anything. The idea behind it was that if I was hit, thats when Id want the mitigation anyways. (Further evidence of me feeling my way around without any planning) Blind seems like a decent defensive layer but I never found an empty gem slot for it. I really enjoyed having two golems running around it gets kind of lonely out in the wilds of Wraeclast. I really liked Wild Strike. It was really impressive to see and the damage was high as well, being the first character to emphasis critical strikes. How I played her was very similar to the Templar, leap-slamming into the middle of a mob and focusing down the one with the highest HP. However, the defensive emphasis is different for her. The cold damage and the frozen ground meant she could dodge in and out of enemies so it was very much a hit-and-run feel, where you leap slam into a group of enemies, attack, leap out, attack, leap back in. I tried to make flicker strike work first, being very inspired by Fiora, but I just couldnt make it work as comfortably as I wanted. I really liked Bestiary league. It may be because I grew up with Pokmon, but the increased crafting options was really important to me as a non-trading player, and the more deterministic way to craft something beyond relying on RNG to get the mods I want really helped a lot. The slower pace, which I remember being a big issue for many players, did not affect me as much as I already play at a much slower pace than the Meta. **[IncursionDuneDuelist: 22/40, Gladiator](URL *Hed a French cocked-hat on his forehead, a bunch of lace at his chin, A coat of the claret velvet, and breeches of brown doe-skin. They fitted with never a wrinkle. His boots were up to the thigh. And he rode with a jewelled twinkle, His pistol butts a-twinkle, His rapier hilt a-twinkle, under the jewelled sky.  Alfred Noyes, The Highwayman* Oh if only I could build a pistol and sword-wielding character! The dashing swordsmans a great standard fantasy character but Ive always been partial to the duel-wielding pistol-and-sword variant that seem to pop up as outlaws in fantasy stories. Whats common to both, however, is high charisma, a distain for authority, and being both skilled and flamboyant with their chosen weapons. In this spirit, I wanted to create a rapier-wielding swordsman. What I ended up creating was basically a Roman gladiator. Certainly, he had none of the charisma of the dashing swordsman and the fighting style is much more direct and less flashy.  Defensive Emphasis: Health, Block, Armor  Offensive Emphasis: 1-handed physical sword, attack speed, increased damage while holding a shield  6L  Reave  Melee Physical Damage  Multistrike  Maim  Ruthless - ///  4L  CWDT  Vulnerability  Tempest Shield  Blood Rage  4L  Riposte  Stun  Reckoning  Endurance Charge on Melee Stun  4L  CWDT  Immortal Call  Flame Golem  Increased Duration  3L  Herald of Ash  Hatred  Ancestral Protector  3L  Leap Slam  Faster Attacks  Fortify Reave was not what I wanted when I started building this character. I started off trying flicker strike, but like the previous Scion, I just couldnt get it to work properly. Thus, Reave. There was a change in gems which I noticed this league that allowed me to run both Reave and Vaal Reave with the same gem, which was great. Starting from the edge of a pack, Reave to the center. Then use Vaal Reave as a stim to get out of a large pack, or put down Ancestral Protector as a stim for harder single mobs. Im actually really surprised I got so far with a character during that time, summer 2018 was a crucial quarter for me and Im surprised I managed to find time to play Path of Exile. Incursion league had the same problem for me as Abyss league, that of the extra instance that takes me out of the tempo and momentum that Id developed by doing the map. I enjoyed the completed ruins that you can then choose to do. I liked being able to choose when to do the completed pyramid, but the individual rooms popping up randomly wasnt for me. **[DelveDuneWitch: 22/40, Necromancer](URL *Awake O Dead, for there can be no rest for ye beneath the earth. Let the splintered bones burrow from the grave pall. Let cold fingers grip time-worn blades, and unseeing eyes survey the fields of slaughter. For your time has come once more. And the dead shall walk.  Warhammer, Spell of Doom* The witch was hard to make a melee character for, but I was inspired by the Death knights of Warcraft lore. I wanted to take advantage of the witchs Necromancer flavor, and she ended up pretty drastically different from any of the other melee characters. Thematically, shes still a melee character using blade flurry, because shes using a melee weapon, but she really is much more dependent on her zombies than wading into battle like the other characters. Totally felt like a Necromancer General though.

The animation of blade flurry is your character pointing their sword at the enemy. With the zombie AI following your attacks, it was basically your character pointing at the enemy and commanding your army of zombies to go attack. It was also really nice not being outnumbered all the dang time. I expected this character to have trouble with bosses, anticipating the zombies and summons to die quickly to bosses and it becoming a one-vs-one situation, but this didnt happen too often. In fact I think this is the character that handled bosses the best, with the zombies soaking up much more damage than I expected before dying, leaving my character free to do damage. What was also important though was to use the zombies as a meat shield. Mentally, I thought of them like the offensive line, and my character being the quarterback. It was important to keep them between the high-damage dealers and my squishy character  this was hard to do in delve, as you needed to keep moving forward. Delve was an interesting league. I talked a bit about some of the older league mechanics requiring you to go into a new instance in the middle of a map or something, breaking your momentum. Delve didnt break momentum, as you chose to start and stop it. I loved it. I also loved being able to go either sideways or downwards and choose to go towards something. This sort of deterministic, less RNG-based grinding was incredibly helpful as an SSF player. This character also shows how little attention I pay to patch notes and stuff: A more thematic, and probably even stronger skill would be Dominating Blow. And, in fact, this was the league changed Dominating Blow to make it incredibly popular! (Relatively speaking) However, I had tried dominating blow in earlier leagues, didnt like it, and didnt realize it had been changed. Missed opportunities! **[BetryalDuneShadowII: 7/40, Assassin]( URL *Back in the old days, when he was on nights all the time, hed known all the shades of darkness. And sometimes you got darkness so thick that you almost felt you had to push your way through it. Those were nights when horses were skittish, and dogs whined, and down in the slaughterhouse district the animals broke out of their pens...Light only ruined your vision, [then]. It blinded you. You stared into the dark until it blinked. You stared it down.  Terry Pratchett, Thud!* For the final character for this set I wanted to continue what I had started with the witch, creating unorthodox melee characters. The concept for the shadow, following his theme, would be some sort of ninja assassin. I was also influenced by my old assassin character from Diablo 2, so I had this character use dual claws. Ultimately, I wanted to aim for some sort of ninja-Wolverine, striking from stealth with extreme brutality and then disappear again. I didnt get a chance to finish this character, and while he was fun to play, he never really got the feel of either a ninja or Wolverine. What he did feel like was animesque, the You are already dead sort of character.  Defensive Emphasis: Health, Evasion, Movement, Life Leech, Frost Wall, Vortex  Offensive Emphasis: 1-handed Melee Damage, Critical Strike, Claw Damage,  6L  Charged Dash  Infused Channeling  Increased Critical Strike  Fortify  Melee Physical  Added Fire Damage  4L  CWDT  Ice Golem  Blind  Holy Relic  4L  CWDT  Blood Rage  Warlords Mark  Phase Run  4L  Ancestral Protector  Arctic Armor  Herald of Purity  Herald of Ash  3L  CWDT  Frost Wall  Vortex  3L  Dread Banner - /// - /// Charged Dash was a lot easier to control, and standing still to charge it was a lot safer than I expected. In the boss fights, the time it took to max out the stacks, and then move to a new spot, was short enough that I wasnt taking too much damage. However, the defensive layers for this character were still appreciated, especially with the use of cold to slow down enemies so theyd last longer along the charged dash route. Charged Dash is the reason this character felt like he was in an anime, as he would be able to relocate quickly, do a lot of damage and be behind the mobs that were trying to reach him in the first place! Thematically, Holy Relic and Herald of Purity didnt really fit this character, but the extra life regeneration and damage, along with the distraction they provided was really useful. Over the rest of the league, had I had time, I wouldve tried to replace them with something more thematically appropriate, but until then I kept them. Betrayal League was a bit of a mess to me. I still dont get how its supposed to work. It was fun though, I always enjoyed the fights against the rogue exiles and the Betrayal fights seemed to be more interesting versions of them. However, with the interrogate or kill mechanic, I just randomly chose one every time. No idea whats happening. **Conclusion** I had a lot of fun playing my seven characters. While they werent Meta at the time, and certainly not optimized, I still got pretty far along where I wanted to be in terms of the challenges, with 5 of the 7 reaching high enough to get a Challenge Trophy and doing maps well into the Reds. Some developmental issues that prevented me from advancing further include just not having enough time to play. This comes in the form of not being able to grind to get better items, which as the Leagues went on would be mitigated somewhat by the League mechanics. It also came in the form of doing the masters daily quests. For a playtime of about 30 minutes a day, most of that time I would do the (old) masters quests, and thus not grinding optimally for either items or XP, as I would quickly out level their instance. (For posterity, the old masters created their own instance of a level that was correlated with their level. They would give you a short quest in this instance which, when completed, gave you extra masters XP.) Choosing to ignore the masters starting with my Witch was a great decision. The League mechanics that I enjoyed the most were the ones that didnt create an instance in the middle of play. In a sense all the League mechanics were optional in that you can choose to ignore the NPC, but their rewards made them hard to not do in the SSF realm. Abyss league was the league that perhaps had the easiest to compare: I liked seeing the abyssal cracks and the box that showed up at the end, but having to go into the Abyssal Depths became incredibly annoying later in-game, even though I realize there was better drops there. The choice to start a League Instance like in Delve was fantastic. Focusing on melee allowed me to pick up each character faster and generally direct how they would develop over the league easier than if I had to focus on something else, although I do admit the most fun and the most excited I got was seeing my Necromancer-Witch become viable over the course of the League. She was the most unorthodox character I made and strayed from the rest of the melee characters template. For the next few leagues, I think Im going to complete the Ranger and Shadow Builds, using some of the newer mechanics and gems and skills. After that, depending on when Path of Exile 2 comes out, Ill remake the earlier characters with better skills possibly. Things off the top of my head, the Templar build could really use the Herald of Purity and Smite. Someday Ill finally figure out how the new masters work. Push deeper into the endgame as well. Certainly a lot of playing left to do! Thanks for reading."

She has some amount of innate reflect that's enough to one-shot me normally, so I went and got an elder body armour with ""You and your Minions take 100% reduced Reflected Physical Damage"". This works fine normally and I get 0 dmg back even from the reflect clone. If I curse her with vulnerability though - which gets reflected back to me - I die almost instantly both to the reflect clone and Atziri proper. So this is half PSA and half the question: does anyone know why that'd happen? The only two possibilities that kind of make sense are: 1. either the increased phys dmg taken on vuln is somehow additive to the reflect reduction and makes me take 30% of the reflected dmg or something (which doesn't make sense) or 2. I'm procing bleed on myself through vuln and that kills me (but isn't bleed damage based on the final phys dmg taken which should be 0?) Edit: The plot thickens. I was sold on bleed being the culprit here since someone correctly mentioned that bleed dmg is based on the base dmg, not the result after reductions. But I tried with a staunching flask and I still get damaged. So it must be both. The vuln's increased damage taken is additive to the reduced reflected damage taken from the armour so I still take 30% of the reflected damage. So yea the armour mod sucks but it will work fine for this specific case as long I ward off the vulnerability."

AKA The drunkin monkey My buddy got me playing poe the day before meta started. Im hooked but totally lost in the sauce. I played a dualist champion and plan on doing it again for delirium, now that I understand 1% of the game. I already know my characters name is going to be simple jack, and youll soon see why. I didnt mess around with any build guides or anything, but did gorge myself on the wiki as I went. I have no idea if what Im doing actually makes sense and if its a dead end or what. So at the moment Im level 86 and run mostly lower level 70 rares. I have 2.4k health. 30es an accident so really 0 for all intents and purposes. My map gridding is at rare t5-t10. I cant get maps to drop higher than 5 hardly ever and have to buy higher. so I dont know if my build is gonna make it. The only issue I have is my health pool is just too low for some of the one shots due to map mods. I assume itll be fine when I put 5 passives towards life and roll some life on gear. I only have like 100 base life across all my gear. Im confident I can resolve the health issue but I have no idea as far as like awakener. Survivability seems manageable, but in the other direction I dont feel like my damage is anywhere near where it should be. And to top it off, I havent really dealt with boss mechanics? Ive fought the syndicate boss and got plugged in the last stage because I wasted portals figuring out not to stand in the corners when they have the green stuff. Ive killed a couple conquerors and got some watchstones. Havent messed with eternal labyrinth. Delve I havent explored anything significant. I havent done Uber elder level stuff. Killed a couple meta bosses but all under level 80. Im just chaos slamming my way into higher level areas and base everything off as long as I survive the vast majority of what would be one shots, smash the ever living crap out of my key board. I die from the boss at least twice above t10 but below that its once every 5 maps or so. - all ele res at 100% for mod control - 0% chaos res - 55% non juiced armor - 0 es - 2.4k health - 10% evade - 50% block - 12% dodge - ** VAAL Pact - 62% /sec cap - +320%?

The flasks are mostly geared towards damage mitigation. I have an overflowing chalice for getting charges back quickly and another one which basically just refreshes all my frenzy/endurance/power charges for sustain. I just spam them as I go except for the charge refresher. Skills 1) no supports - Leap Slam - Molten Shell - Ripatose? - vengeance - vulnerability 2) fight cycle - Vigilant strike to get that sweet fortify buff. Has multi strike to ensure hit proc with reduced stun and end charge on stun. Main is for fortify but also build end charges at cycle pace. Also % chance endurance from blocks to help from passives - Feenzy spam to build frenzy charges. Supported with faster attacks, brutality, melee support - Blade Storm spam. Supported with random stuff usually just used for map clearing and getting the speed boost for single target. I dont know what Im really doing with this yet but its there. ** basically a vigilant strike here and there while spamming frenzy and blade storm. Constantly proc flasks and maintain charges if needed with flask. (It adds one of each if not at cap, refreshes if at cap). While doing this the attacks are really just meant to ensure survival while Im building charges and setting bleeds, blinds, etc. they have solid damage themselves but are not geared specially to inflict high damage. 3) kamehameha Once Im built up I have a buffer zone. Basically 10 seconds where Im at 3 frenzy 3 endurance, fortified, enemy bleeding and blind. At this point I channel blade flurry. Hungry ring supports with impale support, bloodlust, infused channeling, and melee phys. I realize Im losing the melee phys ailment support using bloodlust but its intentionally meant to stack the phys damage for impale. And I freaking love it. Im gonna run it again for delirium and really focus on exploiting it. Increase my charge caps. Suss out some better gem and status combos and order. Id like to get some % phys damage take as mods to really eat those big shot phys hits. Maybe drop brutality and mess around with adding a smidge of poison. I picked up a unique ring that has 20% phys gained as extra chaos and figure I can poison with gusto while investing nothing from passives. Plague bearer to be obnoxious? Even just being able to actually spend resources on rolling level 84s into the mods would help the build. But in the end I still have no idea if itll be able to scale into things like awakener."

So can someone help me figure out when I'm being efficient, and when I'm being stupid? For my SST bleed glad, I used thread of hope on the marauder side of the tree. I grabbed cleaving, slaughter, and razor's edge for 55% bleed damage, 15% faster bleeds, 10% chance to gain onslaught on kill, and 10% dot multi for bleed. If I had instead pathed to cleaving, I would have spent 5 points instead of 3, and yielded - 59% bleed damage 20% bleed duration. But, I also would have added a regular jewel. My best jewel for bleed is 12% dot, 16% bleed, and 6% life. So that's 55% bleed, 15% faster bleeds, 10% chance to gain onslaught, 10% dot multi for my SST Build - 20.8% total bleed damage increase VS 79% bleed damage 20% bleed duration, 12% dot, 16% bleed, 6% life, and 1 extra passive point used but I still get the 15% faster bleeds. I think for my SST build, it's an absolute no brainer because 10% dot multi is probably better, but it actually sounds kinda close. When I just 1 for 1 swap the thread for my best bleed jewel, and I remove 1 5% life node, I end up with more damage with my good jewel, and more resists. 140602.1 bleed dps with 6588 life vs 137937.7 bleed dps with 6566 life - Granted, I still would need an onslaught source (because that's how I get it right now) and I get a little chance to bleed, so I need to get that somewhere else too. Theoretically, I lose flexibility in my abyss jewel for my stygian vise because I need an onslaught jewel, but I -gain- flexibility in balancing my resists in my gear. So it's probably even if you count in a crappy onslaught jewel. But that relies on me having a bleed jewel that is worth at least 100c. So switch to my starter for next league, and I decide to use another thread of hope while I'm leveling to grab the big bow nodes in the bow wheel - king of the hill, and master fletcher. I also grab aspect of the eagle for 3 points total. So my numbers are 1,432,891.3 bleed dps and 6187 life with my thread setup VS 1,464,329.9 bleed dps and 6095 life with the nice jewel that I have. Again, I get more flexibility with resist gear without the thread, but I have a bit more dps and life with the thread. I think that's more of an even trade, but I also don't have the QoL stuff from the onslaught jewel thing, so even though my numbers are higher with the thread in my bow bleed, I still have to get an onslaught jewel, so it doesn't offer my an ability to get higher dps number, but it does actually cost me because I need more resists on gear, and that could be a single bleed ailment mod that I'm using for an all resist instead. This leads me to believe that: If I were crafting all my own gear - it's better to have lots of resists, and then craft a yolo bleed ring - vulnerability + delve ailment, and then just hope for some nice life roll. It's also better to craft bleed jewels. I can go jagged + corroded + pristine and hope for a bleed ring with ailment damage, and hopefully I can make a warlord ring with vulnerability on hit. I can do the same with crimson jewels and hope for an even better jewel with a global physical damage prefix. The leads me to the conclusion that I should also look for more than just damage nodes when I use a thread of hope. For example - taking phase acro and avoiding acro on a CI or hybrid build along with grabbing silent steps while I'm there. Another example - taking righteous army, singular focus, arcane capacitor, divine wrath, divine judgement, and sanctum of thought on my golemancer because along with the conversion, I get reduced crit damage, damage reduction, and my golems can regen more. I can't possibly substitute those on a jewel. However, I should not grab divine fury because it's just damage - 5% phys as extra fire (which I'm not scaling on that build), 12% ele damage, 12% phys damage unless I had absolutely no other thing to put a point into and I needed the 24% extra damage, or I wanted to use a cinderswallow and it's literally THE only added fire damage I have to proc the ignite stuff. So my question is - Am I thinking clearly about this stuff? If the nodes travelling to the node I want are good, then I'm probably better off getting those nodes and using a jewel. If the nodes are worthless, or detrimental - acrobatics on an ES build, silent steps on a caster build - then I'm better off using a thread of hope. If it's somewhere in between - inquisitor side by the physical conversion area - I'm saving about 10 points and spending 6, then make sure I'm getting more than just damage, and not just getting a jewel with more steps and less resists. If I'm just getting damage, then replace the thread of hope as soon as I get a good enough jewel. Thanks for any advice."
43,vulnerability,pathofexile,Bad idea: Vulnerability Phases,1,fgyb0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/fgyb0b/bad_idea_vulnerability_phases/,2020-03-12 01:50:02,"GGG seems to want bosses to last a long while against endgame builds. So far their methods have been blanket buffs to the bosses, complete invulnerability phases, and Challenges. The problem with this method is that it hits weak, casual, or low-budget builds exponentially harder than ""streamer builds."" I think there can be a middle ground. The core issue is that bosses always have the same defensive values (or are invulnerable), and as such they are as vulnerable to a one-shot at the beginning of the fight as any other time. They're trying to make the bosses last at least 8 seconds, but adding an arbitrary, invisible damage resistance is probably not the best idea, especially considering the conceptual purpose of trap and mine builds (even if traps and mines are rarely used that way now). Many bosses have attacks or phases where they are not actively defending themselves against the player. Examples are Atziri's Storm Call and Flameblast, where she isn't even looking at the player. If their defenses were temporarily reduced OR player damage was buffed during these phases, or an arbitrary phase was added after the boss had been active for a certain amount of time, then they could probably bypass the issue of bosses getting one-shot without affecting casual builds too much, as a casual player could simply wait until the vulnerability phase came out and unloaded. I'll admit this would cause problems, too. This system doesn't reward sustained DPS, and punishes delayed damage even more than normal (RIP storm call, earthquake, and flameblast). It could also cause a problem with Action Speed and buff duration modifiers. CWDT and triggered attack skills are also not favored. If overtuned it could result in bosses becoming anticlimactic, laying down to die after tossing some Frostbolts at you. But it *might* be better than phase-start damage reduction."

Pretty much an RNG challenge from doing corruption, but doing 12 out of 15 is actually sounds pretty fine just skip the temple atzoatl crafting option(2) then the rest of the others option should be pretty cheap and easy to get. #33. Complete Encounters VI * **Defeat a Possessed Rogue Exile** Can be done easily by activating ""Anarchy's End IV"" prophecy. * **Exchange 5,000 Perandus Coins with Cadiro Perandus** This challenge exist before during sysnthesis league but in a bad situation because of how hard we can access the perandus mechanic during that time .... now with nemesis available from Zana's map device, this challenge should be achievable even with this big amount, just be careful with scammers when buy this services/coins. * **Defeat a Bestiary Boss** To do this challenge just buy any cheap unique beast(Saqawine Rhex, Craicic Spider Crab, Fenumal Hybrid Arachnid, or Farric Tiger Alpha) then spawn in ur blood altar, complete the fight then you'll complete this challenge, or hunt them yourself. here's the details: * [**Saqawal, First of the Sky**](URL - It's recipe require **Saqawine Rhex** that only appears in **Tier 5+** maps. This DINOSAUR boss not that dangerous but try don't stand in the tornadoes, they hurt more than anything else in the encounter * [**Craiceann, First of the Deep**](URL - It's recipe require **Craicic Spider Crab** that only appears in **Tier 7+** maps. This CRAB boss same like bird boss are just loot pinatas tbh, haven't seen them alive long enough to do anything. * [**Fenumus, First of the Night**](URL - It's recipe require **Fenumal Hybrid Arachnid** that only appears in **Tier 10+** maps. This SPIDER boss deal a lot of chaos damage, so bring chaos resist flask, and dont stand in the stuff on the ground. * [**Farrul, First of the Plains**](URL - It's recipe require **Farric Tiger Alpha** that only appears in **Tier 13+** maps. This TIGER boss deal a lot of phys damage, so bring phys reduction flask, bleed immunity flask and dodge the stampede. * **Defeat Atziri in the Temple of Atzoatl** Kinda hard to spawn her in the temple, but should be fine now because this challenge is share-able now, which means you can join other player's temple that have her spawning in their temple to get the kills challenge. Unlike in the old days(incursion league) this type of challenge can't be shared ... have to done this challenge by your own temple which is really hard and RNG-gated. Normal. These challenge are pretty achievable ... just require a bit RNG to get find them. #34. Defeat Map Bosses(40/40) Hard. This seems another big improvement from previous league map grind challenge(1,500 map bosses), tone down to 500 map bosses with a condition, have to kill them under the delirium effect. You can farm map that have multiple bosses such as Arena Map, or Courthouse Map and so on ... the best one will be Precinct map because of it contain 4~5 bosses as long they're in delirium effect, could try make use of DEADLY TWINS prophecy. Also try make use of Delirium Orb on map to have a permanent delirium effect until the boss room, so that you won't have to backtrack finding delirium-mirror encounter at start of the map then run till the end to the boss room ... Hopefully GGG will fix this soon, will update again if they make any QOL changes on this. #35. Complete Unique Maps Normal. Do 15 out of 19, with the help of [The Encroaching Darkness](URL divination card, this challenge will be slightly easier to complete as you keep grinding end game maps collecting this cards. Even your RNG is sux collecting these card, you could buy some of the unique map [**at here**](URL most of the unique map are quite cheap. The least 4 favorite unique map I would skip is ... **Hall Of Grandmaster**(hard), **Perandus Manor**(very expensive), **The Putrid Cloister**(expensive), and **Doryani's Machinarium**(expensive) depending whose the 4th expensive map is =D #36. Complete the Epilogue Questline [Check out Grimro video on how to obtain watchstones](URL There's 3 phases on how to upgrade full your atlas: * **First 4 watchstones** is from doing the maps at the [corner region of your atlas](URL When you do your first map in those region, the conqueror will spawn in say something to you then portal back out, then your map will fill with the conqueror adds, and also in atlas UI that region will be colored depending of the conqueror. After u do 2 more map(must be different), then Kirac NPC will have a quest for you asking you to talk with Zana open the map for you that can fight with the conqueror itself. Repeat this process in 4 other corner region to get the first 4 watchstones. * **Next 16 watchstones** is from doing a region of map with their condition fulfilled. Previous 4 doesn't need condition that's why the conqueror can spawn. To know what's their conditon to spawn them, you can mouse over your [watchstone invetory](URL slots then it will show what it need and also highlight the region that the slots represent. With enough watchstone socketed in your [citadel](URL the conqueror will spawn in if you run their appropriate map tier in that region 3 times(can't run other tier even is the same map). And after you got your 12 watchstone, Zana will invite you to kill **Sirus, Awakener of Worlds** boss. * **Last 12 watchstones** is pretty much the same with previous phase except this time conqueror will have CHANCE to spawn in after complete a map with their influence in a region, instead of previous phase gurantee spawn after 3 maps. Also now u can now farm conqueror by spawning them again to farm their influenced item but not their wathcstone(if obtained already). Side note, to get a **citadel** in a region you have to find them just by clearing any map till the boss open a portal which brings you to a [small room](URL with zana and an altar at the middle of the room, click the altar then you'll unlock citadel in your region. Normal, this quest is all about killing **Sirus, Awakener of Worlds** which is when you collected 16 watchstones from conquerors of the atlas. Just invite experience player to help you kill Sirus if you're build aren't capable to do it after spawning the boss. #37. Complete Simulacrum II * **Complete a wave of monsters which spawns two bosses in the Simulacrum** 2 delirium bosses spawn is in the last wave(20th) and the fight is very hectic .... might require a GOOD build to do this. * **Obtain a Rampage Streak of 300 in the Simulacrum** Can be done by equipping a rampage gear such as Bisco's Leash or Sinvicta's Mettle, let the rampage effect start then switch back to your main equipment quickly then continuing killing the mob and start the next phase instantly to keep the rampage number going till 300. * **Complete 100 waves of monsters in the Simulacrum** That's 5 runs on the Simulacrum map if you're build can do the full run(20 waves), for a descent build ... should do around 10 runs on this map that's roughly 10 waves per map, nonetheless 100 is a achievable number for a normal player. Normal. Require a bit of grind on the league-exclusive-unique-map and also a GOOD build to do for the double delirium boss challenge ... Might need to invite a pro player to help you deal with that, the other 2 challenges is achievable with a descent build. #38. Complete Deadly Encounters(40/40) * [**Uber Elder**](URL You can access this boss domain by combining 2 shaper fragment(Shape &amp; Knowledge) and 2 elder fragment(Emptiness &amp; Terror), required a good-bossing-build to do this fight. * [**High Templar Venarius in The Cortex**](URL You can access this boss domain by putting [Cortex Relic Chambers Map](URL in ur map device, is pretty hard fight especially with mult-phases boss, invite experience player if you can't do this after you obtain the map. * [**Domain of Timeless Conflict**](URL When collect a total of 100 timeless splinter will become a Timeless Emblem map fragment, which can be use to unlock the 5th slot of map device, if running 4 type of emblem at once. For this challenge it can be need do putting any one piece of the timeless emblem on your map device, pretty easy. * [**Mastermind at an area level of 83**](URL This is the last boss of syndicate hierarchy, you can access the mastermind safehouse after fill the information bar to full from killing captains of each safehouse divisions. It's full fight is all about running around the arena avoid the middle laser beam and the burning arena from 4 edges. Getting a level 84 mastermind shouldn't be a problem as long you keep negotiating syndicate in high tier map, it will also replace ur old progression if u done some negotiation in the past low tier maps. Hard. Finding these bosses is not a problem in this challenges, the BIG problem is to defeat them .... might require a good build to do these challenges OR invite an experience player to help with after you found these bosses. #39. Leave to Chance(40/40) Hard. Because of this challenge, **orb of chance** price is gonna be fluctuate for this league ... This challenge is very RNG-gated, the hardest part will be chancing any unique weapon, strongbox, map or jewel. If you manage to chance any of these 2 type into a unique rarity, then only you can proceed your journey to get the 40/40 golden trophy. Also if you're rich, you can buy the [Trash to Treasure](URL prophecy to skip this challenge easily. #40. Complete Endgame Grinds(40/40) * **Level 100** This is gonna be hardest of the rest challenges. If your build not very end game or dying often ... highly recommended to skip this. * **Complete 500 Delve Encounters at an area level of 80 or higher in the Azurite Mine** Well this sound a lot better than previous depth 600 challenge, this mean any build can achieve this now as long you keep farming delve depth 189 above then eventually you'll reach this number in no time, really love this improvement GGG! Please don't bring back again reach depth 600 challenge :( * [**Cleanse 400 Darkshrines in the Endgame Labyrinth**](URL This actually worst than previous challenge, the best you can hope for is wait for a labyrinth layout with 4 darkshine(max) within them then you'll only need to 100 labyrinth to complete this challenge, fewer darkshrine may cost you more to farm it so .... 4 dakrshrine labyrinth is your best BET to clear off this challenge. * **Complete 50 Blighted Maps** This challenge use to be require 100 blighted maps(since blight league) got tone down to 50 ... looks good! 50 is a very achievable number, gonna at least try complete this one when doing end game challenges. * [**Defeat 100 Conquerors of the Atlas**](URL From ""75 Sirus kills"" to 100 conquerors which is like trying to spawn 25 Sirus instead! Great improvement GGG! 100 conquerors is definitely an achievable number from a casual player perspective. * **Defeat 750 waves of monsters in the Simulacrum** An upgrade version of Simulacrum II challenge, the required amount to farming this map is roughly around 75 times for a descent build(10+ waves per map) and 38 times for a good build(20 wavers per map). Is really grindy but if you like the new league mechanic then should be achievable. Hard. GGG are pretty tame with the end game grinding number this league, I'm very surprise! In a good way :D ... Do 4 out of 6 of these choices, without a doubt I would skip that Level 100, that's ridiculous grind ... then maybe skip labyrinth by doing other content cuz I know many of yo really hate labyrinth ... I mean only [1% ppl can do labyrinth](URL XD For those who willing to do lab then may wanna skip .... 750 simulacrum because of the big number, or maybe 500 delve encounters if you really prefer simulacrum if it's cheap or you love the content, 500 delve is actually more grindy compare the others options because of the sulphite grind. Well just skip the least content you like the most, overall these end game grind challenge is way more easier compare to previous league, **great improvement GGG!** ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- I will still be active updating this page from time to time whenever I got new INTEL untill the league ends ;) Hopefully you guys understand my poor english and also helped new comer try to get 40/40 challenges =D [**Change-logs last update 18th March 2020.

I can't seem to find it anywhere on the forum, on [poebuilds.cc](URL or that ninja site. Basically, I have no reference at all, so I'm calling on you guys. My first problem with this build is that flicker strike doesn't seem to chain nearly enough to be fully functional. Many times I have to wait for the cooldown, get one flicker, cooldown again, flicker again, 3-4 times until I can get it to chain. And yes, I leap slam to try to get that one frenzy charge. My second problem is that it has WAAAAY too many auras and such: Just Herald of Purity and Vulnerability with Blasphemy together reserver 60% of my mana. Anything else, such as flesh and stone, takes me to 88% since it is supported by maim, at which point I can hardly do anything without constantly running out. Obviously. Then after these two auras that reserve 60%, there is Pride (50%) as well as Flesh and Stone (25%). Granted pride as well as flesh and stone are supposed to be supported by Enlighten. But still, I do not see how I am supposed to support nearly 140% reserved mana minus the Enlighten effect on two. I would assume that would take me to ""only"" 124 % reserved mana. WTF do I do with this? Are these different auras supposed to be situational? Which ones are more suited to this build? I'm asking because now I want to dump some of these gems before spending a fortune on Enlightens and then realize it's still broken AF. Other than that, fun build, I am enjoying it, but obviously it has its problems. Advice from the pros on here would be very appreciated."

More specifically; what modifiers require the player to have more than 100% reduction of reflected damage to be safe. According to the wiki, modifiers that increase damage taken works additively with reduced reflected damage. In other words, with the abyssus used as an example one would need 140-150% reduced reflected physical damage to be safe from physical reflected damage. Sources of increased damage taken that I currently know of: Abyssus: increases physical damage taken Curses: elemental weakness, vulnerability, etc. Sextants: x additional packs that deal cold/fire/ lightning/physical damage - players and monsters take x% increased cold/fire/lightning/physical damage I assume shock/shocking ground also requires a higher investment in reflect reduction to achieve safety.

Also does intimidate negate my vulnerability setup with the onyx amulet and blasphemy? Should I just drop my money on spiked gloves with culling strike? Should I try get +1 frenzy? &amp;#x200B; Weapons I don't think soul taker can be replaced as all my auras leave me with very little mana, having to wait a few seconds to cast blood rage sometimes and I need leap slam to get out of tight spots. The other axe was a lucky snipe with around 350 pdps if I remember correctly. I know the attack speed on it sucks since soul taker is around 1.8 and this one is 1.3.

I'm sitting on 5500 HP, 1300 ES, max res (except Chaos) plus the near constant Bone Armor. My minion damage modifier is +465% (I dropped down from +500% to get some more life) Notable uniques are Queens Escape, Queens Hunger and Grip of the Council. The rest are high tier rares. Jewels are Taunt/Blind + Maximum Life Since I hit end game and started running juiced up T14-16 maps I occassionaly experienced being one-shotted by white/rare mobs, also my Zombies started to die. So I revised my gem setup, adding Minion Life to Zombies and Meat shield to Spectres so that they stay on top of me with their Proximity shields. Still, I feel my gem setup is not min-maxed enough, especially I'm not sure about Animate Guardian (holding Victarios Flight, Leer Cast and Dying Breath) and all the non-minion gems I'm using. Switch to Ball Lightning? CWDT+Immortals Call didn't work for me as it's cooldown is shared with Bone Armor. Stone Golem instead of Carrion Golem?

Recently after inputs from this community I incorporated a self cast vulnerability curse in one of my unset rings. This is giving my skeletons quite a bit more damage, both due to the curse and due to chance to cause bleeding when my minions hit enemies (and they do more damage on bleeding enemies). Further, I went for the Grave Intentions node, but seems like it is not doing as much chaos damage as I was expecting (perhaps because they gain unholy might on kill and bosses die only once... duh. So, not much effect while bossing). So I brought back my brutality gem (which I had replaced in order to get the chaos damage). Perhaps I will change those nodes to something else later. Now I was thinking of adding a few extra curses. I was thinking of the following (in addition to the vulnerability curse): Temporal chains, and enfeeble. Can you suggest some way I can incorporate those curses in this setup so that they all trigger automatically. I am already starved for sockets. Hungry loop could be of some use I guess. If I move my wand gems to a hungry loop, and put the curses on a wand with ""trigger socketed spells when you use a skill"" craft. But then again, such a wand with ""+1 to all socketed minions skill gems"", as well as that trigger craft could be very costly. I need your suggestions before I commit to filling out a hungry loop."

I feel like this build can be way more optimized to pump out more damage, but i'm too inexperienced with the game and POB to figure out what to get next. From what I've read here and there, the logical next step to boost my damage would be to dump the ahn's might setup in favor of some good foils, thus gaining one additional jewel slot (instead of pacifism) and gaining the frenzy charge bonuses. Not sure how to pick some though, all the ones i've tried to fit in my pob result in a huge dps loss.

Monster elemental/chaos resists are easy to grasp. It's a straight up % ad you can even see ""resists/vulnerable to X"" in the monster's little info panel when you mouse over them. It's easy to know if your exposures, curses, etc are breaking monster resists and easy to at least get a rough idea when you need to invest in elemental penetration on top of that. So if we were to use the same type of rough % physical mitigation calculation the character menu uses for us, what would we see for monsters? and how extreme of a difference would you see between EQ, heavy strike, etc builds and cyclone, barrage, etc builds? Do we only need armor pen if we're trying to hit fast rather than hard? What about the new 20% resist reduction on punishment? Does this actually make it worth using over vulnerability? What about when you're running physical minions which inherently suffers more against armor due to the large number of total hits you're putting out?

I'm trying to make a fast attack speed bow character and could use some advice. I've theory crafted a bit and came up with two alternatives, but I'm not sure which is better: Berserker using frenzy going physical damage/impale, or Raider using elemental attack and EE. Final question, with details to follow: Which would shoot faster, a berserker or a raider? This will be just a fun build attacking silly fast, not necessarily required to make it to uber elder level difficulty. Below is the link to my characters. My frenzy melee berserker is named WayTooMuchCoffee, you can see my skill setup and passive tree. Basically, he uses a claw with Frenzy+Mutlistrike+phys damage+etc, and he curses with vulnerability and punishment, as well as summons a lightning golem. He uses impale for damage. I gained the max extra frenzy charges passives. He's actually really fun to play and can at least do tier 10 maps (I haven't found any higher yet). He gets around 12 attacks per second and maxes out at \~60k dps. Nothing amazing, but the character looks like he's twitching around the screen which is entertaining to me. It reminds me of the Diablo II frenzy barbarian. [URL Now I want to make a bow character that can attack similarly fast, 10+ attacks per second if possible. Question is: do I use a Raider with all of the frenzy buffs (Avatar of veil, avatar of slaughter, way of poacher), or do I use another berserker? The raider would use element attack, so she wouldn't get the added attack speed/damage from the frenzy skill gem. The berserker would most likely use the frenzy skill gem, but not necessarily. Check this link out : [URL This one sounds fun, attacks fast, and hits hard, but I'm not sure I can afford all of the gear. I welcome your opinions!"
87,vulnerability,pathofexile,There should be a new curse for designed for fighting single targets.,1,e9z46c,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/e9z46c/there_should_be_a_new_curse_for_designed_for/,2019-12-13 15:29:49,"There has been a lot of new auras introduced across the years, but it's been a while since we've seen a new curse. In fact, the last new curse came about because the Vulnerability curse was split into two ones. I've heard people ask about what new curse they could add as all bases seem to be covered already, and that is a good point. But with Metamorphisis league and the increase in the importance of combat against a single target, I think a curse for that situation is something we could use. It could be called ""Lonesomeness"" and grant additional damage and attack speed to melee attackers if the cursed creature has no allies nearby. This would have application different from other curses. Instead of just increasing your survivability or matching the main source of damage for the build, this curse would be for builds that are built around having AoE and are bad at handling single targets, so they they could make up for that disadvantage. Or just be a new toy for multi-curse builds to play around with. The cost of your 1 curse your allowed to apply to enemies is a steep one so that limits this from being too metabreaking. One potential reason against this curse getting added would be that monsters would be able to cast it on the player. In which case that would result in the curse being a lot more dangerous than any other curse, would give minion builds the random buff of them being effectively unaffected to the curse as they always have nearby allies, and tons of players asking if their totems, raging spirits, skitterbots or other things count at having nearby allies. Although the ease of becoming unaffected by it does give potential to synergize with [[Self-Flagellation]]."

A list of influence modifiers can be found here: URL You can change which Influence mod list you are looking at with the 'Influence' drop-down [The link will take you to Hunter.] Each of the new influences seem to have areas of bias, but there's also some in places you wouldn't expect. For example; Extra Projectile is in Warlord, not Hunter. Here's some quick things I've seen, I may have missed some: Crusader: Elemental Conversion can roll on Quivers as well as Gloves [Which already had a Veiled Mod for conversion] Phy taken as Lightning can roll on Body Armour and Helmets; and you can get a total of up to 25% Heavy focus on Lightning Damage in general Bow can roll +1 Chain and +1 Fork.

I also like how each of the new influences has a focus of sorts, so you can probably hunt the Hunter if you want to play a DoT build; for example. Some of the new modifiers seem potentially *very powerful*; like the Charge on Block Shields [Might be enough to justify running Glanceing Blows if you're not investing in max block; whereas before that keystone was relatively useless]. Remember as well you can make it so an item has two influences upon it. So even if there's modifiers from two pools, an item *can* have both. So using Shields as an example again, you can have a Charge on Block shield; potentially with (4150)% chance to Shock Attackers for 4 seconds on Block from Crusader."

Does Maim on chest increase the outgoing bleed damage? The same goes for Blood and Sand - Blood stance supported by Maim - would enemies in range given that hit will do more physical damage take more bleed damage instead while not standing inside the aura area? Flat phys does increase bleed damage, damage over time, bleed damage, damage over time multiplier etc. Also since like 3.7 we 'hits have -15% to physical reduction against enemies', does that calculate bleed damage before reductions or after? Eg hit for 1000 with maim will do said 1300 damage, would bleed count from 1000 or 1300? Or going further with 50% reduction, with 15% reduction hit would do 2000 damage with reduction, 2600 with maim but with -20% reduction would it deal bleed damage calculated from 2760? Vulnerability increases bleed damage, Brutality also does I guess.. By the way, does bleeds get replaced without Crimson dance - eg. my puncture does more bleed damage than my split arrow, but would split arrow apply weaker bleeding?"

As leaguestart drew closer I settled on Herald of Purity Guardian, better known as ""THE BOIS"" by my friends (of which I have too few, hence I decided to just.. summon five more.) My non-HoP friends, except for one, didn't believe in the power of me and THE BOIS, at all, they all bet against me (hehe, jokes on them now), saying it wouldn't be endgame viable. Well, lets look at that statement. As of right now I have only played this build for the entire league, the gear is insanely cheap and easy to get a hold of; here is a short breakdown of how the build functions and what items it utilizes. Our goal is to scale the Sentinesl summoned by Herald of Purity, we can do this in a few different ways. The easiest one is Gem-Levels. So we get ourselves a nice lvl 21 Herald of Purity, this is rather easy as quality only gives some movementspeed to the Minions and can therefore be ignored. Next we equip two Cold Iron Points, giving us +6 to Herald of Purity as well as to our Auras and Curses. To further facilitate Gem-Levels we socket Herald of Purity into a Coming Calamity, giving it an additional +2 Gem-Levels. We link Herald of Purity with the following Support Gems: Death Mark: Cause its nice to click on something and have it die, Melee Phys, Brutality, Minion Damage and Impale. Lastly we equip a +1 To all Strength Skill Gems Amulet, courtesy of Hunter Mods. Now we add two Curses to enhance the Sentinels further. We use Cyclone in a Curse on Hit Setup with Vulnerability and Punishment, both of which recieve the benefit of our Cold Iron Points. We socket this link into my shitty, selfcrafted Fortify Booty, for some more defense. Next we add Auras: Pride is the obvious choice. If we now pick up some Mana-Reservation Nodes on the tree, which also increase the effect of our curses, we can also activate Dread Banner for more Impale Effect for our Bois. We round this out by summoning a Carrion Golem for the additional damage to our minions. In both Ring-Slots we equip Circle's of Guilt, with the Mod ""Sentinels of Purity deal #% Increased Damage"". This mod is the only thing that matters, get some nice implicits if you want and try to pick up ""4% Increased Physical Damage Reduction while affected by Herald of Purity"" as it is the only useful other mod on these rings. Now, the Passive-Tree is just about picking up defense, fortify effect, minion damage nodes wherever possible, curse effect and Whispers of Doom. Fairly straight forward, PoB will be attached down below. For our Ascendancy we run Guardian: We pick up Harmony of Purpose first, this grants us and our Bois maxed out charges when used with Cyclone. Next we go for Radiant Crusade and Unwavering Crusade, giving the Bois Onslaught and generally just a nice damage boost through the flat damage and Intimidate. The last 2 Points are variable, I go with Bastion of Hope for some block and stun immunity, Time of Need seems decent too, I just prefer the block. Radiant Faith is uh.. just not good with our Mana-Pool. The biggest boost that we can still add to our Bois is the Helmet Enchantment ""+1 to maximum Number of Sentinels of Purity"", which pretty much grants us a 25% More Damage modifier. With all this working together I currently sit at around \~2,7M DPS per Sentinel versus the Shaper. This adds up to roughly 13,5M DPS in total. If this isn't enough for you, equp Mother's Embrace, get a Lion's Roar and a Sulphite flask for.. funny damage numbers. You could also always try to encorporate Flesh Offering, I ran a 2nd Cyclone for a while with Flesh Offering, Desecrate and CoC. But the damage really isn't needed and alternating between two Cyclones feels.. weird. With all that combined we have a build that handles all content in the game with ease, can run all map mods (Yes, even phys reflect, your cyclone does so little damage that you won't really hurt yourself, your Bois might kill themselves all the time but it is still doable), delves decently, clears.. uh.. decently quick and comes on a very cheap budget. My current character has about 12 ex invested into it, and that is only because I bought the +1 neck, the helmet with the enchant, high rolled rings and my 6L coming calamity very early into the league when they were a bit more expensive. Right now you should get by with maybe 8 ex or even less. I've killed Awakener 23 times, for myself and some friends, done a few UE's, Shapers and all Delve Bosses, Delve is currently at around \~400. The character is overall very well rounded and works, its not the fastest clear but the bossing is exceptional and definitely its biggest strength. Blowing up T16 Conquerors in a few seconds sure is fun. The only downsides to this build are, that it is fairly easy to max out, so your potential for more investment is rather low. I'm sitting at \~30k Chaos networth with nothing to spend on and I don't feel like making another character. Outside of spamcorrupting 6L Calamities with the correct colors (its aids to color btw, takes like 500 chromes) for +1 / +2 Duration Gems and recrafting some rare gear, there really isn't much to do. Also we're playing Cyclone so that might not be for everyone. To conclude this: ""THE BOIS"" are endgame viable, strong, cheap and my friends owe me drinks the next time we meet up. I'll try to respond to any questions if I see them, if you want to ask me something directly, just msg ""BoisofPurity"" ingame. I have no life so I'll probably be online most of the time. Also hmu if you want your Awakener killed, the 75 Kills Endgame Grind is kinda killing me, so I'll do that for free (Tips appreciated). [URL BOIS vs Sirus 8 [URL"

On a day such as this, it was almost too fitting; as if Solaris herself was blessing the Atoea Centre as GGG prepared for, what could be argued as, the biggest day in Path of Exile History so far. I braced myself as I confronted the largest gathering of PoE players ever in one physical location, waiting for the doors to open and let us Exiles in. What was in store? Oh my. Too much was in store. &amp;#x200B; **THE RUN-DOWN** Look, I'm sure most, if not all, of you know the news by now. The numerous releases, the constant barrage of new information about Path of Exile 2, Conquerors of the Atlas, and Metamorph League, to only name a few. I'm not here to fill you in on these things, but merely here to share my experience at this pivotal moment of GGG's history. And I'm really not downplaying that at all - I truly believe this is the start of something much larger for the company, and us as a community, as we grow, welcome new players (if you're new reading this, HI THERE!), and experience the new era of the ARPG genre. But before I really do a deep dive, I just want to say something - to the entire staff at GGG - but mostly to **Chris Wilson**; We saw you out there. We saw how vulnerable, excited, nervous, cautious, apprehensive, bold, and caring you were. The moment the initial Path of Exile 2 trailer had finished and after we all clapped and roared and cheered as you walked on stage, there was a silence. Not awkward, or tense; a silence, as you stood in front of the community, that could only be described as Fatherly. A silence that told us how much this really meant to you, and the team, that this was finally out in the world (and that Blizzard really has it coming for them, let's be honest here), and that your 'child' that is Path of Exile is growing up into a rambunctious, independent young adult who is ready to go out there into the world and spread their wings. You should be proud. You should be relieved. You, and all behind you, are in the midst of something larger than anyone really realises, I believe. Chris, Well done. \---------------------------------------- **EXILECON DAY ONE:** PROS: * The numerous indirect quips, obviously aimed at Blizzard, during the keynote about features being implemented * The vulnerability, as stated above, by GGG * PoE Mobile?! This takes guts, guys. (Side-note, I did not get to play-test this today, but I'll try to tomorrow) * Visual overhauls, promises of ALL UNIQUES getting visual updates, new lighting system... whoa. * What looks like a slower pace of gameplay in PoE2 (something I've been wanting to welcome back for a long time) * Clarity for old and new players alike through the new skill-gem system * The Community! Seriously, you're all amazing \- and these are just the main points CONS: * The whole thing was literally a 'con'. That's it. That's the only Con. &amp;#x200B; **Path of Exile 2** What is definitely considered the largest announcement by far, PoE2, blew me away. I, and I'm sure almost everyone else, was not expecting such a large secret to be kept for so long (Chris stated they've been working well over 2 years on this so far?!), but boy oh boy did it land well with me. The fact that they will also be updating and continuing to support PoE 1 as the 'original' campaign, and PoE2 will be an entirely new 7-ACT campaign is the ultimate act of 'you can have your cake and eat it, too'. No - actually, it's more like: 'Here's two cakes. We heard you like vanilla, but also chocolate, so we made both - with cream filling and garnished with luscious fruits. Have them both, we don't care. Oh, yeah, maybe you'd like some dessert entrees as well? Here you go -' **3.9 - 'Conquerors of the Atlas' and Metamorph League** What do I even write. I'm sitting here, in my hotel room, at 6pm NZ time, and it just hit me again how much content GGG are literally throwing at us. It's like they don't even care for our wellbeing at this point. Damnit Chris, I have a full-time job, and you're telling me I have to take another 4 day weekend to start this league? \*sigh\* Ok, but only if I must. Jokes, I literally emailed work 10 minutes ago requesting leave. We are grinding this league, and we are grinding it hard. One thing I was worried about in the lead up to what was referred to as 4.0 before today, was us having to wait too long. I was worried I would burn out and not even really play until 4.0 came out, as it could be so enticing that 'old' PoE didn't seem intriguing as much. However, we've been blown away with the news about PoE2, that's for sure, but with another massive expansion coming and an interesting, boss-focussed league to tie it together with, I couldn't be more keen to jump back into the world of Wraeclast. By the way everyone, start stockpiling Dying Suns and Watcher's Eyes right now, if you ever have any intention of playing in standard. Seriously. Thank me later. **Path of Exile MOBILE** My reaction during trailer: HAHAHAAA HAHA hahaaa hah... wait... what? This... This is real? &amp;#x200B; **CONCLUSION** Honestly, today was a day to remember, for many different reasons. I'm proud to be a part of GGG's first convention, and they pulled it off so well. I was quite the fly on the wall today, as I usually don't do too well with large crowds, but the experience was immensely entertaining. I cannot wait for tomorrow, for more dives headfirst into gameplay, as well as the Race Final! To all the big names and streamers who held the pre-show together (ZiggyD, Tarkecat, Kripparian) and all others for showing up with smiling faces to meet the fans and share in the excitement, thank you. To everyone who attended, just like myself, thank you. To New Zealand, for being beautiful and welcoming, thank you. And, to GGG, for everything, **thank you.** &amp;#x200B; P.S. If anyone else attending the con wants to have a chat tomorrow, or grab a beer after, let me know! DM me here and we can maybe see if we can get a few people together, I'd love to meet some of you and discuss all things PoE. If you find me during the con, I'm most likely the only one in a turtleneck. Come say hi :) Badger, out!"

Not sure why. Today is Body Armour and Boots. ***Body Armour***  **Solaris Lorica**. One of three items that enable low-life builds. The lack of energy shield kills it though. The chaos damage reductions are clunky and strange in 2019, access to chaos resistance is much better these days. GGG have been slowly removing flat damage reductions over the past few years (Transcendence being the exception). *Proposed Solution:* Now grants energy shield equal to 20% of your maximum life. *This solution would give Solaris Lorica its own identity as a true hybrid item instead of supporting low-life builds. We dont need a weaker Shavs.*  **Wall of Brambles**. Damage reflect is bad. Just, bad. Unless GGG wants to completely rework it, it will never be relevant. *Proposed Solution:* Now gives 20 armour per 2 strength and causes nearby enemies to take physical damage equal to 10% of your armour whenever you are hit. *It is possible to achieve upwards of 100k armour with the right build. Depending on how quickly you can hit yourself, you could be dealing decent damage even in the endgame. The only way to scale this damage would be with maim, pride, war banner, Vulnerability, etc. I love thorns builds as a concept and play them in every game that they are possible in, this would make that dream a reality.*  **Zahndethus Cassock**. Holy ground ain't special anymore. This item needs something to tempt people to use it. *Proposed Solution:* Now increases the effectiveness of your holy ground and all effects it grants by 50%. *Proposed Solution 2:* Now causes socketed totems to spread holy ground when placed. *Solution 1 is simple. If you really want to invest into Holy Ground to scale your damage and defenses, this is your item.* *Solution 2 calls back to old-school Elreon missions, where the totem you protect gives you an aura.*  **Vipers Scales**. Immunity to poison is cool and all, but not good enough to warrant use in an endgame build without some solid defences/damage to back it up. *Proposed Solution:* Now grants poison damage over time multiplier equal to your chaos resistance. *The idea is that the more resistant you are to poison, the deadlier the poison you can carry. A damage bump would push this item into the realm of viability.*  **Lightbane Raiment**. The other half of Zahndethus' Cassock, this item is just bad all around. It doesnt even spawn corpses. The phys conversion to chaos isn't enough to make this item good. Blocking being the trigger for the desecrated ground doesn't make any sense either. *Proposed Solution:* 30% of physical damage converted to chaos &gt; You have unholy might while standing on desecrated ground. Enemies standing on desecrated ground have -10% chaos resistance. 60% reduced light radius. +50 life. *The desecrate damage is ok for its level, but becomes irrelevant after about 20 minutes. The chaos resist reduction would make it useful, and the switch to Unholy Might would give some much needed damage. The reduced light radius is relevant for Wreath of Phrecia, making it possible to reduce your AoE radius by 30%.*  **The Restless Ward**. At 6000 life, this grants you the equivalent of 5% life regen at 10 endurance charges. The movement speed is so low that it may as well not be there. The charge duration is nice QoL, but this item isn't quite up to par with other chest slot options. *Proposed Solution:* 3% increased life recovery rate per endurance charge. 4% increased movement speed per frenzy charge. 5% increased cast speed per power charge. *This keep the identity of the item, while making it fit better into charge builds.* ***Boots***  **Stormcharger**. This item has no defenses and only converts 30% of your physical damage to lightning. The increased shock is nice, but isn't worth the loss of defenses that other boots offer. It has charge in the name, but has nothing to do with charges. *Proposed Solution:* Now converts 10% of physical damage to lightning per power charge. You gain +20 maximum energy shield per power charge. *This makes 100% conversion possible and offers decent defences through an extra 200 ES at 10 charges. The energy shield works just like Spirit Offering, giving more max energy shield each time you trigger it (up to the max). Linking Power Charge on Crit to your main skill would be like having +20 es gained every other hit.*  **Deerstalker**. This item is fine while leveling, but falls off later. Movement speed after throwing a trap is flavorful, but strictly worse than regular movement speed at those values. *Proposed Solution:* Now grants you onslaught if you have thrown a trap recently instead of movement speed. 2% increased effect of onslaught for each trap you have thrown recently. *This upgrade would make these boots viable at later levels. Not much to say about this one.*  **The Blood Dance**. These boots are only related to blood on a cosmetic level, quite literally. A few changes to the function of frenzy charges aren't enough to make these boots any good. They used to give 1% life regen per charge before the nerf, which \*was\* the main draw. *Proposed Solution:* Your bleeds now deal damage 4% faster per frenzy charge. Nearby enemies are considered moving when you are moving. *For bleed builds in the endgame, Crimson dance is essential, many endgame bosses do not move at all. This change would allow you to benefit from the increased bleed damage granted when your enemy is moving without requiring them to move. This plays into the flavour of 'dancing around the enemy' as they bleed out, since you need to be* moving *and* nearby *for it to take effect.*  **Wanderlust**. This item doesn't really live up to its name. It should encourage you to move, and reward you for it. *Proposed Solution:* Recover mana equal to your level with each step while moving. *This would function just like Abberath's Hooves and Bubonic Trail, only for mana recovery. Some applications off the top of my head are: MoM RF, Indigon mana recovery.*  **Shavronnes Gambit**. A Shavronne item without curse synergy is a flavour fail in my book. *Proposed Solution:* Now causes you to regenerate 1% of your energy shield for each curse on you. *Probably only usable with Soul Mantle, but a big improvement.*  **Duskblight**. Weird 5-link items are almost never good. The 50% conditional chaos res is good, but the added chaos isnt enough to entice people to try this item. *Proposed Solution:* Socketed gems are now supported by level 30 Added Chaos Damage. ~~20~~\&gt;40% reduced light radius. *Level 25 Added Chaos provides 289-434 flat damage instead of 170-255. This almost brings these boots to being equal to a 6-link, while providing more flat chaos damage than any other item can.*  **Gangs Momentum**. This item makes no sense. ""Become one with the unstoppable flame""? It has nothing to do with momentum, and doesn't offer any real benefit to ignite builds. *Proposed Solution:* Now triggers level 20 Flame Rush whenever you kill an enemy. (Flame rush causes you to leave a trail of fire behind you as you move that deals 2500 fire damage per second. You lose this buff when you hit an enemy, gaining 30% more fire damage for that hit) *This makes the flame trail from Essence of Hysteria viable since this would now be supported by socketed gems. The buff acts just like Phase Run, triggering between kills, helping you to move from enemy to enemy, building momentum as you kill, then giving a decent bonus to your first ignite against the boss of each map.*"

I love theorycrafting. I love taking a jank build into the endgame just to see if it will work. I love the special interactions between different mechanics that allows something to function. I don't love many of GGG's older unique designs, and even some of the new ones. I often post new unique design ideas on this subreddit, but often get downvoted into oblivion by people who reject many ideas that come from the community saying ""this is way too OP"" or ""this will break the game"". Each time I suggest that GGG should revisit old designs, some people say ""We need weak uniques to make the good ones feel stronger"" or ""What are you talking about?! Mightflay is super unique! It has +25 Strength on it!"" I'm here to argue that every single unique should be just that. Unique. I believe that every unique should have its own identity, function, and flavour. I don't expect GGG to come out with perfectly designed, perfectly balanced uniques every single league. I do expect these new designs to be interesting and fun though. GGG has the manpower to do it. So don't tell me that they need hundreds of hours to come up with a single design, balance test it, and code it. Do you really think GGG balance tested 2.6.0's Dyadus? GGG have proven that they're willing to take risks, we see it every league when they introduce a new mechanic for us to enjoy. They don't always get it right, but they're not afraid to think outside the box. That being said, let's start with an example. \`\`Mightflay, Flaying Knife *Requires Level* *30,* *64* *Dex,* *44* *Int* 30% increased Global [Critical Strike Chance](URL \+25 to [Strength](URL (80-100)% increased [Physical Damage](URL Adds 12 to 24 [Physical Damage](URL \+10 [Life](URL gained for each Enemy [hit](URL by [Attacks](URL *A mighty beast, a lavish feast.* \`\` This unique has a great name, appropriate base, and fitting flavour text. The idea of a knife that makes you mighty, or that flays the mighty, or get more powerful the more strength you have is a great concept. Daggers are typically a weapon that are effective in the hands of someone who is dextrous, agile, and precise, rather than someone who is strong. +25 Strength is a weak effort to convey the conecpt of 'might' though. Strength on a dagger is certainly unique, but it isn't something that you would even notice unless you had crafted daggers before. This unique certainly has its place. It is an excellent leveling unique. It offers damage and sustain, which is enough to make people pay 1 alch for it early in the league. People might say that this is enough to make it a good design. They are wrong. This dagger offers nothing that can't be found elsewhere. It fails to deliver the image conveyed by its name and art, and stops feeling special after just a few levels. We can fix all this though. Idea 1: Give the dagger some sort of strength scaling support. There *are* other uniques that do this, so it isn't anything new, but synergies are important. * \+% attack speed with this weapon per X strength. * \+X life gained per X strength on hit (with this weapon?) Idea 2: Flaying. A quick google search tells us that flaying means: ""strip (the skin) off a corpse or carcass"" or ""whip or beat (someone) so harshly as to remove their skin"". We could give this flavour mechanical representation in a number of ways. * Attacks with this weapon apply level X vulnerability on hit. (to represent flaying someone's skin off them) * Have the dagger give you Crimson Dance and a chance to bleed on hit. (to represent the many bleeding wounds) * Attacks with this weapon have a 100% chance to impale bleeding enemies. * Enemies you impale take 10% increased physical damage (over time?) for each impale on them. These are a just a few quick ideas i came up with. Maybe all of them are terrible. Maybe they would belong better elsewhere. My point is, it isn't that hard to think of a way to make each Unique unique. If you're interested in my other design suggestions: [URL [URL [URL [URL [URL [URL"

Because it specifies bleeding YOU apply. Correct? 2) More out of curiosity but can anyone think of any reason GGG locked this keystone to the player? This node has a lot of build potential which is ruined by the **you** requirement. Seems non-sensical to me why this restriction is in place. 3) To my knowledge the strongest bleeds are the one that takes effect. So this means, just want to make sure I'm correct here, that you can apply 8 bleeds (with no movement bleed) and minions can only apply 1 bleed (that includes movement bleed) for 9 bleeds total? Or does it mean 8 bleeds total, so if a minion has higher damage than you - you will have 7 bleeds and they have 1 bleed applied? 4) Bleed damage where it matters (vs bosses) don't want ""uber IAS"", you want HIGH damage with some IAS right? The whole reason I'm asking all this to begin with is because I want to make a more hipster summoner variant (non-necro, non-guardian). And for RP purposes I'm going Berserker or Gladiator. Thing about Berserker is that you can give some significant buffs through warcries to your minions, and the 30% movespeed helps for clear speed. Berserker also has less wasted skillpoint to travel to minion nodes. Gladiator has a much less optimized route to the minion nodes, but has the super juicy 25% more bleed amp and corpse explode (arena challenger requires stance switching, to much of a chore). So just wondering if someone can give me advice here for the best bleed + minion option that is non-standard like witch/templar. 5) Bloodlust works for minions if I'm not mistaken.

I just want to lazy walk around while picking items. Self cursing temp chains is nice mechanic to lengthen skill duration. You only need cast skill few times in a map. This mechanic is familiar and used mostly with Headhunter but it can be also used without. You need shackles of wretched gloves + kaom roots (action speed cannot be modified to below base value). With juggernaut you don't need kaoms If you pick unstoppable. Maxing slow effect for you by temp chains (75 %), you need solstice vigil amu and 45% curse effect.

You cannot self curse if you run hexproof map unless you are occulist How to achieve 45 % curse effect: Get helmet with 30 % temp chain curse effect helm + curse on hit gem (20/23 is 11 % curse effect) and conqueror's potency jewel 4 % curse effect Pick curse effect nodes from tree Use occulist ascedancy nodes Use glorius vanity with curse effect Use coward legacy 50 % curse effect (If you use determination watcher with immunity to vulnerability) Or any mix of those.

112,vulnerability,pathofexile,Rough guide/analysis for bleed in 3.7,56,cnt75t,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/cnt75t/rough_guideanalysis_for_bleed_in_37/,2019-08-09 08:32:52," **Quick guide to building for bleed in 3.7** I have been playing a few bleed builds lately, so figured I would do a write-up of my findings in the hope that someone else finds it useful. The purpose of this is to enable anyone to create effective bleed builds. Once you understand the basics, you should have no problem taking down all content, regardless of your ascendancy, and without spending a colossal amount of currency. Firstly make sure you know what you're scaling. Bleed can only be applied from attacks. Bleed is only based off the physical portion of an attack. Impale will not help bleed. Bleed scales separately to hits. Some multipliers affect bleed and hits, some just hits, and some just bleeds (""physical damage over time""). This last part is important. Your bleeds are based from the size of the physical portion of the base hit i.e. like the flat amount that your weapon does, plus any \*flat\* damage from items/skills etc. This is modified by damage effectiveness on the attack that applies it. After this point, only bleed-affecting modifiers will scale this damage. Attack damage (increased or more) does not scale bleed, Melee damage does not scale bleed (even if you applied with a melee attack), Damage with swords does not scale bleed (even if applied with a sword). Strength does not scale bleed. And so on. Global physical damage, damage over time, and generic 'damage' are all bleed affecting damage types. Melee Physical Damage Support gem \*does\* scale bleed, but only because it specifically says so. Ditto Ruthless. And Damage on Full Life Support also scales bleed, because it is not tied to a damage type (even though it only supports attack skills). And in 3.7 Multistrike now scales bleed quite nicely. Minion damage scales bleed if using the Scourge or Spiritual Aid passive node. etc. Basically if the modifier specifies attacks or spells or items then it won't be useful - bleed is physical and damage over time. Like ignites, a higher damage bleed will overwrite a lower damage bleed. Or rather, they will both be applied, but only the higher damage bleed will do damage. You can of course run the Crimson Dance passive, but the same applies, only you have your 8 best bleeds running, not just 1. **Critical Strike or not?** Crit will scale your bleeds as a 50% more multiplier, however you lose the benefit of any additional crit multiplier unless you take the Perfect Agony keystone. Losing crit multi isn't all bad however, because bleed is limited in application, you can effectively get the benefit of near 100% crit chance with a much smaller value - as long as you crit once during each bleed timeout, you have full crit. A hit build going from 100% to 50% crit chance loses 50% crit damage, but a bleed build going from 100% to 50% crit chance will barely lose any damage. Perfect Agony is generally considered too expensive for what it does, but with a good amount of investment it's certainly viable and most likely optimal for really min-maxed builds. You don't need this of course, as relatively low investment bleed builds can drop all content very fast. Plus, you are then competing with hit/impale builds for crit multiplier, which will skyrocket the cost of your build. Given that accuracy is easy to cap now, and the large amount of crit availability on the tree, I would always recommend skipping RT and getting some accuracy and crit chance - remember you only need to crit enough, don't sacrifice a lot for it, since you will boost it with a diamond flask (Lion' Roar doesn't work for you, as mentioned earlier). That said, RT is still very viable and if you have a good setup that makes crit hard to get, then take Crimson Dance and go RT. **Crimson Dance or not?** This is a tricky one. A lot of people do some fairly basic analysis and conclude that Crimson Dance is necessary. But there is a lot to consider. A good bleed build normally has a number of unreliable high damage multipliers. So there's crit for starters, then the Delve mod (60% chance to double bleed damage), and then Ruthless and the new Multistrike (each 1/3 for full damage). Crimson Dance at full ramp up has 4 times the damage of regular bleed (we're only considering unmoving targets here, since most tanky targets don't move much). Think about it this way: if you only barely kept 8 bleeds up, then all of your bleeds are your average bleed damage. So the effect of having all of those unreliable multipliers is greatly weakened. If one didn't have Crimson Dance and hit 8 times, then chances are that one of those hits is going to be very high damage and quite possibly more than all of the crimson storm bleeds combined. So Crimson Dance builds want to hit quite fast, and also want to be sparing on the unreliability of their hits. So one might skip the Delve mod and just get a higher base damage weapon instead. And certainly pick different support gems than Ruthless or Multistrike (speaking of which, the interaction between the two is quite bad and I advise not ever taking both unless you are looking for a meme super KO build). So the Crimson Dance people might say that this is exactly what they do - hit a lot with high damage and relatively low variance, and end up with 2-3 times the damage of a non-CD build. But this doesn't quite complete the analysis, because there is also the base variance in the hit to consider. Top end damage is often 50% higher than low end damage. That's roughly 20% \*more\* damage from a high damage hit than an average damage hit. And in addition, the new passives and Timeless Jewels include a number of modifiers which speed up bleed damage. This means your bleeds will run out sooner while applying the full damage, so you can then have new bleeds running and net higher dps. This makes things harder for Crimson Dance, which already has to sacrifice some of the base damage for attack speed in the first place. All things considered, my preference is to opt out of Crimson Dance and save myself the passive. The option I prefer is to take Farrul's gloves with a less duration Aspect, which means that one can reliably apply both regular and Crimson Dance bleeds to a target. I don't really care about getting 8 attacks in the CD phase - for me it is just more bleed damage on top of what I already have. The downside is no Haemophilia, which is annoying depending on how you are applying your bleeds. **Curses and Auras.** With bleed, you may well be passing by the Blood Magic passive branch on the tree. This is not a great deal at the moment - there are a lot of useful auras out there and bleed builds are not mana heavy, so you can do a lot more with a full mana pool than being limited to a single aura. Plus your banner skill will come off your health which is less than ideal. Low level Precision is insane value. Pride is great. Like most dot builds, whether it's a boss or clearing, you want to hit and keep moving. That means the nearby/aura stuff is less useful than you might think. Curse on hit is best - vulnerability, followed by despair. Enfeeble on CWDT helps a lot with ranged damage, as does sand mode on Flesh and Stone. War Banner for accuracy, increased damage, and adrenaline (use inc dur support) is amazing. Then defensives - purity of ice for uber elder, flesh and stone in sand mode etc. I had no problem with Uber Elder with just war banner and lvl 11 vulnerability on hit - no Pride, no Blood stance etc. Rallying cry is usually good value. **Gems** You can do bleed on any non-converting attack skill. It doesn't matter a great deal what skill you take - if you choose a fast hitting, low damage effectiveness skill, then take Crimson Dance and use a slower, high damage weapon. It does help if you use a skill that grants an applicable damage bonus (e.g. Earthquake's aftershock), and added flat \*physical\* damage which many skills have now. There are a lot of useful support gems: *(Generally good, in order)* Deadly Ailments Brutality Damage on Full Life Unbound Ailments Maim Chance to Bleed (Better on faster attacks with Crimson Dance, or if bleed chance is needed) Swift Affliction (Avoid if possible) Less Duration (Earthquake only) *(Conditional on attack type)* Melee Physical Damage Ruthless Multistrike Vicious Projectiles *(Effective, but build dependent)* Hypothermia Rage (you only benefit from the flat damage, not the range bonus, but the flat is significant, and the attack speed and movement speed are also very noticeable - ramp up time is the downside, so this is probably berserker only) Single target skills will need Ancestral Call (plus either Gladiator or Haemophilia) and/or Melee Splash for clear. **Items** 7-link is ideal: Maim chest, or Fortify/Vicious Proj weapon. Weapon primary consideration is range. Secondary consideration is Crit chance for non-Slayers, closely followed by local attack speed. The Delve mod from Corroded fossils is hard to beat. Take a high ilvl Elder weapon and use Corroded+Jagged fossils (+Shuddering is a good idea, Pristine if you have cash to burn, but don't bother with Serrated) and try to get the bleed mod plus either flat or %damage, and craft the 3rd prefix as needed. If you hit fortify and delve mod you hit the jackpot. Haemophilia is almost mandatory if you are using a non-AoE skill and are not a Gladiator. Otherwise Farrul gloves are BiS (support aspect with less duration), Blasphemer's Grasp are great, and there are loads of other useful gloves. Don't stack mountains of flat damage, it's not needed and with the amount given to most skills directly it's generally inefficient. As prefix mods on jewellery, flat damage isn't bad though, not a lot you miss out on there. Ryslatha's belt is pretty good but don't forget that it's adding variance so you need to get more attacks in between each bleed to make that work for you. And there are a lot of other options out there like Tactician, Deceiver or any Abyss belt, an amazing Rustic etc. Helm is whatever - Starkonja's is good, Deidbellow works for some setups etc. The ailment duration crafted mod can be very strong for dps phases (i.e. pop everything, adrenaline etc and focus). Some skills get a huge boost from enchants (such as Earthquake), so be aware. Flasks: diamond (for crit), sulphur, 1 defensive, 1 life (or utility for ES build), and a quicksilver (or just silver flask with adrenaline). Use bestiary to get the ailment mods you want on them. Jewels: Timeless can be nice, with Karui adding on crit chance and phys, with loads of useful defensives. Eternal timeless can potentially be extremely strong for damage, with bleed and phys nodes, plus resists as well. **Passives** The faster bleed nodes are really good, but if not in that area of the tree just pick up good ailment nodes, or Spiritual Aid and minion damage. Most ascendancies have some way to hyper-scale bleed damage, whether it's guaranteed shock from Elementalist, or Perfect Agony with Assassin, tri-curse with Occultist or just plain being able to sacrifice defense for more damage. &amp;#x200B; That's it really. If your goal is to clear screens immediately or deep delve, then bleed is probably not the best option. But for dropping bosses on a budget, it does pretty well. Hope there was something useful in there for you."

Eliminating flame golem on CWDT and using increased duration support for Immortal Call. I'm loosing some damage and a mob distraction (flame golem), but would have increase uptime for immortal call 2. Do not use faster attack support for leap slam, and using the socket for a single skill instead, which allows me to reorganize my other gems. 3. Is culling strike worth keeping?. Was thinking on getting rid of it, reorganizing gems and using Flesh and Stone + Maim Support. I have to keep Ancestral warchief, as it adds a lot of damage (universal more damage), though ancestral protector adds a lot of attack speed, so I'm not sure which one to use. 4. Changing War Banner to Dread Banner. Increased impale chance + impale effect + reduced enemy accuracy. 5. Instead of using Sulphur Flask, using Stibnite Flask 6. Changing Amulet to Impresence (Physical), which would mean changing offhand ring and/or gloves to have enough dexterity and resistances. It would also help to free some mana to use Flesh and Stone, maybe even adding an extra aura (something without too much mana reservation) 7. Putting Jack, the Axe to rest and getting a better off hand Axe with Dexterity and/or resistances. I have a tab full of fossils, though I'm not sure which ones to use. 8. Moving Passive Skill Points from Splitting Strikes node to Swagger node (+ 10 block chance + 10% to generate a frenzy on charge when blocking, which would help with boss fights if It helps to renew the charge duration) 9. Moving Passive Skill Poings from Gladiator's Perseverance to Blade Barrier (+11 block chance) 10. Avoiding Cloth and Chain path and using Savagery path instead. Because of my boots, frenzy charges are really important to attack speed, moving faster, and dodging. If I stop to pick up loot, my charges dissapear without investing in increased charge duration. 11. I noted Outmatch and Outlast (Gladiator Ascendancy), does not help to much to renew Frenzy Charges, as while using Lacerate, I'm not killng too many mobs with main hand. I already have 100% endurance chance with the armor. Was thinking in getting Painforged instead: +8 Block Chance, + double Vengeance damage, which should be enough to stun any rare mob. It's also important to consider that I loose endurance charges constantly because of the armor, so the 10 reduce physical damage is not constant and that the 10% more damage is not too much to loose. 12. Vengeance, I believe it helps a lot when I'm getting swarmed, or, when because of lag or too many mobs on screen, I'm unable to chance direction to hit the ones behind me, so it adds some time and helps to sustain leech when moving quickly between mobs. 13. Not sure if it's worth changing Arena Challenger to Versatile Combatant or Violent Retaliation (Gladiator Ascendancy), The more attack speed and movements is welcomed when moving quickly and facing rare / unique mobs. 14. Getting rid of increased duration for Vaal Grace, as to be able to use it more often (though less time each use), because of the soul prevention. &amp;#x200B; I know it's a long post. Thanks for any help you can give."

After some testing it turns out that you can be reflect immun without purely stacking reduced reflect damage taken. For example my character uses: Yugul Pantheon: **25%** reduced Reflected Damage Taken Sibyl's Lament: **40%** Reduced Reflected Physical Damage Taken Fortify: **43%** Reduced Damage Taken from Hits with 119% increased Fortify Effect This puts my character at **108% Reduced Reflected Physical Damage Taken** (75% increased Fortify Effect would be enough: 20% * 1.75 = **35%** ) Other sources of reduced damage taken should work based on that fortify works aswell. For example Juggernaut nodes, corruptions with reduced X-type damage taken, Wise Oak, Nebuloch etc. (It would be great if others could confirm this) The only other thing which I had to remove from my character was Vulnerability on Hit because Atziri reflect curses and vuln causes increased physical damage taken. Same would go for Vulnerability Maps as well as Monsters with Vuln on Hit should be avoided, unless you are confident in having curse immunity at all times. I wouldnt recommend this for HC (besides Atziri). Any other sources of increased damage taken should be kept in mind as you'd need more reduced damage taken taken to compensate."

Now your next hit triggers the impale, you hit for 139 damage adding a second 13.9 damage impale while triggering the first impale stack. Since the stack is counted as reflect damage taken by the enemy, sources of ""enemies take"" will affect the reflect damage done. This means the 13.9 damage impale hits for 19.31 damage on trigger. This allows most builds to do significantly more damage with impale (without even being champion) than they do with their actual hits once impale is stacked. I have no problem with this build progression, but it is odd to see them gut so many builds that relied on ""non-cancerous"" double dipping (not talking about voltaxic poison) just to implement a physical double dip so powerful it enables about 40% of the player-base's current builds."

(Using a jewel provided by [u/MaXiMiUS](URL I imported the new Slyer Ascendancys into PoE Ive chosen to go with Headsman/Bane of Legends/Impact and Masterful Form I initially took Overwhelm instead of Masterful Form wich resulted in some insane DPS, however after giving it some thought, i decided the Defensive potential of Masterful Form in form of the Max Endurance Charge = Max Frenzy Charge would be more valuable than the pure damage increase. ( Max Frenzy charge is 5 ) Item wise ive chosen Uniques that are used in other Cyclone builds ( took a look at exsiting builds to get a rough estimate at what i should use ) + used POB to craft some Rares that fill out the needed Stats, based on what ive learned about PoE so far. Skill Gems: Cyclone - Faster Attacks - Melee Physical Damge - Curse on Hit - Vulnerability &lt;- Weapon Leap Slam - Faster Attacks &lt;- Gloves Cast when Damage Taken - Molten Shell - Blood Rage --- Enduring Cry &lt;- Helmet \-----with the changes to Immortal Call i dont think the usual CwDT setup isnt going to work as it used to. Molten shell however provides a flat absorb shield based on armor. POB calculates my max armor rating at 11693 wich is pretty decent i think. \----- Enduring cry is not the skill i use to generate Endurance charges. however it should allow me to sustain endurance charges during boss fights. Blasphemy - Poachers Mark - Warlord\`s Mark---- Ice Golem &lt;- Boots \---- Poachers and Warlords for charge generation, granted the elder ring enchants might be better but given how these rings tend to be sought after and thus often quite pricy having both as an aura should be a suitible alterntive. Ice golem for Global Crit and Accuracy rating. Ancesteral Protector - Faster Attacks - Added Fire Damage - Fortify - Brutality - Life Gain on Hit &lt;- Chestplate \----- Fortify is probaply in the wrong place here, but Vulnerabilty gives a lot of DPS and with Cyclone being a channeling skill, putting up the Totem doesnt seem to be much of an issue to me.

Multistrike is now surprisingly good for Lacerate. The increased Attack Speed improves your Attack hit DPS, and the Bleed does not suffer from the Less Damage penalty, so the third hit from Multistrike does 99% More Bleed Damage. 2. Ruthless now gives you 132% More Damage on the third hit, which applies to Bleed and your Attack hit. 3. The new Rage support improves your Attack hit Damage, and your Bleed Damage. &amp;#x200B; So how do we make good decisions about where to invest? Goals * Minimal direct investment in Bleed * Make choices that improve both Bleed and hit Damage * Apply one Bleed at least as often as the duration of Bleed, without overinvesting in this * Apply Bleeds from Attacks where the source damage is highest (third Attack from Multistrike/Ruthless) &amp;#x200B; Gem links 1. Lacerate 2. Multistrike 3. Ruthless 4. Brutality 5. Melee Physical 6. Whatever you decide is best when you get a 6L (Probably Chance to Bleed . . . ) &amp;#x200B; Passives 1. Take Crimson Dance 2. Take Bleed cluster near Crimson Dance, except the two Bleed chance nodes 3. Take Bleed cluster near Blood Magic 4. Take Bleed nodes near Marauder for Sword or Axe 5. The updated Bloodletting passive now grants 5% reduced damage taken from Bleeding enemies, which makes it a good choice defensively. &amp;#x200B; Specific Gear You could wear Haemophilia. If you do you need 4 Attacks per second. If you don't, you need &gt;3.4 Attacks per second (with 90% Bleed chance) or 3 Attacks per second (with 100% Bleed chance). &amp;#x200B; Attack Speed, Temp Chains, and Bleed Duration * You need to apply 8 Bleeds from your 3rd hits at least as frequently as your bleed duration. If you wear Haemophilia, that's 4 Attacks per second. If you don't wear Haemophilia, it's 3 Attacks per second. * Temp Chains just changes how much Attack Speed you need. It's not very good unless your uptime on attacking is very low, or you want to make this work with really low Bleed Chance (like 75%) * War Banner, Flesh and Stone, Maim Support, Pride, and Vulnerability curse increase both your hit damage, and your bleed damage, so they synergize well with this setup."

On betrayal I've started to really like the game and in that league I probably invested more time than all other leagues summed up. I've always followed build guides but this season I decided try my own build, using Dominating Blow and Herald of Purity on a Champion (I know some/most people are gonna hate me now) to use the cannot evade/taunt thing. I've done Red Elder and Shaper with fair ease and didn't try Uber Elder yet, but I feel like Uber Elder is gonna be a problem damage and survivability wise. Some explanation about the build: * Minions: * Dominating Blow linked to Melee Phys and Melee Splash on a weapon with +2 Level of Socket melee gems, Multistrike and Ruthless. * Herald of Purity linked to Minion Damage and Empower on a Magna Eclipsis, granting up to +7 levels to Herald of Purity. * Holy Relic on a +3 Level to socketed minion gems + Minion Damage helmet, linked to Blind, Culling Strike and Controlled Destruction for AoE clear and finishing bosses. * Raise Spectres with Blood Magic for the Carnage Chieftain frenzy charge spam. They are linked to fortify, but I'm not sure they are affected by it. * Auras: * Vulnerability with Blasphemy with no reserved mana because of Impresence amulet. * Hatred with Generosity while having Elemental Equilibrium. * Dread Banner. * Vaal Haste, using only the vaal skill to buff for 4 seconds. * Defences/Sustain: * 7K HP. * Lots of armour. * Blind on enemies. * Taunt damage reduction from ascendancy. * Fortify on shield charge. * Some Life on Hit. * Some life leech. * Some Life Regen from self and from Holy Relic. * Dread Banner's enemy accuracy reduction and fortify effect. * Basalt flask. * Immortal call with CWDT Main problems I'm having right now: * Spectres survive Red Elder but are insta dead on Shaper. Would love to have the possibility to give them endurance charges, but from what I've searched that's impossible (unless I use Umbilicus Immortalis + Doedre's Elixir and I really don't want to do that). * DPS isn't as high as I expected. * Not as tanky as expeted. This only confirms my lack of game knowledge and that's why I'm coming here for help. I'm thinking I can use a second unset ring and have Enduring Cry on it for endurance charge generation but maybe you have better suggestions. Also, I'm kinda lost on where to get more damage..."

152,vulnerability,pathofexile,Farrul's Pounce Bleed Archer (Long Post),38,bg3zqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/bg3zqs/farruls_pounce_bleed_archer_long_post/,2019-04-23 02:18:25,"**TLDR**: Expensive Farrul's Fur + Farrul's Pounce / Crit Based / Bleed Archer / Max-Block Gladiator. Also Sry no video. **PoB**: [URL (The Red Dream and Lioneye's Vision don't work for some reason in PoB, manually added block chance to first) &amp;#x200B; **Intro**: This build was really run to craft and level (and expensive), and less fun to grind levels at the end (partly because I'm mostly done with the league). The Setup is with Puncture and the puncture duration enchant this helps us have long bleeds even after the ""bleeding you inflict deals damage % faster"" mod on watcher's eye and bow implicit. The long bleeds are important for Farrul's Pounce. &amp;#x200B; **Build Focal Point** \- **Farrul's Pounce**: These gloves have an interesting interaction and also some nice up-sides. 3 passive points saved (don't allocate Crimson Dance). LOTS of flat accuracy (easier crit scaling). Bleed damage and Crimson Dance during Cat's Stealth. I wrote a simulator to calculate bleed damage and even added weighted values for the rotating Crimson Dance notable. This simulator is still lacking a more accurate simulation of the Aspect of the Cat rotations, but still gave me a good weighted idea of the actual damage. At the end of the day, you get the best and worst of both worlds with the rotating Crimson Dance. Sometimes one 70% bleed and movement bonus will insta-start a chain bleed-splosion. Other times, one 70% bleed with no movement bonus feels really crappy. Other times, Crimson dance (35% bleeds) is active and that is normal, just need to stack many bleeds. Finally the best case scenario (longer fights) is when you've been stacking 8+ 70% bleeds During Cat's Agility and Aspect of the Cat swaps to Cat's Stealth. Then the top 8 bleeds are all 70% from the previous phase, the damage goes through the roof (560% compared to 280% Crimson dance). Now keep in mind that **best-case** this is only half the time and only works well if your bleed duration is fairly long. Hence using Puncture and helm duration enchant. That way I could get my 70% bleeds to bleed as long as possible during the next Cat phase. I wouldn't say that Farrul's Pounce isn't overpowered, if anything the damage averages out to be about the same as just going Crimson Dance. **But** it is good boss damage and enables crit builds with the high accuracy. I also picked up a Farrul's Pounce with Vulnerabilty on Hit for fairly cheap, so that was a large boon to the build. &amp;#x200B; **Crit Based**: I felt like I needed to go crit because I was already getting accuracy from Farrul's Pounce and Power Charges from Farrul's Fur. The Fur also lengthens Cat's Stealth which is very nice for this setup. Also, there are limited ways to scale bleed damage so crit was a good option even though you can't scale the crit multi without a garbage tree notable (Perfect Agony - not worth it from my point of view). &amp;#x200B; **Bleed Archer**: I just wanted to do it, especially after I crafted a very nice bow: [URL (also kind of sad, I just sold it since I got offered a nice price) &amp;#x200B; **Siege Ballista**: On top of my main clear setup, I use siege ballista for the single target damage because of how hard it hits. The siege ballista bleeds were a very nice complement for boss damage. Note: the totem without investment has small life and may not reliably always hit the desired target. Pro: a 21/0 gem is cheap, at least when I bought. &amp;#x200B; **Max Block**: Because I wanted my build to be semi-unique/hipster I incorporated getting my block and spell block up to 78%. This is done using ""The Red Nightmare"" and allocating all the fire resist nodes over by the Marauder starting spot for 13% block chance. I also used the ""RearGuard"" quiver for high block % and the corrupt implicit +1 chain (rare and expensive implicit, but freed up a support gem for my main clear skill). Also used a ""Rumi's Concoction"" and 8% of my block was conditional to having been hit recently (From ascendancy / also available on jewels). I also got 2% attack block synthesis implicits on boots and helmet but didn't end up using the helmet in favor of a Devotos (yay movespeed) that had my desired enchant. I did use the boots once I crafted something usable. And finally I paid many exalts for a corrupted ""The Anvil"" that had +5 Attack block as the corruption implicit. Max block felt amazing, but also was semi-reliant on my flask so felt bad during longer boss fights. &amp;#x200B; **The Struggles**: Because I invested so heavily into max block, my life pool and damage suffered quite a bit. I imagine it would be more effective (and cheaper!) to not try and hit max block and just gear in another defensive layer (or just more life) and more damage. It would free up a lot of Passives and you could grab pierce over by the Ranger area. You could use a different quiver/amulet for more life/dmg. Another thing was that I was Unique Heavy at the end. So my rings were mostly to fill out resits, and I needed resists in the tree. Also, the map modifier that gives all mobs a chance to avoid bleeding is very annoying. Phys damage reduction mod not as annoying. &amp;#x200B; **Endgame**: I cleared all guardians a few times (mostly deathless). I killed shaper, the damage was very good and I died once to a slam (user error). I killed two 83 Nexus bosses, but don't remember the modifiers but was mostly fast and smooth. I didn't get around to spawning Uber Elder, but in my experience I think my damage is enough at this point as long as you know the fight well enough to not die too much. I imagine I could do it, but not deathless. (also there is a video of a TS Bleed Archer doing it a couple weeks ago, so at the least you can follow his guide if needed) &amp;#x200B; **Other important pieces for Bleed scaling**: Ryslatha's Coil, Malevolence + Watcher's Eye, War banner, Herald of Purity (can get the new unique ring for LOTS of phys damage, but I needed my resist rings), vulnerability on hit. Synthesis Bleed bow or Elder Bow with Vicious Projectiles. &amp;#x200B; **The Rest of the Build**: I think I touched on most of the important topics, everything else can be seen if you are interested to look through the PoB. &amp;#x200B; **Meta Question**: Why you no *tOrNaDo sHoT*? Doesn't really fit into what I wanted. I wanted really long bleeds for bleeds lasting through the aspect changes and having the +1 chain on my quiver helped my clear and bleed stacking without sacrificing damage and trying to get a TS helm enchant. &amp;#x200B; **Final Note**: If people want to see my bleed simulator, I can upload the script to Github or something. I started off using someone else's python script but added lots of code to show actual damage (instead of a PoB offset number) and added support to put in a main skill and a totem skill attacking together. I originally planned on making the simulator very sophisticated making each simulation run start at a random time within one of the aspect phases. Then I would also track each bleed if it was a 35% or 70%, but I don't know if I'll get to it now."
153,vulnerability,pathofexile,Synthesis Mod Values Listed on Resource Sites Not Giving Me Expected Results. Why?,1,bidazx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/bidazx/synthesis_mod_values_listed_on_resource_sites_not/,2019-04-29 02:56:26,"The title. I've been crafting some things recently, such as gloves with phys and accuracy, and while using [URL and PoEDB I found the ""Max"" values listed couldn't be relied on to predict Synthesized Implicit tiers, at least not for ranged values like added damage to attacks. For example, I crafted these gloves which had Physical Damage to Attacks on them. (In case there's any confusion about Fractured mod values which are a range, they have to be a straight add of the damage. It can't be the average damage, because the total average damage you could get calculating that way would be 24, making higher crafts impossible). Both sites list 28 Physical Damage to Attacks as the maximum value to get 13-14% Global Physical Damage. Anything above that could get you ""(15 to 16)% increased Global Physical Damage"", ""(6 to 10)% chance to Impale Enemies on Hit with Attacks"", or ""Curse Enemies with Level 8 Vulnerability on Hit "". I was aiming for one of the latter two, but knew I could end up with 15-16% phys instead. It was a calculated risk. The total Physical Damage I had was more 28. But instead of 15-16% Global Phys, I got a 14% mod. If the resource sites are accurate, how is this possible? And if they aren't accurate, why hasn't it been mentioned before? If someone can figure out I got something wrong, I'll gladly stand corrected. I just want to know how much I need for crafting. Either way, this sort of confusion is another reason why crafting with this system is so terrible. Any error in reading back-end information results in frustration, as well as wasted time, energy, and ""money"". TLDR: Crafting Global Phys gloves with mod resource sites got me a lower result than sites predict. Am I wrong or are they wrong, and why?"

When her body finally washed ashore, it looked as though it had been mummified for a thousand years. The fish did not touch her flesh. **B:** She was perfectly preserved, but drained of her blood. We buried her, but within days the earth rejected her. Whatever killed her took root in that place. The earth soured and we had to move, abandoning her body. **Cavas:** This memory seems ancient. I do not believe this was mine, and I hope I never learn more of it. **Zana:** Hmm, this memory seems too ancient to have belonged to Venarius. --- **CavasAcidCave** **A:** Why won't you let me leave? I found you so many yellow rocks... this pick is getting dull, and I'm so tired... **B:** I can't... get up... stop hurting me... **C:** Oh dear. I don't know whose memory this was, but they were far too young for such cruelty. Sometimes, Exile, mankind makes me weep. Who could create such an inhuman system of exploitation, and for what purpose? --- **Archives** **A:** I used to pride myself on taking care of these tomes, but the ancient treatises concerning the Vaal... should be burned. He's making me research for him, and the things I am reading about concern the destruction of all mankind. **B:** I would think my fears of the end of the world ridiculous... except... it's happened before. I must run... I must flee... and take my secrets with me. **Cavas:** Exile, was this me? I'm no master of the spoken or written word, so I don't think I was a scholar. **Zana:** I've never met him directly, but I think I know whose memory this was. It's someone Helena talks about: Eramir. I believe he lives with the Azmeri now. --- **AshenWood** **A:** I awake to the sound of screaming. My eyes and throat sting. Smoke billows into the hut from outside. Something is terribly wrong. I dash outside and am confronted by a wall of heat. Smoke makes it difficult to see, but the village is in flames. **B:** I run from the smoke and, to my horror, realise we are trapped. A rival tribe stands at the only exit, cutting my brothers and sisters down as they flee. We've been ambushed. I run towards the flames and leap, praying to Valako for protection. **Cavas:** Oh dear, such violence and hate... I wonder why the tribes were at war. It's clear this is not something I ever experienced, at least. **Zana:** What devious maliciousness. War truly brings out the worst in people, doesn't it. It's clear to me this belongs to some unfortunate Karui. --- **Bazaar** **A:** I see you. You are here seeking answers, because you can find them only in the stories we will leave behind when Malachai and Voll cause our destruction. In this final hour, I entertain the notion that the words I write exist in some form beyond me. Do they go on as dreams? As memories? **B:** I have the wildest notion that perhaps you will find a way to pick up scraps of memory, and you, whoever you are, will come across this one someday. If you do, I ask only this: slay Malachai. Slay him for yourself, or slay him for all the lost citizens of the Empire, but, most of all, slay him for Marylene. **Cavas:** Oh, Exile, though I am a mere shade with only figments of memory, I can say with certainty that no man has ever felt the nuances of rage and love so strongly. His was the strongest memory I have ever felt, an imprint of his entire essence. His name... was Victario. **Zana:** That was exhilarating, Exile! Like truly seeing the mind and heart of another person, living and breathing right here with me. Why was his memory so intense? I can still feel Victario, as if he has just left the room only now. --- **Beach** **A:** You and I, we're the only ones that made it to shore... alive, anyway. This place is crawling with criminals. Find something you can defend yourself with. **B:** That'll do for now. I thought I saw some smoke rising just north of here. Could be worth checking if there's **Cavas:** I saw you through someone else's eyes, Exile! That was a memory from someone that knew you! He was relieved to see you. Were you close? **Zana:** Ugh, my neck feels stiff. Was that you, Exile? You were in that memory, though looking a little worse for wear! --- **Belly** **A:** I take no pleasure in this. It simply must be done. Humanity's purpose has been fulfilled... in me. Within this sanctum of flesh lay the tools I shall use to reshape the world. **B:** With this act, I sweep away the trappings of mortality, and bring about a new age. A world of Thaumaturgy, and I, its ruler. Farewell, my Gemling Queen... **Cavas:** Who was that, Exile? I felt such drive and focus. Nothing mattered but my one goal. It was... terrifying. **Zana:** Ugh, I am left sickened and dirtied by the vile thoughts of someone intensely self-absorbed. Was that... Malachai? The monster who brought about the Cataclysm? Did I just relive that moment? --- **CavasCave** **A:** It's him! He sails back to me, my Daresso! I shall sing for him. I shall show him the way. **B:** It's my Daresso! He sails back to me! I shall sing for him, and show him the way. **C:** The last vestiges of human thought in a woman consumed by madness... she saw her beloved in every passing ship, and sang to them all, never realizing their true fates. --- **ZanaAcidCave** **A:** Breaking rocks to mine voltaxic sulphite... but I'm so small... **B:** Such pain... such despair... I'm going to die down here, and I never even had the chance to know what life was. **C:** Monsters... To use a child like that... The Eternal Empire was truly cruel. --- **ZanaCave** **A:** It's him! He sails back to me, my Daresso! I shall sing for him. I shall show him the way. Come, my love. Come to me. We shall be together at last. **B:** No, turn away! Don't listen to my singing, you'll die upon the rocks! Turn away...! Turn away... Turn away... **C:** Was that Merveil? That poor woman. Somewhere within her monstrous form lived the woman she once was. What a terrible curse. --- **Chambers** **A:** The Courts are burning. Accusations fly. Sinner! Heretic! I am but an initiate, and my patron urges silence. We will keep our heads down while one High Templar supplants another. It's all about power, my patron whispers, and we have none. **B:** Should an accusation fall our way, we shall be doomed to die with the other accused. Be unseen and unheard, he whispers. This is what happens when men who seek power refuse to wait. I learned a valuable lesson that day: Trust without leverage is vulnerability. **Cavas:** Oh, Exile, I was caught up in the memory. It felt so familiar. Was it one of mine? **Zana:** Exile! That was the moment Venarius decided to seize life and vie for power. That was the moment doom for men like my father was assured. --- **Fissure** **A:** Master's orders were clear; I am to wait here until his return. I cast my eyes to the horizon and see smoke billowing from Sarn. The city burns, and I fear my master burns with it. **B:** The sky grows red. I hear screaming from the village by the Crossroads, but I will not abandon my post. Master will return, and I will await him. No matter how long, I will wait for Maligaro's return... **Cavas:** Maligaro... that name rings a bell... was it mine? No... this memory feels too old. **Zana:** A memory from someone close to the Inquisitor. How exciting! I bet there are many historians who would be interested in such a find. --- **Forest** **A:** Another child was taken last night, so tonight we wait, praying the demon does not return, but it does. It soars through the air and passes through the wall of the hut. We catch only a glimpse of its grey skin beneath the moonlight. We pursue the demon on foot to the edge of the woods. The child it carries does not cry out. **B:** Anaris follows closely, but I hesitate out of fear. I gather my will and I leap into the shadows, tracking the demon by the tendrils left in its wake. But I am too late. The demon and child are gone, and Anaris stands frozen, pale as the moon. He whispers something I do not understand and falls, dead. I fear we will be hunted to extinction. **Cavas:** Can such a horrible tale be true? I pray not. It is no memory of mine, of that I am certain. **Zana:** Could it be...? Exile, this sounds just like the entity hunting my father. But... the memory is so old. How is this possible? --- **Garden** **A:** A man in uniform visits. He is from the Courts. He says the Templar have alms for widows like my mother, but she must collect it in person. We go to the church together, and I wait outside in the gardens. The sun is setting. I don't know how long I've been sitting here. **B:** Mother comes from around the rear. She looks pale. Her eyes are red, and her clothes are torn. She doesn't look at me but she grabs my hand. We walk home in silence. I lay awake in bed. I hear her crying. The man comes over often after that, with toys and food, but I don't like him... **Cavas:** Oh, I remember this... Mother was never the same after that day. I wish I had understood at the time... I might have been able to do something. **Zana:** I think... I think this is a memory from Venarius. How horrible. Why would he want to join an organisation like this? --- **MushCave** **A:** Help! Please, somebody, help me! I've fallen down here! I think I've hurt my leg! Hello?!... Stay calm. I'm sure someone will come soon. I'm so hungry... If I get desperate, maybe I can eat some of the mushrooms down here. **B:** I feel strange. My head feels like it is filled with bubbles. Are the walls breathing? The colours here are so vibrant... oh... My stomach... I'm ill. The world is spinning and, oh, my gut! What did I eat? I feel **Cavas:** Wow... Exile... that was a very strange memory. Certainly not my own. **Zana:** Well, I'm not sure whose memory that was, but it's safe to say you shouldn't eat mushrooms you don't know. --- **Dungeon** **A:** Ha! Lioneye's failure against Kaom comes as no surprise. He was always more arrogant than skilled. It is time a real man showed the Karui the might of the Eternal Empire. **B:** Shavronne assures me that my process will be relatively painless, and that my duties as warden can continue unhindered, but as my flesh swells and ruptures, I realise I am just another test subject. At least I can fulfill my duties to the Empire before my mind **Cavas:** Ohh, such might, Exile. I felt so strong, yet I felt I was losing control. Another memory that felt too ancient to be mine, however. **Zana:** I felt so... so strong! Yet I couldn't shake the feeling I was at my breaking point. What a terrible sensation! Was that the Warden of Axiom? --- **Park** **A:** People stream down the street towards Oriath Square. I hear their shouts and cheers, and when my mother isn't looking, sneak out to join the merry crowd. Just outside the pens, a Karui boy, no older than I, stands atop the gallows. **B:** I see by the sign around his neck he has been caught stealing. I swear I will not look away, but fear overtakes me. I hear the rope snap taut and the crowd cheer, but I fight back the tears... **Cavas:** I remember this well, Exile. I remember hearing that snap in my dreams for many years. **Zana:** Was that Venarius as a child? I think perhaps it was... society has not changed much since he was young. --- **ZanaPier** **A:** Out of sight, out of mind. No one speaks of the cursed land anymore. That has made it quite simple to send our smugglers out in search of powerful Eternal artifacts. **B:** We knew of the gems, but we did not know of what Malachai called his 'muse.' The smugglers have returned with rubbings of the device they found. They call it 'miraculous.' I know a thing or two about miracles, so I will be the judge of that. **C:** This was almost certainly one of the High Templar's memories. In fact, I think this was not long before he spoke to my father! --- **ZanaPier2** **A:** The stench convenes around me thicker than the press of the vagabonds themselves. Though starving, their strength while holding on to one another is surprising. I am trapped in a knot of ragged bodies, and the men of the Church clap me in irons despite my cries. **B:** I am not one of them! Can't you hear me? I'm not Maraketh, nor homeless, and I have committed no sins. That ship is not for me! Why won't you listen?! **C:** A young Venarius, innocent and helpless. If only he'd stayed that way. It never ceases to amaze me how much a person can change over their lifetime. --- **Prison** **A:** The shackles cut into my wrists and ankles. The guards are deaf to my pleading, but I am no murderer. If I am guilty of anything, it is falling in love with the wrong person. Ugh! Justice served, they claim. **B:** This is not justice. Any chance of justice evaporated the moment I walked into the courtroom and saw her husband held the gavel. I'm just the scapegoat. It's easy to get away with murder when you're the judge. **Cavas:** How horrid! Are all people as corrupt, Exile? Thankfully I'm certain this was not me. **Zana:** The most upsetting thing about this memory is how unsurprising it is. It's hard to tell whose memory this was. Certainly not Venarius, but I wouldn't be shocked to hear he was the judge. --- **Quarry** **A:** I strike the earth once more as I have countless times, but my strike feels unfamiliar. Instead of the crack of stone, I am met with flexing sinew. I examine my pick axe. A dark red liquid froths on its tip. **B:** The metal beneath rapidly corrodes. Have I found it at last? I run to alert the General. I'm told not to speak of what I found. The other slaves must continue to dig, but I am set free. **Cavas:** I don't think I was ever a slave. What did they find, I wonder? **Zana:** This must have been one of the Eternal slaves... an Ezomyte, maybe. But sinew beneath stone? What could that be? --- **Antiquary** **A:** Indexing artifact one-twelve in lot ten, an ancient jawbone. Carvings on the side attribute it to... Valako? This can't actually be the jawbone from the myth... and this... Tukohama's tooth? Hinekora's hair? **B:** These were in the archives for centuries. Are these what those thieves were after? Who would want these relics except for... followers of Kitava? But that's absurd... best not to mention the robbery attempt. **Cavas:** Exile, I think a historian somewhere made a grave mistake by keeping quiet. **Zana:** A single decision made out of fear had such grave consequences. I wonder, if that researcher had spoken up, could the cult of Kitava have been stopped before ravaging Oriath? --- **Baths** **A:** Sometimes, we in the Brotherhood don't need to harm anyone at all. We surround Drusus in the Baths. He has a family, and that means he's vulnerable. **B:** He doesn't even protest. He knows what this is. Wordlessly, he backs into the baths and sinks to the bottom. All that remains are the bubbles of his last breath. **Cavas:** I find myself less perturbed by that memory than I should be. It was almost... peaceful. What does that say about me? **Zana:** You know what I find most disturbing about this memory, Exile? None of the bystanders so much as lifted a finger to help poor Drusus. --- **CaveMine** **A:** These shiny baubles we pull out of the rock are worth more than their weight in gold, yet we hardly get paid at all! We should stop work and demand our fair share. **B:** Don't worry! They're just sealing the entrance as a way to intimidate us! They wouldn't dare leave a thousand men down here just to die. **Cavas:** It seems the Empire was harsher than even its citizens knew. I doubt their bodies were ever found. **Zana:** Human beings seem to believe the world has an inherent decency. It cost those men their lives. --- **ZanaChambers2** **A:** The defendant is accused of Unlawful Avarice, Pecuniary Sloth, two counts of resisting Templar authority, Civil Envy, and one count of pandering. **B:** You have been found guilty by the power of the Court, and will hereby be exiled to Wraeclast as penance for your sins. **C:** You know all too well how little true justice the Templar meted out. I hope you at least got to argue your case. --- **Crypt** **A:** He wasn't a pious man, and certainly had a gambling problem, but he didn't deserve to end up like this. I feel like somebody should say something as we cover his tomb, but nobody does. **B:** The others begin to file away while I linger by the tomb a moment. A muffled banging sounds from within, and I consider rushing to get help... but then I remember, and leave without another word. **Cavas:** Exile... the sensation... that man recalled another memory while I was in his memory... but I couldn't see that one! Why did he leave, I wonder? **Zana:** I wish I could tell you what he remembered, Exile. It seems these memories have their limits. --- **DarkForest** **A:** Farrul, lend us your eyes, that we may see past the darkness in our hearts. Fenumus, lend us your web, that we may bind our tribes together. **B:** Craiceann, lend us your shell, that we may hold out against our oppressors. Saqawal, lend us your feathers, that we may be carried to a better future. We call out in your name! **Cavas:** Hmm... a ritual of some sort. I do not recognise the names, though they sound Ezomyte to my ear. Silly superstitions, if you ask me. **Zana:** So that's what faith feels like... I'm no stranger to religion, but I never truly believed what the Templars taught us. I just had a brief glimpse into a life without doubt. I must say, I understand the allure. --- **Fields** **A:** I come here on sunny days to get away from the squalor of the streets and alleyways around my home. It's not the cutpurses that bother me. It's the city guard. Even so, a legionnaire approaches me and asks me my intent in the fields. **B:** I do not answer him, instead shaking my head and holding a finger over my lips. Better to act mute than risk being clapped in irons for the sin of being born Ezomyte. **Cavas:** Thank the Gods I'm no Ezomyte, Exile. I'd not stand for such treatment. **Zana:** It's hard to believe, but the Eternals of Sarn back then were even more rotten than the people of Oriath today. Sometimes I wonder if the Empire was doomed with or without the Cataclysm. --- **Glacier** **A:** Rami waits at the cavern entrance for the passing aspirants. One at a time he pulls them in from the snowstorm and covers their mouth as I slice their throats. Blood stains the cavern floor. **B:** Rami pulls in the last straggler and we make quick work of her. Just we two remain. Before Rami makes this realisation I plunge my blade into his eye. I alone will lead the Mutewind. **Cavas:** What a barbaric memory. Were all Mutewind this vicious? I certainly hope I was not one of them. **Zana:** That was quite a brutal memory. You know, I'd never dare ask her, but is Jun Mutewind? --- **GraveYard** **A:** As I kneel over her grave, the night sky joins my tears. The earth becomes scattershot, stained by sputtering torchlight. She reaches out to me, and I smile... **B:** ...until I see other lost loved ones reaching up through dirt. The rain smells like leather-grease, and my torch goes out as the first of the dead breaks free. **Cavas:** Why is Wraeclast beset by such evils? My friend, we must find a way to protect the people. **Zana:** Gods, the terror that gripped him in those final moments. I hope I never feel that again! --- **Haunt** **A:** I know I have no voice as a servant, but there is something deeply troubling here. This manor holds a dreadful presence which permeates the very air. **B:** When they find the third dead and disemboweled maid, I speak up, but the master of the household doesn't listen. He refuses to even look at me. It is then that I realise... I am already dead... **Cavas:** Quite the twist on that memory, Exile, but I was never a servant, nor a manor-bound spirit. At least, as far as I know... **Zana:** Exile, how does a ghost form memories without a brain? It seems there's much more left to discover in this world. --- **Iceberg** **A:** Nineteen more days in the mountains... I'll never survive, never earn my Mutewind name... I'm already starving and dying after ten... and is that... a wolf?! **B:** Kindest friend, kindred wolf. You kept me warm for nineteen days. I will return one day, when I am old, and let your descendants feast upon my remains. **Cavas:** Exile! I felt a wolf's fur... whose life was that? So very different from what I expected! **Zana:** I never knew barren mountains could be so beautiful. --- **Library** **A:** I move through the stacks, seeking that one perfect moment from my youth. I once read a book here, its name lost to me, that perfectly struck the chords of my heart. **B:** It was as if that book was written for me, and yet, I cannot find it now. There are more tomes here than I could ever pick up and check in an entire lifetime. **Cavas:** The words of the story he read were... so poignant... and yet they escape me, like sand blown from the ridge of a dune. **Zana:** So many books have been destroyed by Wraeclast's troubles through the years. I hope one day I can help rebuild Oriath's libraries with new knowledge. --- **Lunaris** **A:** I don't know much longer I can do this. Every day, we cart in the poor folk the General has rounded up for the Witch's experiments. I used to count, but I stopped at two thousand. **B:** This is not the career the Blackguards promised me. We're worse than monsters. Look at this place! Rivers of blood! Piles of corpses! We were just following orders... **Cavas:** We were just following orders. Hollow words. He didn't believe his own absolution. **Zana:** Just following orders... spineless little--! How many lives were lost because someone wouldn't stand up for what's right? Wouldn't think for themselves? --- **Mineshaft** **A:** We're trapped down here. Though we strike it again and again, the Sekhema's seal remains unharmed. No one down here can sleep. My throat is parched, yet I feel no thirst. **B:** The foreman is beginning to show signs of madness. He claims the walls, earth, and even his pick have become sticky as honey. I pray death comes for us soon, but I fear we will receive something far worse. **Cavas:** Some of these events have the ring of familiarity, yet I cannot place myself in this one. I suspect it is simply too old to be mine. **Zana:** It seems the mines of Highgate were sealed before everyone could be evacuated... what a terrible fate... --- **MoonTemple** **A:** Lunaris, help me find calm. Help me find peace. Help me silence those who trouble me! **B:** Lunaris, help me destroy my enemies! Help me take what is rightfully mine! **Cavas:** Such a strange evolution of beliefs... that is most assuredly not my memory. I know I was a man of conviction. **Zana:** Somewhere in history, the old religions lost their way. Or perhaps this is the journey every religion takes eventually... --- **Oasis** **A:** I cannot escape the feeling that I am being cooked by the sun in a cauldron made of sand. As I dream of water, walking, dying, I see it: an oasis. **B:** I slake my thirst with chill liquid that sparkles in the sun. I dunk my head, then lie down, exhausted and exhilarated. Today, I get to live. **Cavas:** Even if I could remember my life, Exile, I am certain no single drink would ever have tasted so good. **Zana:** At long last, a memory that didn't make me want to curl up into a ball and weep! --- **Rooftop** **A:** The last three weeks feel like they've passed in an instant. The atmosphere here since the High Templar's disappearance has been so relaxed, but, while enjoying the sun on my roof this morning, I saw the black smoke billowing from the Chamber of Innocence turn red. **B:** The Seneschals have at last elected a new High Templar. Rumour has it they've sought young blood. Someone who can revitalise the Templar. Someone who can bring them into the modern age. Whoever it is, he can't be worse than the last one. Bastard set us back fifty years! **Cavas:** A changing of the guard? I don't think this was me, but it feels strangely familiar. **Zana:** That was Dominus' ascension to power. I remember seeing the smoke from the orphanage... it was so soon after my father's disappearance. --- **Sanctuary** **A:** What is it? You know I am not to be disturbed during my communion with God-- it's here? Well get it to the lab immediately, and do not disturb me again, lest I take your head! **B:** I feel a rush of excitement as I review the contents of the crate. The pieces, aged as they are, still hum with energy. I can feel its potential, and it fills me with hope and terror. I cannot assemble it, but I know who can. I need only apply a little pressure... **Cavas:** How curious... this feels familiar to me. What was inside the box? Perhaps another memory will tell us. **Zana:** Exile, who was that? How did he come to have pieces of the map device? Were they then delivered to my father? --- **Scepter** **A:** I am so very late. This is deeply embarrassing. I fear the wait will be too long now. But this is the one chance I get to meet the great Laureate and I will not let it go to waste! **B:** Malachai says he has perfected new techniques that will unlock the raw power hidden within the Virtue Gems. I have volunteered my body to the cause. I feel no fear, no hunger, no pleasure... nothing. I only hear his voice. I must obey... **Cavas:** Exile, what a horrible moment I just experienced. I feel for whoever this memory belonged to. I'm glad it was not mine. **Zana:** Ugh, I feel disgusting after that. Even within that memory I could feel Malachai's presence wrapping around my mind like grasping little fingers. --- **Sewers** **A:** We walk in absolute silence through the murk. It's after midnight, but the streets above are still abuzz with activity. Hours pass before the streets fall silent. We emerge one by one into a pitch-black room. **B:** As I help our last out of the sewers, a flint is struck, and we are surrounded by light and gleaming imperial armour. There's a dagger at my throat. A setup! Dragged into a cell, the guards laughing. I still reek of the sewers... **Cavas:** Did I lead a life of crime? I don't think so... I expect this story did not end well. The Empire was not too kind to thieves. **Zana:** There are times, Exile, when I wish those memories weren't so vivid. Sometimes I don't need to know what a memory smells like. --- **Solaris** **A:** Tonight is a celebration. On this, the night of a Thousand Ribbons, we honour Emperor Chitus for his heroic defense of our beloved capital. Long may he reign! **B:** I feel fear... and hatred. The Emperor stands before me, and I know this is my chance. I strike at him. I pierce his belly, but it is not immediately lethal. I lock eyes with the man. I watch him raise his axe... **Cavas:** He killed me. Exile! That Emperor Chitus, he cut me in half...! No, not me. I am no backstabber. I would have faced him head-on. **Zana:** I felt my body split into two. Agony! That's the last thing I remember. This memory must have belonged to Ondar, the Betrayer. For some reason, I always thought that was a myth... but apparently not. --- **SpiderForest** **A:** I'm a fool to have gotten lost here, but it was getting dark, and I thought I saw a way home. A crowd stands silently around me, their faces blank white, their bodies covered in webs. **B:** The crowd begins to shiver and shake as I creep between their bound hands. Some moan for help. Others scream. As their bodies bubble, I realise I cannot help them. Tiny spiders pour out of open wounds. **Cavas:** Oh, no! I can still feel them crawling on me! **Zana:** Exile, if you ever find me trapped in webbing like that... put me out of my misery. --- **SwampBog** **A:** Beneath the summer sun we follow Tarcus in search of the promised land. Before long, hunger grips our stomachs. The doomlands take their toll. Our numbers dwindle, and discord spreads amongst the tribesmen. **B:** Veruso's words quell our hearts, but not our stomachs. In the dead of night, a woman goes missing, and our hunger is abated. We reach the ruins of Azala Vaal alive, but dark deeds hide in our bellies. **Cavas:** Exile, this terrible memory is far too old to have been mine. Let's keep looking. **Zana:** How horrible... the founders of Sarn! Not such a promising start. --- **Thicket** **A:** He told me to meet him out here at midnight. Well, it's midnight and he isn't here, and I can hear wolves nearby. He better hurry up or I'm leaving. **B:** That's it. I'm out of here. Now which way did I come from? Was it this way? No. Must have been this way. Hmm... this doesn't look familiar either. None of this looks familiar, and I think I hear the wolves coming closer... **Cavas:** Oh dear, what a frightful situation. I don't think I did much midnight hiking, Exile. **Zana:** Huh... I've never felt lost like that before... I didn't care for it. I think I prefer knowing exactly where I stand. --- **Causeway** **A:** We pack up our camp just before sunrise and journey towards the capital, Azala Vaal. We hear the crowd before we see them. Word of our victory spread quickly, and even the Queen has come to meet us. **B:** My family has come to watch the ceremony. As I lay on the stone altar, I hear them chanting my name. It's the last thing I hear before the Queen's dagger is plunged into my chest. **Cavas:** I could almost feel the blade. What a chilling moment from a terrible time in history. Far older than I, I'm afraid. **Zana:** I saw her, Exile... I saw the Queen of the Vaal! She had such a terrible presence... --- **DriedLake** **A:** Six moons have passed since the earth supped the rain. The riverbed is dry, and the lake is but a puddle. The beasts here have become desperate and dangerous. **B:** There are rumours that Lord Yriel's blood-fed crops have swelled, but the fruit they bear can send a man mad. We look to our children for the answer. A child cannot hunt, but it can still provide. The taste is hard to forget. **Cavas:** Exile... this is a memory I would rather not have experienced. How nauseating. **Zana:** They ate-- Gods, Exile...! I feel sick to my stomach. --- **Cells** **A:** You can't just keep me locked up! I have rights you know! I deserve a fair trial! Hey! You hear me!? **B:** Hello?! Guard!? I smell smoke! Get me out of here-- please! Don't just leave me to die! Someone please help! Please! **Cavas:** I fear that man never again saw the light of day. I'm so grateful I was never incarcerated. **Zana:** After everything that has happened, this one hits too close to home. --- **ZanaLushBeachCliff / LushCrater** **A:** I don't understand. I saw Bryn die. I held him. The fever that took him was so intense... I remember the moment his body went cold. But now he lives once more. **B:** Yet it is not truly him. I know that. A mother knows her son and this creature is not my son. It is a hollow imposter. My son's spirit is with Innocence. So I go to him at last. **Cavas:** If I still possessed a heart, it would now be broken. We are no strangers to the returning dead, but this was not my memory. **Zana:** She lept, Exile. I felt her fall... What terrible anguish she felt... --- **Ridge** **A:** Everyone is dead and I am alone. The Karui swept through the watch so quickly, we didn't have a chance to flee. Men, women, even children, slaughtered. I'm lucky to be alive. But I cannot return home now. No. **B:** I'd be branded a coward, imprisoned, and hung for desertion. I have no choice. I must make do out in the wilds. Perhaps a farmer will take pity on me. And if not, I have my blade. I will take what I need by force. **Cavas:** What a ghastly man. I pray it was not me. **Zana:** It's hard to feel pity for a man like that, desperate as he was. --- **PoolsAndStreams** **A:** My legs ache, but at last they can rest. We are two days journey from the nearest city, and the trickle of water sets me at ease. I begin to set up camp. **B:** My wife bathes naked in the stream. I appreciate her form from the banks. With any luck, we will never see another person as long as we live. **Cavas:** So peaceful. I could have dwelt in that memory forever. Alas, I do not think it belongs to me. **Zana:** It's not all doom and gloom, Exile. It's worth remembering that. --- **Reef** **A:** The storm is bad now. The ship rocks to and fro. The other exiles exchange glances as a guard struggles to regain his footing. Then, we hit the rocks. **B:** When I come to, I'm alone on a tiny island. Little more than a rock, really. I can't see any other land. Even Wraeclast would've been better than this. **Cavas:** I'm certain I was never exiled, and thank the Gods. What a terrible fate... oh... oh, dear. Sorry. **Zana:** Just goes to show, even as the world around us lays in ruins, things could always be worse. --- **ForestCave** **A:** The world is changing in dark and subtle ways around us as I run. My arms burn from the weight of my young children. The sun is turning blood red, and there's only one place of safety I can imagine. **B:** The walls of the cave we huddle in tremble. The screaming outside keeps us from fleeing into the open air. Life has gone mad, and the sky is burning. The children cry out for their mother, but I haven't the heart to tell them what she became in front of my eyes. **Cavas:** Oh, my friend, these memories are sometimes too much to bear. **Zana:** How horrible... I wonder what ever happened to those children. Perhaps it's better not to know. --- **ForestCanals / Canals** **A:** The boats are the only way out of the city! Don't you understand? The sky is burning! We have to go! **B:** Everyone had the same idea. The crowded boats aren't moving at all. The others scream and wail. Everything begins to burn. I hold my son under the water and pray his death is quicker than mine. **Cavas:** Such suffering and loss in this world... sometimes I wonder if I'm better off not remembering. **Zana:** The most horrible thing is, I'm certain that parent was doing their child a mercy. --- **RuinedTemple** **A:** My grandparents worshipped here, back when it was still a place of faith. I wonder, did the gods ever hear them? **B:** I choose to believe the gods did listen, and that I am here now out of that benevolence. It is the only way I can explain surviving the troubles. **Cavas:** Was I a person of faith, Exile? I think... I might have been. At the very least, I remember the trappings of faith, though I cannot say to which God. **Zana:** Knowing what we now know about the gods, I think we can safely say benevolence was not the cause. --- **SpiderThicket** **A:** Where am I? What happened? I remember a massive spider coming at me, and then... huh, I'm stuck in webbing... **B:** My stomach is really rumbling... and it hurts... and it's bulging... and rippling... **Cavas:** After that memory, I think I'm afraid of spiders. **Zana:** Ugh, what a horrid way to die. Exile, if you ever find me in that state, you know what to do, right? --- **CitySlums / Slums** **A:** Sarn is the city of opportunity, they said. The cradle of civilisation. Pardon me if I don't feel swaddled and taken care of in this 'cradle.' **B:** It's starve or steal. I think I know which one I like better. **Cavas:** Was I poor and hungry on the streets of Sarn? I think not, exile. This memory feels foreign to me. **Zana:** With Oriath in the state it's in, I worry we're not far from tumbling down this same road. At least we can rule Venarius out of that memory. --- **Daresso / Colosseum** **A:** With one motion, I cleave a man in twain. A kick sends another flying, and the roar of the crowd swells. I am their idol! **B:** I was always meant to be at the top of the pile. Nobody else can compare. And this tiny man, this new challenger, Daresso, will fall like the rest to the might of Barkhul. **Cavas:** From the look of the carnage around that 'Daresso' person, I think that ancient gladiator was in for quite a surprise. **Zana:** Ha! We know how that ended, don't we? --- **Plateau** **A:** I've thirsted for adventure my entire life, but I suppose, at eighty-two, the most I can do now is walk along the village plateau. **B:** I dreamt of magic and adventure when I was younger. It's a shame this world isn't more exciting. **Cavas:** From what I've seen in my time with you, Exile, the owner of that memory must have been uncommonly lucky to avoid Wraeclast's dangers. Or, seemingly, unlucky. **C:** Ah, what I would give for a boring life... --- **ControlBlocks** **A:** I wear the armor of a Templar, and I walk among the guards, but I am not one of them. My soul is Kitava's to consume. **B:** The time nears. At the appointed hour, I will open the gates... all the gates. **Cavas:** I don't think I was some sort of cultist... his urge toward self-destruction was overwhelming. **Zana:** Bastard... that bastard! Do you think he knew what he was about to loose upon us? No... I can't believe anyone would knowingly do that. --- **Ossuary** **A:** Centuries of my predecessors line these walls. It is supposedly the ultimate honor to rest with them, but I have my doubts. **B:** How would anyone know which bones are mine? How would anyone know that I am even here? Because I recognise none of these remains myself... **Cavas:** I can relate to that feeling, Exile. **Zana:** Confronting one's mortality is always troubling, isn't it? I believe Venarius would not be so humble as the owner of this memory. --- **ZanaCanals** **A:** I feel very nervous. Am I sweating? I think I'm sweating. I hope she doesn't notice how much I'm sweating. Oh no, she looked at me. She can definitely see how sweaty I am. I should say something. Your face is good?! Why would you say that!? **B:** She laughed at you. Now she's gonna tell all the women in Sarn how stupid and useless you are. You're gonna die alone. Wait... is she-- she's holding your hand! You did it! Your face is good! Classic line. Works every time. **C:** That was... deeply uncomfortable to witness. --- **ZanaReef2** **A:** This is not good. I can't believe I fell asleep. Now I'm in the middle of the bloody ocean without a bloody paddle. Micah, you stupid shite. Why couldn't you just follow the bloody captain's orders? **B:** Now you've gone and got yourself killed. Unless... what is that? Is that a ship on the horizon? It looks like Roth's! Long as he doesn't hold a grudge, I'm saved! **C:** Roth? Could it be-- no, that is simply too much of a coincidence. Still, I can't help but wonder... --- **ArachnidTomb** **A:** I'm a fool to have gotten lost here, but it was getting dark, and I thought I saw a way home. A crowd stands silently around me, their faces blank white, their bodies covered in webs. **B:** The crowd begins to shiver and shake as I creep between their bound hands. Some moan for help. Others scream as their bodies bubble, and I realise I cannot help them. Tiny spiders pour out of open wounds. **Cavas:** Eugh, no! I can still feel them crawling on me! **Zana:** Exile, if you ever find me trapped in webbing like that... put me out of my misery."

If i would decide to go with Amulet +additional curse, i could use Agony herald with Vulnerability is it worth though? And here comes the second issue, what do i choose for rings and amulet? One option is to go with Carnage Heart for leech and Ming's Heart for chaos damage, but in the end, the build would end up having some issue with resistances, so i don't know if it would be better to have 2 resistance rings. I would appreciate any advices you guys got, but please, don't link any forums or posts with ready build for flicker strike. &amp;#x200B; Thanks"
157,vulnerability,pathofexile,"[PSA] Synthesis shield implicit ""Immune to Curses if Corrupted"" blocks LL from Coward's Legacy",0,b7ppga,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/b7ppga/psa_synthesis_shield_implicit_immune_to_curses_if/,2019-04-01 03:44:05,"""Immune to curses"" prevents curses from applying, ruining the condition for LL from ""Coward's legacy"" (being cursed with Vulnerability"") while Atziri's Reflection mod ""Unaffected by Curses"" keeps curses, but nullifies their effect on the character. Yes, this implicit is quite easily aquired (like literally slam any 3 corrupted shields together and have a decent chance of rolling it) but I seriously doubt that it would break the game (all those OP Dreadbeak+Lori's Gladiators, right?). Casters can still use the unique (with up to 240+ ES and up to 30 all res) or would be able to craft those shields - both for ES and HP versions. I agree that high rolled ES shield with this implicit will beat Atziri's but it also sacrifices a belt slot. Attackers though do have a tough time with LL: they do not benefit from Pain Attunement, Vulnerability mitigation via Watcher's Eye requires sacrifices: blocking more benefitable Eye mods, using a highly situative 50% manacost Determination aura... Even their notable LL unique - Dreadbeak - is being used only by casters. This implicit could give them a new breath, a new opportunity - with all those new shield affixes, but no fun allowed I suppose. In the current state, this mod is like ""meh"": people still run anticurse flasks, its usability with the Soul Mantle is unclear... But yeah, so are all the other synthesis corruption implicits. Too bad, but I sincerly hope melee in 3.7 will be redeemed (just not at the cost of nerfing spells to the ground)"

159,vulnerability,pathofexile,Hints on Staying Alive in Poe for Life/Armor Characters,0,b9x0wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/b9x0wc/hints_on_staying_alive_in_poe_for_lifearmor/,2019-04-06 08:38:26," Due to the recent popular posts about characters dying in various ways, I decided to put together some hints on things that keep my character alive in higher maps. None of my suggestions rely on any godly gear. **Background**: I am a casual player, currently playing a level 92 Juggernaut, with Teutonic Slam, dual wield, and it is an armor using, life-based character. Some of my suggestions may also apply to Energy Shield or Evasion based characters, however as I have not played either of these characters into higher maps in recent games, you will have to decide if these ideas will benefit ES or EV characters. My character also has 6K life, resists over 100, chaos resist around -20, 14.4 K armor, immune to stun, freeze, and temporal chains. My DPS sitting in my hideout with hatred is 220 K. On to the hints. 1. **Bleed ** Bleed has probably killed my life-based characters more than any other thing in the game. Not only can it kill you quickly and silently, but if you are moving, or are running Blood Rage to generate frenzy charges, then you die very fast. Bleed is also a big killer in the Labyrinth. **Avoiding Bleed -** a. **Flask of staunching**  Staunching on a life flask stops bleeding and gives your character a health boost. Usually you have a Staunching flask in slot 1 (I assign it to the space bar). When you notice your character bleeding you have a second or two to use the flask. I still die a lot relying on this flask and I no longer use it. b. **Cheapest and Best Solution** \- **Craiceann's Carapace** (Crab Armor). This armor makes you immune to bleeding and sells for 1 EX in Standard, 20C in League. This is also one of the best in slot armors for a life-based armor character. More on this later. c. **Expensive solution**  Deaths Door boots 4-5 EX in Standard, 1 EX in League, provides bleeding immunity. d. **Other skill-based solutions**  There are some skill-based solutions that mitigate or can avoid bleeding. If you are lucky enough to have a build that has access to one, then good for you. **2.** **Armor ** Armor and chest choices in general are probably one of the most hotly debated subjects in this game. Again, this subject does not apply if you are an ES or Evasion based character that doesnt or cant use armor. **How much armor does one need?** Your character needs enough armor to keep them from dying from physical attacks and to combat physical spell attacks. This amount of armor is probably minimally 10,000 armor but 15,000 or more would be better**.** The more blocking your character has the more you can cheese down your armor but my character with its lowly 19% dual wield block still was getting beat up badly with 6000 armor**.** Given that you need a healthy dose of armor from your chest, EV based chests are not a good idea (if you even have the dexterity and can get the socket colors to make it work)**.** Chests with low armor values shouldnt be used unless physical damage can be mitigated by blocking or other gear. **Cheapest Solution - Brass Dome ** High armor amounts of 5500-ish and your character cant be critically hit**.** You do take more shock duration, but this can be offset by Pantheon choice. It is very cheap in league - 1 chaos and starts at 30 chaos in Standard. It doesnt have life or resists and has a movement penalty, but it can work with other gear and items. **Best Solution** \- **Craiceann's Carapace** (Crab Armor). This armor makes you immune to bleeding and sells for 20 chaos in league and for one EX in Standard. It is also one of the Best in Slot armors for a life-based armor character. My character has over 14000 armor wearing this chest plus it mitigates 30% physical damage when its 15 crab barriers are up. It has good life and you even get resists thrown in. I have been one shot exactly one time (on a vulnerability map  ugh!) going from level 91 to 92 in this armor (with no extra crit mitigation). **Other armors:** **Kaoms Heart ** It has 1000-ish armor, 500 life, and extra fire damage. You would need a six-link weapon or an elder or shaper item to get a six-link attack. The armor value is low, and the fact that it has no sockets or resists make it a troublesome solution at best**.** **Rare Armors ** A Shaper or Elder armor with high life on kill, 2000+ armor, life, resists and other goodies can make a very powerful chest piece. **Least favorite armor**  **Loreweave**. The armor value stinks (less than 600), it has low life, and the extra maximum resists are not significant (now lowered to a max of 78 due to much crying about how OP this armor was). The two best things about this armor is it has magic find and it has up to 40% increased damage for elemental attacks. I ran around in this crap trying to get my character from Level 91 to 92 and kept getting my butt kicked. **3.** **Pantheons ** Pantheons are very important as they address many of the dangers that high armor cannot handle. a. I recommend armor users choose the major god **Soul of Arakaali** which when all four souls of the supporting gods are captured the character has improved shock, chaos, and damage over time mitigation and you get some nice life regen throw in. b. For a minor god I choose **Soul of Shakari** which gives you some chaos resistance and makes your character immune to poison once you have captured the souls of the two minor gods. These choices reflect attributes that fill in the weak spots of a life Juggernaut. Feel free to mix and match them to cover the weaknesses of a different character. **4.** **Dealing with Vulnerability and Enfeeble in Maps.** Close behind bleeding comes Vulnerability and Enfeeble as leading contributors to my characters demise. Vulnerability stinks because it causes you to take 30-40% more physical damage and if you get crit by a big physical hit its good-bye. So much for all your hard work to get a nice chest! Enfeeble is bad news because it robs you of DPS, crit, and chance to hit, so all that had work you did to get decent damage is effectively gone. To make matters worse now it takes much longer to kill things which means your character is exposed to damage for a much longer period of time. **Lessening curse effectiveness**. a. The unique ring, **Kikazaru** supplies 40% reduced curse effectiveness on your character. Unfortunately, the other affixes on the ring arent great so it isnt very practical to use. b. You can role reduced curse effectiveness on some Shaper and Elder rings, but this can be difficult plus the reduction amounts are typically less than 25%. c. **Best solution**  **Watchers Eye Prismatic Jewel (50 chaos in Standard, 8C in league).** This jewel can role, Unaffected by Enfeeble when affected by Grace, and Unaffected by Vulnerability when affected by Determination. This requires you to swap out a jewel in your skill tree and replace it with the Watchers Eye, and then you must run either the Grace or Determination aura. This seems like a big PITA but I think it is worth it. **Conclusion**  These are things that have worked for my build. If nothing else, I hope it has helped some of you to think about ways to plug up the holes in your own builds. "
160,vulnerability,pathofexile,Herald of Purity vs Herald of Ash math inside.,1,aoslyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/aoslyk/herald_of_purity_vs_herald_of_ash_math_inside/,2019-02-10 01:07:51,"**Background :** So I just had an interesting experience, I was watching a PoE stream and the streamer explained to the audience how he is using herald of ash and hatred over hatred and herald of purity. I then said that 100% herald of purity is more dps and was promptly explained by both the streamer and his viewers how I am basically an idiot with blanket statements because I apparently am too dumb to understand that herald of purity gives flat damage while herald of ash is a percentage amount that scales better the better your gear (true) and that if you have a good weapon and flat phys on your gear herald of ash is always better and I am an idiot for making blanket statements when I do not understand basic game mechanics. **So here we are doing the math** to compare herald of ash and herald of purity on his build with a good weapon and flat phys on his gear. Weapon of choice : [500 dps siege axe (should be good enough right?)](URL Base weapon damage : 204-354 damage on the weapon = **279 average** Flat phys on gear : 2x steel rings 4-14 phys damage + 4-7 flat phys affixes = 16 - 42 flat phys = **29 flat phys average** lvl 20 chance to bleed support gem = 44-66 flat phys = **55 flat phys** Total flat phys = 279+55+29 = **363** lvl 20 herald of purity = 25-37 flat phys = **31 flat phys** Herald of ash = 15% of physical damage als extra fire damage **Assumptions for our calculations :** - He is cursing bosses with vulnerability right now as dps boost - Hatred is being used together with the Heralds - Enemies have 30% elemental resistances (could go much higher) - Gladiators Blood in the Eyes node gives 10% extra physical damage taken to enemies - War Banner gives 11% extra physical damage taken to enemies (would get increased to 16% when placing the banner but we will not even go that far) ***Math :*** Herald of Ash with Hatred vs enemies with **0% resistances** : 0.15/1.36 = **11%** more damage Herald of Ash with Hatred vs enemies with **30%** resistances : 0.105/1.25 = **8.4%** more damage Herald of Ash with Hatred vs enemies with **40%** resistances (shaper) : 0.09/1.216 = **7.4%** more damage Herald of Purity + Hatred baseline : 31/363 = 8.5% + 2.1% = **10.6%** more damage **Herald of Purity + Hatred increased physical damage taken(always on) : 8.5%x1.21 = 10%+2.1% = 12.1% more damage** Herald of Purity + Hatred vs map boss cursed with vulnerability : 8.5% x (1.21 + (0.39x0.4)) = 8.5% x 1.366 = 11.6% +2.1% = **13.7%** more damage Herald of Purity + Hatred vs Shaper with vulnerability : 8.5% x 1.288 = 10.9% + 1.836% = **12.7%** more damage **Things not taken into account :** - If you have any other sources of % phys added as elemental/chaos herald of purity gets even better - Herald of purity is a 8.5% more damage increase to the bleed damage (not neglectable on a phys gladiator build with both bleed nodes) - The numbers are even more different when you do not have a 500dps axe(or two) and use mother freaking chance to bleed gem - If you have any source of Impale herald of purity will add even more - The minions summoned by herald of purity do damage - Herald of purity can be supported with culling strike (only 2% more mana reservation) for free 10% more damage vs bosses - Upsides of Herald of Ash : 11-7% more bleed explosion damage depending on enemy compared to herald of purity (yay?), no minions that dps for you(can be important). Overkill ignite. Based on this I will claim that I do know the game mechanics when I make a statement like : Herald of Purity is 100% certainty more damage than herald of Ash on your build. "
161,vulnerability,pathofexile,My reflections on the game after playing Delve and Betrayal,1,aou2xo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/aou2xo/my_reflections_on_the_game_after_playing_delve/,2019-02-10 03:57:37,"## warning These are my reflections. No tl;dr. No single conclusion. ## my gameplay history I started playing PoE shortly after it has started Open Beta. It felt like a really good game with lots of customization and non-schematical design. I was very strongly immersed by the passive skill tree. I played every softcore league except Talisman with strong focus on completing 36/40 once this system has been introduced. I really liked every update except Forsaken Masters which appealed too grindy and umatched for this game. Rampage league was a huge grind - more than 80% of my time in that league was spend on master rotations - few hours of everyday time I could offer. Still, didn't level all masters to 8. I like tons of new additions, especially vaal orb, Atlas, Labirynth, Anulment Orb (already was expecting such orb way earlier). Breach was critically acclaimed but at that time I had a relatively weak CwC discharge Inquisitor build. Also, Guardian/Necro supports were annoying for me because they were making situation only worse (granting unnecessarily large cast speed causing me to run out of mana before CwC triggers). I was one of the very few players for who support builds were providing disadvantage. Incursion was a blast and felt like it was out of all previous league flaws (boring rampage, micromanagement with talismans, forced encounters in Perandus (no click to open), overcomplicated essences, clunky Bestiary, impossible to pricecheck beasts, top Bestiary content only for those who play 12h/day etc) while still maintaining an impactful addition and a lot of choices. I did lvl 100 3 times but I'm not really proud of the one in Harbinger. It was a mediocre Kaom's + Oro's ST build, just carried like everyone else in endless, boring Beachhead rotas. ## time impact and the current clearspeed era The game has changed much since I started playing it. Back in time we: - used to read mods on rares to avoid death or too strong enemies - used a variety of skills - the meta had much more variety - used to buy/sell 1lvl 0q gems - **flasks actually were temporary** - gems were actually choices, not % more multipliers - 6L rares were for XX exalts I remember when Discharge builds appeared and required only linked Voll's Protector and occasional Ice Spear. This build could one-shot packs in a party of 6 and needed only some mana flasks + ice spear to retain power charges. It was considered OP at that time. Later there was patch 1.1 (Sacrifice of the Vaal - added Atziri, vaal orb and fragments) and Mjloner some time later. LowLife ST was absurdly powerful being able to reach 100k unbuffed. 600k DPS with top gear and RF only for few seconds (untill the flask runs out). Now self-cast Discharge is too clunky and 600k DPS is not reddit viable. Clearspeed meta was always in this game. Just not at this level. I think the largest leap in this regard was Ascendancy update which brought powerhouse known as the Labirynth WITHOUT immediate adjustments to the environment itself. We have reached the point where game can no longer can handle the power of our characters. Things such as loading screen time starts to matter because we clear so fast. There definitely will always be clear speed meta (it's a hack and slash game after all) but the current ""ceiling"" of possibilities is way beyond sanity. ## p2w, 10cent and game direction PoE is advertised as F2P but it becomes more and more P2W when we consider each new league with it's new items and default 4 tabs incapable of convenient selling and stacking currency. Nothing could potentially hook me back to PoE as much as custom servers and ability to tweak/remove certain aspects of the game. You can say that it's possible to play on 4 tabs but it's just a painful play where you lose tons of time on inventory/stash management. You need 1 tab for currency, 1 for divination cards, 1+ for maps, 1 for items to sell and then what? Where to fit all of essences, sac frags, shaper/atziri frags, quality gems, new league currency, flasks, swap gear, items to sell and more of useful stuff? When I started playing I was on the first year in techical school. Now I'm working full-time third year and ending 5th semester on univeristy. Learning stuff gives me more interest than another day spent on running maps. Ultimately it's probably better for me because Chris can no longer own my soul and I can fully utilize my computer time in advancing my programming skills. Chris once said they created Path of Exile as hardcore ARPG because ""that's the game we want to play"". Through time, game seem to go more outwards the former idea and more into money machine. I'm dubious what Chris achieves now in the game (eg how many Delve bosses he found and what is his Atlas like). Perhaps I should drop PoE at some point? Maybe there is a better game for me? Despite all the recent hate I tend to regularly come back to League of Legends and play some matches with friends because it gives me satisfaction for my decisions and it never feels grindy. Suprisingly I have spent about 500 points on PoE (almost only stash tabs) and exactly zero on LoL. Don't get me wrong, I still like PoE, just not as much as in it's early times. ## the Delve league Delve itself was a pretty good league for me in terms of core idea but little dissapointing due to it's implementation. Nonetheless, playing Delve was a blast for me. This league challenges really required my effort and it is the second league I had to really rethink my builds. After 2 failed attempts (first: immunity pathfinder - too reliant on flasks and steep entry with items, also no recovery methods once damage is taken; second: Ele hit scion - too expensive for starter, I tried the wrong variant which required absolute minmaxing) I ended doing classical MS JUGG. With Greelwood and rare 300 DPS stat stick (extra % gains worth more than second Greelwood). This league was the first league I went really into Atlas play. Guided and recommended by the guildmate, I went full into the min-maxing strategy. After finalizing my Elder setup around Minotaur, I earned enough to buy a HH in a week by playing (read: farming) only 4-6h/day. But when it comes to fixing Atlas influence, HOLY SHIT WHY THE FUCK GGG HAVENT CHANGED THE COLOR OF MAP CONNECTIONS. Ok, they did change it at the start of Betrayal. Still, it took them way more time than it should. Only Delve and Legacy leagues gaved me so much satisfaction from playing. I never mindlessly copy meta builds but try to make something that fits the current state. Nothing gives so much pleasure as running a successful build, made by my own. In Legacy I knew the new EK nova jewel was meta (back when meta was ES + VP) but instead of making a 6-8k ES CI Pathfinder I made a 12+K ES low-life Occultist. I did not have 1 M DPS but 400K was satisfying enough given how tanky that build was. Hit my first in-league lvl 100 with it (second lvl 100 overall). Ofc done by running shaped Strand. The JUGG in Delve caused me to realize how important physical mitigation in this game is. Everyone has 75% (or more) resists, but who cares about armour or other sources of physical damage reduction if they require strong investment (usually sacrificing something else)? [JUGG](URL gives the opportunity to make a build with high DPS and strong phys reduction. Every build I now do must have stable phys defences. The JUGG Delve build is especially satisfying to me because it is the first build I managed to conveniently kill Shaper guardians deathlessly. For the first time I could do red tier bosses without dying and fkin exped on Minotaur! Leved to 98 with very few deaths. Challenges: - Enough has been already said on reddit. My first plan was to do everything except 3 Voricis and last endgame grind / rare delve rooms. GGG made rooms easier to find but I managed to complete Vorici Ahuatotli so it ended without these 4: - endgame grind (lvl 98 though and killed 250+ Minotaurs) - Vorici Kurgal - Vorici Aul - delve rare rooms (5/6) - [challenges image](URL - look at that beautiful progress bar! What went right with Delve: - No league-enabling items. No coins, no talismans, no remnants, no nets, no cluttering bullshit. - Clear league mechanics. No hidden exploits besides fossil farming. What went wrong: - *Delve stackable currency*. Really stackable indeed. I can't even sell them easily because I don't even know how many I have - they do not stack and stash search function has unnecessary time-waste animation and no results count. Selling a quad tab of fossils took more effort than it should have. - Incursion was much better balanced in terms of monster damage. Initially I was amazed to hear that GGG introduces a new league with depth scaling mechanic but it turned out to be ""do the shit at 270 because that's max zone lvl can and stuff deeper gets maps mods causing 1-shot deaths"". Delve map mods and exploding wetas turned me away from going deeper than 300 for the challenge even though my build could easily reach 600. Just not worth the exp loss. Really, maps mods and exploding wetas destroyed perfect linear scaling. Delve itself is already encouraging you to follow certain paths depending on the visible encounters. In Delve league trailer, Chris says: ""Test the limits of your character in Path of Exile: Delve."". In my opinion, this really is ""Test your patience - how many deaths you can endure before you give up on 1-shot corpse detonade deaths from unstable wetas"". **Map mods and exploding wetas are major dissapointment in Delve - the absolutely destroy the core idea of the league: getting deeper with slowly increasing difficulty.** - Delve party meta. Empyrean team clearly showed that the game is full of mechanical abuses. I do not want to watch support party playing workarounds. I want to watch risky glasscannons and tankiest JUGGs. This eventually get fixed but such things should not occur at all. I guess we will get something like this in the future anyway, we have had multiple time points in the past of CoC builds reaching permanent IC and 100% resists. - If there weren't so many on-hit / leech / on-kill abuses we likely would not have to have monster immunity in darkness. I'm interested whether GGG was aware of darkness farming abuses through low life and flat regen. What could be improved: - All the bugs Delve had. I suppose Gruthkul's and Ichimonji's bugs ""were intentional"" to simplify implementation and save development time. It's likely that it was much simpler to code light as a buff and flares/dynamite as spells instead of new game logic. Ship the league on time and then fix it ASAP. - Delve Subterranean Chart could have bookmarks. It's too large and you do not always want to go where previously. What I learned from Delve: - Sextants, prophecies, elder/shaper influence are powerful and should be used. Map sustain without investment does not exist. Top tier maps can sometimes be hard to sustain as items but always sustain economically (you get more from sales even if you buy maps). - Trade is what powers vast majority of progress in the entire game. Any trade trivialization makes it much easier to complete and push further. Just imagine every redundant red map was sold. I already ignore 3c shaper/elder bases and no longer sell red maps but plain currency, shaper fragments and occasional expensive drops still sustain quad sextant and Zana mod setup. - Start of the league really does matter. Maps and high ilvl base items are much more valuable and sextants much cheaper. The more you push at the sole start the bigger advantage you can gain. ## the Betrayal league The syndicate: hands down, the best voice acting PoE has ever done. They topped Izaro with multiple unique personalities augmented by funny responses. The mechanics: IMO the biggest failure in terms of game mechanics desgin. The worst league you can imagine: running low-level zones to earn currency and upgrade breachstones to mindlessly run overpowered very high level zones to reach lvl 100. I have not done 100 this league and I already feel no satisfaction from the one in Harbinger. I just don't get this design. The game gives very little reward for running higher lvl zones. Safehouse drops should be gated behind zone lvls on which you encountered members. More intelligence at higher maps. And the fact that sometimes the best option is to do nothing ... especially in the labolatory which requires to backtrack or logout. Chris said they would like to offer a league that has a bit hard mechanics to understand. And indeed, they achieved it - manipulating syndicate is not trivial and quite RNG-dependent. I'm fine with this. What I'm not fine is when GGG introduces unclear mechanics that they do not themselves know abuses of. A very good example: Shaper/Elder influence. The same idea - make something unclear and let players figure it out. The problem? Hidden implementation details that players started to abuse to form Elder ring. GGG has never made any official statement regarding how influence was supposed to work and be played, but we can guess they meant ping pong strategy and chasing elder kills. Players were smarter and realized that implementation does not allow Elder blob to split, making Elder ring an infinite source of Elder maps. The same thing happened with sextant blocking and low-level delve farming. I can reveal another such thing which still remains unfixed, although it gives very little advantage now: Prophecies always trigger in certain order. If you have multiple prophecies active and multiple of them roll to trigger on the same map, there is a fixed order of their activation. What I have concluded: - Bountiful Traps (+6 strongboxes) - The Cursed Choir (swarms of sea witches) - Soil, Worms and Blood (swarms of worms) - The Hungering Swarm (packs of insects) This means that if you open a map with these active and all of them roll successfully, you will always get Bountiful Traps. If last 2 roll successfully, you will always get Soil, Worms and Blood. It does matter for people who run maps with certain prophecies active - if you buy multiple of them you will realize they do not trigger equally often and you will have to refill stock of certain prophecies more often. Other things I dislike about the ""unclear mechanics design"" is that a lot of things may look just like a bug because players expect rules to be consistent with others but the implementation contains exceptions: - safehouse craft: error: item is a shaper item - ancient orb: error: unique fishing rod not a valid item - *delve stackable currency* - remnant of corruption essence mobs: can not be leeched from Game is already hard for beginners and it's surprising how many mechanics are more effective when used in a way they are not really intuitive to be used. I know that a new player will not be the best at efficient sextant + prophecy combining but descriptions of items have already too many complications: - speed vs movement speed - ""ignore all movement penalties from armour"" - life leech rate, life leech per second, maximum life leech rate - ""sockets"" on resonators from jeweller's/fusing orb point of view (fix descriptions pls) - ancient orb vs cheaper unique fishing rod (I guess GGG still gets bug reports for this) - Zana mods. Actually (from challenge point of view) Zana mods except ""Zana's"" prefix mod, quest maps given by Zana and tier upgrade mods What I like about the syndicate are the unique crafting opportunities they offer. Especially amultet to talisman upgrade - I would like to see more such things in the future - some powerful upgrade while making item corrupted. White sockets are also nice, they make gearing easier. I also earned a bit by applying this craft to Pariahs. The sad part is that you can't bring these crafts outside which makes it much harder to sell them (imagine Jorgin's craft as an orb) or make good use of them. I expect that the upcoming league will also allow some quality crafts. ## trade Imagine playing SSF. And now imagine playing regular league. Much faster progress by exchanging resources you do not need for resources you do need. Trade is undoubtly the major source of game trivialization and faster progress. We already spend too much time flipping, selling and buying mapping materials. Those who trade are much more competetive compared for those who do not. Trade is too powerful, **trading should be nerfed**. Don't you see it? GGG tries to nerf trade in every possible way: - labirynth (taking time) - delve (taking time) - new hybrid mods, abyss jewels (making pricing and searching optimal items harder) - syndicate crafting: somewhat similar to soulbound items Benefits of nerfing trade: - people spend more time actually playing the game because you lose too much time staying in the hideout (shifting opportunity cost) - game can offer even more powerful crafts if they are not easily tradeable - game is less vulnerable to RMT GGG tries to hide these nerfs by labeling them as other game mechanics so that players do not complain. I think this is much better than solutions like trade cooldown. Similar thing: collecting azurite. Cooldown/having to wait? Players would complain. Spread the thing around so they have the feel of collecting it while in fact it's a simple fix to let the game load assets in time. Basically give something to do to shut up those who complain on waiting. ## game overall - major causes of dissatisfaction The point in which we currently are the game is way too fast. We now require milions of DPS and screen-wide 2s clear + Uber Elder/Atziri video for a build to be ""viable"". The newest clearspeed addition are hit-and-run skills: brands and Winter Orb. Clear even faster while being able to use PoE's best fighting strategy: just don't get hit. We have a new generation of skills which do not penalize player for running around. We now need mechanics such as bearers, porcupines, corpse explosions, 1-shot abilities because living monsters die so fast that only on-death effects make a significant danger. They are major source of unavoidable random deaths. And they are very frustrating. I still don't get why DD totem has offscreen range. Another thing which I really dislike is the push for being efficient in this game - or rather what being efficient requires to do. Of course, one does not have to but I want to complete challenges anyhow and want to earn up to 50ex to make a good build and play some crafting. I know game requires time but we should be able to earn as much solo as in full support + MF party. I have a guildmate who is all about efficiency and the way he plays the game is disgusting. He did not touched Delve at all. Running maps with scarabs is better. Multiple Doctors each day. *Delve is the worst league so far because it doesn't alter mapping in any way and has time-consuming encounters with rewards which require tanky build. You can't prophecize, influence and sextant delves. No place for MF there.* **He ignores every possible league mechanic if it disrupts the process of farming.** Every league he makes another TS Ranger or similar build - just anything capable of clearing well with Sadima, Goldwyrm, 2x Ventor/Pariach, 2x Bisco's, Windripper etc. He full invests into MF gear and Atlas including regularly buying specific prophecies, sextants, sac frags etc. Obtains Headhunter in the first week of the league and earns dozen or more ex including 1-2 Loreweaves, dropping multiple top-tier cards and exalts themselves per day. Ultimately everything ends in RMT. Multiple mirrors each league. Whatever GGG introduces into the game, usually the most optimal strategy is to ignore it and/or buy only the good parts of it. Game gets more and more additions and people are fooled by their presentation while the thing that gives you the highest earnings remains mostly unchanged. Top earning players rely on fools which roll the mechanic and sell expensive stuff they profit even more from. ## other random thoughts - Delve: BV + Flame Dash + Phase Run - doesn't work, you instantly trigger mosnter aggro, never jump into darkness with this as you will instantly trigger all nearby monsters while being unable to damage them. BV are good Delve builds but very bad at going into darkened sideways unless you like to wait for BV stacks to dissipate. - Purifier - If you are ES based better bring anti-ignite flask. Can't escape much fire and can't recharge ES. - Many have asked for a crafting league. Giving how powerful Elder/Shaper rares, fossils and new crafting bench are now, we kinda achieved it. No one really pickups ordinary rare loot in endgame anymore, only currency and bases. - It's possible to open 2 abysses at the same time but not breaches. - Fragment tab splinter space is a fail. Everyone puts splinters on currency tab - they drop too often. - Some UI inconsistency: you can open delve map or trade window while on the passive tree but if you have a trade window already active opening tree will cancel the trade. Delve map does not dissapear in this case. - Other UI inconsistency: map *transparency* should be renamed to *opacity* (scroll is reverse) - You can not outrun the Clawler but you can outjump (out-movement-skill) it. Using quicksilver to catch up with the Clawler is counterproductive - it uses your movement speed. Use movement skills instead. - Onslaught mod seems to buff volatile dead travel and trigger speed. - Running away from untimed Elreon mission stops it like everything else which is 2 screens far away. Running away from timed Elreon mission fails it instantly when you reach time-stop boundary. There might be an exploit based on such implemenation in future leagues. - Minotaur with crit mod is more dangerous than with Vulnerability. - If you reduce Master Volume on the Sound options tab to a very low level some sounds never play. Found examples: Crawler's engine and Shaper portals. **Lowering game master volume but increasing it elsewhere can be used to get rid of annoying repetitive ambient sounds like portals and crawler's engine.** - You can be reflect immune (great for ele reflect variant because purity brings back resists lost from ring): - 25% from Pantheon (both phys and ele) - 40% from unique ring (left: ele, right: phys) - (40-50)% from Watcher's Eye (purity of elements / determination) - We slay gods for Pantheon powers but gods by definition are immortal. Meanwhile we can't pickup blocked items in map edges and stop cycloning on smallest stones. - It's still possible to crash the game (semi-reliably) in some specific situations: - client logout kick: I had [a very ""intense"" hideout](URL (note: the entire main room is covered in Energy Dome). Kicks to login screen about 1/10 of buyers. If someone is affected by this, it ALWAYS kicks them. 100% reproduction rate for affected people. Apparently ~10% of players are just not allowed to load there. - server instance crash (removes instance portals): Haunted Traitors + Plague of Frogs/Rats with huge pack size and large party. About 10% reproduction on my MF guildmate. Enough for him to resign of combining this prophecy and sextant. - Don't trust ""extra lightning monsters"" sextant on a tight map (eg Toxic Sewer), the lightning trap monsters with proximity shields are a true pain, especially when combined with can not die aura. - Headhunter is a game changer. If you have it but I do not, we are not playing the same game. It is not mandatory for your build - it is mandatory to ever play the actual Path of Exile! NPC thoughts: - Vorici = +1 Exile and sometimes favour. - Vagan = dude who has no power in fights but predents to have so, sometimes annoyingly requiring you to pass another loading screen. Would make a better carrier in the kitchen. Daresso likely constantly dissapointed by who he is being referred. - Elreon = a blind believer testing your patience. - Tora = more monsters. Sometimes rippy porcupines. - Catarina = some necro girl with her sculpture copied from HBO giving you only backtracking tasks. - Zana = the only appropriate master to ever care for. - Haku = If you Talamoana enough you can add resists to common gear. Then skip it, warrior. - Leo = a forgotten dude who probably dreams of the fully-featured Exile Battle Royale. - Niko = the mad delver. Still wondering why he doesn't share his blunt-making secrets or whatever else he makes from that azurite which keeps him to be high. Stay in the lOiGhT. ## some stats (Delve league only) Should outline general view on Delve RNG... - unique strongboxes (excluding ones given by Zana): **12** - found delve bosses: **8** (3/2/3) - found abyss liches: **6** (lol wtf almost better than delve league) - 4s resonators: **0** - ex drops: below 6, did not count - reliquary key drops: **4** (all sold, I hate strong RNG gambling, you lose on average anyway) - leveled Enlightens to 3: **12**; **1** went lvl 4 - Zana exp: **8 lvl** done just few days before reaching 36/40 - money: 4500c in stash, on build: HH, 6L Loreveawe, Starkonja +3 MS proj, Xoph's Heart, 140% resist boots with 100 flat and 3% life, perfect 2s Tombfist, 2x Elder rings with flat life, resists and 15 life on hit (each ~3ex); not really much stuff to sell besides 70 Minotaur fragments and tons of red maps Betrayal league: also 0 4s resonators. ## my wishes for GGG - challenges - more choices - less RNG - less RNG on top of RNG - less RNG on top of RNG on top of RNG - clearly visible progress - no Vorici mission challenge bullshit, especially for Farrul rarity bosses - trade - whatever that makes scamming and abusing trade mechanics harder; I'm fine with the current state - nerf trade opportunities, force people to play the game more - chat - Give us channels with dedicated use (not just conventions from reddit but actual channel descriptions and their purpose) so people who want to discuss politics can discuss politics and people pasting Toucans can continue to praise. - Something allowing for cleaner multi-player whispering. Trading with multiple players at the same time gets messy. Maybe a separate tab for each player? More chat boxes? - chat moderation pls, give us an opportunity to remake 820 and mute anyone who posts ""LF trial"" - gameplay - down the ceiling of clearspeed meta, continue to promote different types of builds and endgame - make game harder but remove spiky 1-shot mechanics - 99% of content is trivial and 1% is just frustrating random death experience - Stash: what we truly need is a prophecy tab and/or different active prophecies UI. I'm tired manually separating same ones after applying new sextants. If you like to combo them with sextants you need to manage them but all look the same and do not stack. - Lightning Mirage is the return of old Volatile bullhit. Remove it. Melee (the melee melee, not EQ not MS) is already very weak. - more endgame promoting diverse gameplay, not 1-map Atlas setups and constant sextant trading (perhaps strongholds were to counter it?) - Bearers from mystereious barrels should be more visible, just like bloodline bearers. My concerns are that in the future the game will become even faster and even more grindy, potentially ending as just money machine for GGG and another place for gold miners. PoE is already under strong casualization influence. Initially I saw SSF like a very weird trend but now I start to understand all of it. The problem is that I really like trading itself but not midless repetition of the same activity over and over. I want to create own builds and play myself with hard-earned progress, not search global chat for another support + MF + carry map rotation that can run mindlessly and earn more than focused solo mapper. I'm not jealous for them. I'm just afraid that at some point in the future the only way to fully experience this game will be either to MF grind or RMT. The more bots/MFers/RMTers we have, the more expensive stuff gets. HC is not an option for me because I'm not a full-time streamer, have friends and a job. Ideally I would like a game like it was back in OB, without efficiency raise while in a party. Scarabs promote party play too much. **What is really disgusting for me is that running behind such MF player with all of his aura/curse supports gives me more currency and exp than when I'm justing playing this game alone.** I already noticed this problem multiple leagues earlier where parties were carried by SRS builds with Vaal Haste in Gorge rotations. Perandus league and Labirynth release made it even worse because at that patch there was no change in monsters/encounters themselves and players gained huge ascendancy powerhouse. I did complete 36/40 in Delve and Betrayal, but the facts above turn me away from further playing. I could do it much faster (playing in a efficient party) but it gives me no pleasure - I don't feel any satisfaction by running behind Headhunter MF and aura/curse bots neither playing them myself. I want to play a hard ARPG, not sextanted Burials RNG simulator. Continously bying sextants, prophecies, sac frags and running the same map over and over with HH gives me entertainment only if it's my work. Just tell this to a new player: ""Do not hit stuff, only run behind us and pickup drops we do not. You will get more exp and items this way than playing by yourself"". **Partying should be significantly nerfed.** I'm afraid that at some point in the future anyone who will want to make a decent build will be forced to make an MF character and just grind untill specific point, then make an actual character and play how RPGs should be played. Complete 36 or 40 and then go back to grind or leave from burnout until next league. I'm already partially doing that - I quit multiple past leagues just after reaching 36 challenges. Now the game feels more like a grindy chore than something that gives you entertainment. I tend to pick builds focused on getting 36/40 ASAP and then quit the game until another league release. I don't think PoE is a suitable game for curse/aura supports and the like. Could be if our clearspeed was at the level we currently have while leveling in Act 4. Currently supports feel like a unfair cheat mode which only lowers the chance of accidental 1-shot deaths and multiply map drops while keeping the map cost same as for solo player. Think how PoE would be different if there was no MF, support builds, absurd powercreep, mirror and Headhunter. Gear and crafting would have diminishing returns and the game would require to plan a strong build capable of facing top-tier content, not just another 3k life 100IIQ/200IIR glass cannon TS ranger. ## my thanks to you - all the memes on reddit - all the trials/challenges on 820 - tool creators (PoE price check macro: please allow to change rare PCing from machine learning price prediction to shaper/elder base item search) ___ Nonetheless of all of the above, I still find PoE to be one of the best games ever made. I'm looking forward to march league annoucement. "
162,vulnerability,pathofexile,New player questions... My build in progress Level 80 Gladiator,1,apx8ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/apx8ud/new_player_questions_my_build_in_progress_level/,2019-02-13 06:35:59,"New player here. Both overwhelmed and fascinated with all the possibilities in POE. Before writing this I have spent a considerable amount of time reading forum posts, watching videos by EE, ZiggyD &amp; Dropaduski, among many others. My first character is not following a specific build guide, mainly because I wanted to try out several of the mechanics in game and see how they felt to me in use. The character I am trying to design is a melee (Cleave) with high Block (70%+) using Overwhelming Odds Jewel for permanent Fortify, using as few buttons presses as possible. I am not trying to place on leader boards and while I hope I can see end game content, I might not be able to complete it in any reasonable time frame. I am also less concerned about clear speed than the average player. This is my current character level 80 Gladiator URL right now my character is in transition as I have learned about the issue of rolling GRB sockets based upon the attribute with relationship to armor, which I was unaware of when I first began equipping him. Before we start I understand that DoTs are not hits. However I have read several current guides which use Withering Touch Support along with Life gain on hit to gain life, in combination with Herald of Agony. I am not sure if it is Life on Hit gained at its application or there is another mechanic involved, hoping someone could point me in the right direction on this. What I want to do is to plan for the future! I like using Herald of Agony &amp; Purity &amp; with the Herald of Agony reserves 20/30% less mana I should be able to run Arctic Armor as well Best way to do that is to lay out the skill gems I want to use as final, then acquire the armor &amp; weapons needed to equip the gems. Core build: 6-Socket Cleave-Multistrike-Melee physical damage (Withering Touch-Life gain on hit-Poison or Maim Endurance Charge on Melee Stun?) I am not sure how the interaction of withering touch/life gain on hit works &amp; if poison is required to make this work. Currently using Maim and Endurance Charge on Melee Stun 3 Herald of Agony-Minion Damage Support-Pierce Support or (Maim/Vile Toxin in a 4 socket?) 4 Herald of Purity-Minion Damage Support-Holy Relic-(Poison or Vile Toxin?) 4 Tempest Shield-Increased Duration Support-Curse on hit support-(Vulnerability or Enfeeble or Temporal?) 4 Riposte-Reckoning-Vengence-(Poison or Blind?) 3 Arctic Armor-Enduring Cry- Summon Golem (Chaos or Stone?) or 3 Herald of Ash- Enduring Cry -Summon Golem (Chaos or Stone?) I am open to all suggestions and fixes of this build, with the key being that I am look for just a few buttons to interact with (2-3 is great). The last 3 socket setup I am not thrilled with, just not sure what to do differently (with mana reservation restrictions in mind). The purpose of the Holy Relic is not just for life regen. Its aoe I was going to use to also apply poison even thinking of using Geofris Legacy to get two Holy Relics (as well as easy blue sockets) As to my passive tree. I will continue to grab life/shield/armor/ nodes while planing to grab a few offensive nodes releasing my Mana nodes when I stabilize my equipment. Looking for all feedback and suggestions. Thank you for helping me learn and explore POE!"
163,vulnerability,pathofexile,LF Help/Ideas for Build,2,assomk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/assomk/lf_helpideas_for_build/,2019-02-21 06:40:52,"Hey guys, I wanted to ask for help and ideas for if there's a way to take this build further. Below is a wall of text explaining my thought process for the build and the ""Why's"" and ""What's"" of the build. &amp;#x200B; TLDR; / General Idea: Dancing Duo + Facebreakers (Cyclone) \[Need help making better.\] &amp;#x200B; I had the thought that using Dancing Duo and Facebreakers would work well because once Dancing Duo procs I can become unarmed and contribute as well. By double-dipping the minion AS+CS/Damage nodes for both myself and my minions I can use the passives to greater effect. &amp;#x200B; Why Warcries? : While looking around for ways to boost myself and minions I stumbled upon the idea to use Warcries to help buff myself and my minions. I decided upon using Deidbellow and the 2 warcry passives. Because they are instant, I can now use them while cycloning or while running around and not have to stop. This gives a 26% MS + AS + CS buff for 4s with \~3s cooldown, allowing me to keep it up forever (at the cost of having to keep pressing it). \[Can switch between Rallying Cry and Enduring Cry for defensive or offensive setup\]. &amp;#x200B; Why Cyclone? : ""Gotta go fast"" is the obvious answer. Being able to stay on the move is certainly nice for speed clearing content and is usable while unarmed! Also is nice to add a 3rd wheel to the Dancing Duo. :\\\^) \[I also can use blasphemy with Warlord's Mark, Enfeeble, or Vulnerability for defensive or offensive setup\]. &amp;#x200B; Why Darkness Enthroned? : Meginord's has always been a classic staple in Facebreaker history but I believe that DE gives more benefits that Meg because with the right jewels you can get higher flat damage bonuses and more life, along with any other affixes you can get on the jewels themselves. While I haven't tried this myself, I looked on PoB and saw that this also can work with Bubonic Trail for more damage (I haven't been able to myself due to needing resists). &amp;#x200B; Why Worm Jar? : Worms provide an excellent source of kills for both starting and maintaining rampage. Running to the next pack but almost out of time? Pop off some wormies and let the duo kill them to refresh the timer. Only 6 monsters around to start rampage? Pop off all 3 flasks twice, kill everything around you and pop more wormies out and you'll get rampage no problem. Also provides instant recovery which has saved me on occasion as well. &amp;#x200B; Why Champion? : Champion provides the best of both worlds. Being able to provide bonuses for myself but also for all my allies. Between dealing less damage to everyone, making enemies no longer evade, and everyone dealing more damage per impale (that I or anyone else causes), the help for everyone did make a huge difference. \[Note: Since I'm taunting and taking the aggression I opted to use Fortify in my cyclone to help keep me alive and capitalize on the fortify buff ascendancy.\] &amp;#x200B; What if there are no mobs at all? : You swap to your Great Old One's buckler and cyclone away to the best of your abilities until adds show up to help. &amp;#x200B; What are some of the issues with the build then? : Once I start trying higher level content I start struggling pretty hard. I believe about T10 is when I really start to feel sluggish and I start noticing it at about T7 with some spicier mods. Whether it's mobs hitting me ridiculously hard (or even outright one-shotting me) or my swords and I taking a while to kill, the overall struggle grows quite a bit. &amp;#x200B; Current thoughts on improvement: Leveling up more to get more jewel sockets and more life is an obvious answer. Getting badass Steel rings is also another one. Actually 6L'ing my Loreweave is another. &amp;#x200B; But I wanted to ask you guys, the real experts, what are some of your thoughts on improving this build? Maybe you guys see an obvious answer that I don't. Thanks again for reading and I look forward to seeing what you guys have to say. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Current Character (Betrayal SC) for reference: [URL"

165,vulnerability,pathofexile,Betrayal League Reflection: Vortex/Cold Snap Occultist CI (as of current patch) is so damn powerful,10,awirad,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/awirad/betrayal_league_reflection_vortexcold_snap/,2019-03-03 02:23:38,"There are only some days left until league is over and I want to post a reflection about my **Vortex/Occultist CI** build (my 3rd character and 1st league). My character name is VortexedGril (public profile, Hologram_o is acc name). Currently **lv 95** (I tend to give up leveling when I reach lv 95 for a character), **10,689 ES, 1042 total mana, 741 mana reserved). I have managed to defeat Catarina deathless (and at worst only one death in 3 runs), Uber Elder (usually one death when solo, but there are deathless runs so lo or not), Elder guardians (no deaths ever), Pale Council, normal &amp; Uber Atziri (one death to uber Atziri, first and only run), Red Elder (no deaths except 1st encounter), Shaper and his guardians (no deaths), and other syndicate encounters (no deaths to any syndicate members ever since level 1). 1. **Offense**: - Vortex (lv 21) as main skill (6 links), Vaal Cold Snap (4 links), cold snap gives frenzy charges, **Elemental Equilibrium** skills: Orb of storms, Frost Bomb and Storm Brand, and **Elemental Overload**, easy to get crits on enemies thanks to Storm Brand and orb of storms hitting multiple times in quick succession. Total Vortex DoT in Path of Building: Roughly **415k total dmg** effective DPS. - Defense: Vaal Discipline, Clarity (low lv to sustain mana), Aspect of the spider lv 20, Enfeeble + cwdt (low levels) and Immortal Call + Inc Duration - Movement skills: Phase run (lv 11), Flame Dash with faster casting and arcane surge (lv 6). 2. **Other defenses**: - Immune to chaos/poison dmg, stun, chill, freeze (ascendancy points), corrupted blood (jewel) and maim (pantheon) - Energy shield occurrence modifier/start of recharge is at 50% only (which could've been a lot higher, but it gives me mostly no problem this league) - Vaal Discipline + Phase run/Flame Dash whenever in grave danger - Flasks: Bismuth flask of resistances (+ 65% elemental resistances), Sulphur Flask of Dousing (deals with ignite while also gives 40% dmg boost), Quicksilver Warding (removes curses and giving 40% extra movement speed), Basalt flask of staunching (defensive and also removes bleed), and Granite Adrenaline (more defense and movement speed). I do have a shock removal flask but rarely use it. - At least 80% elemental resistance (highest is lightning, 113%) Overall I've had quite a blast with the league thanks to this character. Initial leveling can be a bit painful for some, so I had to rely on Arc + Freezing Pulse until lv 28 to get Vortex, and then later on get a Tabula Rasa until lv 70 for a final switch for endgame gearing. It's also my first time running a CI build, so I feel a bit weird having only ONE life at first. So many immunities to various conditions, can tank a Shaper slam from full ES, certain Shaper guardian hits, and especially this build completely obliterated Syndicate regardless of levels. All I have to do is run right into them, pop a basalt/granite flask, place a vortex/cold snap and shred them apart within a few seconds. Tora's toxic rains and Chayula's dmg are laughable. This build has turned Syndicate members into the WORST tier mobs in the game, and I find even **porcupines** and **warbands** a lot more threatening. No trouble with map bosses in general, aside from Malachai with inc attack speed, dmg, life or vulnerability curse on me. Even Rigwald in Dark Forest is no problem when he's in wolf form. Very safe Uber Elder overall, even if I don't have movement speed protector like Kaom's roots (even though I can die in this phase if I mess up positioning). Decent/good clear speed with movement speed + phase run + Vaal cold snap. I really love the playstyle of the build, definitely my most favorite thus far; it's a hybrid of spell that attacks from a distance (cold snap) while also giving me opportunities to practice playing like a melee character (Vortex skill). Big shoutout to player **Idarroc** for creating the guide and helping others like me succeed this league! Comparison with my 2nd character using **Arc Elementalist** build (Enki's guide): - More immunities (especially chaos, vs -15% chaos res), more defenses (arc witch is not immune to stun, chill, freeze or anything else), and quick ES recharge/regen rate, allowing me to tank a lot more hits - Never run out of mana, compared to MoM of arc witch - Great bosskiller skills in Vortex with massive DoT, while Arc (515k DPS) + Storm Brand do less dmg - Never died to Syndicate, while Arc character's fear is Syndicate, died a lot to them - No need to rely on golems for extra cast speed and dmg, Vortex is insta-cast. - No need to leech life/mana from enemies, so can do those map mods with ease. Arc witch has weaker sustain methods and rely on both mana and life to survive. - Cannot do elemental reflect dmg, but arc witch can. - Playstyle is also more convenient: Vortex requires no cast speed, so I can run around a bit and learn mechanics of boss fights more easily than using Arc + Storm Brand spam combo (a lot more movement to dodge things). The slight tradeoff is slower clear speed compared to arc, but much more consistent performance against Syndicate/minibosses. P/S: I hope Vortex isn't going to be nerfed anytime soon (while Arc will be) :(. But for now, I would definitely recommend this build if you want to try out something different, or want a solid build that can do all contents without breaking too much sweat. "
166,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Discussion] the design tyranny of Shavrone's Wrapping,2,axomp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/axomp7/discussion_the_design_tyranny_of_shavrones/,2019-03-06 05:46:46,"So, what do people think of Shav's Wrappings as an item now? From a design space perspective? My view: Seems to me beyond any doubt that low life /ES spellcasting is going to be big in Synthesis, and so I wanted to highlight an area where I think there's a real constraint problem at the moment in PoE character planning: the near necessity of Shavronne's Wrapping for genuine LL builds (as opposed to those that fake it using the belt and then ignore vulnerability using various means). Maybe synthesized mods will finally break into this monopoly but at the moment it looks like we're returning to an era of expensive Shav's, even though as an item alone it's now well outclassed by fossil rares, and crafting chest options. Hopefully character design-limiting things like this will get looked at. "

Let's start from the item definition. ""Corrupts an item, modifying it unpredictably"" . This is a complete antithesis of what the item does. You can totally predict what it will do in the sense there is a limited possibility of outcomes. You can actually target vaal an item to get a predictable implicit. Like vaaling gloves for ele weakness or vulnerability, vaaling amulets for +1 curse. I think this would be one of the most interesting items in the game if it would do what the definition says. How about getting a rare chest with 8 mods that looks like shavs and out of the 2 mods, it has 2 keystones, like vaal pact and resolute technique. I don't know, something that would make the result unpredictable. If the purpose of the vaal orb is to get more quant on maps, and to change implicits, it should be called something else. Also, corruption is definitely used for getting 6 link armours to drop. I think this is an item that if it did what it reads, you could have some unbelievable results. Make vaal unpredictable again!

171,vulnerability,pathofexile,How GGG failed loyal POE players with its unauthorized Steam refund bans,1,a5vim0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/a5vim0/how_ggg_failed_loyal_poe_players_with_its/,2018-12-14 04:21:31,"TL;DR: Without notice or inquiry, GGG banned several players, including me, for financial discrepancies  some from *three or more years ago*  many of which ultimately proved to be Steams fault. The bans were implemented mere hours before the launch of Betrayal (3.5), meaning GGG has been overwhelmed with other support requests and we have had to wait several days just to even begin the process of sorting out what had happened, and we continue to wait in silence for our accounts to be restored. [A note to moderators: While this is a post *about* bans, it is not a post *litigating* the reasons for anyones ban. It's a post about how GGG treats its players.] --- Ive been an avid Path of Exile player for over five years, relishing both the thoughtful complexity of the game and transparent reputation of the company. I honestly thought GGG could do no wrong. But what I and several other players have experienced this week has showed me not only that GGG is fallible, but that it is actually quite capable of greatly disrespecting its customers. # The bans As many of you in the subreddit perhaps noticed, there have been a bunch of threads (at least 6 and counting) since the launch of Betrayal regarding players suddenly being banned for reasons they could not understand. I was one of those players. Betrayal went live at 2 PM for me here in the eastern U.S., so I got home from work early that Friday afternoon, patched, and launched the game  only to receive a message that I had been banned by an administrator. The POE website informed me that I had been banned at 1:16:17 AM that morning (12/7/18), just over 12 hours before the 3.5 launch (when I was very much asleep). The reason stated on the Path of Exile website? Banned due to issuing unauthorised Steam refund. Now, I have been a long-time supporter of POE, spending hundreds of dollars over my years of play, and never in that time had I ever asked for a refund. In fact, Ive made arrangements with GGG in the past to gift even more support to my friends who play. I had no evidence of a Steam refund that I could see, let alone any evidence of suspicious behavior on my account. Plus, the last purchase I had made was for the new supporter packs several weeks prior, and I bought them through POEs website/Xsolla, not Steam. I was *very* confused and very concerned. I saw that several other players were trying to post about having identical experiences being banned on Reddit, but r/pathofexile has a rule prohibiting discussions about bans, so moderators were shutting down these threads. I think this rule exists for good reasons, but I was concerned to see so many posts by similarly gobsmacked players, so I reached out to the moderators, explained my own experience, and pleaded with them that it seemed like there was something seriously wrong. Thanks and kudos to u/MultiplicityPOE, who agreed to make an exception and allowed us to share our concerns and connect over what was happening to us. My initial email to GGG had been met with an automated response indicating a wait of 3-7 days (with a warning not to create a new account in the meantime). I pinged Bex on Twitter about all these threads popping up and my own panicked concerns. She put me in touch with a specific GGG support person, who replied at 10:16 PM my time Friday night, telling me only, This is not an error and the ban was applied to your account appropriately. This was not a helpful nor comforting answer. I sent a support request to Steam asking if they could figure out what was happening on my account, then went to bed restless that I had been unceremoniously dumped by my favorite game after weeks of hype for its newest content. # My investigation In my dayjob, Im a journalist, and given I now had at least 3-7 days of *not* playing Path of Exile ahead of me, I went to work Saturday investigating what happened. Across the various Reddit threads, I identified 16 or so other players who had experienced the exact same unauthorized Steam refund ban (and quite a few *more* since then), all of whom learned of their ban just as they were sitting down to play Betrayal. I reached out to each of them and invited them to share with me some specific details about their own bans. Ultimately, 10 of them agreed to do so, for which I am most grateful. Here is what I learned: * All of us had been banned within the same 5-minute window, about 12 hours and 45 minutes before 3.5 went live. * None of us had ever asked for a POE-related refund through Steam. * Of the few of us who had ever requested a refund from GGG at all, those requests were not made through Steam. * None of us saw any suspicious activity or restrictions on our Steam accounts. Because none of us could make sense of our bans, this seemed like either a significant error on GGGs part or even a potential security vulnerability. I sent GGG an email Sunday morning (my time) explaining what I had learned and also, with their permission, sharing the POE account names of those who had spoken with me in hopes GGG could conduct a swift investigation first thing Monday morning in New Zealand. Late Sunday afternoon (my time), I heard back from the GGG support person Id been in touch with two days prior, who disregarded the concerns Id mentioned in my investigation but finally informed me of the specifics of my ban. I had an unauthorized refund on an Ascendant Supporter Pack, which I had purchased in  get this  *November of 2015*. (**Note: As of this posting, that was the *last* time I heard from GGG.**) I dug back through my Steam transaction history, and sure enough, there it was: a $440 refund I had never asked for. Indeed, the refund had been issued by Steam within a day of when I placed the purchase, and upon reviewing my past statements, I confirmed that the charge never appeared on my credit card at all. (Given it was the holidays and I was doing a lot of other spending, I clearly never noticed the discrepancy.) But I definitely had intended to purchase that pack  one of the biggest single POE purchases Ive ever made  and I was very happy with the MTXs, t-shirt, and signed concept art that came with it! I couldnt fathom why Steam had issued that refund, and I dreaded the thought that I might have inadvertently deprived GGG of money I owed it. I did notice in my email records that I had made a support request to Steam around the time of the refund, but because Steam has since abandoned its old separate Steam Support account system, I couldnt access the ticket to see what I had asked about. (I knew it wasnt for a refund though!) Instead, I updated my new Steam support request, asking for specific details about that refund, and sent a desperate email back to GGG asking if there was a way I could compensate them for the money Id apparently never spent. I also informed the other players Id been in touch with  many of whom had not yet heard back *even once* from a real person at GGG  that they might want to dig back much farther on Steam to see if they could find similar discrepancies. # A Blast from the Past Monday afternoon, around 1 PM my time, I finally received a message back from Steam support. Back in 2015 we accidentally and improperly refunded your Ascendant Pack, the message read. This was an error in our fraud protection system. Steam apologized and promised to reach out to GGG to explain that the mistake was on our part. I shared this news with the other affected players  some of whom *still* had not heard back from GGG other than an automated message  and encouraged them to contact Steam if they hadnt done so already. Even if they didnt yet know the specifics of what prompted GGGs ban, they could at least flag that theyd been banned from POE and request Steams assistance in identifying the problem and hopefully rectifying it. Sure enough, many of the other players also found weird random things in their Steam accounts that they were not aware of. Theirs, like mine, were from three or four years ago. Soon, many of them would likewise confirm that Steam was also responsible for the errors on their account. Some, like me, had been given erroneous refunds because of Steams fraud protection system, while others had received refunds for the wrong game, and others had issues with gift cards being improperly applied. Steam was not responsible in all cases, and some players are still trying to talk to their banks and credit card companies to find explanations for their chargebacks. If GGG allows it, they may, in the end, have to pay out of their own pocket to reconcile their accounts, even if they were not personally responsible for the refunds and chargebacks they face. But in most of the cases, it seemed, we players had done nothing wrong  certainly nothing intentionally nefarious  but we were being punished for Steams mistakes and other complications beyond our control. Now, I want to be clear that I respect GGGs imperative to protect its financial assets. This post is not to dispute its fundamental rationale for taking action against players with financial discrepancies. Indeed, before this all went down, I was rather unfamiliar with the concept of chargebacks, and I quickly came to appreciate how damaging they can be to a company and its financial reputation. But for reasons I describe in more detail below, GGGs decision to impose these automatic bans hurt their player base and arguably were *not* in their business interests. Since Steam has since gone to bat for us, but the process has remained very slow. One player informed that he did have his account restored, but he remains the exception. When I pointed out to my Steam support contact on Tuesday that 24 hours had passed since they verified that they were at fault, he acknowledged that he too was also struggling to establish communication with GGG. This is despite the fact that Id immediately contacted the support person Id been in touch with at GGG to share Steams admission and let them know they should expect to hear from Steam regarding my account. Id originally planned to wait until my account was restored before posting this, but seeing as how were approaching nearly a full week of lost game play and so many other players are exasperated, Im pulling the trigger now in hopes it can do some good. Even with Steams intervention on my behalf, I havent heard from GGG in five days, so I feel it necessary to really shine a light on whats been happening. I have no way of knowing just how many players were actually caught in this sweep, how many of those bans also proved to be Steams fault, or how many of those players will ultimately prevail in restoring access to their POE accounts. Still, these bans speak to systemic problems at GGG in terms of customer service and player respect that need to be addressed. # So many questions Im still super eager to start playing Betrayal (Winter Orb CwC Arctic Breath Hierophant is my first plan), but Im also incredibly soured by GGGs handling of this entire situation. GGG Support informed me in its last email to me Sunday that this matter was thoroughly investigated before this ban was applied. Considering I was punished for something I was not responsible for and had never been contacted about, *that was clearly not the case.* Given these bans were implemented all in one wave, Im left to assume that GGG must have conducted some sort of audit of its finances, identified the discrepancies on our various accounts, and banned us en masse. I certainly understand GGGs need to be paid what its owed, but I have many questions about the decisions it has made when identifying these discrepancies and about its general practices when it comes to interacting with its customers. Lets start here, I guess: ## If the issue was with Steam-related refunds or chargebacks, why was contacting Steam not part of the investigation? Im no businessman, but if my company were partnering with a third-party vendor and we had money missing from that vendor, Id try to figure out what was going on *with that vendor.* My interactions with Steam suggest that GGGs refund concerns were not on their radar at all; in fact, my Steam support contact expressed surprise to learn that I had been banned in 2018 for something on my account from 2015. So many of us found discrepancies that were Steams fault, and I have to imagine that if GGG had attempted to work these issues out with Steam directly, they might have been resolved without us players even being aware of it  let alone being deprived of playing at the launch of a league. ## What kind of investigation doesnt include contacting the player? Because of how little information GGG provided, there was certainly a point when I worried that I was somehow responsible for stealing money from GGG. What a crappy way to feel about a company I adore! How differently would things have played out if GGG had sent me an email simply asking me about the discrepancy? I could have easily resolved this issue with Steam without being banned from the game, and likewise other players could have taken steps with their other financial institutions to get to the bottom of the refunds and chargebacks. Moreover, this lack of outreach speaks to GGGs unwillingness to give players the benefit of the doubt: Did GGG think so little of us that they automatically concluded we were thieves? We had all spent far more on POE over the years than what we had received in these refunds, so it shouldnt be so unreasonable to think that wed be loyal enough to take the steps necessary to get our accounts in order  even if we were personally to blame instead of Steam. Had that contact happened, I never would have had to feel like I was guilty of something I never did. Likewise, a *suspension* (as opposed to an outright ban) could have softened the blow and better motivated players to take action, but honestly that still strikes me as an overwrought reaction. Its one thing for your character to RIP to a lag spike playing hardcore, because thats the risk you take. Its quite another for your account to RIP in real life due to someone elses error. ## Why are players not provided with any notification that they were banned? This question similarly speaks to a disappointing lack of communication on GGGs part. I had to find out about my ban by attempting to log in to play the game, as did many others. The only information I could access about my ban was a four-word description  issuing unauthorised Steam refund  with no specifics about what happened. When I first heard from a real person at GGG, they *still* provided no specific information about the details of my ban. It was more than 48 hours after my original support request that I first learned exactly what I was being punished for, and it has been far longer for others. *Even then*, GGG made no attempt to assist me in addressing the issue. This made me feel totally helpless and disrespected as a customer. ## Why is there no established process for how to appeal bans? At no point in the process did GGG ever communicate to us players any information about what process they follow to review these bans. It was almost as if the ban meant the relationship was over before we could even begin a conversation about what was happening. Before Steam confirmed that they were responsible for the mistake on my account, I had sent an email to GGG *begging* to let me pay the money it appeared I owed. But I still wasnt sure if such a process actually existed! The only clue that there was a way out of a ban was the initial automated messages warning that we were not permitted to create a new Path of Exile account until this matter has been resolved. If GGG has an internal procedure for review and restitution, they apparently do not communicate it to players. The current practice appears to be: Ban first, ask no questions later. I completely understand that there may be bans for which GGG would want to have a no-exceptions policy (such as for hacking/cheating or real-money trading), but it seems like quite a bad business strategy to not provide loyal customers with any opportunity to rectify financial discrepancies. ## Why were we allowed to continue making purchases if our accounts were flagged for bans? Though I was no longer playing the Delve league, I had bought the new Betrayal support packs and was ready to try out my new MTXs in the new league. Being banned with no notice just a few weeks after that purchase (over a refund from **three years ago**) left me feeling like GGG was the one stealing *from me.* This speaks again to my first question about the relationship between GGG and Steam, as I am very confused about how long it took GGG to realize it had not received the payment for my 2015 Ascendant Pack purchase. Surely it had to have been at least by the end of that fiscal year, which was at least two years (and many more leagues and support packs) ago. If that refund was grounds for banning my account, I would think that would call into question the sincerity of any transactions GGG accepted from me after my account was flagged  to the tune of hundreds of dollars. ## Why was the day of a launch selected to implement the bans? GGG support informed me during one of my inquiries over the weekend that they were handling thousands of support requests, so I really wanted to be sympathetic to how slowly they were responding to concerns. Certainly, my circumstances were not directly caused by the specific individuals trying to assist me, and I appreciate the hard work they all do. Nevertheless, its hard to be sympathetic to GGG writ large  especially days of silence later  because the timing couldnt have been worse. Surely GGG could anticipate that banned users would seek review and appeal of our bans immediately (whether they have such a process or not!). By implementing the bans just 12 hours before the patch went live, GGG set up a situation where it would be the least equipped to offer the necessary support. Not only was it a weekend, but the game was set to hit gameplay records, ensuring support staff would be spread incredibly thin. (POE did break those records, so congrats by the way!) This also resulted in these unwarranted bans hitting us players at the most punishing moment possible. For competitive players and streamers, this may have been particularly detrimental, possibly even resulting in lost income. User u/Biscosmademedoit is one of the other players who has been vocal about his ban this week. He [shared yesterday](URL that Chris had emailed him to tell him that there were 1400 people waiting for various questions and that he was even contemplating hiring more staff to accommodate the load. One is left to wonder just how many of those requests were related to bans from this sweep. Had we been contacted in the weeks prior  or, you know, *years ago* when these refunds and chargebacks actually transpired  we could have resolved these issues with our accounts when support staff were more available to assist us. How genuinely sad it would be if GGG ended up losing money hiring supplemental support staff to handle the perfect storm it had created for itself by caring more about money issues than the customer experience in the first place. # Final Thoughts Ive been following the new content vicariously through Reddit and Twitch and it all looks as engaging and impressive as ever. But as much as I might eventually enjoy it, that doesnt mean my relationship with GGG will automatically heal. Whereas in the past I wouldnt think twice about immediately buying a support pack, Im not so sure how quick Ill be to open my wallet as new supporter packs come around. I was one of an untold number of players who have been deprived of nearly a week of prime league playtime (and who knows how much longer) for something that wasnt our fault. Its also not clear that GGG will be offering players any compensation for this undue punishment. If any other company treated customers this way, they would try to make amends. Just last month, Amazon gave me a $10 credit after a package was delayed by three days without notice. Its not much, but its something, and made me feel like they valued me as a customer. All Im saying is: A couple Fairgraves Mystery Boxes costs you nothing, GGG, and is frankly the least you can do after this debacle. I know that account issues and ban issues constitute the one area of GGGs business where it tends not to be so transparent, and I dont necessarily fault them for that. I likewise dont expect any specific responses to the questions Ive posed here. I do, however, hope GGG seriously considers reevaluating some of the mechanisms by which it interacts with customers when issues come up. I still have great admiration for POE and I will still encourage others to play it. But I also want to be able to guarantee theyll have a good experience as a consumer, and I dont feel like I can provide such assurances anymore. A banned player spends no money, and this entire process has painted a picture of a company that isnt committed to retaining players  not even longtime players who have invested hundreds of dollars into the game. That cant be a decision that is ultimately good for its business. Loyalty needs to be a two-way street, or its meaningless. (If President Trump can be credited for teaching the world anything, its that.) GGG has given me every reason over the years to expect better from them, and frankly, we deserve better."

Aside from whatever mods your build is weak to, if you're having syndicate trouble you might want to avoid: - critical chance/multiplier mods - mods which modify your resists (or grab bismuth flask or purity of elements) - mods which increase attack/movespeed - mods which curse you with vulnerability Some of the syndicate members are more dangerous than others: Janus Perandus - in T10+ maps, make sure to constantly keep moving, he has a physical damage burning-ground-like AoE which can be deadly. It looks like golden swords coming from the ground. Korrell - His short range fire AoE can apply a very strong ignite which can be deadly. Flask with dousing suffix is a big help to avoid burning to death. It That Fled - In T10+ maps, keep rank 0 or 1 unless you have over 0% chaos resist and at least 5k life. Has a slow wind-up AoE shaped like a large purple hand which can easily kill if you lack chaos resist. Tora - same as It That Fled, except her Toxic Rain is faster, harder to see, and larger. If you have her and It in your syndicate, carry an Amethyst Flask and get some chaos resist. Cameria - drops some ice spikes on the ground which explode when you run through them. As you rank him up they seem to become less visible, eventually being almost invisible. These can do a large amount of cold damage. Leo - leaps at you, doing very high physical damage. His attacks seem particularly accurate, and are very hard to dodge if he has increased movement speed or attack speed. Can be deadly if you can't escape/control the distance to him, or kill him quickly. Riker - if left alone, can focus you with attacks. If you damage him, he will stealth and run away a short distance before reappearing. Not terribly dangerous unless left alone, but has considerable range. Benefits significantly from attack speed, crit, and accuracy. The rest of the syndicate as far as I have experienced is not as dangerous as these. If you have any tips for specific syndicate members, please comment and I will add them."

With Enfeeble, their hit will be weaken and when you start hitting them, Vulnerability will then apply the curse and overriding Enfeeble.

184,vulnerability,pathofexile,The problem with curses on bosses,1,9z3d0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/9z3d0o/the_problem_with_curses_on_bosses/,2018-11-22 00:49:24,"Before i get to the main problem, here are the facts. Most applications of curses are basically useless on bosses, but especially on Shaper/Elder, due to the 60/80% less curse effectiveness on them. Builds that rely on a single curse to enable their playstyle, suddenly dont work properly anymore on bosses. As an example, take a highly specialized crimson dance melee bleed build that relies on vulnerability to cap out on bleed chance. On bosses this doesnt work due to the less effectiveness. The one area where it is needed to work, it doesnt do so. This is true for many areas of the game, and diminishes the power of single curse enabled playstyles. And why is all of this the case? Because a couple of highly specialized curse setups can completely trivialize bosses if they did not have the less curse effectiveness. Mainly enfeeble and temporal chain setups with a high amount of +skills and +quality on them. The fact that you can heavily invest into those two gems to increase their power isnt the issue. The main problem is the fact that their effectiveness increases exponentially instead of linearly. If you increase the strength of poachers mark, elemental weakness, assasins mark, vulnerability (pretty much all the gems except enfeeble and temporal chains) by simply adding 50% flat to the numbers on them, then thats all you get. You get a linear increase to the efficiency. Its not gonna have a gamebreaking impact on the game or on bosses. If you increase the numbers on temporal chains or enfeeble by a flat 50%, you dont get a linear efficiency increase. You get an exponential efficiency increase. The closer the effects on those two curses get to 100%, the more efficient they get (exponentially). Quick example: Going from 0% to 1% slower enemies, means they are 1% slower than before. Going from 98% to 99% slower enemies, means they just became half as quick as before. Going from 99% to 100% means they became infinitely slower. So the problem really lies in the fact that quality on these gems grants a flat % increase instead of a multiplicative increase, which enables specializing into these gems to get them to such high percentages that their effectiveness increases exponentially at very high numbers, trivializing bosses. So GGG made a bandaid fix and added a 60/80% less effectiveness onto bosses, rendering all other curses and cursesetups useless, except the ones that are highly specialized into temporal chains and enfeeble. The real fix would have been to take a look at temporal chains and enfeeble (and/or enhance), and to change them in such a way that their power isnt increased exponentially anymore by speccing into them, but instead to have a linear power increase like all other curses do. The current state of curses on bosses is pathetic and solely stems from the fact that the way temporal chains and enfeeble works (in an exponential manner) has been left unchecked. tl;dr Enfeeble and temporal chains scale exponentially the stronger they get, while all other curse gems scale linearly. Thus GGG made a bandaid fix and slapped 60/80% less curse effectiveness onto bosses to prevent them from being trivialized by enfeeble/temporal chains. This made all curses except those two pretty much negligible against bosses, while those two continue to reign supreme and will always reign supreme as long as they scale exponentially."

For example, imagine an Ancestral Warchief Build with a standard cap of 3 totems when using Tukohama's Fortress and Ancestral Bond. Suppose this build now wants to use 2 more totems as utility support in a separate 4-link, and is intending to use Flame Totem with Combustion for additional fire damage taken by the enemy, and a Decoy Totem for additional safety. Now that our example is out there, let us walk through what will occur when one intends to use these totems. The 3 AW Totems go off without a hitch, hitting the normal cap of 3. We more over and hit our Q key, which we have bound to our Flame Totem, and we place 2 Flame Totems at the same time, and thus instantly hitting our effective cap of 5 totems. We realize the issue, and then hit our W key to place our Decoy totem, however it also casts 2 totems at once, and we are left with 2 Decoy Totems, 2 Flame Totems, and only 1 Ancestral Warchief totem actually doing damage. Ahh, maybe we should cast them in reverse? Decoy Totem, Flame Totem, and then 3 AW Totems. Sounds like a solution, except for the fact that since both of our Decoy totems were cast before our Flame totem, casting 5 AW totems afterward will eat all of our Decoy Totems before replace a single Flame Totem, and once again we end with 3 AW and 2 Flame Totem. Essentially what I'm saying is that this support gem kills any chance of using varied support totems. Really interesting ideas, such as a Rejuvenation totem and a Spell Totem cursing with Vulnerability, or a Shockwave Totem with Reverse Knockback and an Ancestral Protector are thrown out the window. This issue applies both to both main totem and self cast/attack builds that want to use more than 2 different totems."

192,vulnerability,pathofexile,How Player damage is scaled (lots of math in side),1,9pmp5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/9pmp5g/how_player_damage_is_scaled_lots_of_math_in_side/,2018-10-20 05:46:22,"I'm tired of everyone using ""more"" multiplier when it's not. There are 11 separate ways to scale your damage, since damage can scale infinitely each increase after the last will be less meaningful. Meaning you want to scale each of the 11 as evenly as possible (within reason). All sources are multiplicative with each other. A:Flat damage, spells have a built in flat damage and attacks use weapon damage, other sources include abyss jewels, mods on jewelry, and Empower. All skills have a built in damage effectiveness on how well they scale with flat increases. IE Volitile dead with enchant has a damage effectiveness of 480% with enchant vs Ice crash at 208%. Meaning 10 flat damage for VD is 48 damage vs 20.8 for IC. This is before it's multiplied with other multipliers. B: %increased damage modifiers, This is one of the most easily accessible mods in the game and is extremely plentiful on the tree, with certain unique items you can get thousands of % increased damage generally making this stat under valued. Keep in mind balance is key. C: ""More multipliers"" your bread and butter skill gem choices. If it's not a more multiplier it's generally not a very useful support gem. All more multipliers are additive with each other IE 6L giving 5 40% more multi's is 200% in this catagory. It's generally difficult to reach a massive amount of % MORE damage here, as there are a few keystones and skills that give a More multiplier outside of your standard support gems. (Righteous Fire and Pain Attunement) D: ""Gained as"" mods. The classic hatred and new shaper ""stat sticks."" It's also found in cold to fire, atziri's promise, Incandesent heart, and many others. E: Accuracy, Spells have an inherent 100% accuracy as they bypass evasion, accuracy caps at 95% with the exception of hit's can't be evaded. F: Crit Chance, Most skills have a base crit chance or can obtain a base through the inc crit strikes support gems and other sources. The total crit chance % is [(Sum of all base crit)(sum of all %increased crit)(sum of all more/less crit chance)]*lucky. Lucky it rolls it twice, Ie if i have 50% crit chance it will bump it to 75%, The cap on crit is 95% normally, but can achieve over 95 through special mods, use of lucky, assassin's mark (applies after Ie 90% crit chance +9% additional chance from assassin's mark leaving with 99%). Crit chance also checks accuracy to see if you crit, so if you have low accuracy it will also affect your crit chance. G: Crit Multiplier: The base crit multiplier is 150% So if I have 100% crit and accuracy I'll do 1.5x as much damage. If i have 1000% I'll do 10x as much as normal. If I have 5% crit chance and 1000% crit multiplier I'll on average do 69% more damage than before. It's best to balance this stat along side crit chance and accuracy (if applicable) Assassin's mark has a 20% increased damage mod for the extra damage from crits. (10 base damage 200% multi meaning I would do 22 damage instead of 20.) H: Enemies take increased damage: This mod shows up on a few sources such as, Shock, Vulnerability, intimidate and more. I: Elemental Resistances: How much resistance does your enemy have? The more they have the more beneficial it is, however it's still a great stat to have. There are several sources of penetration on the tree as well as support gems. Reduction of enemy resistances include, Ele equilibrium, Curses and a few others. J: Application speed: How fast can you apply your damage, attacks invest into attack speed, spell's cast speed, trigger gems CDR, traps throwing speed, totems placement and attack/cast speed, etc. Each case is different, they all have a base cast time or attack time that is determined by spell, weapon and cooldown. If I have a weapon with 2.0 attacks per second and 100% attack speed I now attack 4x a second where as if I have an attack speed base of 1.5 and 100% attack speed it's only 3x a second. It's the same functionality as previously discussed in flat damage. If you have a slow cast/attack speed base it may be better to scale other sources of damage or change the base value with spells such as cast while channeling or triggering it with Poet's pen or cast on crit. K: double damage: maximum chance of 100%, very few sources being threshold jewels and shaper mods being a few sources. This applies to all damage you do IE (A*b*c)*K=DPS The full math is a sum of all letters in this formula. [A*B*C*D(E*F*G)J]*k= DPS (DPS)H*I= Effective DPS There are some area's that are easy to scale and other's that' aren't. If you have a massive amount of A and C but no B you're overall not going to be better off scaling more A and C but B. Please correct me if I'm wrong on any of this and I'll edit it in. I think it'll be useful for newer players and I often get the question ""how to I improve my build"" from some friends who have a good build but is RT cyclone using disfavor and while it's good you're losing out on damage from not going crit. If it's highly requested I might do one on defenses but while outdated Project PT made a good video on defenses and I'm sure other's have made video's as well."

196,vulnerability,pathofexile,AURABOT : a supportive type of gameplay,1,9vjg0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/9vjg0v/aurabot_a_supportive_type_of_gameplay/,2018-11-09 21:44:57,"I've seen alot of newer players due to the Diablo Immortal absolute shitstorm. First of all Welcome, and Hi to POE players who want to read. &amp;#x200B; Many of my in game friends requested me a guide about this. So i decided to creat a quick guide about a supportive way to play Path of Exile. &amp;#x200B; Some of you may know me, as a dedicated Aurabot player (i try to build a min maxed aurabot every league), and i want people to understand how usefull it is to have an aurabot working for YOU. &amp;#x200B; Quick definition of an Aurabot : it's a character basically running **ALOT** of auras (defensive or offensive), **providing A TONS of stats** to allies. \- Usual **Defensive auras** that can be runned by an Aurabot : \- Purity of FIRE (increasing the maximum resistance, increasing the total resistance) --&gt; Fire resistance (for exemple you can cap you ally to 81% fire resistance instead of 75%) \- Purity of ICE (increasing the maximum resistance, increasing the total resistance) --&gt; Cold resistance \- Purity of LIGHTNING (increasing the maximum resistance, increasing the total resistance) --&gt; Lightning resistance \- Purity of elements (increase the total amount of resistance of Fire, Cold, Light) : 3 resistances for 1 aura but it doesn't increase the maximum resistance (cap will still be 75%) \- Vitality (increasing the life regeneration) \- Determination (increasing the total armor, reducing physical damage taken) \- Grace (increasing evasion and chance to evade attacks) \- Haste (increasing mouvement speed) \- Discipline (increase the energy shield and add a flat amount of energy shield) \- Curses (it's another topic but Aurabots can provide some curses to help avoiding the DEATH such as temporal chains, enfeeble...) \- Usual **Offensive auras** that can be runned by an Aurabot: \- Anger (adds flat fire damage) \- Wrath (adds flat lightning damage) \- Hatred (cadd a converted part of physical damage as cold damage) \- Curses (still another topic but Aurabot can provide curses that help DESTROYING packs of monsters such as vulnerability, elemental weakness etc..) \- Vaal skills: some corrupted skill gems give an addition skill with the same remaining skill. Exemple a Vaal Haste gives you an aura (Haste) + an active skill (Vaal haste) both aura + active on the SAME skill gem. This kind of gem is SUPER USEFULL. It allows you to have an additionnal skill when you run the aura providing different benefits. Most usefull vaal auras runned by Aurabots: \- Vaal Haste (increase attack speed and mouvement speed during a short amont of time) \- Vaal Grace (increase evasion during a short amont of time) \- Vaal Discipline (allow as soon as you use it to start the energy shield recovery even during a combat) Those skills need a delay of recovery + some souls (provided when you or your ally kill a monster) !! &amp;#x200B; Playing Aurabot is based on the fact that you can do a combinaison of those auras. Basically the more auras you can run the better your are. Aurabots are stacking alot of ""Increase Aura effect"" nodes in the skill tree, plus most of the stuff is oriented to get aura gems levels (such as Victario, Prism guardian, empowers gems --&gt; +2 to 4 level of supported gems). This kind of stacking able aurabots to run +200% aura effects and auras lv26 (those stats varie based on how expensive is the build) &amp;#x200B; Q: How to stack auras it costs alot of mana reservation !!!! A: Aurabots are working thanks to 2 stats in the game: \- Reduced mana reservation : this is the main stat that helps stacking up to 13 auras. Different items provide you this stat : Victario's influence chest (local reduced mana reservation --&gt; only apply on socketed gems), Alpha's howl (local), Prism guardian (local), Shaper amulet (with reduced mana reservation shaper mod ilvl:80+ --&gt; Global: it applies on every auras equipped no matter where you got it), Shaper shield (reduced socket mana reservation of socketed gems (local)), Skyforth (global 8% reduced really expensive item). Conqueror potency jewel: (3% reduced mana reservation global) Corrupted vaal implicit modes on jewels / abyss jewels (really rare vaal implicit) : You can stack up jewels or abyss jewels with the ""reduced mana reservation: 1%"" some builds use up to 6 jewels with this implicit reducing by 6% (global) the mana reservation. Labyrinthe enchantement: On helmets you can get an implicit (1 more stat on an armor piece) that reduce the mana reservation of 1 aura"". Exemple ""Hatred takes 50% less mana reservation"". Enlighten support gems: this gems is particular (like the empower support gem), Enlighten is primarily used to decrease the amount of [mana reservation](URL of linked skills. This effect is multiplicative with the effects of x% Reduced Mana Reservation modifiers. Though Enlighten can also be used to decrease the mana cost of linked active skills \- Blood magic: this skill allows you to use life instead of mana to cast spells, so you can reserve life instead of mana to cast your auras. The main item wich can provide you blood magic is Prism guardian. It ables you to cast 3 auras on life (and the reservation is affected by global mana reservation) &amp;#x200B; Why are AURABOTS that usefull : \- The main reason of playing with an Aurabot is SPEEDFARMING ; optimizing your time spent in a map is highly correlated with how many times you can run a map. Getting an Aurabot helps you clearing maps way faster depending of the map difficulty (you double / triple your dps, you can jump between packs and kill them faster). \- Stayin'alive: Running high tier maps can be rippy for certain builds (MF ones in particular). Mf builds are usually lacking of resistance / life / survability (wich can be deadly past certain tier of maps) \- Reducing the overall difficulty : gear condition is way easier to get if you got a fatty aurabot near you providing +100 to all res (except chaos) and +250% dps. Pretty easy to faceroll isn't it? &amp;#x200B; Various way of playing AURABOTS. different ways of playing aurabot exists and can be really different in term of utility (writting it soon after i gather some really good aurabot builds) \- Scion \- Guardian \- Occultist \- Hybrid &amp;#x200B; Hopefully this will be usefullto newer and older players to understand how works ""this way of playing"" and how usefull it can be Every advice on the format (grammar etc..) are welcome. To my friend Aurabot feel free to comment and add details ill keep edditing this post. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

I'm saying could, because the actual zone level is level 60 in my level 7 hideout, leaving me with level 60 Spectres if I do that. Which obviously doesn't work for me since I don't farm level 60 zones but Shaper and Uber Elder, which are level 84. I don't think I have to explain the huge difference between a level 60 Spectre and a level 84 Spectre. My build specifically uses Armour Cruncher, a beast that applies Vulnerability and is EXTREMELY hard to find. I can't even find it in zones that both the Wiki and poedb recommend to look. Now, imagine you are using or trying to use a snowflake Spectre build using very rare monsters. You are basically fucked if one or two die. Now, when doing Uber Elder my Spectres end up dying here and there. Meaning it's super hard for me to get my Armour Cruncher back (actually near impossible), because for some reason it just won't spawn there, not even after 10-15 minutes of constant Desecrate spam (my other Spectres spawn, no problem). **TLDR:** It would be of great help, not only to me but in general as a Spectre Summoner, if your hideout would scale up to your current level up to a maximum of 84 (max zone level). E.g. if you are level 85, the hideout will be 84 and if you are level 50, your hideout will be level 50. This would allow you to spam Desecrate to make sure you have your specific Spectres available before you enter a super hard fight like Uber Elder. I'm not sure if that's technically possible, if not, why not just make your hideout level 84 to begin with? Anyone else feel the same?"

My thoughts on scaling and gearing: My main skill will be either dominating blow or static strike. With the new minion nodes on the top of templar we dont need to go out of our way to grab weapon specific nodes and instead go full into minion damage. I opted to use Kongors Undying Rage for the usefull ""cant miss"" mod, saving a few points to resolute technique. It also has good dps for a two hander. Other items are shaper and elder rares. These dont need a high item level so they can be farmed by myself too. I would be using a +2 Minion helm with the elder minion dmg support. Gloves are also elder with faster attacks, to save up a socket. Boots are Bones of Ulur, a placeholder, as we seen additional spectre/zombie mods from the delve currency. All other items are just going to be filled with life, resists and some added phys damage if possible. Jewels would probably take the longest to find/buy, life and minion dmg will be sought after. For flasks, i would get a lions roar at some point, thats about it there. Minions: I will be using Zombies as meatshields and aoe support. They deal very high dmg on their slam, around 50k. The herald of ash will be the new herald of purity, in the same link as the spectres. For specters i will be using the Kitavas Heralds for their tankyness and decent damage. Blasphemy-Vulnerability does a very nice dmg boost for both my minions and me. I hope this is read-able, and i wish everyone a good jump into DELVE!"

I was so happy GGG gave some buffs to SSF (esp maps) in this patch, and now they made it so Guardians can bring along their own army of thematically appropriate minions. So I can have a party of allies to take advantage of my guardian buffs without leaving SSF. I truly enjoy the challenge of SSF and am curious what gear I can find to fit into the thematic Holy warrior GGG has laid out for us in the 3.4 update. I am going to attempt to make an ""I am Legion"" Guardian using the new dominating blow, herald of purity, holy relic. This is a character I have dreamed of making for many years. I will try the new consecrated path skill for movement outside of the labs. If it doesn't play smoothly I will fall back on leap slam or shield charge depending on what items drop for me. I will likely curse with vulnerability and/or enfeeble. I doubt I will use a warcry as auras take up so many sockets. I will be using a skill tree similar to my past guardian characters spreading out for the 34% decreased reserve mana stats that are capable of 7-9 auras, arctic armor, and a herald. However, now I will be swapping my spell and elemental damage nodes for the new minion nodes in the Templar area. The character shouldn't really need any uniques to make it to lvl 10 mapping. However, to take this character to endgame, begin reserving life, go full ES, and take the Radiant Faith Guardian ascendancy notable, I will have to farm a Shav's.

Although I'm sure this is not terrible original, I have been out of the scene for many years and am quite clueless about the game now, I wanted to share my build concept. [Tidebreaker Gore Knight](URL [Jump straight to a video of a map run.](URL [Defensive stats.](URL [Offensive stats.](URL (DPS varies depending on buffs active). Conceptually the idea was to take advantage of the Endurance Charge, for both defense and offensive. Tidebreaker with the built-in ""Endurance Charge on Melee stun"" which now grants 4&amp;#37; more physical damage per endurance charge lines up really well with this idea. Not to mention the great synergies between the Juggernaut ascendancy and endurance charges. I wanted to do a pure physical damage build. I don't want to go much into gear details, but a 6L Tidebreaker is pretty important (before I got a 6L I used Hatred and HoA) and the Vulnerability on Hit glove corruption is quite key (basically 35&amp;#37; more damage). The belt of the deceiver adds another 10&amp;#37; more damage and is quite good with the life implicit corruption. This build gets into trouble in regards to resistances and therefore every single Purity (Lightning, Fire, Ice) is utilized to compensate for this. This also provides a great defensive buff against elemental damage, leaving your max resists at 81&amp;#37;, 80&amp;#37;, 80&amp;#37;. I accomplish 10 endurance charges which leaves me with 52&amp;#37; (Oak 2&amp;#37;) base physical reduction before armor and before fortify/redundancies are taken into account. My life pool is a bit low, however, sitting at 6351 at level 91 (will be 6500 at level 92). With the Kaom's Way rings I'm hitting 1105 base life regen with 10 endurance charges up, which seems quite good. With mobs hitting me I can easily reach 1600 life regen via the Asendancy. My gear can still be improved but I consider the build finished in general. **Vaal Earthquake** The new change where Vaal skills include the original skill is the best ever and Vaal Earthquake is so much fun. Works wonders with Phase Run and movementspeed. **Feedback?** I really have no idea about the meta or what's good or not anymore, so I'd love to know if this build fits within utter shite category or approaching mediocre+? What can kill me as I now start to push content? Can I still get one-shotted by things? Any tips on how to improve further?"

[This is the most recent forum post I've seen. ](URL [Coward's Legacy](URL is a new unique belt that states "" You count as on [Low Life](URL while you are Cursed with [Vulnerability](URL "". The belt curse you with vulnerability as well as increasing the effect of cursed on you. Myself like many others I'm sure would like this to work with the Champion Ascendancy node [Adrenaline](URL When first looking at the belt I figured you couldn't use any flask that makes you curse immune and I was okay with that. Playing Champion you are already naturally tanky and the buff's from Adrenaline I think offer a good trade off. Plus there are other ways of reducing the effect of curses rather than immunity. Another issue, as seen in the [forum post](URL is that map curses would override the belts curse and thus deactivate the pseudo low life. If any of the interactions that can occur with this belt are bugged, I think this absolutely is. I could understand if the wording/concept of Adrenaline is not meant to combine with this belt. But there are many other low life items that should work with this belt that currently would suffer if you were running a cursed map. At the very least GGG should look into that, maybe adding ""Curse ignores player curse limit"" so that as long as you have the belt you are cursed with Vulnerability. But me personally I would like to hear their thoughts/reasoning for it not working with Adrenaline. I don't see a scenario as a Champion where you can completely negate the vulnerability curse except with maybe an obscure combination of uniques at which point the build wouldn't be viable imo(lose out on other valuable gear slots). What are your thoughts on the aspects of this items interaction?"

The twist on this build is that it uses the unique Soul Taker Siege Axe to provide defensive mitigation by allowing our pure Physical damage to Chill (39% maximum enemy speed reduction) and Physical and Bleed damage scaling using the Hypothermia Support Gem allowing us to reliably reach 450k+ DPS. Written guide Google Doc located at: URL **Build Summary** The Soul Taker Spectral Shield Throw Blood Slushy Gladiator is a really fun active playstyle build capable of mapping all the way to Tier 16 with Boss kills, Atziri / Uber Atziri viable, Red Elder, and Shaper viable. **Offensively,** we are using pure Physical &amp; Bleed damage delivered with Spectral Shield Throw for both mob clearing and single target. Our clear speed is augmented with Bleed Explosions through the Gladiator Ascendancy Gratuitous Violence passive and Spirit Burst through the use of a Lightpoacher Helm. We use two very fast and flexible movement skills Shield Charge and Leap Slam to quickly navigate any terrain. **Defensively,** we are using a multilayered defense setup with high Armour (50%+ mitigation), high Evasion (50%+ evade chance), and high Block &amp; Spell Block (50%+ Block &amp; Spell Block). Our moderate chance to gain Phasing (14%+) keeps us very elusive and smooth moving during mapping. We are also applying Maim, Chill, and Blind to our enemies to greatly reduce their speed and chance to hit. Our playstyle is Shield Charge into the first pack, use Frenzy and take damage until our Blood Rage and Tempest Shield trigger, throw shields until everything explodes, Shield Charge to the next pack and throw more shields. Our bonus Flasks charges and Overflowing Chalice allow us to run nearly 100% uptime on our Flasks so we piano key as we go. **Level 92 Vital Statistics** **Defensive Mitigation** Life - 5,321 Evasion - 1,580 Evade Chance - 57% Armour - 14,650 Physical Damage Reduction - 54% Block &amp; Spell Block Chance - 53% Attack Dodge Chance - 49% Spell Dodge Chance - 34% **Offensive Statistics** Hit DPS - 236,522 Bleed DPS - 30,079.3 (per stack) Total DPS - 477,156.4 **Path of Building Pastbin** URL **Pros &amp; Cons** **Pros** * Very durable character with multilayered defensive mitigations * Medium to fast clear speed through Tier 16 maps * Can run most map mods * No gem swaps **Cons** * Spectral Shield Throw is love or hate skill * Top end DPS will max out around 500k * Endgame gear can be expensive * Leveling with Spectral Shield Throw from 30 - 50 is painful **Final Passive Tree &amp; Progression** We are taking the following **Keystone Passives** * Resolute Technique - The mechanics of Spectral Shield Throw require an accuracy check on both the Shield and each individual Shard which can make frequent missing a real problem without significant investment into accuracy on our tree and / or gear. One keystone fixes that problem. * Blood Magic - Scaling pure physical and bleed damage leaves us very few offensive aura options and our multi layered defense doesnt require a defensive aura. This keystone is an easy choice. * Iron Grip - Our Strength number in our final tree will scale well over 300 making this one point a no brainer. * Crimson Dance - Big bleed DPS boost for boss fighting * Point Blank - Our playstyle is mostly up close and personal making this node another easy choice for DPS. We start as the Duelist Class moving down and left on the tree through the strength nodes to Master of the Arena Notable passive. We then move down and take all the shield nodes in the Defiance Notable passive wheel. We then travel left on the tree grabbing Strength nodes until we reach the Hard Knocks Notable passive and move down and then up and to the left through the Strength nodes grabbing the Iron Grip Keystone passive node and pushing up and left directly to Resolute Technique Keystone passive in the Marauder area. We then return to the lower left of the tree and take the Blood Magic Keystone passive with the additional life wheel including Mortal Conviction Notable passive wheel behind Blood Magic Keystone passive. Now we grab the entire Bloodless Notable passive life wheel and the entire Red Storm Notable passive wheel in the lower left section of the tree. We take the left half of the Juggernaut Notable passive life wheel and then we travel down and right grabbing Strength and the Crimson Dance Keystone passive. We then return the the area below the Defiance Notable passive wheel moving down and right through Golems Blood Notable passive grabbing the life nodes and further down into the Shield notable passive wheel at the bottom of the tree where we take both Testudo Notable and Retaliation Notable and all connected nodes except the bottom Shield Defenses node. We then return to the area left of Master of the Arena and move left and up to the Scion life wheel grabbing the Jewel Socket along the way and taking Constitution notable passive and 4 life nodes plus the Path of the Warrior Notable passive. Back down to the area right of Hard Knocks Notable passive we take the entire Bloodletting Notable passive wheel. Then return the bottom Shield wheel and push right to the Dirty Techniques Notable wheel where we take the right side of the wheel. Then push right and grab the Point Blank Keystone passive. Push up and right to the right side of the Graceful Assault Notable passive wheel taking the right side of the wheel and the entire Thick Skin Notable passive life wheel. We then return to Master of the Arena Notable passive and push right through the life nodes to Art of the Gladiator Notable passive and continue right taking the entire Command of Steel Notable passive wheel before returning to the area right of Golems Blood Notable passive where we take the lower half of the Savagery and Cloth and Chain Notable passives. We then return the area directly beneath Command of Steel Notable passive and push right and up to the Finesse Notable passive continuing right through Precise Interception Notable passive and taking the entire Herbalism Notable passive life wheel. Return to the area between Finesse Notable passive and Herbalism Notable passive and push up into Weapon Artistry Notable passive and the left side of the wheel up to Aspect of the Lynx Notable passive. We then return to the area directly left of the Herbalism Notable passive wheel and grab the dexterity node moving up and right to the Fervour Notable passive. This brings us to Level 92 at which point you can grab additional life nodes or open Jewel sockets as you see fit. **Class &amp; Ascendancy** **Class** Our chosen class is the Duelist with the Gladiator Ascendancy. The Gladiator Ascendancy is the best way to scale Bleed chance and damage, has the excellent Bleed Explosion for mob clearing and great defensive mitigation with shields using Block, and Spell Block. **Ascendancy** Recommended Ascendancy Class progress is: 1. Blood in the Eyes (The Labyrinth) 2. Gratuitous Violence (The Cruel Labyrinth) 3. Painforged (The Merciless Labyrinth) 4. Versatile Combatant (The Eternal Labyrinth) **Pantheon Options** **Major God** Soul of Lunaris Physical damage reduction, movement speed, chance to avoid projectiles, chance to dodge, avoid chained projectiles all synergies well with our overall defenses. **Minor God** Soul of Garukhan Chance to evade and movement speed all synergies well with our overall defenses. **Gem Links** **6 Link - Chest Armor** Spectral Shield Throw + Brutality + Maim + Physical Projectile Damage + Swift Affliction + Hypothermia + Pierce (Pseudo 7th link from Lioneyes Vision) All Support gems scale our Physical &amp; Bleed damage. We will be using the unique Soul Taker Siege Axe to Chill with Physical damage enabling the use of the Hypothermia Support Gem on our pure physical damage for 39% More Damage multiplier with Hits and Ailments as well as increased 20% effect of Chill and 10% chance to Freeze enemies who are chilled. **4 Link - Boots** Shield Charge + Leap Slam + Fortify + Faster Attacks Shield Charge is our primary movement and positioning skill. Leap Slam is our secondary movement skill for jumping obstacles and gaps. Both are linked to Faster Attacks and Fortify Support Gems. **3 Link - Shield** Cast When Damage Taken + Tempest Shield + Blood Rage Tempest Shield is used for its 3% chance to block. Blood Rage is used for increased attack speed, Frenzy charge generation and Life leech. **3 Link - Weapon** Frenzy + Faster Attacks + Vaal Grace We use Frenzy to generate and maintain Frenzy charges during boss battles. Vaal Grace does not need to be linked. **2 Link - Helm** Reckoning + Blind Reckoning does not deal significant damage and is used primarily to apply Blind on Block. Blind also applies to the Spirit Burst from our Lightpoacher Helm. **2 Link - Gloves** Blasphemy + Vulnerability We run a zero reservation Vulnerability aura for increased Physical and Bleed damage using the unique Impresence (Physical) Onyx Amulet. **Gearing** **Head - Lightpoacher (2 Abyssal Sockets)** Lightpoacher is easy to find Uber Lab Enchanted with 40 % Increased Spectral Shield Throw Damage and the Spirit Burst augments mob clearing while mapping as well Life Recovery and defensive mitigation through application of Blind with our helm Support Gem link. **Abyssal Jewels in Helm Affix Priority** Murderous Eye Jewel +# maximum Life + +% chance to gain Phasing on Kill + +% Attack Speed Searching Eye Jewel +#maximum Life, Added Physical Damage to Attacks, Increased Damage over Time while holding a shield **Chest - Lioneyes Vision (Pseudo 7-link)** Lioneyes Vision provides us with a pseudo 7 link with a Level 15 Pierce for Spectral Shield Throw.

But I've been keeping an eye on the physical damage part in PoB, but vulnerability provides at most 10% more damage, even with taunt, maim, intimidation disabled. I thought vulnerability was supposed to stack multiplicatively with my phys damage, but PoB seems to calculate it additively, which is a bit puzzling to me. Has anyone looked into this closely? I really can't tell now whether PoB is messing up or Vulnerability doesn't stack multiplicatively like I thought it would.

224,vulnerability,pathofexile,Why do I sometimes take massive damage seemingly out of nowhere?,0,8ez43p,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8ez43p/why_do_i_sometimes_take_massive_damage_seemingly/,2018-04-26 11:59:33,"Getting very frustrated again. I probably did about 20 maps today, and lost all of the xp by dying 4 times. And everyone of those deaths was a sudden spike in incoming damage that killed me in under 2s that two pots and a 15% physical damage reduction flask couldnt do anything about. I really dont understand why this is happening. Most of the time i can cruise through a map with ease. Sometimes I just take massive damage and die before i even know what is going on. For example, I did race course earlier. I easily killed the lion boss, was on full hp and even had most of my shields left. The bull boss was frozen and almost dead then suddenly half my hp was gone and my character was doing the stunned animation (I use the soul of brine king pantheon). I potted, tried to run, and dropped dead before I could take more than one step. As far as I could tell, the ranged boss killed me in 2-3 hits from off-screen where I couldnt even see him. I am honestly sick and tired of ranged mobs doing insane damage from off screen where you cant even see them. The next time I died, I was in Primordial pool. I killed the magic mobs in the boss room, ran into sight of the boss, casted freezing pulse once, then got hit by...something...im not sure what because I could only see some kind of ground AOE appear. I was on full hp/shields and instantly took about 5k damage, dropping me down to about half hp. Potted, tried to run, died in the next hit before I could even take more than one step. The map didnt even any mods with extra damage or crit. I respawned, went back in, the boss hit me with some kind of ranged attack, and this time it only did about 1500 damage instead of the 5k+ the first time round. Then I just killed him like normal without breaking a sweat. I dont run maps with insane mods, I dont even do corrupted maps anymore after getting the atlas bonuses. Im always on max resists and I never do maps with vulnerability or elemental weakness. At most, my maps only have one extra damage mod that give the monsters roughly 25% more damage (After resists). I just dont know why i sometimes take massive damage from out of nowhere. I cant tell whats going on because everything happens near instantly and i cant do anything about it. Potting doesnt save me and I cant run before I die to the next hit. Is the boss just getting a few lucky crits in a row or what? Most of the time I have no trouble at all, then suddenly the boss does way more damage for some reason with the same or easier map mods and I die, losing hours of progress. As far as i can tell its not lag because everything is smooth, there is no stuttering or teleporting at all to indicate lag. Third time : I was doing an abyss, constantly keeping diamond + basalt flask up, got to the last part, everything was OK...the last rare mob popped out of the ground, got frozen, and then shaper appeared behind me to fire some energy balls. Tried to move out of the way, got hit by the abyss mobs since I stopped casting, tried to pot, died before I could run. Fourth time : Was doing torture chamber, I used lightning warp to get near the boss, dropped orb of storms + frost bomb, and the first thing the boss does is channel the lightning beam, which still does damage even when the boss if frozen. I ran behind the nearest pillar, and then shaper appeared behind me to fire the energy balls again. I had to move from behind the pillar, and then suddenly five totems surrounded me and I couldn't move. I was instantly gibbed by five totems spamming shock nova. And I just died on racecourse again, and I have no idea why. I killed the lion and ranged bosses with barely a scratch, and the bull boss was being perma frozen at the edge of the screen. **I had more than 5k hp and suddenly dropped dead**. The map didnt even have any damage or crit mods and I just got one shotted by...something...I have no idea what because the last boss was perma frozen and couldn't even move. The only thing I saw was immortal call activating although it obviously didnt prevent me getting one shotted by whatever hit me. I didnt see anything that could hit me at all and the last boss was a melee one which was nowhere near me. I now have less xp than I started the day with. Just what the hell is going on?"

228,vulnerability,pathofexile,[BSC] Slayer (Scion) starforge cyclone deathless Uber Elder Run,56,87gcp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/87gcp0/bsc_slayer_scion_starforge_cyclone_deathless_uber/,2018-03-27 17:51:35,"Video: URL POB: URL (I know it's garbage number compared to most other POB link in this subreddit LUL) (edited: Updated since I finally know how to make Aspect work in POB, and plz noted that in contrast to what POB shows, the Enlighten don't support Aspect currently, remember that before you plan your mana reservation) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Been farming uber elder comfortably with this build for a while, with 0~1 death depending on the internet, so I would like to share some tips. I will just talk about this fight from the perspective of Slayer Cyclone build. My Aura setup: Aspect of Spider + Vulnerability + Purity of Ice + Lv3 Enlighten (will be a bit mana heavy if you are slayer or without Lv4 enlighten, in that case, drop either Aspect or Vunlnerability) My pantheon setup: Major: Arrakalli (The only major god for all slayer leech build, other choices are heretics) / Minor: Yugul (Get the upgrade for reduced cold damage taken, this include the DOT ground) My flask setup: Writhing Jar (Bubbling Life flask of Heat for Scion version) / Lion's Roar / Chemist's Sulphur Flask of Heat (or Sapphire) / Chemist's Sapphire Flask of Heat / Chemist's Quick Silver Flask of Heat (or of Adrenaline) Don't press your flask mindlessly, try to always have freeze/chill immunity up by timing your flask, and Jar/Roar for Heal/burst, Quicksilver for the Slow phase or emergency dodge. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- This fight is separated into 4 phases: A: Shaper phase (Elder is invulnerable) B: Elder phase (Shaper is invulnerable) C: Door phase (Either Shaper or Elder door, and both boss are invulnerable) D: Final phase (Both are not invulnerable, but only Shaper can be culled) The sequence go like this: A-&gt;B-&gt;C(elder door)-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;C(shaper door)-&gt;A-&gt;B-&gt;C(elder)-&gt;D Each phase is passed after the Shaper/Elder lose 25% of their total life, or after a fixed timer(Door phase). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Phase A is rather easy for us, since the yellow balls from shaper deal no damage at melee range (they require a minimum traveling distance to be ""armed""), you can just cycloning around Shaper without any fear. Elder will shoot you with ice spikes, but at this stage you should tank those spikes easily with leech as Slayer (Spikes don't have cold penetration, so Purity of Ice and Sapphire is very effective). The major risk is that the shaper will constantly teleport around the arena, and during the searching for shaper you can be stunned by the Elder ice spikes and then killed by shaper balls (The Slayer nerfed in losing stun immunity is actually big here). But as long as you can engage Shaper quickly and start spinning, this phase is easy. Phase B is the most difficult one. Elder is mostly immobile, but Shaper will constantly cover the elder with Balls and Laser. The big trick here is try to lure the aiming of Shaper into other direction, since the Shaper will only target your last location. Shaper usually fire 3~4 rounds of balls then followed by 1 laser. In best situation, you want to lure the all the balls and laser away from Elder and deal damage to elder before the Shaper start aiming again, but in practice, the firing of shaper balls is very rapid, so you should try focus on luring the Laser away as your first goal, since the Laser last few seconds, allowing you have big time window to burst the Elder (Save your DPS flasks for this opportunity). Another thing you have to pay attention here is that the shaper would still teleport around the arena, so the direction of balls and laser will also change. In short: Always put most of your attention on the Shaper, even if he is invulnerable, since he is the real boss here for Slayer cyclone. Phase C is just spawning trash for you to fill your flask, just always pay attention on the location of Shaper, and keep moving (even better if your movement is vertical to the direction of shaper balls/laser). You don't have to kill the elder door, just clear the spawn and the door will disappear after fixed time. For Slayer, you can try to kill one Door to get the 20 sec Onslaught from Bane of Legends, since the Door is an unique monster, and Slayer can even intentionally leave some small squids behind (just no big squids, they can spawn DOT ground), so you can use them to proc Headsman (20% more damage) later in phase A or B (small squid deal almost 0 damage if only few of them left). After the first round of A-&gt;B-&gt;C, the Elder start to dish out some new trick in later rounds (mostly during phase B). The first trick (and the most deadly one) is the Slow phase. This can't be avoid (even if you manage to dodge the initial animation or leave the siphoning cone) and can't be dispelled by any flask, it always slow you down for quite few seconds. The slow by itself is still manageable if you pop a quick silver, but this slow is absolutely deadly if you are also chilled (it's impossible to dodge anything with slow and chill, and the stun duration get almost doubled in this status). Always keep one usage of chill removing flask for this situation, and always short spin your cyclone so you can stop spinning as soon as you saw the elder diving animation (Getting slowed and stuck in cyclone animation is very deadly). Koam's Root and Jugg ascendancy trivialize this mechanics, but you can't possibly sacrifice 30~35% movement speed as cyclone build to wear Koam's Root just for this situation. The second trick from elder is the tentacle, they deal quite some damage (2~3K per hit) and will stun-lock you if you get caught, but is very easy to dodge (just normal moving is enough). The final trick is the elder shower, this seem do deal no damage if you are directly under him, and even if you get hit by the shower, it's only just about 1~2K damage, nothing big. Just remember that elder will do a ""delayed"" slam aiming at your last location after the shower, dodge that and you're fine. If you manage into phase D as Slayer, you are basically passed, since phase D start with both Elder and Shaper at 25% health, you should instantly cull the shaper at 20%. And without Shaper, the Elder alone is easy (even though he can't be culled). "

232,vulnerability,pathofexile,Nice guy ice golems vs. Chad flame golems,79,8bbmns,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/8bbmns/nice_guy_ice_golems_vs_chad_flame_golems/,2018-04-11 07:33:28,"**My Dream** I really wanted ice golems to be good.[Really really](URL I spent hours tinkering with support gems both in PoB and in game. I experimented with a dozen different spectres as support. I 5 linked multiple Belly of the Beasts so that I wouldn't have to recolor. I tried single curses, double curses, curse on hit, blasphemy. I explored poison (with severed in sleep), charge generation(with victario's charity), bleeding (with vulnerability and chance to bleed and bloodlust on spectres) and elemental (kaltensoul, hatred, added fire, wed, etc.). It's just not good. After getting all my relevant gems to 20/20 and settling on what I thought was the best ice golem setup, I decided to see how flame golems would fare without changing any skill points or setups beyond gems. At this point, I did not have elemental equilibrium, and I bought level 15-18 gems, most with no quality, to experiment with flame golems. First, I did two of each T6 map with my ideal ice golem setup. Then, I swapped in my partially leveled flame golem setup and did two of each T6 map again. The flame golem setup took 30 seconds off my average map time. **Flame Golems** Flame golems are the king of golemancer builds; they have by far the highest damage and clear speed. Let's summarize. *Elemental Equilibrium* The easiest way to cast offering skills is with a channeled skill and cast while channeling. The easiest channeling skill to deal elemental damage with is storm burst -- piercing projectiles, high rate of fire, aoe damage upon release. So the best type of minion damage to deal is Not Lightning. Flame golems deal 100% fire damage with all three skills, so they get the full benefit of elemental equilibrium. *Spectre Synergy* No spectre can top Tukohama Vanguards for single target dps. TV vanguards debuff fire resists with their scorching ray totems. Flame Golems get perfect spectre synergy. *Link synergy* All three skills used by flame golems are spells. Two of them are projectile spells. All three are 100% fire. This makes support links easy to choose. *Aura Synergy* Aura supports are only mediocre for flame golems. Anger adds a bit more damage, haste adds more cast and movement speed. Probably you'll use a defensive aura like discipline, though. *Curse Synergy* Curses provide only modest dps increases for flame golems. Flammability, obviously, can add some damage, but you're already getting two sources of fire resistance debuff. Probably use a defensive aura like temporal chains, instead. So, a rating for flame golems might look like this: * Ideal 5 link: Summon Flame Golem  Minion Damage  Spell Echo  Greater Multiple Projectiles  Elemental Focus * Elemental Equilibrium: A+ * Spectre Synergy: A+ (Tukohama Vanguards, great single target, fire res debuff) * Link Synergy: A+ (all three spells, two projectiles, all fire) * Aura Synergy: B (Anger, or defensive aura) * Curse Synergy: B(Flammability, or defensive curse) * Other Notes: The screen gets very red, very fast. Changes Suggested: Alpha slider for minion effects **Other Golems** Now, let's look at how other golems fare with this rubric. *Ice Golem* * Ideal 5 link: Summon Ice Golem  Additional Accuracy  Maim  Minion Damage  (Melee Physical Damage or Summon Phantasm on Kill or Bloodlust) * Elemental Equilibrium: C (Only elemental damage is from Hatred) * Spectre Synergy: B (Kitava's Herald  physical attacks, benefit from maim, cause bleeding, good clear) * Link Synergy: C (One default attack, one cyclone style attack, one projectile spell) * Aura Synergy: B (Hatred adds a lot of damage) * Curse Synergy: B(Vulnerability or Punishment or defensive curse) * Other Notes: Low screen clutter. Cute noises. Chilled ground from cyclone attack with maim, temporal chains and hinder (animated guardian with singularity sceptre) gives you enemies than don't move. Changes Suggested: Change the projectile spell to a frost blades style attack *Lightning Golem* * Ideal 5 link: Summon Lightning Golem  Minion Damage  Elemental Focus  Spell Echo  Greater Multiple Projectiles * Elemental Equilibrium: D (Switch to Incinerate from Storm Burst. Wrath aura from golems ruins EE) * Spectre Synergy: B (Stygian Revenant, lightning projectiles or Bearded Goatman with spark) * Link Synergy: B (Two lightning spells, one terrible aura) * Aura Synergy: B (Wrath is a lot of extra damage, but overwrites the golem aura and ruins EE) * Curse Synergy: B (Conductivity or Defensive Curse) * Other Notes: You want them to cast the projectile spell all the time. They don't. Changes Suggested: Change the wrath aura to a miniature version of Beacon of Ruin, for golem's own damage only. Let the golem's orb of storms be supported by chain. *Stone Golem* * Ideal 5 link: Summon Stone Golem  Melee Physical Damage  Minion Damage  Additional Accuracy  (Maim or Bloodlust, depending on spectres) * Elemental Equilibrium: C (Only elemental damage is from hatred) * Spectre Synergy: B (Kitava's Herald  physical attacks, benefit from maim, cause bleeding, good clear) * Link Synergy: A+ (Three physical attacks) * Aura Synergy: B (Hatred adds a lot of damage) * Curse Synergy: B (Vulnerability or Punishment or Defensive Curse) * Other Notes: Basically a straight upgrade to both ice golems and zombies. Innate taunt makes it a safe build. Changes Suggested: Reduce base cooldown on slam *Chaos Golem* * Ideal 5 link: Summon Chaos Golem  Minion Damage  Poison  Void Manipulation  Added Chaos Damage Elemental Equilibrium: D (Only elemental damage comes from Hatred) * Spectre Synergy: D (Use a whither totem instead) * Link Synergy: B (One physical attack, one physical/chaos spell, one chaos DoT aura) * Aura Synergy: B (Hatred adds a lot of damage; probably want haste instead) * Curse Synergy: B (Despair adds less damage than you'd think.) * Other Notes: Can't tell if they are walking forward or backward Suggested Changes: The aura is worthless. **Conclusion** In principle, there is a nice spread of abilities among the golem. Two are spellcasters (fire and lightning), two are melee attackers (ice and stone) and one is weird(chaos). Flame golems give the most pure damage, stone golems are tanks that work with bleeding, chaos golems can work with poison. Lightning golems are pretty. However, there's not enough ways to support ailments on minions and the base damage on anything but a fire golem is way too low. Not only do flame golems have the highest base damage, but they also have the best synergy with spectres and they have the most specialized move set. Though it is in theory possible to take other golems to the endgame, in practice it is frustrating to play anything but fire. **TL;DR** Fire golems are significantly more powerful and easier to play than any other golem type when playing a golemancer character. Some simple changes could significantly improve build diversity in this area. *Edit* Fixed formatting"

The question is this: If Immortal Call prevents physical damage entirely, is the amount you would have taken still affected by Abyssus etc., even though Immortal Call then reduces it to nothing? Basically, what are the underlying equations here (or anecdotal testing results, failing that)? I'm holding out hope for an answer from Mark but any input is very welcome! I ask because for the odd phys-immune (perma-IC) juggernaut, Unbreakable would then mean that Abyssus (or Shackles of the Wretched+Vulnerability I guess) would actually increase the healing that results from physical would-be-damage. I realise this is a very niche case."

236,vulnerability,pathofexile,[3.2] RFTotem (+SR Totems) updated for 3.2,90,7zv1iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/7zv1iu/32_rftotem_sr_totems_updated_for_32/,2018-02-24 18:02:54,"[Link to the Guide] (URL Major changes: + Hierophant instead of Berserker + Mind over Matter instead of Bloodmagic since Hierophant supports it so well + Tukohamas Fortress is not longer a chase item, Atziris Reflection is ;) + Playstyle is the same except for Tier 16+ Bosses. There we swap the RF with Scorching Ray and deal mainly Scorching Ray Totem and Searing Bond damage + back to Dualcurse, either one on blasphemy (temchains/enfeeble) or both curse on hit. + The Skilltree changed a bit, no more pathing down to ironwood. Instead we go more in the Witch direction + A few gems changed related to the changes Minor Changes + slimmed some of the Info section + added the beltslot in the gearsetion (somehow deleted it) + more colors + new skilltree pics + leveling section prepared for Templar/Hierophant Its pretty likely that most of it stays the same, but some things can change: + Small skilltree changes. There is nothing announced regarding this, but often we see minor buffs/nerfs to nodes which can change the direction a bit + Another great class release for the build. Occultist? Elementalist? Ascendant? especially those could have potential, but i doubt that they can be overall better for this build. + New/Fated/Buffed/Nerfed items can go so far that they change the direction of the build or are just desireable uniques. Looking at you fated Windscream! + Last minute buffs/nerfs could happen. At some point i needed to start the update and most possible changes just require a few tweaks here and there. From my PoB testings with okish, realistic gear (standard uniques, most important stuff has t2-t4 rolls, dual dmg property jewels, 20/20 gems, No Atziris Reflection) the Shaperdps went up by around 38% with the change from Berserker to hierophant and two gemswaps (SR in soulmantle). Was around 1.15 million shaper dps. Essence and shaper/elder items can boost that further with a spelltotem on the boots, more dot dmg in gloves and so on. Overall the playstyle doesnt change much until t15 and for the endgame bosses we Scorching Ray Totem (SR totems felt horrible for clearing maps) the shit out of Bosses. RFT might deal a little bit lower dmg than on the berserker, but the huge totem placementspeed, better coverage and QoL features compensate that. The ability to place 4 SRT + 1 SB anyway. Soulmantle might be a bit more expensive at the start of the league (Hierophant totems might be very popular as a starter), but a tabula/random other shit does the job as fine in early-mid tier maps. My goal will be killing Uber-Elder on the build and provide up-to-date clips of some bossfights. **If you find something that can be improved in the guide, isn't updated properly or other suggestions let me know. I'll keep a close look over anything related to the build until 3.2** edit: The Hierophant makes the early game smoother (no longer speccing life and stats for 20 levels) using spells and the spelldmg pathing early on. The charge generation reduces the need of the critgem for OoS to procc EO and enduring cry for enduring charges. The extra totems in the first 2 labs remove the need of ancestral bond (no trapping for EE) 90% totem Placementspeed makes everything smoother. The pretty high manaregen supports MoM well and the liferegen is close to a chieftain considering the dmg splits to mana as well. each extra totem is more coverage for rf or more singletarget with scorching ray. edit 2: **Atziris Reflexion is a bit overrated** Unpopular opinion in the hype around it but let me explain. The remaining 20% curseeffect while using Kikazarus isnt so bad. Got a list in the guide with the remaining effects, the worst is vulnerability + projectile weakness against mobs that deal high phys projectile dmg. If enfeeble proccs it (in my setup) barely reduces the effect of 3 curses including enfeeble for self-flagellation. Sure it's a bit worse, but its also not drastic. Looking at the items in comparison and with what you can replace it they are not so far away from each other. Atziris Reflection mainly grants the no curse effect property, good all res, curse effect which is barely noticable on endgame bosses and thats basically it. Eva/es is more useful if you specced nodes for it. Kikazarus grant liferegen (2-4% depending on total life and level), manaregen (mom), attributes (dex starved) and also 60 lightning res. both have no life For what would you replace the items? Atziris for either some Lioneyes for good armour and very high life or some rare shield with high fire(up to 79!)/elemental damage, life and maybe resists and manaregen Kikazarus first with life + res ring and maybe manaregen/mana. in the optimal case a essence crafted opal ring with life and resists. Shields can have higher life values than rings one by one, 2 rings can surpass life on rare shields with good rolls. To fully benefit from a switch to atziris reflection it requires some dope rings. Its definetly a great endgame item, the question will be: Is it worth the (unknown) investment over rather cheap rings and shield? **edit 3:** We have the option to turn on RF ourself with just Rise of the Phoenix equipped. Not to clear maps, but as a extra singletarget boost for 4x scorching ray totems. In my PoB test is had 652 liferegen and 500 manaregen with totems active. With RotP and selfcast RF on still 104/133 without any flask or pantheon active. The build is not made to run maps with RF on (since any harmful mapmod will destroy the regen), but for stuff like shaper its possible to sqeeze more dmg out this way. a jump from 258k to 345k dps per scorching ray totem IS a difference!"
237,vulnerability,pathofexile,I am disappointed in the Champion revamp,0,80gyvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/80gyvp/i_am_disappointed_in_the_champion_revamp/,2018-02-27 09:03:49,"I am aware of that I compose this submission a few days late and it might be a lot more controversial as the response to the Champion reveal felt like a success for many. I already gave my [statement](URL previously, but it didn't receive a lot of attention, and since I wanted the Champion ascendancy to be something better (as it's been my favourite ascendancy), I will try to impart what I think about the changes and the hopes I had for it to become less of a party cracker/hc bow character choice and more of an actual melee ascendancy. During the latest patches, Champion degraded to a curse on hit supporter (Inspirational aura &amp; permanent intimidation until 3.1 when it was reduced to attack damage taken) and Ancestral Warchief totem (making them taunt) ascendancy. I liked the Champion ascendancy for providing a permanent fortify as fortify itself has become mandatory for any close-range build on HC, and keeping it up to be prepared anytime could end up being a hassle and often dangerous (boss fights involving a lot of manual dodging, leaping into mob packs on a deadly map etc.). **Worthy Foe** - one of the ""hyped"" notables (with First to Strike, Last to Fall), as taunted enemies now cannot evade attacks anymore. Many people misunderstand (or at least misunderstood) that they could run a crit build without putting anything into accuracy, but as it already states, the enemy needs to be taunted in the first place. Unless you feel like using warcries against every monster you intend to kill, you still need to stack accuracy (at least to a proper amount so you taunt your enemies more frequently and the gameplay feels satisfying). If anything, it is a way to make duelist crit builds more alive. It truly comes to shine when this notable is used by a Champion supporter as he can pick Resolute Technique to apply this downside-less RT for attackers in his group. I won't talk a lot about the topic that certain bosses such as Shaper are immune to taunt and guardians have a diminishing effect to taunt. GGG certainly is aware of it and if they won't introduce something such as ""unaffected by taunt"" instead of straight immunity, you can throw this ascendancy branch into the trash bin. **Conqueror** - changed to a guaranteed chance to taunt on hit compared to its predecessor with 25% chance, 2% life regen (up from 1%) after a recent taunt, and the Worthy Foe's former attribute, that taunted enemies by you deal 10% less damage taken to others. It's a fine buff for Ancestral totem builds, and especially in combination with Worthy Foe, but still almost completely worthless by itself. **Inspirational** - the 4% (from 8 to 12%) movement speed buff isn't as inspirational as the notable's name could imply. But that is fine, not everything needs to be changed. **First to Strike, Last to Fall** was... changed (I'm not lying here!). I would like to call it a nerf, but it's a buff as well. While Adrenaline itself is a huge buff, it is kinda awkward to trigger if you actually want to use it a lot (which it definitely isn't supposed to, but w/e). Recent ideas are all about Righteous Fire, Doedre's Elixir and Blood Magic auras. All of them require you to enter a state of vulnerability (not the curse, duh) aka low life. While this may work while taking cover, it shouldn't be done in dangerous boss encounters which take (far) more time than 20 seconds as recovering life via life flasks is the usual approach and might be valuable in certain fights. This being said, it will end up annoying for many to stop pushing forward to take a bit of time to trigger Adrenaline to have it up all the time. For this Adrenaline buff, FtS,LtF lost 40% incr. damage while not on low life, 200% armour/evasion while on low life and the removal of elemental ailments when entering the state of low life. As far as Adrenaline goes, I wouldn't mind it if it weren't traded for the last one as it only exists in a far inferior form. It will only apply in combination with triggering Adrenaline, and Adrenaline can only be triggered ONCE every 20 seconds. It was an incredible life-saver when you ended up in a messed-up situation where your life bounced up and down by spamming flasks (not everyone on hardcore logs out on damage taken). And yes, it was ""game-breakingly abusable"" (hint: sarcasm) with additional life regeneration triggered on entering low life, so you would end up being in a constant state of removing elemental ailments aka Schrdinger's elemental status ailment immunity. **Unstoppable Hero** - the only proper improvement of this ascendancy. 1000 flat armour&amp;evasion and stun immunity in exchange for 30% incr. armour/evasion. As the Champion ascendancy provides a lot of increased armour/evasion rating by itself, it becomes a fine addition to the defence layer improvements and finally might be comparable again to Juggernaut's 25% incr. fortify effect. As a final note - when I see the changes to other ascendancies (with exception of Guardian), I hoped for a few additional branches and/or reallocations of 1-2 notables. It could have provided some freshness making this ascendancy more attractive for melee builds, but this was left out (not counting Adrenaline). I'm really disappointed in this hugely anticipated change. Using Champion correctly in 3.2 would be to run him as damage/curse support in a group, running AW totems or playing with a bow). "

243,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Suggestion] Map mod/quantity system needs an improvement,14,84d6l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/84d6l0/suggestion_map_modquantity_system_needs_an/,2018-03-14 23:59:42,"I know a lot of players who struggle understanding the quantity system in itself and are always mad about how really rippy 150% maps dont seem to be more rewarding. The thing about map quantity many players get wrong is how much map quantity bonus increases overall drops. To put it simple, if you take a map with 50% quantity and compare it with a map with 125% quantity the latter is not twice as rewarding, its is 50% more rewarding. Because its a comparison between 150% and 225% --&gt; increase by 75% = increase in 50%. Of course there are other factors that increase map rewards like packsize, extra magic monsters and so on, but the overall quantity system does not feel rewarding and thats my point. Now I want to suggest something that KARV has mentioned some time ago in a podcast, to introduce **map mod synergies**. For example, if you roll a map that has either elemental weakness or -max resist and you also roll any extra elemental damage on it, you should be rewarded with more quantity/packsize/rarity than usually because these mods have a syngergy with each other and therefore increased the overall difficulty by a lot. Same with Vulnerability and less armour and so on, you get the idea. Every mod that increases the lethality of another mod should yield more rewards. This way a 8 modded map could reach up to 200% quantity, which would actually be twice as much as a 50% quantity map. But only if the map is REALLY difficult, a random 8 modded map with no mod synergies would still be exactly the same as before. If GGG has a problem with his that it might become to easy to play these maps, sustain maps by doing this, another option would be to also increase the difficulty of mods that have a synergy. So if I roll -max resist and extra ele damage for example, there could be a synergy mod added which increases the duration of elemental ailments by 50%. If I roll vulnerability and less armour there could be a extra mod added that increases physical damage of monsters by 10%. This mod in itself would either not provide any quantity bonus or provide the above mentioned extra quantity bonus, however you want to balance it. I think this change would accomplish several things: **a**. It would make really rippy maps more difficult and more rewarding **b**. It would help newer players understand how map mods can affect each other and what mods are really deadly together, because now there is a extra synergie mod added if that happens. You could even highlight this with something like: ""Players affected by Vuln, less armour bla bla **Syngery mod added**: 10% increased physical damage"" **c**. It would overall increase fun while mapping, new challenges, more options I also dont think a change like that would take up to much time developing, since you are only improving on existing content? What do you think? "

I just want to know if my character is viable moving forward and if not what steps I should take to move toward a more viable course towards endgame. Marauder (Berserker) is my class and my build is mainly built around Molten Strike for AOE and Heavy Strike for single-target DPS. Molten Strike is supported by Ancestral Call, Multiple Projectiles, and Life Gain on Hit. Heavy Strike is supported by Multistrike and Ruthless. I also use Ancestral Protector totem for single-target DPS on bosses which allows me to continue to do damage as I dodge attacks in the more mechanic-heavy bullet-hell type bosses I've started to encounter. He also doubles as a decoy when needed and is just generally useful in lots of situations. 75% of my mana is typically dedicated to Herald Ash and Determination passive skills. I've also got Vengeance running and it is supported by Cast Spell on Melee Kill, which casts Molten Shell. Another important skill I use is Leap Slam, which is used both for movement and to start engagements. It is supported by Fortify and Maim, providing buffs at the start of each engagement or for quick attacks and escapes against tougher enemies. Finally I am using both Rally Cry and Vulnerability to provide buffs/debuffs, typically used after Leap Slam to start engagements. Anyway, is this a tenable build to continue with? Any skills jump out as decidedly unusable in late-game? Thanks for your help! EDIT: TIL I can link y'all to my character page. Here it is: URL"

Noble Dead for example counters you with some kind of mortar on death which you can mechanically avoid. Nice concept. Same with volatile or bearers. They hit hard but you always have at least small window for overplaying it. But when it comes to Porcupines you have to rely on your char defences. Manually dodging their spike projectiles is impossible to do consistantly. You may hide behind some obstacle if there is one but let's be honest, there aren't any in a lot of cases you meet them on maps. For a non-overplayable mechanic they hit too hard. Each single spike projectile can get to 2.5-3k dmg on a red map with some damage mods like vulnerability + %extra ele damage. And can go even higher on a map with even more rippy mods if someone decide to play such one. The latest map I have died to them motivated me to make this post. Corrupted T11 Promenade, Vulnerability + %extra dmg as lightning. A bit dangerous but not especially rippy at all. I can easily play maps like that one without dying. But not when there are Porcupines on them. I have 7.3k effective hp and I was playing VERY carefully. Whenever I saw Porcupines pack I was running close to them, casting Abyssal Cry and trying to kill ones which were into the warcry range. Or trying to kill them entirely separately one after another. But even with doing that I have died 3 times to their spikes on a single map (I have 3 deaths by a whole level on average on 90+). There are always a few ones being killed unintentionally. You can say there are plenty of mechanics allowing you to counter them. Yes there are: Abyssal Cry (doesn't work good enough to consistently protect you from dying) CWDT + Immortal Call (same as above + some builds don't have a space for it) shatter (a lot of builds don't shatter) Basalt + Granite + Jade + Stibnite + Taste of Hate / Rumi etc. (swapping all of your flasks only to have a chance of not being insta killed by one certain type of monster being randomly spawned on a maps? Pls...) Rebuilding all your character to have a chance of surviving a punishment from just one type of monster after successfully killing it sounds irrational to me. I can do all the endgame content with my build. No dying to Shaper, Uber Atziri, guardians etc. Some types of monsters with rippy mods are dangerous for me but always overplayable. But Porcupines are almost always just completely rippy on red maps. I can understand such a damage from telegraphed mechanics you can avoid. But it's just extremely rippy insta punishment for something you are normally rewarded for and it kills all the fun the game is providing."

For those of you who don't know what this item actually does, Doedre's Effigy is basically a totem that is summoned at a location that lasts for 6 seconds, casting a Blasphemy aura around itself applying all socketed curse gems without any curse limit. You can still apply curses like normally outside of the socketed curses, so with this item alone, you can have up to 7 curses without counting other sources of +1 curse. On paper, this item is amazing. But there are key features that make it really awkward, but let me first elaborate on the upsides of the item. Most upsides are the downsides of the item at the same time though. * First upside is obviously the ability to throw in any curses you might need. The 5 all-rounder curses are Warlord's Mark, Assassin's Mark, Poacher's Mark, Elemental Weakness and the elemental curse of the damage type you're running (so Frostbite if you're running Frostbolt, which I am). These can always come in handy no matter the situation. Temporal Chains and Enfeeble are defensive all-rounders, but I'd say they are best suited as your curses outside of Doedre's Skin for defense. * Alright Energy Shield, allowing you to actually use this item, seeing how it's ES based with no life and the curse scentric Ascendancy being ES based as well. * Running Doedre's Skin allows you to finally properly use [Doedre's Scorn](URL granting you effectively 160% increased damage on top of the damage bonuses of your curses. Scorn also grants alright ES. * High life on the totem and the totem not mechanically working like a Totem, as it's placement can be increased by cast speed instead of placement speed. * No need to link at all (unless running Enhance) and easy to color. ___________________________ Now, the downsides. * Very few skills even benefit from all these curses. The most potent offensive curses are the Elemental Curses and Projectile Weakness. Vulnerability and Despair don't add up in numbers as much as Ele Weakness and an Ele curse. For me, this narrows it down to Ele Proj spells or attacks. After playing around with it a bit, Frostbolt is probably the best bet at a powerful skill to use with it. * Seeing how any non-support build with Doedre's Skin is making themselves dependant on curse application, Hexproof mobs just royally screw you over. The more than halven your damage output and negate mana leech and gain from Warlord's and Poacher's Mark. * You do not receive the 3 main benefits from the Mark curses, which is flat life recovery and leech. This is because you are pretty forced into running ES unless you want to take a big hit on your life count because of the lack of two life slots. You can of course still run as life, but I don't see why you would do that since the item was basically made for ES Occulist. * You're ES without a rare Body Armor or Helmet (probably Shield too since you don't have a 6 link for your damaging skill). This is bad, even though the uniques have an alright amount of ES. * The duration is horribly low. Doing a boss consists of casting your spell 6 times then putting down the totem. * Only one totem can be dropped at a time, so overage becomes very little and very simplistic. This is what I've concluded for now. I love the flavor of the item as it's all about curse stacking, which is something that has been hard to do in the past, at the cost of a pretty hefty curse effectiveness reduction. However, in it's current state, I can only see it as a very niche item that has obvious flaws all around. ____________________________ What this build absolutely needs (in my opinion) are the following things: * A way to get past Hexproof. Hexproof absolutely wrecks a build based around the item and the only way to currently get past it is by using another unique Body Armor. So there literally is no way around it. I can't see anyone running this item without Scorn, so it doesn't even need straight up ignoring of the Hexproof mod. Either giving Occulist or this item an additional mod that said ""Your curses can apply to Hexproof monsters at 50% effectiveness"" would immediately make it much more competitive with other builds. * A way to properly increase the duration of the item. As mentioned above, this item has a measly duration of 6 seconds which can be increased by duration increases throught eh passive tree or a support gem. Support gems for this item are very limited though as you likely already will want to run a Faster Casting to make it a bit more smooth to use. However, making the duration of this totem scale off curse duration would be a neat way to increase the duration without having to invest crazy amounts just to make it stay for longer than 6 seconds. * A way to get more max totems. It's currently just ""place it down whenever you charge into a new pack or the boss changes position"". And that's pretty boring since it feels like a liability and something mandatory to do. Since it's not a totem in the code, it obviously can't have more max amount of totems up through nodes like Ancestral Bond. Instead, I'd suggest simply building on the solution to the problem above and tying it into the curse tag. For every +1 max curses, give it +1 max totems. It is technically a curse skill, so giving it a few unique interactions would be cool. You will barely ever even use more than 2 totems anyways, but since there are only so many curses you can even use at the same time, getting +1 max curses isn't actually even advantageous when using this item. If it scaled off max curses like this though, it would be worth it to get that wheel at the top and the Occulist max curse node. Maybe even a Doedre ring. ________________________________ This is honestly a very spontaneous post since I really like the item but am able to see immediate problems with the playstyle. It's essentially a weird totem + spell hybrid build enabler that allows you to reach a crapload of damage if itemized properly, but is slower than builds that don't bother with it."
256,vulnerability,pathofexile,Thoughts after finally passing LV90 after years of playing.,19,7g3evg,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/7g3evg/thoughts_after_finally_passing_lv90_after_years/,2017-11-28 22:05:57,"So I've been playing Path of Exile for years now, but I'm an altaholic - I rarely make it past early maps before wanting to play a new build and starting over. Late 70s/early 80s was pretty much my limit. However with SSF Harbinger league that's changed - I discovered a build that was entertaining and more powerful than previous builds I've made and so I'm now up to LV91. Haven't done Shaper, Guardians, or Uber Atziri, but I can handle Atizi &amp; Uber Lab pretty easily - in any case, it's far further in the endgame than I've ever gotten. Here's the build if anyone wants to look at it - URL The build is a life-based Trickster RF with Scorching Ray. I'm using Eldritch Battery to take advantage of the Trickster's ascendancy ES-based bonuses. For odd for RF equipment, I've got a Queen of the Forest (my base movement speed is +60% at the moment) &amp; I'm using double Kikazaru for regen which is nice since it makes me almost immune to curses, making it much easier to get good maps - stuff like Temporal Chains &amp; Vulnerability are a joke. Here are some random thoughts about the experience. A lot of this is going to seem like no-brainers to the experienced players out there, but maybe some of it will be useful. Defenses are way higher priority than offense for progression - you can always improve your damage, but if your defenses are low, your progress gets slowed to a halt. I almost abandoned the character at one point &amp; then I got a really nice piece of equipment that gave me a nice boost in power and changed my mind. Basically, don't get too impatient - if your build feels a little weak, maybe all you need is to an equipment upgrade or some passive point rearranging. There are a lot of nice uniques that facilitate RF &amp; if you don't have them, you can use MoM (which is what I did on a previous character in the league). Rise of the Phoenix may be best in slot 99% of the time, but in a pinch, stuff like Saffel's Frame, Ahn's Heritage, Immortal Flesh, and Springleaf can be used (all of which I've gotten at one point or another, sometimes multiples). I basically alched all maps (never had a lack of alchs thanks to Harbinger drops) and I haven't had difficulty maintaining high level maps. Have completed 95 of the map bonus objectives so far - now the main limit is not having enough Vaal Orbs. More divination cards should be like Encroaching Darkness - it's always fun to get and it drops frequently enough to complete sets on a semi-regular basis. The Tier 15 Harbinger map is by far the most profitable way to spend time. It's not too bad in SSF since you can't spam them but I can see why they don't want to make it a permanent part of the game. Next to that, Uber Lab is so good. I wish it was easier to unlock in SSF. I've only done it a handful of times, but I've already gotten several midnights, two nice 6-link corrupted rare armours (one EV, one ES), and a good bit of currency and other fun drops. I also got lucky with enchantments and got the stone golem +150% to life regen buff boost which is fantastic with RF. A 3-link setup with Blade Vortex + Culling Strike + Increased Critical Strikes (for Elemental Overload activation) along with grabbing one of the Increased Duration clusters was a huge boost to playability. I'd stick an Arcane Surge in as well if I wasn't using Eldritch Battery. Might try to swap to a 4-link &amp; throw a Blind in there instead. A Curse on Hit setup with Ball Lightning with Elemental Equilibrium on the passive tree, Enfeeble, and Vulnerability is amazing for RF. Curse immunity is my #2 most hated map mod, right after No Regen. My first ever attempt at Atziri, I got destroyed due to Atziri getting possessed by a Tormented Spirit. Didn't try it again for a while after that, but now that I'm higher level and have done the battle before, it's not too hard. Vorici helps a lot, but man, trying to properly color sockets when you're using mostly evasion gear but want mostly blue sockets is a pain. Not letting Ancient Orbs target Harbinger unique fragments seems like a missed opportunity. I managed to complete one unique (the belt), but it's very RNG-based since you have to get multiple specific drops. Wish there was a ""downgrade"" vendor recipe where you could sell regals and get an equal number of chaos orbs since those are far more valuable most of the time. I mean, it's not that hard to do the regal orb recipe and then pop into a low-level area and just replace one of the items with the first rare you find, but it is an unnecessary hassle. Love not having to worry about reflect due to using dot skills. Getting masters up to the top rank seems like a waste of time in SSF since you're not going to have the currency to use the master-mods anyway (possible exception being Vorici) &amp; it's probably more rewarding to run good maps than redo masters in hopes for uniques to buy. I do have 3 masters at max rank and the rest are almost there but it's been time-consuming. Anyway, it's been a fun experience! I'm still debating on whether to keep with this character when the league ends or to do it all again when the next league starts."

Let me know if I missed any. Minions - a couple nerfs (specific Spectres, reduced effect on The Baron), but mostly buffs here. Accuracy on Spectres, increased damage on some minion types, Minion Life support now gives 49% MORE life at LV20 (this is huge for both survivability &amp; for minion explosion effects), better Desecrate. Lightning Tendrils rework - Functions as a channeled skill, more dps overall Reworked Vulnerability - Now 2 skills: a physical/bleed/maim one (that is Strength-based) and a dot/chaos one. This will mostly likely be a buff to several different build styles. Life regen - Mod on non-unique equipment buffed. We don't know what the max is, but T3 would be around 0.3%-0.4% on an average life-based endgame build which while not amazing is at least usable. Depending on T1 values, this may help mitigate the blow to RF from the nerfed RotP. Shield damage buffs - More shield passives will buff damage and now it's not limited to melee. This is potentially a big buff to Wanders, Spectral Throw, and melee skills that also include a projectile component like Molten Strike and Frost Blades. Freeze - Now can affect endgame bosses in weakened form (so like a super chill with higher slow effect)."

Attacks against cursed enemies have a chance to inflict bleeding and maim. Despair, an Intelligence Skill Gem, curses all targets in an area, making them less resistant to chaos damage and causing them to take increased damage over time. Cursed enemies also take additional chaos damage when hit. Will these 2 have a synergy with increased bleeding damage since first is physical DoT only.

Vulnerability now says: &gt; Cursed enemies take 30% increased physical damage from damage over time And Despair says: &gt; Cursed enemies take 35% increased damage from damage over time effects OK, so Vulnerability is specific to physical damage over time, while Despair applies generally to all damage over time? Does this mean that if I run both on a dual-curse setup, that I get 65% MORE bleed damage, and 35% MORE poison damage? IOW, the 'Damage over time' umbrella seems to cover two ailments at once, and so Despair is manifestly superior to Vulnerability. That sounds like it can't be right, since it wouldn't be a very even-handed split, but the gem text seems to urge this view. Am I missing something? Is there something sneakily specific about the word 'effects', so that it only applies to spell-based things? Like, is an ailment not an effect, or something? EDIT: From the responses it seems that I wasn't clear about my question, so let me TLDR it: Can it really be the case that the net result of splitting vuln into two curses is that bleed now has double the potential of poison?

I've found some data that shows Lacerate is basically only used by me over on URL (search for Lacerate, spoiler it's 133rd with .2% usage). **PoB Pastebin for Level 86:** URL My opening weekend went very well I ended up finishing the 4 day weekend at position 1150ish when I logged off last night. I have made it further than I ever have in maps; t9 now up from t7. I was nervous about the Vaal Pact changes, but it still feels very smooth. The build is meant to get INTO trouble and I thought that losing instant leech would be the death sentence for VP based builds, but I'm still feeling comfortable. Bubbling / Seething flasks are a must. **Biggest current frustrations:** * Trying to craft a Diamond Flask that generates charges when I crit. * Decoy totem is pathetically weak and is only useful on some bosses where their animation allows for safe casting, but it's not bad enough to drop from the build... yet. **Big build changes from my Harbinger League attempt:** * Assassin's Mark for Power Charges was cool, but the Vulnerability buff was too enticing. * u/vulpix0r suggested I use Vengeance; he was right. The CWDT needs to be low to trigger often, but Vengeance happens fairly regularly. So I swapped my link to Vengeance -&gt; Curse On Hit -&gt; Inc. Dur -&gt; Vulnerability (good dang vuln is strong). * Scaeva is not really necessary which opened up a big DPS boost by pairing Ahn's Might with Dreamfeather (must pair Ahn's with a high AS weapon for sure) as my early mapping swapover. Scaeva was very useful in early maps and was easy to stat for, though so it's still good and may come back up. You give up 7% to be at 68% phys block but still cap at 75% spell block. You can easily make this up with the new Jewels if you are worried about it. * u/TheRealWizzardyDude suggested I drop Faster Attacks while using MultiStrike and he was correct as well. I've replaced it with Conc. Effect and haven't looked back since. **Things I'm looking forward to after opening weekend:** * finding more shaped items and getting my first 6L * Uber Lab - which I'm really scared of doing after seeing how much HP regen is favored for builds that want to clear it. I'm going to be branching over to the Bleed node, which will activate extra damage for both Bleeding (Ascendency 7 &amp; 8) &amp; Maimed (Maim Support in 6L) enemies boosting me up fairly high. I hope all your League Starts went well. Stay Safe, Omni **P.S.:** This is a pretty good Gladiator DW Block shell for some other weapon skills, I just chose Lacerate. Reave would work with almost the exact same Tree, probably, and you'd get an MTX. Frost Blades would work with some Tree modifications to nab the cold conversion nodes maybe instead of going hard into the Sword areas."

As the title suggests, i want to create a small discussion on the state of gruthkul's + Blood Magic builds as opposed to generic rare chest/ kaom's heart/ belly of the beast + aura setup. For the uninitiated, gruthkul's pelt provides strong benefits (mainly up to 100% increased physical damage, 2% life regeneration, Large added life and increased character size) in exchange for the inability to use any spell skills for damage or otherwise. This mainly prevents auras and curses for a melee build, and since those are also the disadvantages of Blood Magic (due to health reservation) they are used together, so you can access the benefits of gruthkul's and the powerful life nodes behind BM, for the same cost. The largest benefit of using this is a huge amount of bulk in the form of life, life regeneration, and the utility of no more mana worries, the disadvantage being less damage and bulk auras could provide. The points lost in allocating the life nodes are point i feel would be spent to fix mana concerns otherwise, so it is practically equivalent. I wanted to test how the two variants compare so I made a build that could use either. Now that were all on the same page I'd like to show an example of a build I Made with BM + gruthkul's pelt and with Belly + hatred Hoa + Mana leech. The build is a simple [stun ground slam juggernaut](URL for lab farming, whose main purpose is bulk. The BM version goes all in on the ""brute force"" theme and uses brutality to support a ground slam. It has 6700 life, 49k dps, and at 8 endurance charges, 83% reduction, 8% additional elemental damage reduction, 29% damage reduction from fortify, it regenerates 1300 life per second and it will stun nearly everything it hits. It also uses curse on hit Veruso's to apply vulnerability, although a witch-fire brew would work just as well. The Belly + hatred and Hoa variant has 10,000 more DPS and a HoA clear speed bonus at the cost of 800 life and 300 life regeneration. the bonus armour from belly provides 7% additional physical mitigation. This variant is free to use blood rage and i have enabled it as such, the calculations assume maximum frenzy charges. I replaced Kaom's roots with Red-blade tramplers here to accommodate the jewels and the user will have to find a way to add int and dex to the build from gear. It would appear in this instance that the BM variant has added significantly more bulk for the cost of some damage. I would like to discuss how effective this combination could be in most other melee builds and the reason it is not used more, considering how effective the exchange seems to have been. Keep in mind the build itself is not up for critique, and has only been theorized and planned by me to illustrate the differences. So post your thoughts! and thanks for reading! Edit : thanks to fellow exile u/ShdwHntr84 i realized that the Brutality variant has similar if not better dps against bosses and rares as elemental resistances are much more common than physical mitigation. Edit2 : thanks to u/kwitchy for his wisdom from the streets. He mentioned how curse on hit gear and witchfire brew can be used to apply curses with gruthkul's! The curse topic has been frequently discussed, so i felt it prudent to mention this. Kindly consider this information prior to commenting, and thanks for the responses! Edit3 : In accordance to people suggesting Curse on Hit Gear (with curse on hit veruso's going or 1 ex) i included those in the gruthkul's version, i also added blood rage to the Belly variant as it was suggested widely. The numbers and PoB link were updated accordingly. The changes basically amplified the previously specified difference with the BM variant having over 9,000 less damage but the Non BM variant having 500 less life regeneration and a whopping 900 less life."

287,vulnerability,pathofexile,Dialla's Malefaction - is it just me or will this shine as an amazing new curse build option?,40,757vlm,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/757vlm/diallas_malefaction_is_it_just_me_or_will_this/,2017-10-09 20:04:41,"Because of the way that curses (and curse on hit/blasphemy supports) scale with quality, this armor looks especially appealing for curse setups. A corrupted +1 gems Dialla's, with proper colors, can use red sockets to grant a lv 6 empower and enhance, with curses and curse supports (curse on hit, blasphemy) in green sockets for +10% quality - allowing for up to 73% quality curses. By doing this, we can achieve level 26/73% quality or level 27/70% quality curses in this armor. Blasphemy and curse on hit will hit up to 33% quality, or a 16% increased effect of curses. Add in conquerors potency, hex master, curse effect, and skittering runes on the passive tree for a total of 41% increased effect of curses applied by blasphemy or curse on hit. I know Dying Breath allows for higher numbers, but here I'm looking at what kind of numbers we can get without needing to use it. Unless i'm messing something up, here are some numbers that can be reached: ~~96%~~ [Edit: capped at 75%!] slow temporal chains ( 27/70 temporal chains for a 68% base slow with 41% inc. effectiveness) Ditto vulnerability -&gt; enemies taking 96% increased physical damage Enfeeble can reduce enemy accuracy by [Edit: capped at 75%!] ~~111%~~ and make them deal 46.5% less damage with similar reduced crit multi and chance to crit Projectile weakness can make enemies take about 120% increased damage from projectiles. The 'mark' curses can get to 97% chance to grant a charge on kill - maybe this could be used to enable a new, silly variant of flicker strike with poachers mark, or some sort of shenanigans in a discharge build? Now, using a +2 skin of the loyal or things like Atziri's Disfavour blasphemy setups could hit some pretty high numbers already, so it's not like these new maximums are a ton higher than what could be done before, but I just wanted to share some numbers in case it sparked any build ideas for people :). Even without a +1 corruption, this body armor still enables the highest gem quality setups we've had access to before. Curses jumped to mind, but if there are other gems that scale well with quality those may be worth taking a look at too. The ability to split bonuses with different sockets is neat, the quality bonus is pretty novel, and this body armor does enable a new ceiling for curses unless I've forgotten something. Thoughts?"

I'm not sure what items to use as of yet. (Just hit level 30, at this point I'm following guides/theorycrafting and being a pleb.) However, [Rearguard!](URL is an obvious choice due to the bonus armour, block and spell block. I haven't yet decided on whether to use Puncture or Split Arrow, with Puncture I'd have to use the Unique Bow Reach of the Council. This is my planned [passive tree!](URL The goal is to use Puncture/Split Arrow for throwing around bleeds first and then changing to Tornado Shot or Barrage at close range for Point Blank Damage. Once I have everything I need damage wise I'm investing in Critical nodes to increase my damage and the proc chance of King of the Hill(knockback will force them to move and bleed more) along with life to make me more meaty. I'll use the last of my points to pick up close by armour and evasion rating nodes(which will further boost my armour through Iron Reflexes). I'm not entirely sure on my gem set ups yet. 1.

A good life/str armor can match its life roll and cold resistance roll. The only thing the armor offers that others don't is a 60-100% increased physical damage roll which I imagine you can compensate for with auras, heralds, or curses like Vulnerability, since **this fucking armor disables all your spells, including heralds, curses, and auras.** Literally the only thing you can do is attack. No triggered spells. No nothing. You better enjoy holding RMB because it's all you'll be doing. So that's why I ask: what's the bug/exploit?

I want to run through a few things with you guys that I've been boiling over as well as soaking up whatever advice you all have for me. * I'm currently running Cast When Damage Taken for Vulnerability and Enfeeble but they don't seem to proc often enough and I already have 100% mana reserved so I can't run Blasphemy so what should I do with this? Drop the gems completely? Drop the level back to, say, 10, so that I can have more leeway in the jewelry department (holy intelligence requirements, batman). I'm also leveling that Enlighten gem in case I ever do opt for the Blasphemy curse gem setup. * Once I can 5L+ my Atziri's again, I'll switch my Cyclone setup back to that for the +2 support gem benefit but I'm also wondering if perhaps I should sell it off and pick up a Starforge instead (went with Atz initially because I thought +2 range would be better) * With my new passive skill points (unaccounted for in the guide), should I opt for weapon nodes or survival nodes? Perhaps with survival nodes somewhere, I could swap to Bronn's Lithe for more damage since I'll be losing Belly %life. * I don't really know if I should be gunning for pure armor, pure evasion, or hybrid since I'm a Raider...The guide doesn't explain that specifically for Ranger-based ascendancies * Bossing is definitely my biggest issue. I'll run circles around the boss at the edge of my cyclone in an effort to miss most of their abilities but when they bypass my evasion with a melee hit, I'm usually either laying in the dirt or just barely alive - what can I do to improve my bossing experience? I'm not entirely sure the recommended life thresholds in Lighty's guide are feasible for Raider. P.S. Ignore my Life Gain on Hit gem in my weapon that isn't benefiting anything - I'm leveling it to use per Lighty's suggestion for reflect maps. EDIT: I have 3 max Endurance charges (but no way to generate them it seems) and 7 Frenzy charges. EDIT2: I realized through a slight oversight that my Cast When Damage Taken for the curses and for the Molten Shell / Immortal Call weren't applying because of the level requirement on the gems (I have since swapped the curse gems fresh ones and leveling them up now and will swap out MS/IC soon)...This should help with my ridiculous Int requirement."

it, or upgrade it to q20 and list it (for the price in the table). **What is Threshold Quality, and how to use this table** It is the quality where upgrading the gem to q20 with GCP and selling it would yield no profit and no loss. (Assuming 1chaos=1.25GCP) Theoretically, everything below the threshold should be vendored, while everything above it should be upgraded and sold to other players, but sometimes you want to vendor those gems close to the threshold since the profit is minimal. > Example: > > The threshold for Enfeeble gem is 11. If I get a q8 Enfeeble, I should vendor it since it's not worth the GCP cost to upgrade it. If I get a q15 Enfeeble, then upgrading it to q20 can offset the GCP cost with some profit. You can just compare each of your gems with the table and decide what to do with it. However, with GGG's private stash API (the thing that makes you able to browse your stash on URL this procedure can be further automated with some scripting. **Final notes** Shout out to [poeapp.com](URL for providing a dev friendly interface to the poe market.

306,vulnerability,pathofexile,The problems with Bleed that the new keystone doesn't solve,93,6pepgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/6pepgx/the_problems_with_bleed_that_the_new_keystone/,2017-07-25 17:49:37,"The problem is quite simple. Scaling. ___________ **Tree Scaling** Let's use Duelist for the first example. [325% increased bleed damage](URL Note i took one handed nodes, and i even took some nodes of a weapon type i won't be using simply to squeeze every last drop of bleed scaling in the area. There's two more scattered notables with some phys damage on them, then nothing outside Shadow's area. There's 50% bleed damage in Marauder, but it's 2h only, so i choose the 1h wheel since it was closer, you can swap the two around for the exact same total value. [449% direct hit scaling](URL Same number of nodes spent. Now here's the kicker, not only is the number much higher, but i can still take a lot of damage from the area if i please, with bleed i took EVERYTHING i could. Furthermore, i also get attack speed which is a great scaler for a direct hit attack build, even with the new keystone, it's only marginally as good for bleed. On top of that, an attack build can continuously increase it's damage by repeating the attack, bleed does not stack. Here comes into play the new keystone, which alleviates *part* of this problem. But here's the deal, the new Keystone is mandatory if you wanna play a bleed build. 70% to 140% per second just doesn't compare to 35% that can reach as high as 280%. It's a no brainer if you wanna play bleed. But w/e, it's a step in the right direction, the keystone i suggested for bleed was pretty mandatory as well. ________ **Support Gem Scaling** Melee Phys, Multistrike, Faster Attacks, Melee Phys on Full Life, Added Fire, Brutality, Chance to Bleed, Maim, Elemental Damage with Attacks, Added Chaos, Added Cold, Added Lightning, Phys to Lightning, Cold to Fire, Concentrated Effect, etc, all these can scale a melee attack. For bleed ? Brutality, Chance to Bleed, Maim, Deadly Ailments, Unbound Ailments, Rapid Decay. That's it. Now obviously a melee attack should have more gem scaling available since it's a much broader spectrum, but this gem selection is just incredibly restricting. I guess the new keystone enables FA and Multistrike, but as we discussed, scaling attack speed even with that keystone for a bleed build is vastly inferior to doing the same for a hit build. Item scaling is also much worse for bleed, not even going to get into that. ______ **Reservation Scaling** Anger, Wrath, Hatred, Herald of Ash, Herald of Ice, Herald of Thunder. For bleed ? Crickets. Curses ? Vulnerability only. ______ **Suggestions** 1. Change some of the nodes in the Duelist area from being tied to attacks only to ""Physical Damage with Attack Skills 2. Add a Bleed Wheel between Duelist and Ranger. I mean a REAL bleed wheel, not Dirty Techniques. Take a look at the weapon clusters at the side of the tree then look at Dirty Techniques. Bigger with more damage available (obviously with more point investment) 3. Give us a Physical Damage aura You can do this in a day, it doesn't need fancy development. Physical scaling is lagging behind Elemental Scaling anyway, you hit two birds with one stone. Add ""You cannot do chaos or elemental damage"" to it so our Poison and Ele Conversion friends can't use it. 4. A couple more support gems aimed at Bleed won't hurt. Gratuitous Violence in a gem ? It's available on an item anyway. Enemy takes full bleed damage even when stationary, 50% less hit damage (word this so it doesn't work with the new keystone), etc. "

Since there is no double dipping, is it still necessary to have less duration on damaging ailments for end game bosses on top of the added resists? Fire resist can be reduced in multiple ways (EE, support gem, nodes, curses -although the curse effectiveness reduction is super harsh- etc). For chaos on the other hand, it is much harder. Bleed is in a very bad state already despite my best efforts to scale it. I managed to make a decent on hit -non hc viable- ailment character in beta but I find it still lacking and most importantly, map bosses are a nightmare. They have high hp and added resists (to poison and curses, namely vulnerability). Those ailment based characters already do subpar dps but their damage is more than halved again against end game bosses. There absolutely no reason for this anymore. This issue should be tackled before launch because right now damaging ailments not only are lacking in damage, they also suffer an additionnal, unwarranted, penalty. It is much easier to see that -aside from my extensive testing- now that we have path of building. These mechanics take so much design space (keystones, multiples wheels, multiplle item mods, ascendancies) for a very limited return. Let's take poison, why would I want to scale something that does 16% of my base damage over 2 seconds instead of my base damage and why are those 16% punished more than the 100% damage?"

I did pretty well with getting this guy down but after a point it didn't seem like I was hurting him. Died to him a couple times, then decided to try using purely phys damage instead of ele since he was ele resistant and that seemed like it might help me. It seemed like I was doing no damage to him, i decided to say screw it on my last portal and just attacked him constantly, head on, healing when necessary. His health WAS NOT MOVING. I got pretty sad after that death and was not sure what the problem was, so I decided to look up the boss online to see if there was a weakness of some sort I didn't know about. This is what I concluded: According to the wiki, this is a fight that swaps arenas once the boss is at first 67% health, then 33% health. Since this was a twinned fight, I assume both of the bosses needed to be at 67% to continue to the next stage. Since I separated them and only tried fighting one, the other remained at full health and once the boss got to 67%, his health just did not go down. tl;dr: In twinned maps, make sure you are damaging both bosses and don't try to separate them to take them down individually.

For an ignite build point of views i think this is a total failure. Because unless you at least dual curse + EE and use a 6L the damage are totally INSANEly. INSIGNIFICANT. .. The beta let me try it on T10... and the ride was totally unpleasant. Aoe nerf, damage nerf, es and VP nerf. I really dont see other class than Berzerker or Assassin using this skill. Radius of DD is very small monsters have more life, damage only really work on a 6L and trash takes time to burn. I think having very good jewels + endgame gears + all passives in dot + burn should at least be more rewarding. And most fire elemental damage clusters. Hopefully the balancing phase will help for thoses issues. DD + rapid decay + chance to ignite + burning dmg + (blue gem more dot) + dont remember the last but i think its a green more dot gem.

Anyway, these are what I'm torn between: Sunder+Multistrike+Ruthless+Brutality Sunder+Multistrike+Ruthless+Chance to bleed Sunder+Multistrike+Ruthless+Added fire damage Reason I added ruthless to all of these is because at level 20 it gives you a 30% chance to deal 113% more melee damage, and 113/3.33 = 34%, and since it is melee damage rather than melee physical it also applies to elemental damage so it is basically 34% more damage. Also gives stuns which is nice. Brutality would technically give the most raw DPS on its own, but the problem is I wouldn't have any use of Hatred or HoA, I think if I were to use brutality the best aura combo would be haste+arctic armor+Blasphemy with vulnerability. Problem with this is I would either have to use an essence worm ring to socket haste or I would need two level 4 enlighten gems, which I won't be able to afford at the start of a league. Also keep in mind mana doesn't matter because this build utilizes a soul taker. For the versions with Chance to bleed and added Fire, luckily I can keep my auras (Hatred, HoA, Arctic Armor) and a ring socket, but I'm not sure what would give more DPS, I'm leaning towards added fire though. So what should I go with? If none, which other alternatives would be better? Also any other recommendations for changes I should make to the build for 3.0 would be nice too. "

For comparison, Duelist has : * 150 % increased bleed damage While Shadow has : * 215 % physical damage Shadow also has some dot scaling on top of that, the generic physical damage can be used to also scale the attack, and lots of the nodes are right in pathing, the only advantage Duelist has is dmg per point efficiency. I have two solutions for this issue : -&gt; Change some of the nodes in the Duelist area from being tied to attacks only to ""Physical Damage with Attack Skills"", this way the bleed also gets scaled. -&gt; Add a new Keystone between Duelist and Ranger, ""Hemorrhagic Stroke"" *Enemy takes full bleed damage even when stationary, 50% less hit damage* **Curses, Auras and Heralds** With the addition of the new supports, players are finally able to make fully dedicated physical attack builds, no longer being tied to using Added Fire/Hatred/Herald of Ash. Brutality specifically denies the user from dealing elemental damage with his skill. This creates a few problems. 1.There is no physical scaling aura. Elemental builds have Wrath, Anger and Hatred (which is slightly different since it needs a physical base to function). Physical builds have nothing. A ""more physical damage"" aura seems the obvious answer here, although i'm confident more creative solutions can be found. 2.There are no physical/damage over time heralds. Herald of Ash scales from phys but is still elemental damage, while the other two rely on elemental scaling and shock/freeze application, something that will be almost non existent in physical only builds. Suggestions : -&gt; Herald of Blood x % more physical damage, on kill enemies explode dealing x to y physical damage. Like Gratuitous Violence explosion, only flat damage rather than % based to make it much weaker. This would also greatly help Melee Splash builds that are still incredibly sub par clear speed wise. -&gt; Herald of Agony x % more damage over time, on kill enemy's corpse hinders nearby enemies. 3.The two physical scaling Curses are in a awkward spot. * Punishment has failed as design and is almost never used. * Vulnerability is Int aligned, even though Bleed is Strength-Dexterity aligned, and dots in general are Int-Dex aligned For example as a Duelist, the defacto bleed class, you will have to get a very large amount of int just to use vulnerability at higher levels. Suggestions : -&gt; Rework Punishment to give a base of bonuses, then temporary larger bonuses based on how many enemies hit you recently. This way it always has a benefit, and proves viable and usable. -&gt; Change Vulnerability so it's 100% Damage over Time dedicated, and create another generic physical damage curse, this time, Str/Dex aligned.

So to you experienced totemers, some questions: 1) I assume totem have its own base life, which only can be scaled from % totem life on tree and gems, but not based on life stats of your character's gear right? 2) Whatever dps your main hand weapon have will be used for totem dps calc? Does the totem benefit from the weapon's unique mod, like i.e. Bleeding on hit? What happens if u dual wield weapons? Will it take the average or alternate weapon usage, just as like a player would? And would it gain dual wielding bonus? How does one scale crit chance/multi on totem? Is it like u would for a players skill, i.e. Taking 'increased melee crit chance/multi' on tree will apply it to the totem? 3) if i have a corrupted glove with i.e vulnerability on hit, will it apply to my totem? 4) totem have a base max charges of 0, so technically that makes totem always at max charges. If i use a snakebite glove which give 'poison at max frenzy charge', does it apply to my totem? 5) whatever aura i run is applied to my totem right? Thats it for now, I hope I can get some good feedback from u guys. Cheers! "

However, combining max block with Xirgil's Crank and Occultist's Wicked Ward would allow you to sustain RF off ES recharge alone, though we will get some ES regen with Zealot's Oath. Funding this build will probably be my currency goal for next league Passive Tree - URL Ascendancies: Occultist - Wicked Ward, Vile Bastion, Profane Bloom, Malediction Mechanics: Max Block - Achieved with 4x Reckless Defense jewels &amp; Rumi's. Reckless Defense downside would be mitigated with Enfeeble. Xirgil's Crank gives 20% to activate ES recharge on block. Wicked Ward + RF - Whenever we start ES recharge we'll have uninterrupted ES recharge for 4 seconds. We get 105% increased recharge rate on the tree so we have 41% of our pool regened per second. It is important to note that this cannot retrigger while it's active, so there will be a short downtime while you wait to get hit and block. For that reason we also need to have ES regen to sustain RF while Wicked Ward is down or use a flask of dowsing to allow our ES recharge to start again. Unique's - Shav's + Xirgil's, 4x Reckless Defense. Can't do RF with a CI build as life is reduced to one, FYI. Spell of Choice: Scorching Ray - CwC - Flame Surge. Scorching Ray will lower resists, and flame surge gets 50% more damage on burning targets. RF should be sufficient for clearing white packs with ~60k dps without curses and before essence helm/gloves. Most of the tree is scaling fire damage or defenses, so SC CwC Flame Surge will fit the melee caster theme and allow good single target deeps with no cast speed investment. Scorching Ray additionally scales abnormally well off of Empower for some reason. You could also opt for a lightning/cold spell to apply chill or shock and elemental equilibrium. With a CwC setup you want to select skills with high cast times, so based off this good candidates would be Vortex, Firestorm, Arctic Breath, Glacial Cascade. Gem Links: Helm: RF - Inc AOE - Inc Burn - Elemental Focus. Ideally you'd want an essence of horror helm Staff - I'm going to opt for Scorching Ray - CwC - Flame Burst - Controlled Destruction - Elemental Focus - Empower. Armour - Curse application for Flammability/Ele Weakness, Enfeeble, and Vulnerability/Temp Chains/Warlord's Mark. I'm going to probably do BV or Ball Lightning. Gloves - Leap Slam - Faster Attacks - Fortify - Purity of Fire. Essence of Insanity gonna help the clear speed. Boots - Blood Magic - Discipline; CwDT (high level) - Stone Golem And Arctic Armour and/or Enduring Cry in the ring slots if you want DPS - with max stacks of SC, curses applied PoB is giving me: 160k RF 490k SC 330k Flame Surge Pros - Hipster Build - Incredible Survivability - 1mil max DPS without double dipping - Can probably facetank most content - Multispell build is fun Cons - Crit map mods could fuck you up potentially -Not t1 clear speed -Multispell builds suck -Gonna need a mana flask if you're not using Warlord's Mark"

Clear speed was noticibly slower. To combat this, I attempted to effectively spread my damage area by trying proliferation, which of course meant that I had to drop my Pyre ring. Hrimburn gloves were an option however the problem with these gloves is that they still allow Vortex to freeze, which has a negative effect on burn proliferation. The only other option was The Three Dragons helmet which so far is working very well. However, I soon realised that I could no longer use lightning damage (Orb of Storms, more specifically) to proc vulnerability to fire and cold, as lightning damage may freeze enemies when using this helmet. In other words, a similar problem to that when using Hrimburn gloves. The only thing I could come up with was to alternate some sort of fire spell with Vortex, in order to switch between vulnerability to fire and cold. I ended up hitting a bit of a brick wall here. I am now trying to theorycraft a build that is focused around stacking ignites through the use of the Emberwake ring, while still using The Three Dragons helmet. I intend on using Multiple Traps and Cluster Traps together, as well as Cheap Construction and/or Unstable Payload jewels to maximise the amount of traps and trap triggers (and therefore Vortex casts) in order to stack burns. This is where I am now, however I am not sure whether I am better off just using a single-burn type build (as originally planned) or pursue the burn stacking idea. I would welcome any suggestions regarding how to best apply fire based damage to large packs to proc vulrunability to cold. I would also welcome any insight regarding the burn stacking idea.

Hi! I have tons of questions. I've been playing PoE off and on for ages, but I want to finally buckle down and get serious for a League - this one is awesome, I get to try out all the shit I missed along the way. I like summoners, and am therefore gonna play one again. I'm kinda intrigued by the new helm - The Baron gives your minions your strength, which is neat. However, it's sort of led me down a rabbit hole of damage multipliers, damage double-dipping, etc, etc. So I understand at the most basic level the difference between Increased and More. So the super basic formula is - say I have an attack that deals 100 damage. I have 100% increased damage with the attack, and then 50% More damage with it. My attack does 100 * (1 + 1.00) * (1+0.50) for a total of 300 damage on the hit. Question #1 - lets say I have 100% increased minion damage, I have 50% more damage from, say, a Minion Damage gem, and then I give my minions my 500 strength. We'll say my zombie is still hitting for 100 base. **Does strength simply count as another source of Increased Damage modifier?** If so, then my formula now looks like 100 * (1+1.00+1.00) * (1+0.50) for a total of 450 damage. Correct? Question #2 - There are several gems or auras which deal a % of a physical attack as elemental damage. I.E. Hatred. **These work off of the final amount of physical damage going out, and therefore count as an additional layer of More damage, correct?** I.E. same attack with lv. 10 hatred deals a total of 100 * (3) * (1.5) * (1.3) = 585 (450 phys 135 cold). Question #3 - **[So now lets talk about Poison](URL Reading that wiki page, it says that Poison double dips - meaning that damage increases are applied multiple times during the process of calculating my poison damage. So, to recap at this point, I have 3 modifiers right now - 100% increased minion damage, 100% increased melee physical damage from strength, and 50% more damage. My Hatred damage wouldn't matter, since it's not Physical or Chaos damage. So my base hit of 450 generates a base DoT of 36 damage per second (450 * 0.08). The Wiki specifically says that my 100% minion damage will double-dip. **Does my increased strength damage or my More damage from the gem I've got socketed also double dip?** Question #4 - Damage multipliers on the target. Lets say I have a level 11 Vulnerability curse on hit setup. This means that enemies are taking 25% increased physical damage ('cuz they're not an act/map boss so they don't have 60% less curse effect). 4a - Hatred: A hit from my zombie is dealing 585 damage. 450 phys, 135 cold. The 25% increase comes *after* my damage is calculated, so even though my final physical damage is (450 * 1.25) = 562.5, **the cold damage is not effected because it's based on my outgoing damage, not the damage dealt**. 4b - Poison: A hit from my zombie is dealing 450 damage and applying a poison effect at (450 * 0.08) plus modifiers. However, Poison says the DoT applied is based on the damage *dealt* by the attack - meaning that when my curse scales my damage done to 562.5, my Poison effect becomes (562.5 * 0.08), correct? Whew. OK. I think that covers the basics. "

The reason why I annoy you with posting of yet another guide on reddit is because I've already bought the Reaper MTX for Mathil's ST build with Mortem Morsu and Cherrubim's Maleficence, but item's prices skyrocketed, so I've decided to make my own build with blackjack. Besides, Mathil's build guide was life based, and I've tried to play life based character this league. It was awful. CI FTW. So, as far as I get Mathil uses the claws to get: 1) physical do chaos conversion 2) poision on hit He scales of physical and chaos damage and currently uses 5l. I've done my research and found out that there is another weapon for phys -&gt; chaos conversion, which is Innsbury Edge (1h sword), which has higher phys to chaos conversion and pdmg, so I've decided to design my build keeping that item in mind. Of course, for 1h sword utilization Duelist would be much better, however it's too far away from CI and ES nodes imo, so I've started with Shadow. Ranger could be an option too, as ST scales good with projectile damage, which is available from the beginning, but with ranger you obviously won't get that juicy ascendancy passives. So Assassin that is. Sword nodes are pretty far away from Shadow area, so I've ended up taking only 1 sword cluster, which I think is enough (?) and focused on chaos and physical damage, while trying to take as much ES nodes as possible. I ended up with 4 jewel sockets, 1 of which is reserved from Energy from Within, near Melding. Bandits go this way: kraityn, kraityn, alira. So the conversion problem is solved with the sword, now we need the poision on hit. We've got some options here, but in budged friendly build (haha, CI budged friendly :/ ), I'd just got with poison support. Skill tree is [here](URL For the links on ST I went Added Chaos, Void Manipulation, Poison, Faster Attacks, LMP (GMP, Slower Projectiles). As for curses my guess is Vulnerability is a must have. Maybe some defensive one's like Enfeeble or Temporal Chains. For auras I think Arctic Armour, Discipline and Haste would work. Other defensive things are Immortal Call - CwDT - Duration, maybe. I'm no way an experienced PoE player, nor good theorycrafter, but this build, I think, could work. I would be very happy if you review this guide, optimize the skill tree and kick me in the right direction."

My logic was because Frost Blades has good clear and bad single target, Molten Strike the opposite. So I got to thinking, both of them are projectiles in their secondary form, which means, you guessed it, a double dipping poison build! You would need to use a 2h weapon, Edge of Madness or Terminus Est would both be good here. If you went Edge of Madness you would do a Raider with Snakebite, or Pathfinder, you need poison from somewhere. If you did Terminus Est you could go Assassin and get constant power and frenzy charges, your damage would be beastly. Dual curse Vulnerability/Proj Weakness. With Vaal Lightning Trap up and a Wither totem at 10 stacks, you're doing several million DPS on Molten Strike. And Frost Blades is just going to shred everything. You can get Acro/Phase acro and 200% life from the tree. Pretty tanky for a life build. Anyone who wants the path of building link, message me."

I'm a closed beta supporter (have kiwi to prove it) and I've probably put more hours in this game than any other in the last 5 years by a lot. I kind of suck though and my usual routine is to jump in for the beginning of challenge leagues, play 2 or 3 characters into low maps then quit after they die. The combination of technical improvements and finally playing alongside a friend this league pushed me to commit for a full 2 months. I've hit all kinds of personal milestones and it's been extremely satisfying so I thought I would share. My experience is quite different to the experience described in a lot of community discussion right now so maybe this will give some of you really awesome players an idea of what a not so awesome player is up to. Here's a list of most of the characters I've played this league (may be forgetting one or two) * 85 Bladefall Trap Sabateur - Don't remember what killed it but the char sucked anyway * 75 Warchief Totem Chieften - Died in Tul breach in a low tier map * 90 Ice Trap Sabateur - Died to flame bearers while I was looting and not paying attention * 91 Life based BV Pathfinder - Died to Atziri reflect because I didn't know that was a mechanic * 84 Bobslop's lowlife SRS auramancer - Died in merc lab to traps (lul) * 84 Bobslop's lowlife SRS auramancer - tried again, died in mid tier maps by being frozen by sea witches * 88 Alkaizer's block gladiator - Died in first uber lab attempt, mostly because I let vulnerability curse through in first phase for some reason * 93 Waggle's Xoph's Nurture rain of arrows slayer - Alive! * Also lost 3 or 4 characters sub 60 while leveling. First time achievements in this league: * First 6 link - A lightning coil on the ice trapper, only took 110 fusing, ripped shortly after getting it * First chance skyforth - Actually first ever chance unique, sold for 27ex which I am not spending for some reason * First Atziri kill - On the BV pathfinder, no idea what I was doing but I did succeed on first attempt * 4 breachlord kills - Icetrapper did Xoph and Esh, BV did uul-netol and Tul, tul was sketchy. * First level 90 - Achieved 3 times this league even though I had never done it before * First time to red maps - I've cleared up to t14 currently, really struggling to maintain pool and have close calls regularly if I run damage mods. * Getting close to top 1000 on BHC ladder, which is next goal. Can't wait for act 5. Thanks for an awesome game GGG."
380,vulnerability,pathofexile,Tabletop RPG inspired by PoE,66,5qw0sh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/5qw0sh/tabletop_rpg_inspired_by_poe/,2017-01-30 07:47:46,"As a Path of Exile player, when I designed Nightmares of the Dead Dreamers, I was obviously inspired by Path of Exile in some of the design decisions. The most notable is in character advancement customization. Without knowing the game rules it is difficult to truly understand these, but I want to share them anyway so you guys can see the customization available. If this interests you, the game releases on February 1st as ""pay what you want"" early access. &amp;nbsp; I really like the customization that Path of Exile offers, and the meaningful choices you make in building a character. One of the most notable choices you make are the notable/keystone passives you choose when building a character, which come with trade-offs and change the way your character interacts with the mechanics of the game. This is what I wanted to capture by designing the Psychic Anomalies posted below. &amp;nbsp; Psychic Anomalies are powerful psychic manipulations of reality available to all characters. Each anomaly can only be gained once. Ghost Dance: You have Advantage on all Active Defense tests, but equipment no longer provides you with an armor rating. Acrobatics: Mobility-based tests can be re-rolled once per turn, but each piece of equipment weighs 2 additional points of Bulk. Determination: Attacks always deal damage, including disaster rolls, but deal no extra damage from complete successes or critical hits. Absorption: Armor rating from equipment no longer reduces damage, but is added together and becomes treated as absorption rating. Any incoming damage subtracts from the absorption rating, damaging your armor instead of actually injuring you. However, once the absorption rating reaches 0, your armor is considered completely broken, and you take damage with no protection. Can only be recovered by repairing or replacing armor. Dark Hunger: By causing injuries, you recover injuries, but can no longer heal naturally. Remove the least important injury from any body location any time you roll a critical hit. Black Blood: Any time you receive damage from an enemy, that damage(after armor) is also inflicted onto all nearby enemies, but you no longer recover additional injuries from medical treatment. Mountain: Your armor rating is doubled, but you lose the ability to perform active defense tests. Multiple Strikes: Increase your combat dice pool limit by 1 and gain an extra attack action, but attack actions may only deal weapon damage, no other damage may be dealt. Shield Wall: Your shield's weapon rating is added as armor rating against any incoming attack, but you suffer disadvantage on all active defense tests, and all attacks made against you have advantage. Bloodletting: Remove 1 Stress any time you suffer an injury in combat, but you can no longer recover Stress naturally, and you now gain twice as much Blood Loss from injuries. Execution: Deal 1d10 extra damage on Completely Successful attacks and critical hits, but deal no damage with partially successful attacks. Cursed Touch: Your successful attacks cause the target to suffer Disadvantage and Vulnerability(receiving double damage) until your next turn, but you cannot deal weapon damage. Iron Grip: When grappling an opponent, attacks deal an extra 20 damage, but you deal 20 less damage any time you attack with a weapon regardless if you are grappling or not. Cohesion: Increase your combat dice pool limit by 2, and allow allies to use dice from your dice pool, but you can only roll/expend 1 die per turn. Provocation: Choose to make an attack action that causes your target to ignore your allies and focus their attention on you for one round, but you suffer Vulnerability(receiving double damage) for that round. Warlord: When surrounded by at least 3 opponents in close range, you may make two additional attack actions without expending dice from your pool, but you suffer Disadvantage on all tests while surrounded. A Feast of Souls: Slain enemies are stored as souls, carry up to a maximum of 6 souls. Consume a soul to deal 1d10 extra damage on a successful attack, to remove a major injury, or to roll an additional die on a skill test. However, your maximum combat dice pool is reduced by 2. Vile Sacrifice: At the start of your turn, you may choose to gain 1d10 Doom points to recover an additional die to your dice pool. Corruption: Gain +1 on all combat tests, but gain double the amount of Stress any time you roll Strain in combat. Running of Blood: Every point of Blood Loss you currently suffer, causes you to deal an additional point of damage, but you can no longer remove Blood Loss with bandages. Berserk: Your successful attacks affect all enemies within range of your attack, but you gain 1 stress point for every enemy that you hit. Regeneration: Recover from injuries at an accelerated speed, removing an additional injury of any severity from any body location after a full rest, but permanently suffer Vulnerability(receiving double damage). Battlecry: Expend 3 dice and gain 3 stress points to shout an intimidating war cry that causes nearby enemies to become stunned and lose a turn. Carnage: You deal maximum damage with your partially successful attacks, but you suffer Disadvantage in combat. Weapon Master: Deal double weapon damage on Completely Successful attacks, and triple weapon damage on Critical Hits, but your attacks only deal weapon damage, no other damage may be dealt. Hulking: Deal maximum damage on critical hits, but deal minimum damage otherwise. Run Speed: Gain an extra 30 feet of movement on a mobility-based action, but you cant perform more than one mobility-based action in a combat round. Bombardment: Ranged attacks repeat an additional time, but your attacks only deal weapon damage, no other damage may be dealt. *Receiving injuries twice means if you receive a major injury to the arm, you receive two major injuries to the arm. If you have multiple anomalies that cause you to receive injuries twice, you only multiply the original injury. For example, if you have two anomalies that cause you to receive injuries twice, if you receive a major injury, you receive 2 additional major injuries. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Edit: To elaborate a bit more, the game is set in a world of surreal horror, and I had previously only released fragments of lore to piece together similar to how PoE has its lore scattered throughout the world. The premise of the setting is ""In a bleak post-apocalyptic world, ancient alchemists discover a way to travel through their dreams to other dimensions. While these alchemists dream in comatose stasis, they use illusion magick to enslave caretakers for their lifeless bodies, and manipulate thousands to build archaic civilizations that worship the dreamers as gods. The dreamers go to war, forcing nightmares upon each other, and imprisoning natural-born psychics to absorb their nightmares. When they die, fragments of their dreams and nightmares are born into reality, forming labyrinths of surreal horror. Within these labyrinths, survivors emerge from the dimension beyond. These survivors awaken to the real world. A place now haunted by the nightmares of the dead dreamers."" The core mechanic is a dice pool system based on risk/reward. Roll 1d10, 2d10, or 3d10, (d10= ten-sided die) use the highest result and add your skill rank(0 to 5). 10 or higher is complete success. Less than 10 is partial success. Less than your Stress score is Disaster. If any dice roll a natural 1, you gain Stress equal to the number of dice you rolled. This is in addition to the result of the highest rolled die, but the Stress gain is factored in before resolving the action. Characters can reduce stress by eating, relaxing, entertaining each other, etc. but have to manage their resources and time spent on activities each day, without getting lost in the night(when the landscape becomes nightmarish). There are a specific set of rules for the amount of time various tasks take in the Survival section of the book. Combat involves the dice pool being in limited supply. Once a die is rolled, it is expended from the dice pool and cannot be rolled again until dice are regained. Combat doesn't follow an initiative system, instead it is broken up into the players' turn and the adversaries' turn. Each player regains 2 dice at the start of the players' turn, and 1 die at the start of the adversaries' turn, to an initial maximum of 3 dice in the pool (this can be increased through character advancement options). Characters have a body injury chart, where there are 6 locations (Head, R/L arms, torso, and R/L legs) that each have 4 bubbles for Major injuries, 2 bubbles for Grievous injuries, and 1 bubble for Mortal injury. If you have 4 major injuries, the 5th would turn all of your major injuries into a grievous injury. Injuries are determined by the damage received, where normally armor reduces this amount. Each injury type causes a certain amount of Blood Loss, which is essentially the character's Life pool, where if it goes over the Exsanguination limit, the character falls unconscious and starts bleeding out. Characters can bandage themselves in combat by expending 2 dice from their dice pool and gaining a Stress point in order to reduce their blood loss by 1d10, this is by default the only way Stress is gained in combat(even if you roll a natural 1, you don't normally gain Stress in combat). There are a lot of mechanics in play here, but the rules only take about 20 minutes to read. In terms of similarities to PoE's skill gems, this game doesn't have any crazy magical skill gems, but there is a similarity with the Skill system. Your character's Rank 1 skills are generalized words that are tied to the character's background, like ""Forest"" ""Brutal"" or ""Beasts."" These rank 1 skills can be used for any action where those would apply, such as hunting in a forest, or to make a brutal attack, or taming a wild beast. You can then ""modify"" these skills (similar to support gems), by making them more specific of a higher rank. So, rank 2 skills could be ""Forest Hunting"" or ""Brutal Attack"" or ""Beast Taming."" Each rank needs to be more specific. Similar to how with support gems, you have a generic version that is low powered, but then you have Support Gems that can modify how they work. It's not exactly Area of Effect, More Damage/Increased Damage, Poison modifiers, but still has a design similarity. (Anyway, really sorry for adding to the wall of text, but someone told me I should elaborate!)"

I'm going to play an Evasion based raider probably next league. Claws and swords will get buff so i might build with bloodseekers and maybe later varunastra or rare claws.

So here i'm playing a stacking evasion build (life based). -What should i use as a defensive mechanic? I might play full phys. With grace + blasphemy Vulnerability, non crit. So vs reflect and for tankiness what's best ? Shield with jewels and +%block chance in skill tree or shield with acrobatics. I might stacks max frenzy with +2 frenzy darkray vectors which with 10 frenzy grants +20% dodge but maybe vaal grace is enough to reach the dodge cap (65 or 75 ?). Then blooddance or Atziri's Steps are better ( no 50% less frenzy duration). But I'll less block 'cause of Acrobatics. And i don't know if it's reliable. I am afraid of reflect too. -I might pick vaal pact if I dont use bloodseeker but I wonder if losing regen is ok ( especially blood dance 1% regen per frenzy as the legacy version looked like). -Also is there good points about Dual Wielding? I am going non crit and claws have nice implicit that can be stacked. My skills of choice are reave and flicker. However i am not picking AoE in the skill tree, don't know if it's a big loss. Also is 157% life ok for T16 ? I only played low life and CI so i'm not sure."

I also boosted a lot of uber runs for my friends and was still able to get 3-4 keys on boost runs. I think the build is about as finished as it's gonna get so here's the bones of it, I may write a detailed guide with videos and stuff to it later if there's interest. [Build at level 90](URL Required items: [Wings of Entropy (4-link is enough)](URL [Bringer of Rain](URL Auras: Hatred, Arctic Armour (negotiable, don't run Hatred if you get a Voidheart) Links: In hat, Cyclone (high quality), Fortify, Added Fire, Inc. Aoe or Conc. effect (alternate for bosses.) You may want to switch to Added Chaos over Added Fire, especially if running a Voidheart. Hypothermia is also a viable gem when running AA. Other 4-links: Leap Slam-Faster Attacks-Blood Magic-Flame Golem Hatred-AA-Enduring Cry-Blood Rage CWDT-Vulnerability(or any curse)-Increased Duration-Ancestral Warchief Character: URL (charname Manni for the most recently passed one) &amp;nbsp; **How the Build Works** With the Slayer abilities and other passives, you reach a life leech rate of 43% of your maximum life per second. That means that together with your life regen, you can heal up almost 50% of your max hp every second. Thanks to the fast attack speed of Cyclone, you can maintain this [leech rate](URL even against a single target. Keeping up a leech rate this high would probably not be possible with slow-attacking skills like EQ. Combined with your layered defenses, this leech rate ensures that you can face tank even stronger bosses without needing your life flasks. Also due to the fact that you cull everything at 20%, you can kill Uber Izaro's last form easily without losing your defensive flasks. &amp;nbsp; Your total defenses at level 90 will be: 6500+ life, 7 Endurance Charges, 23% Fortify, 3-5k Armor, 38%+ block, Blind from BoR and the ability to chill bosses with AA. With your evasion, block chance and Blind bosses should hit you maybe 1/3 of the time or less. Tooltip DPS with Hatred + Conc effect at level 90 should be around 40-45k, and ~70k with BR, onslaught, Headsman and Frenzy Charges. Flasks: You'll want 1-2 instant health pots, a freeze immune quicksilver and (ideally) a Chemist's Basalt Flask of Grounding. Fifth flasks can be whatever you want but freeze and shock immune are vital against Izaro when he has elemental buffs. &amp;nbsp; **Uber lab:** You can safely do Uber lab at 75 if you want to (though you may not want to give Izaro too many buffs) and comfortably farm 4 keys at 80+. While this build can kill the final form fast, I wouldn't recommend running him with Charges + another serious damage buff or double elemental buffs (Essences &amp; conduits), especially when he is using dual swords. 2-handed Mace does significantly less damage than the sword versions. For Curse Fonts, you can run 2 anti-curse utility flasks and disregard the mechanic entirely. In the last phase you can use Enduring Cry on the sentinel totems to get 3-4 charges before the boss activates, also it is important to prepot Basalt flask right as he activates if he has buffed damage as you don't have all your defenses available immediately. In the first 2 trials be careful because if your DPS is high, he can go invulnerable and be un-leechable while he finishes summoning the rest of his adds like Lieutenants. Getting teleported isn't a big issue, just leap slam back into action. If Izaro parks himself on top of saw or other non-spike traps, don't worry, you can just attack him and out-leech the trap damage too. Argus is easy but you may want to make sure you have all your endurance charges before engaging him and pop Basalt for the first enrage. If he gets ghosted you may want to abort, depending on the ghost. Use 2x Brightbeak in weapon switch if you gottagofast &amp;nbsp; **Leveling:** Having leveled a slayer 5 times now I think I have a firm grasp on how to do it, here's what I've found works best. [Build at level 39 or so, has good stats and regen for easy leveling](URL [Build at level 70, respec out of early nodes when you have your BoR](URL Leveling with 2h build seems better to me. Up until level 12 use whatever, then use Sunder, at level 31 use Earthquake - Less Duration - Melee Phys - Added Fire/Fortify in a 4-link. Earthquake seems better for leveling until you have your BoR imo, at least unless you have some 30% MS leveling boots. Use Cauteriser and whatever leveling weapons you have, if any. Ascendancy leveling order: Bane of Legends &gt; Endless Hunger &gt; Brutal Fervour &gt; Headsman *Do normal lab as soon as you can, the Bane of Legends ascendancy will significantly speed up your leveling.* &amp;nbsp; Ideas for improving when you've hit endgame: If like me you've earned tons of chaos from lab farming you may want to consider buying a Disfavour or an equally sexy weapon and speccing into a regular 2h build (takes less than 12 points to respec.) Alternatively you can acquire Steel Rings for more damage, and/or a Voidheart and switch Hatred into Blasphemy Vulnerability and Added Fire into Added Chaos. If you feel like the build isn't defensive enough, you can also run Grace and use 2 points to grab IR, or if you feel like it is too defensive, lose some life nodes and grab Wrecking Ball. &amp;nbsp; Before you ask: &gt;Why Wings of Entropy and BoR? Because they're good &amp; cheap sources of damage and BoR saves you from needing to worry about links. Wings of Entropy benefits from all the Slayer ascendancy 2-handed passives, and I find that the added layer of mitigation from block &amp; blind increase the potential of the leech tank significantly, especially in Breaches and when bossing. &gt;Why Slayer? Because it's awesome and because I don't find Juggernaut as good for lab farming. &gt;Is this end game viable? I killed some guardians last league with a 2h build that had similar damage so I would say yes, but the damage probably isn't high enough for Shaper, at least not without changing the build into 2H or Voidheart or something.. But at the very least you should have no problems facetanking bosses like Chimera. &amp;nbsp; Credit to Hegemony for giving me the idea to run WoE on Slayer."

I've already wasted 8 or 9 sets on this fight and I just can't seem to push through to the end. My best try was ~20% in p3 but that was basically a hail mary after I somehow managed to dodge bullet hell and survive the onslaught of two Shapers from ~50% to 20% while on last portal. My character: URL (RaiderIsMyNewBFF). Tldr - it's a dreamfeather BF raider that strongly relies on flasks, pretty standard setup. The character clears t15 bosses like they're not even there, guardians are fairly simple. My hideout evasion is ~32k, with flasks it's at 55k and my flasked tooltip with conc effect is ~4.8k with ~12 aps. Bottom line, my problem is dps. I've died enough times that I can more or less dodge the oneshot mechanics for days but what eventually fucks me over are vortexes that slowly fill up the arena. I also can't seem to bring the adds down even if I stand directly in front of the portal. My combat aura setup is grace + blasphemy with vulnerability. Survivability is fine thanks to (M)VP and WB but as my room for maneuvering narrows the amount of errors I make exponentially increases. I think my gear is fairly decent, I could upgrade my left ring with one that adds chaos damage, get a better roll on my offhand DF and get a helm with BF enchant (a long shot). I could also drop the onslaught ascendancy for Veil but that doesn't add anything to my dps. Bottom line, I don't think these relatively small upgrades would add up enough to give me that edge in the fight. Fwiw, I also tried dual wielding The Scourge which I had laying in my bank but it didn't really change much and Dreamfeather just feels better and smoother overall. So I'm wondering if there's anything I can do on mechanical level. I can't really cheese the fight with leech since I'm at 5.7k hp and my leech rate even with VP isn't high enough anyway at my damage level. I'd really love to beat the fight with this character because I enjoy playing it."

It'll last a while and have good AoE. Or just Blasphemy Temp Chains for the defence, curse something else (Warlord's Mark, for the life+mana sustain for MoM)? Vulnerability + DoT from a Witchfire? Saemus' Gift as the quiver? Or just Soul Strike/something else? Go hybrid/CI/low-life? Single-target 6-link could be Wither - CwC - Storm Call - Faster Casting - Conc Effect - ~~Less Duration/Added Chaos/Lightning?~~ Rapid Decay? We also want Void Manipulation in there somewhere, because of chroming and dealing with reflect? Instead of Faster Casting? Any similar things already out there, or suggestions to make it (more) viable? Is the 60% convertion of Voltaxic not worth it without building crit? Is VP needed to handle the reflect of Storm Call? We can also use CwDT Vortex/Arctic Breath, or an Aquamarine flask, to produce chilled ground, to additionally slow enemies and trigger the Scion Inquisitor crit chance. Though perhaps a Searing Bond totem or Fire Trap would be best? I guess it's mostly to ensure EO is up, rather than increase the chances of shocking from SC."

This is totally fine with me. Risk vs. Reward makes sense in this case. These negative effect Darkshrines are by far the most common. Once again, I have no problem with this. ""Life is an exercise in duality. One can only appreciate pleasure if there has been pain to put it into context. The delightful taste of a Knickerbocker Glory is nothing if you've never staked your bollocks over a worktop and set about them with a toffee hammer."" **Here comes my issue.** The good Darkshrines are rare. The effects they give, with the exception of Lead to Gold are 'meh' overall. But the single most frustrating part of the 'good' Darkshrines are that they last for one room. One. Single. Room. A Darkshrine giving Vulnerability lasts the entire lab. A Darkshrine giving MORE monster health lasts the entire lab. A Darkshrine giving Minus Maximum Player Resistances (-14% to be specific) lasts the entire lab. But a Darkshrine that gives zero mana cost lasts for one room. A Darkshrine giving rares a Nemesis modifier affects only the room you are in. The incredibly-rare-to-begin-with Darkshrine giving you a Diamond Shrine is for one room only. The 'good' Darkshrines are already rare. GGG, why would you also make them useless in the one area where they are actually useful, the Aspirant's Trial, by limiting them to the current area? There is a time opportunity cost to get these Darkshrines. There is risk involved with the Darkshrine screwing you over and giving you Vulnerability or some other negative effect. But because the 'good' effects never affect you in the place where they would be more than a simple 'Oh, cool I guess', there is no point to get a Darkshrine, with the exception of Lead to Gold. End Rant. **Edit**: I should probably mention that I love the Labyrinth. Like, a lot. It is seriously some of my favorite content in the game. I understand why people do not like it and I see that point, but I love the lab and this rant here drives me crazy. Darkshrine was my favorite league of all time, and seeing them in the Lab made me smile. At first. But then realizing how poorly implemented they were made it really sad to see. I want crazy risk to pay out with crazy reward sometimes. Most of the time? No. But every now and then: Permanent Diamond Shrine. Or something better than they are now."

The gear** * Helmet - Heretic's Veil (For the temp chains curse) * Boots - Bones of Ullr (+1 spectre) * Weapon - Severed in sleep (source of poison) * Shield - Rare ES shield * Gloves - Rare ES gloves * Chest - Rare ES chest OR Vis Mortis * Amulet - Rare Essence crafted (Minion MS) OR Eye of Chayula * Ring 1 - Rare Essence crafted (Minion MS), preferably unset ring * Ring 2 - The Pariah (for socketing Discipline) * Belt - [Umbilicius Immortalis](URL This is ""the big one"", in combination with the planned flasks it would scale the minion chaos damage tremendously. * Flasks - Atziri's Promise, Sin's Rebirth, Witchfire Brew, Vessel of Vinktar (spell one), Overflowing Chalice * Jewels - 1x Unending Hunger, the rest generic minion jewels. &amp;nbsp; **4. Some number crunching** * Physical damage added as chaos (for minions): 29% (Spirit Offering) + 32,5% (Atziri's Promise with flaske effect) + 30% (Unholy Might from Sin's Rebirth OR Vis Mortis) = 91,5% * Increased Minion damage: 150% (General Minion damage from tree) + 100% (For spectres from Soul Weaver) + 60% (4x generic minion damage jewels) + 25% (Severed in sleep) + 74% (Commander of Darkness with 5 Auras and 48% increased aura Effect) = 409% * More multipliers (that double dip on poison damage) - 1.49 (Minion damage), 1.39 (Void Manipulation). Controlled Destruction (1.44) doesn't double dip. All in all, I like these numbers and the damage should be pretty good, the survivability if what concerns me (more in the next section). And there's more to it - the damage from Witchfire (Vulnerability aura and DoT), Shock from Vinktar's, Chaos Damage debuff from Wither and Increased poison duration from Temporal chains. I will try to run exact numbers later, but initial calculations (completely ignoring any poison damage, added chaos damage and void manipulation) came out to ~36k damage per hit at 5 blades per spectre. &amp;nbsp; **5.

The current plan is to use Convocation - ZO - Sulphur flask (Overflowing chalice) combo to deal with it, but I'm not sure the regen would be enough. Any suggestions? * The Unending Hunger jewell. As I understand, each stack grants 5% attack and cast speed, 5% ele resistances and 5% physical mitigation. Is this correct? Also I realize that using this jewel will make it impossible to use any vall skills, so would it be worth it? * Could Vis Mortis be viable? It grants +1 spectre and Unholy Might on kill for spectres, so it would free up a flask spor and increase builds damage, while loosing out on ton of ES and having reduced minion life. I'm thinking that 3 spectres should be enough and the lost survivability isn't worth it. * Any ideas if the 100% spectre damage and the damage from commander of darkness double dips?

Illuminated devotion and Ritual of awakening from the heirophant ascendancy. Blasphemy+enfeeble (or vulnerability)+warlord's mark+herald of ash on gloves for increased AoE. Leaves me with 10% unreserved mana. Warlord's mark gives 2% mana leech, and endurance charges on kill, and templar area gives good mana regen. Ancestral warchief+ancestral protector+melee phys+Faster attacks on helmet, having both totems up adds more melee damage, attack speed, phys mitigation, and they both do decent damage. When they kill something i get increased attack speed from heirophant ascendency. weapon will have CWDT+IC+Inc duration+Chaos golem, and unlinked leap slam+FA, nothing special here. Boots will have:- Heavy Strike (or another single target skill)+ links. Boots give 2% life leech which will help with reflect/leeching. Chest will have Earthquake+fortify+other links.

I put some points into totem nodes that i was going to path next to anyways, and since they are a big part of the build, i thought it would be a good idea. B-how does the damage seem? If i feel like im not doing enough DPS, i will swap out enfeeble for vulnerability, which might help. I took about 2-3 Mace wheels, and the rest of the damage will come from the curses/totems/ascendency. C- Is it defensive enough for HC? Its gets about 185% life from the tree without including life from jewels, and it will have fortify/endurance charges/enfeeble(maybe). D-What should i put as a single target skill? The boots slot is open, and it gets 2% leech from ascendency, so it looks good for a single target/secondary damage setup. Thank you!"

Blight LV20 166 chaos/sec (Max 20 Stacks) 2.5 sec duration 0.3 cast time vs. Essence Drain 809 chaos/sec (Max 1 stack) 3.8 sec duration 0.75 cast time + 0.85 cast time (Contagion) It takes about 5 stacks of Blight to match Essence Drain's damage over time. At max stacks, Blight does a little over 4 times the damage of Essence Drain. When you take into account different support gem options (Blight's Concentrated Effect vs. Essence Drain's Slower Projectile), you can get that up to 5 times the damage. Note, the actual numbers for total damage aren't quite as high in Blight's case since in typical use, Essence Drain will be supported by Contagion and Essence Drain does a small amount of on-hit damage as well. Blight is heavily benefited by increased duration and increased casting speed since those make it easier to quickly stack instance of the damage debuff on enemies. In contrast, those things make Essence Drain play smoother &amp; easier to spread with Contagion, but don't directly increase dps. Blight is supposed to be boosted by Temporal Chains' increased duration of ailment effect. This is a bug that according to the patch notes will be fixed in the update. Main advantages of Blight over Essence Drain: Only requires one linked skill to do AoE (no need for Contagion) Higher maximum damage if you maximize stacks One of the lowest mana costs in the game Built in crowd-control with the strongest hinder effect in the game Directly benefits from increased duration, cast speed, and temporal chains I see most theorycrafting around the Blight skill as a companion to Essence Drain. This is a mistake IMO - you'd need two 6-links to avoid weakening either skill, as well as a 4-link Contagion, a 4-link Wither totem, and then you're left with only 4 sockets left to fit all your auras, curses, and other skills. Besides the socket issue, the gameplay style seems very busy &amp; clunky and not likely to work well. Seems like if you want to do ED, a traditional ED+Contagion setup with self-cast Wither as your spam spell would work much better. Similarly, I don't see much use in a cast while channeling setup as opposed to just casting Contagion or Essence Drain in their fully linked forms. I believe the best ways to utilize Blight would be in one of the following styles of builds. 1) Blight as burst dps. With this setup, you'd have Blight linked up with Void Manipulation, Rapid Decay, Controlled Destruction, Concentrated Effect, Increased AoE/Increased Duration/Faster Casting for the most concentrated damage possible. Then you'd use Abyssal Cry (+ Void Manipulation + Poison + Increased AoE) in the spot that ED would use Contagion to more easily take care of large groups of enemies. Occultist would be a good class choice here for the chaos resist lowering &amp; increased ES defense bonuses. 2) Blight as DPS+CC in a support or minion build. You'd probably swap out the Concentrated Effect gem from the previous style in favor of either AoE radius or duration to better take advantage of the hinder effect. This gives these builds a way to deal a bit of damage themselves while still supporting allies or minions with some more CC. Necromancer seems like a particularly strong class for this kind of build since you can get increased duration, damage, and cast speed from it (plus increased defense for yourself with Bone Offering), while still getting good bonuses for your minions. Final notes: Breath of the Council is probably the best weapon for any Blight build since it gives chaos damage, radius, and a huge increased duration buff. Temporal Chains &amp; Vulnerability are both strong curse choices (Vulnerability being especially valuable when you aren't using Wither &amp; have allies or minions that can also take advantage of the boost to physical damage taken)."

When they were released, there was not very many chaos abilities in the game. We can assume that with time, GGG will release more chaos abilities. It feels to me Contagion will become too niche and restrictive in the future. I came up with the idea to remake Contagion to interact with all chaos DoT effects. &gt;**Contagion 2.0** &gt;*Curse*, Spell, AoE, Duration, Chaos &gt;Radius: 22 (standard for curses) &gt;Mana cost: 24 to 50 (standard for curses) &gt;Cast time: 0.50 seconds (standard for curses) &gt;Curses all targets in an area, making them *less resistant to chaos damage. If a cursed enemy dies, all chaos DoT effects spread to other enemies.* &gt;Base duration is (9-10.9) seconds &gt;(0-38)% area of effect radius &gt;Cursed enemies have -(25-44)% chaos resistance' This remake turns Contagion into a viable support curse for all chaos DoT and poison builds. The spread speed will be slower, because only cursed enemies will spread DoT on death. I have not decided whether the spreading mechanic should mimic the Proliferation mechanic, or Bino's mechanic. It might become too strong with the latter. With this new chaos curse, we could also remove the archaic non-scaling increased DoT damage on **Vulnerability**, turning it into a pure physical curse. **EDIT** **Since the curse idea was not the most popular. A simpler solution is to keep Contagion as a non-curse, but make it spread all chaos DoT instead of just Essence Drain's DoT. This would allow you to build around single-target Viper Strike, phys spells supported by Poison without using a Bino's, Blight with Conc Effect etc.**"

403,vulnerability,pathofexile,Has anyone tried a fully double dipping BV build with Added Chaos?,4,5imnr6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/5imnr6/has_anyone_tried_a_fully_double_dipping_bv_build/,2016-12-16 16:46:37,"I'm theorycrafting a 100% chaos Blade Vortex Build right now, taking inspiration from stuff like King of the Forest, where you use Added Chaos and every single gem/node double dips to give you big initial hits and even bigger poison damage. Here's my tree: poeurl.com/V13 Links would be BV, Added Chaos, Void Manipulation, Conc Effect, Poison, maybe Inc Duration 6th link or Inc AoE so I can have Conc Effect in all the time since it's the biggest source of double dipping in the build. Using an Apep's Rage. Or alternatively Obliteration, maybe Consuming Dark, then I can take out Poison from my links, but there really aren't any other good double dipping options as far as I can see. Breath of the Council would be good too. I mean, even a decay weapon might work. In fact, who knows, it could be the best option. I will have to test. Of course Atziri's Promise. Chaos rolls on all jewelry. Maybe the new Unholy Might Flask. Wither totem. Going occultist to get the -20 chaos res and profane bloom, which would also scale with all my chaos and area damage. Using Vulnerability to double dip my phys damage and poison damage. For defense I would go the good old fashioned CI + Vaal Pact facetank option, with all the OP resist flasks once I got rich enough, which work well with Blade Vortex anyway even though I'm not scaling the phys that much because it has good base damage. I would also get lots of curses, eventually going low life with all the curse effect nodes and doing Temp Chains/Enfeeble, Warlord's Mark for leech, which would make me tanky with VP and take care of Apep's Rage mana costs. Also would give end charges for CWDT Imm Call. Wicked Ward would be nice too, although it isn't a focal point of the build, helps with lab and such though. Eventually I would go low life of course. Pain Attunement doesn't double dip but it's one point and it's a huge boost in damage, and I would be able to fit more curses in. So what do you guys think? Have you done a build like this before or can you point me in the right direction? Also, I feel like this would be OP as shit, am I wrong? Is normal BV better? SHORT UPDATE: I made a character based on my plan, a Witch in Merciless right now, level 60. It's insane damage. I have no items worth more than an alch except Witchfire Brew, and act bosses are dying in seconds. Links are BV, Added Chaos, Poison, Void Manip, Inc AoE/Conc Effect for bosses. For bosses I also put down a Wither totem. I'm leveling with an Obliteration wand right now, which is hilarious and really strong. It stacks with Profane Bloom, so BV's usually kinda janky AoE becomes really good. Chains of explosions all over the place. Every point of base chaos damage you can get matters in this build. I'm thinking about different sources of chaos damage to scale. Any suggestions would be appreciated. I think probably a decay wand with a decent spell damage roll is the highest damage I can get on my weapon. I wonder what else I can do. Flat chaos and phys damage added as chaos both seem very effective, because BV is still doing a lot of physical damage."

So without having to change much in tree went for Blade Flurry. Issue is .. accuracy, thankfully the +dex +accuracy +%chaos damage jewels are insanely cheap. Strap a few of those on and you get madness. Tree: [poeplanner](URL Gear: - [The Scourge](URL - [Breath Of The Council](URL - offhand goodness, can go with a shield for more survivability but less deeps - [Eye Of Chayula](URL for that sweet stun immunity - rings with either %chaos damage, +accuracy, %energy shield and ofc resists If you can afford a Shavs + the upgraded chayula it's even better, as you get good usage of [Spirit Offering](URL For trash I pretty much always run [Flesh Offering](URL The increased attack speed helps to stack up those insane poisons. I would recommend running 2 curses - temporal chains + enfeeble or vulnerability - for either deeps or more survivability. Overall I think everything on the Necro tree is brilliant for anything phys + chaos, could easily respec into either BV or blade fall. The claw double dipping poision makes these builds. P.S. The wolves spawned by the claw do quite good DPS, stack faster attack, poison, added chaos on the claw. 8 wolves took out T10 boss in seconds. I have whirling blades, fa + fortify on the claw as I don't feel I need the extra dps."
405,vulnerability,pathofexile,Beacon of Corruption Ghostbuster,0,5azxow,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/5azxow/beacon_of_corruption_ghostbuster/,2016-11-04 09:34:13,"Beacon of Corruption causes minions to spawn a caustic cloud on death, dealing 10% of their max HP as chaos damage per second. I thought it would be interesting to see if this could be made useful, however, it wasn't very successfull. Looking to hear if anyone else has given it a go. Here you can see the skill tree I picked: URL **In the skill tree:** Basically CI for defense, take all minion life nodes and everything that scales with chaos damage. Minion damage is not bad, since you'll be using zombies as well. **The basic idea** was based on the fact that minions die when they are either cancelled or overwritten by a newer summon; thus you can trigger the caustic clouds without having to wait for the minions to die. Initially I thought I could use it with SRS, spawn a ton of them really fast, and have them despawn through a weapon swap (with SRS linked on the weapon) once they had spread out to get a good coverage. However I noticed the damage was far too low; they don't have enough hit points. I tried using zombies, but again their HP and thus the damage was quite low. It was also hard to spread the caustic clouds out since the zombies tend to clump up. The best damage was going with spectres, especially since they have an ascendancy node that grants +100% health. The basic attack was to cast desecrate into a pack of mobs and then summon spectres using spell echo. Since I only had one max spectre, it meant one of them instantly died spawning a caustic cloud. I could link the summon spectre skill (or wither) to a spell totem to make it a little bit more automated, wasn't necesserily better though. As a meat shield I used zombies, flame golem and animated guardian (leer cast, dying breath). As complementary skills I used wither, either on a totem or cast manually, and vulnerability. Flesh offering to increase cast and movement speed. I tried Temporal Chains as a Blasphemy aura, but the range was quite short, didn't try it as a proper aura; might have been more effective. **Gear was as follows:** Main hand: Breath of the Council (80% chaos damage, couldn't find anything better). Everything else: ES + Increased minion life (Essence of Fear which yield potentially &gt;30% increased life, which translates directly to increased damage. Couldn't find any gear that would outmatch this). On rings you can use the Essence that increases poison damage (unsure if it scales properly, however). Potions: Chalice + Witchfire brew, rest utility Important stats: Cast speed. **Good things:** - Once mobs actually got stuck in the caustic cloud, they died quite fast. Spectre health scaled with map level really well, so it would clear any level map pretty much at the same speed. **Bad things:** - Hard to get mobs to stay in the caustic clouds. The area of effect seems quite small. - Desecrate feels quite limited with only three casts before it needs to recharge. - Not really viable to use the mobs own corpses against them, because you have to wait quite a while for your zombies to kill something, it is much faster to plop down a desecrate and start a caustic cloud. - Unsure if area of effect or damage over time passives scale with the caustic cloud. - Doesn't stack, which reduces it's effectiveness vs bosses. **Suggestions:** - Change it so that the summons create a caustic cloud while they are alive, which drains their HP slowly. This reduces the problem of how hard it is to catch monsters in the clouds (zombies would chase after mobs and poison them). This would be in addition to causing the current effect on death. - Increase the AOE slightly. - Remove the cooldown on desecrate, but keep the corpse limit. - It would be great if mobs killed by caustic cloud would leave a cloud behind themselves. - Have it stack at least 3 times. Anyhow, those are my two cents. Anyone tried it themselves, and made it work somehow? Suggestions for improvement? Remember, the goal was to use this ascendancy node as the main form of attack."

The effect of the orb is very simple, and is as follows; When a map is completed which has had an orb of insanity applied to it, one of the mods of that map will carry on to the next map you start which is connected to the previous map. In the picture example, if you complete the first map ""Desert"", say it had Vulnerability on it, this mod will carry over to the next map - ""Oasis"" -, in addition to the other mods that you can apply to your Oasis map in the regular fashion. **Potentially you can stack a ton of mods on a map,** and gain a huge boost in IIR, IIQ, but also the danger of a map will be greatly enhanced! If you fail to kill the boss of the map, you will not be able to carry on the chain. Some mods will be hard to stack, like curses and so on, but maybe some adjustment could be made to just increase the effect of them. It would be weighted so that it is more likely to pick a mod that is not already on the map. It would not carry over mods applied by Zana's device (so you can't stack 16thuple Beyond). You can also have conditionals such as the maps have to be rare and corrupted, to prevent stacking of easy mods. What do you think? The name of the orb, by the way, is just temporary. It might not even have to be an orb. People could really challenge their builds with this, and do some crazy stuff. Input? **Have fun!** :) "

Link is: URL Character name is Corvidae_Phoenix I'm mainly looking for skill and passive tree recommendations I have a lot of passive points invested in life and am sitting at about 6.5k which seems about where I should be with a melee build considering I need a chest for a 5/6 link. Damage wise, cyclone feels great for damage and seems to synergize well with The Taming but I feel a little bit vulnerable with health. I'm not sure if running different flasks might make me safer staying near high map tier bosses and thus more comfortable. Alternatively, Lacerate makes me feel very safe as with the amount of increased AOE I have I can offscreen enemies, but the damage feels pretty mediocre, especially against red map bosses. I've considered Reave as well, but I don't know if it would be worth the time investment to level up the gem or if any other skills are worth pursuing. So in terms of curses, I'm not sure what to do. I have my application as cast when damage taken, which seems fine. I'm not sure what the optimal curse setup would be. Flammability, Enfeeble, Temporal Chains and Vulnerability all seem viable. Also, I'm near the 2nd curse nodes, so I've been considering whether I should invest the passive skills to get a second curse or not. Aura wise I typically use: Haste+Herald of Ash (With lacrate/cyclone) OR Herald of Ash+Herald of Ice+Arctic Armour (Only with lacerate) Are these good combinations or are there better defensive options I'm missing. One set of Passive Nodes I would definitely like advice on are the Weapon Elemental Damage nodes. I can save a couple of points pathing an alternative way, but I'm not sure how good these nodes are. Thank you so much for your time and advice. Newer to reddit so I apologize if I mess up formatting. "
409,vulnerability,pathofexile,The Problem with Helm Enchants: They break expected market rules and reward following the meta,40,5cifuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/5cifuw/the_problem_with_helm_enchants_they_break/,2016-11-12 13:35:27,"The market in Path of Exile tends to, all other things being equal, reward playing unpopular builds/using unpopular items. A Reach of the Council is more expensive than a Doomfletch's Prism, for example, so if you make a build that utilizes the latter, you have an easier time getting your build together (in this case, because of cost, but why I don't generalize it as cost will become clear shortly). In general for PoE, this holds true. Item drops don't care about the meta--there is relatively little player agency in making a shavs drop versus a cloak of flame. That isn't to say there isn't ANY player agency in supply--chance orbs make certain uniques more common than they otherwise would be, crafting efforts make certain types of rares (especially with the introduction of essences) simply more likely to exist, and of course if a rare has a unpopular distribution of stats it might simply be vendored if the player who had it drop doesn't realize it may be worth something to someone. There are some aspects of the game where player agency has a much larger role--for example, I wanted rare gloves with certain basic stat distribution and a vulnerability corruption for a build--and none existed on poe.trade a couple leagues ago, because while people were mass corrupting decent gloves, they apparently weren't of that stat distribution. Conversely, when looking for ele weakness gloves with generic life+resists, there are tons. However, even in this example, a path is open to create your own gear--if you have enough money, you can craft your OWN corrupted gloves with the stats you want. However, the helm enchant market is its own beast--it's 100% player agency without ANY real way to buy your way out of it for certain builds due to the fact players choose which helms to enchant. If you use ES or certain unique helms, you are in luck--people LOVE popping ilvl 84 hubris circlets, rats nests, etc. in the enchant-o-matic. For these types of helms, the market works as you would expect--the most popular enchants are the most represented and also the highest price since people aim to stop on one of them. However, even if you want to use an unpopular skill, SOMEONE will probably end up posting one so long as you use a popular enchant helm--it will likely cost you less than a meta enchant when you find it, too. The problem truly emerges when you want to use a non-meta helm; you are literally forced into the 1-in-500 farm it yourself method. Hope you are ready, willing and able to either do an average of hundreds of uber lab runs or have someone you know do the same for you. For example, I am playing an armour based firestormer. Looking at all 3 enchants (not the best, all 3) there have been the SAME 4 i lvl 84 high armour base craftable helms (I use a hysteria helm, necessary for my build as a faux 5 link since I used kaoms and dual wield) over the last week when I have been searching; not one of the people with those helms listed has been online at the same time as me. I literally cannot buy one, no matter how willing I am to pay. This perverse incentive really needs to go. I don't have a solution, but I just wanted to bring the problem to light. Hopefully GGG notices this and considers the issue, since it seems so out of line with the rest of the game's market."

Chaos converted pseudo 7 Link Blade Vortex with a shit tonne of uniques. Done up to tier 10 maps. edit: [Atlas of Builds Image Here.](URL So I just hit 80 (edit:82) on my semi-budget Low Life, Blood Magic, Chaos conversion Occultist and that's about the point I start doing a write up it seems these [past](URL few [threads.](URL Character Profile is [here](URL (Character name TheCovenant). Early disclaimer, no videos yet, waiting on a mic in the mail. And I've been generally clearing tier 8s easily, done a tier 10 deathless but I'm lacking maps since I'm trying mapping self-found. Been only playing the past day and a half on this character so I'm still getting the hang of things. Just doing a write up early because I'm honestly excited about this character. So this build takes advantage of a few combinations to make this strange build work. First, Blade Vortex is our skill of choice due to all the synergies at play. It's linked to Spell Echo, Controlled Destruction, Poison and Void Manipulation in a 5 Link. Secondly, we use quite a few uniques to bring the build together; [The Covenant](URL grants us Blood Magic without having to travel across half the tree, as well as Shav's comparable ES and an extra Added Chaos Damage link, which turns our Blade Vortex into a pseudo 6 Link; [Ming's Heart](URL grants us a large increase to damage and Chaos resistance, the latter we need in spades to survive with a small health pool and no Shavronne's Wrappings; [Lori's Lantern](URL grants a lot of resistances and the luck factor, which decreases average damage received by [between 6% and 21% depending on the source](URL [Bino's Kitchen Knife](URL grants an increase to our damage over time, poison proliferation and 200 health regeneration per second for 4 seconds on killing a poisoned enemy, which is the 'battery' we use to fuel our mana cost as well as survive chaos degeneration and hits; [The Writhing Jar](URL functions as a back up health source for casting skills when we don't have Bino's regeneration active, as well as giving us two worms to activate Bino's regeneration and proliferate a bit of poison to enemies too; [Coruscating Elixir](URL functions as an extra defense against strong sources of Chaos damage (exiles, extreme degeneration, roided Vile Touch mobs, Poison on Hit map mod, etc.) with the downside of being at 1 Life quickly mitigated by our extreme health regeneration from Bino's, it also grants (maximum) fire resistance and some Energy Shield regeneration; two copies of [Atziri's Promise](URL are used to have permanent uptime on both the damage boost and the chaos damage life leech, as over half our damage is Chaos damage this flask gives us a pseudo 7 Link; lastly, [Kiara's Determination](URL is our source of Stun and Freeze avoidance, which is actually less required than you'd think. There's also an [Energy From Within](URL nestled in the tree below Melding for an additional 27% increased Energy Shield (I stumbled upon a max roll one). Skill gems other than Blade Vortex include Stone Golem, for a near-constant 100 Health Regeneration which stacks with Bino's Regeneration (combined these two have let me survive zombie death degen, poison arrows, multiple poisonous hits, Viper Strike exiles, all with ease); Blasphemy Vulnerability to scale up the Physical half of our damage as well as the 33% multiplier to Poison degeneration; Discipline, for more Energy Shield; Whirling Blades for movement and Fortify; CWDT Immortal Call for physical damage; CWDT Blade Vortex linked to Increased Area of Effect and Blind for blinding enemies and popping writhing worms to activate Bino's if caught with my pants/BV down; Vaal Discipline for an extra defensive layer; and Wither Totem for scaling Poison/Chaos damage. The [Passive Tree](URL focuses on grabbing a large amount of Energy Shield as well as the Chaos and Physical damage increases in the Shadow area, some duration near Scion, some Area of Effect near Witch and some Poison damage. Some of our pathing looks suboptimal as it's hard to grab enough Dexterity to meet the requirements of Blade Vortex. Notables picked up include Pain Attunement, as we reserve 70% of our life with Vulnerability Blasphemy and Discipline for a 30% more damage multiplier, and Ghost Reaver to keep our Energy Shield topped up since Bino's and Stone Golem handle our health regeneration. The next few planned points on the Passive Tree are to grab the Flask Effect cluster in Witch and the Spell Damage Jewel socket in Scion. Ascendancy class is Occultist, and points are Wicked Ward, Vile Bastion (which works with Writhing Worms killed) and Void Beacon. With Uberlab we'd take Profane Bloom. As I recently spent the vast majority of my currency 6 Linking my Axe on my Shockwave Totem character, I tried to do this character on a Budget. All uniques except for two cost 1 Chaos for good rolls, the exceptions being Kiara's Determination, which goes for 100 Chaos or a bit over, and Energy From Within which goes for ~15 Chaos for a bad roll. Most of my gear was purchased for 5 Chaos or less, except for my Amulet which was 1 Chaos (a bargain to be fair) and my belt, which cost me 7 Chaos to buy, 1 Scour to clean and 2 Shrieking Hatreds to roll (I needed 40% cold resistance and then was going to craft 20% lightning resistance, but I lucked out and rolled lightning resistance so I crafted ES). Lastly, a Jeweller's Touch costs about 23 Chaos, but I had one of those lying around too. All in all this build costs a little over 2.5 Exalts, with 1.5 Exalts of those being Kiara's which you don't need until tier 5+ maps (an anti-freeze flask would suffice while you farmed Dried Lake for currency until then). With current gear we have over 8.5k Energy Shield and just under 1000 life (293 unreserved), as well as Elemental Weakness capped elemental resistances and capped Chaos resistance. We have 10k tooltip DPS on Blade Vortex, 12.8K with either Atziri's Promise up. However, Blade Vortex tooltip is iffy, and this doesn't account for Vulnerability scaling the physical damage, Void Beacon scaling the Chaos damage, and Poison. Poison has 70% increased damage on the tree, 34% increased damage on the support gem, 30% increased damage over time on Bino's, 37% increased damage over time in the Shadow section, 137% increased Chaos damage (10% from a Jewel), 30% increased area damage (which applies to Poison as it inherits it's applicator's tags), 50% increased skill effect duration, Vulnerability's 33% multiplier, Void Beacon's 20% Chaos resistance decrease and Void Manipulation's 37% more damage multiplier. In summary, it does a stupid amount of damage. This build still has a bit to go, there's more damage and survivability to be grabbed on the tree over the next half a dozen levels, the only 20/20 gem used is Blade Vortex (they're about 4 chaos Corrupted each right now), and non-flasks gear could easily be improved from the ~5 Chaos a piece average going right now. Anywho, thanks for reading if you've read this far, I know it's a wall of text but I'm genuinely enjoying all the interactions this build has to offer and want to document every niche of it. Now back to actually playing this build! "

Here's my tree: poeurl.com/QlV As far as flasks go, I figured I could use Witchfire Brew, Vinktar's if I have the currency, Rumi's to make me super tanky, maybe Atziri's Promise and a bubbling bleed flask.

Throw in whatever gems are best for Scorching Ray and use an Orb of Storms to proc Elemental Equilibrium and Elemental Overload. The synergy here is absolutely nuts, ES gives you a high EHP pool which means your Righteous Fire will be doing considerably high base damage. Your Scorching Ray inflicts a -24% fire resist debuff which synergises with Righteous Fire. Neither Righteous Fire nor Scorching Ray actually hit mobs so Elemental Equilibrium adds another -50% fire res, on top of the debuff and Flamability. Pain Attunement is a more multiplier, so is Elemental Overload and Righteous Fire. Vulnerability increases damage taken and is thus essentially a more multiplier and works for both Righteous Fire and Scorching Ray. Rapid Decay, Elemental Focus and Controlled Destruction are all big more multiplier gems with absolutely no downsides for Scorching Ray besides the -15% duration from Rapid Decay. Pretty sure all this will easily amount to dps well in the millions. Survivability may even be pretty damn good with ZO/Sorrow of the Divine, the inquisitor passives and some investment into life regen/max fire res. Thoughts? EDIT: Some quick maths, not considering any % increases from the passive tree or gear except for Searing Touch. Level 23 (21 base+2 from touch) Scorching Ray deals a base damage of 667.6 per second. Each Stage of Scorching Ray adds 60% of the initial dps, so thats 7x0.6x667.6+667.6 =3471,52 base dps. Searing Touch has 50% spell damage, 40% fire damage and 70% burning damage, 'increase' so 160%. Inquisitor big passives has 30% spell damage and 40% general damage, 'increase' so 70%. 160%+70%=230%. 3471,52x3.3= 11456 11456 x Righteous Fire 21 x Pain Attunement x Elemental Overload x Rapid Decay 21 x Elemental Focus 21 x Controlled Destruction 21 x -129% total fire res x Vulnerability (33% increased damage taken) 11456 x 1.6 x 1.3 x 1.4 x 1.4 x 1.5 x 1.45 x 2.29 x 1.33= 309385. Thats 309k dps completely ignoring gear beyond Searing Touch and all passives except for the big Inquisitor passives meaning it could very easily quadruple or more.

ED is a projectile so the dot should benefit from it as well. i have doubts because i see so many people running with vulnerability so there is likely something to it. * is vulnerability worth it at all? the only thing it gives to ED is 33% increased damage taken from dot, 46% thanks to the 40% inc effect of curses i have on tree and blasphemy, and while it's massive for other builds wither already gives me 140% increased chaos damage taken so the effective increase in dps is just 19%, even less against bosses. * i'm thinking of just using the new vulnerability flask and keep temp chains and enfeeble on blasphemy permanently, that would rule out proj weakness but would free a gem slot and a skill on the bar. opinions?"

This is, however, multiple patches ago. It got completely butchered so that nobody played it anymore, me included. I enjoyed it for the duration where it was still viable, but now, it's pretty much just trash tier. It had its use when combined with VMS for ignite stacking, but that's gone too, as you cannot procc VMS with damage dealt to yourself anymore. There's nothing about this skill that screams useful anymore, though I guess that may just be me? In the clear speed meta with poison and mobility, a skill that stands still isn't just outdone by its major downside - Channeling time and complete vulnerability, but I feel like even the damage is completely abandoned. I know this is probably something relevant for more than JUST Incinerate, in having more weaknesses than strengths, but I just can't find anything that justifies Incinerate, over either of the better skills. It doesn't even work with echo anymore, so it's even a mana-hog. A mediocre-at-best mana hog Even if it was reverted to its shotgun self with spell echo working with it, I'm still not sure it'd be comparable to some of the other builds. Especially not against tougher bosses like the guardians, which BV just roflstomps anyways.

I had a bad feeling about this league. - Started to play 7 days into league with a real zeal - my perma-freeze elementalist got to maps in a few days, and promptly ripped to blue devours with powerfull crits on an extra crit map (tier5). It was one of my most refreshing experiences in PoE lately. Game was running smoothly, no bullshit just a plain old BAM your build is not good enough! reminder from the game. I re-rolled 10 seconds later. - economy felt more alive than ever. 1-2c items were flying off of my shop, and buyers were seemingly not newbies. Fast copy pasta, joins instantly with money ready, T4T followed with SS and the occasional question about what build needs a quality 7 trap gem?! or similar. I had all kinds of strange stuff selling. - Second char went all out on life with self-cast RF chieftain. Havent tried that for a long time. - Kaoms heart prices started to plummet, so I set myself a goal to buy a +1 may resist. I got one after 3 days of grinding, my most valuable item in a temp league ever. - The build started preforming perfectly with lvl 21 PoF, marble amulet, and +1 Kaoms. I finally had time to EXPRIANCE Atlas, and boy was it a fun run. Every map new and interesting, not overturned and layout seemed great on every map. - PoE sucked me in for a second time. I found myself flying past the mid 80-s on Tier 5-6 maps. I just wanted to try them all. My build already perfected, money just started to accumulate as my playing sessions were solo runs of maps, one after another. - Playing RF really helped to maintain long productive grinds of 2-3 hours after work. Its a nice and calm playstyle, easy on the eyes, ears and on the controls. I listened to 3-4 really good films on the side. Every session I went into higher tiers of maps. My Atlas completion started to crawl from 10 to 20, to 30 right past 50 and 60. - Soon I found myself with hundreds of chaos. I havent spent a nickel since level 80 on anything else than maps and I was closing in on 91 I needed a goal. Well, Dying Sun seems like a good all-around item. - Bought Dying Sun for 470 chaos. My second all-time most valuable item in a temp league in the SAME temp league! - I realized I havent played Dota 2, or Civ 4 for 3 weeks. Even on the train to work I was planning the items, and gem setups for my character. How to maximize elemental overload uptime, whats the best way proc Elemental Equilibrium. - My char has seen some small improvements every gem was 20/20, every bottle almost perfectly rolled. I exalted 4 out of 5 of my optimally chosen jewels. I divined the last one from 5% life to 7%. - I noticed Im on the ladder, at around place 1500. - Only two more goals existed. Finishing as much of the Atlas as possible, and getting as high on the ladder as possible. - I dinged level 92. My all-time highest character ever. - Every map under TIER 11 finished on Atlas. I was only running Tier 12+. I bought them for 2-3 chaos a piece if I ran out, and chiseled and alched them all. Sulphur wastes was my favorite. Its like doing dried lakes with much better loot. - Several big items dropped. I didnt care anymore. Spent like 200 chaos to respect into Pledge of hands firestorm, only to respect back into RF on the same day. Money wasnt an issue. - Tried to do Uber Lab. Had a heart attack. God I despise the Lab. Never again. I dont need the 2 ascendency points. - Running only Sulphur Wastes now. Vulnerability? Not a problem. Temp chains? Bring it on. Ele Equilibrium- sure. Extra damage as Fire? Lol. 20, 40 60 less Regen? Doesnt Matter. - running faster and faster I checked the ladder after every second map - Got cocky and ran ele weaknes map. I wasnt overcapped on cold res. (i knew it goig in) Trash melted. Went into boss room. Puff5000 HP gone in one shot. WTF? Its OK still got 4000 Left. Hmm better open a TP so I can refill flasks.

People have used this trick for some time to get cardset vaaled uniques (The Fiend, Brittle Emp) desired corruptions since their inception. Pretty straight forward right? What has been overlooked though is that from what I can tell though vaal orbs used on noncorrupted items follow the same rules. So if you're sitting there buying up all the Sadima's/Meginord's/Magnate's on the market and you haven't been buying ones high enough ilvl to get the corruption in the first place you've just been wasting currency. To verify try searching xyz in any league for an item (no need to specify) with a capped ilvl, say 30 for example, against a particular implicit like ""Curse Enemies with level (10 to 12) Vulnerability on Hit"" which has an ilvl req of 30. You won't find any below that itemlevel, nor will you find a ton at that specific itemlevel like you might expect if vaaling set a lower ilvl item to a new ilvl equal to the new implicit. Anyway looks like quite a few people were not aware of this, if you were then you're the man. TLDR: look at the ilvl before you vaal items if you're chasing specific implicits. "

I officially dumped it after I discovered that Contagion did not work as expected and never touched it since. Well, that is until today. I took an almost 2 month long break from PoE after getting bored and failing to come up with new ideas. I was about to release a pure fire damage Blade Vortex character, but then decided to scrap it because everybody was playing Blade Vortex and it surely would be of no interest. I can't tell if it's the same for Essence Drain, but I will anyways throw it at you, simply because I can and because I feel like it. **A little bit of backstory:** &gt;*I was scrolling through the unique items, looking for ideas, when it hit me. I stopped at ""Breath of the Council"" and took a good look at it. Then I suddenly felt reminded of a build I never got to actually finish. The first guide I ever released. Unfinished. I couldn't let that sit there. So, here I am, bringing you the late (better late than never) Essence Drain character guide aka. ""The Harbinger of Chaos"" (I give every build its own name - it's a habit, deal with it). I was about to turn this into an Abyssal Cry/Essence Drain/Contagion hybrid, but later decided to scrap it as it was simply overkill and made it harder to play.* So, let's get started. First off, you can check out two videos I made for this. The items and such will be listed below. *** **MEDIA** *** *Please take note that the build was not in the optimal state during demonstrations. I was using underlevelled gems and different setups during testing (that still worked). Also, I must admit, I played very sloppy. Might be because I have to get used to the setup first and because I played too much Dota.* [Apex of Sacrifice](URL [(Double Boss) Maps](URL *** **BUILD INTRODUCTION** *** **So, what is this build about and how does it work?** Well, the playstyle is simple but requires coordination. &gt;*This is a 12k+ Energy Shield based Chaos Inoculation Occultist, dual wielding Breath of the Council. A single curse setup is used.* You just use Contagion on a pack of mobs and then shoot Essence Drain into it. Then what happens? Well, it blows up. Simple, yet so beautiful. A true art of its own. This is especially satisfying when mobs keep dying and dying a few screens away as it keeps spreading death. This works best in dense maps, obviously. The true power lies in the fact that you can take out entire packs of all kinds of cancer mobs such as reflect and what not, without actually getting close to them or having to worry about reflect as, obviously for now, chaos damage cannot be reflected. Despite the fact that it packs a punch, it is quite tanky for what it is. You can face-tank a pack of mobs and then just blow it up to regenerate lots of Energy Shield.

If you need it, use them. But I don't recommend it. *** **TIPS AND INFO** *** Mobility is key. The only reason I switched from The Blood Dance to rare boots was because I was lacking too much Cold Resistance. The only problems I have now are: Missing 16% more multiplier, 4% extra Life Regeneration, 28% less Movement Speed (have no MS on boots, which sucks). In return I have capped resistances and a bigger chunk of Energy Shield. Which is fine, but I will switch back to Blood Dance once I manage to neutralize this problem. Phase Run is really good for 2 reasons (if you don't use Blood Dance). It's good for movement and allows easy setup of your combo without being charged at right away. ***"

439,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Discussion] Rebalance of Map Mods,72,50c88x,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/50c88x/discussion_rebalance_of_map_mods/,2016-08-31 03:12:55,"-Pretext- The relative strength of map mods not only plays a role in creating difficulty within the game, but also to some extents determines the strength of meta builds. Map mods were last changed roughly a year ago, and I believe changing the reward balance within these mods could benefit the health of the game. For a very long time, the best thing to roll on maps has been packsize. It's great for both xp and map pool sustain. -Pack Size Mods (Using top tier of mods for simplicity)- -(-16 to -12)% maximum Player Resistances ---16 packsize -Players have 60% less Recovery of Life, Mana and Energy Shield ---15 packsize -Players are cursed with Elemental Weakness ---14 packsize -Players are cursed with Enfeeble ---14 packsize -Players are cursed with Temporal Chains ---14 packsize -Players are cursed with Vulnerability ---14 packsize -Players have no Life or Mana Regeneration ---12 packsize -Players have Blood Magic ---10 Packsize These are currently the best mods to hit on maps and the innate problem with this list is that it's both grown stale over time and has been a factor in many of the meta builds strength. It also has a heavy punishment for some builds over others. (I don't believe this to be fully avoidable) It is my belief that the hardest map mods should give the best rewards and with packsize being the absolute best reward; shouldn't packsize be shifted to the mods that actually hold the highest challenge? Not to say the entire list is flawed, minus max, vuln and temp chains can actually make things quite dangerous, and generally will have heavy impact on the majority of builds. I propose the the rest of them be changed however. The map mods that I consider contenders for this are as follows; -Monsters have (360 to 400)% increased Critical Strike Chance +(41 to 45)% to Monster Critical Strike Multiplier -Monsters deal (90 to 110)% extra Damage as (Insert Element here) -(25 to 30)% increased Monster Damage -Monsters fire 4 additional Projectiles These are just examples of mods that are actually what people consider to be rippy or dangerous. The real problem with the argument that players can create their own challenge is that the best mods in terms of rewards are actually not the most challenging mods. Many of them can be ignore (hello ele weakness free packsize). Many players do actually want to run harder content, but will never roll the hardest mods because the reward simply isnt there. A map with elemental weakness, minus regen and enfeeble is far more rewarding than one with triple extra damage mods, and that is where the issue lies. There are other issues with map mods in terms of how heavily they favour or punish some builds, but I think shifting pack size to the mods that provide real challenge is a good first step towards creating a better challenge reward dynamic in maps and also creates a new set of circumstances that will shift the power of builds to some degree. edit; [Which Map mods do you find difficult for most builds](URL (Monsters deal extra damage as fire is supposed to be monsters deal extra damage as element) "

So yea, it's a LOT. Like 20 times stronger. Or in other words as strong as ***8*** extra support gems or so. Almost all the math relates to *double dipping* where they get a supplemental bonus from secondary effects like poison. Here's the math for my lvl 90 occultist after AoW releases: * 8% of initial hit per second * 1.49 remote mine * 0.79 minefield * 1.39 trap and mine damage * 1.59 concentrated effect * 5.63 increased damage from passives/gear/quality/gems (break down at bottom) * 1.20 void beacon ascendancy (-20% chaos res. even stronger if enemy has ANY chaos res) * 1.30 increased damage taken (from vulnerability with 50% increased curse effectiveness, 60% less curse effectiveness on bosses, and 10% increased damage taken from profane bloom ascendancy) =182% of initial hit as poison per second on bosses Duration is: * 2s base duration * 1.6 increased skill duration from tree and poison support * ~~1.26~~ 1.24 temp chains on boss with increased curse effectiveness = ~~4.16s~~ 4.09s of poison This combines for 182 x 4.09 = ~~758%~~ 747% More damage from the poison support gem due to double dipping. YIKES! And that's just per mine, minefield means you lay 3 at a time and on some boss fights you can have 9 mines pre set, so... yea. For non boss enemies, that number is over 2,000% more damage. Or pushing 300% per second for almost 7s (if they ever lived that long). _____ Math for increased damage: * 1.00 base * 0.38 poison support * 0.20 conc effect and trap/mine dmg support quality * 0.30 bino's kitchen knife * 0.39 jewels (could double this, I only use 1 DPS jewel in favor of 2 energy from within) * 3.36 [passives](URL (47% DOT, 40% chaos, 30% area, 219% mine) (my tree linked) _____ Please feel free to check my math and call out anything I misunderstood or miscalculated. Regardless, 10% to 8% per sec change is laughable in terms of how strong poison is in general and specifically in the case of BF mines with triple curses. I am *seriously* disappointed that GGG was unable to come up with a serious solution to this problem within the game as it trivializes so much of the most interesting content in the game. And the worst case scenario is that GGG starts designing and balancing around abuses like this and completely hose everyone else who doesn't abuse this shortsighted ""exploit"". So if you're on the bubble about what will be the best method of overcoming the new hard endgame content, there really is no other option. _____ EDIT: Remote Mine no longer double dips thanks to new patch notes New values: 122% initial hit as poison/sec for 4sec for 500% DMG overall.

Check it out for updated info and new videos. Well, i don't know how many of you used to play this game back when Kripp used to make PoE videos but if you go to his channel and search for Kripp's Sweep Templar Build you will see where this build was inspired from. Basicaly the idea is to use CI and 2 handed melee weapons in conjuction, trying to get the best of both worlds, which was kinda impossible to do until now. (was possible but was shit) The previous versions of this had to spend way too many points in other to have everything you need to start running maps and in the end you wouldn't have a lot of ES or damage. The following is a tier 10 shaped dunes run URL Very casual, im lvl 86 atm and EQ is just 5L. My build use the new Brain Rattler Meatgrinder Mace and the physical to lightning support gem in order to convert 100% of your physical damage to lightning so you can scale your damage with both phys nodes and elemental nodes allowing you to do deep into the Witch tree and still get good damage and ES without wasting too much points going all over the skill tree. Defenses: Current ES is 8.3k. Keep in mind that i'm using a 550 ES chain mail chest and not a vaal regalia. The reason is because i'm still trying to 6-link the mace and getting the right colors on a regalia would be way too aids so until i have the 6L mace i'll have to use this 5L chain mail instead. With a regalia my ES should easily go over 10-11k. I also have 136% increased armour from the tree and alchemist node making your granite flask and other flasks in general very strong. Offense: EQ max tooltip with everything up on a 6L is 75k URL (read edit1) which is pretty impressive already considering that EQ is not a very tooltip friendly skill that you cannot really measure the dps. What really matters is the single hits and the after shock damage that is not mentioned in the tooltip. Other things that are not mentioned in the tooltip is the 52% lightning penetration from the tree+conductivity aura (read edit2) and the ""enemies take 16% increased elemental damage"" from the Augury of Penitence Ascendency node. With all that the real dps should be around 120-130k without counting the shock, which brings another matter on the table: Vessel of Vinktar. With Vessel of Vinktar's perma shock and 10% penetration your dps should go over 200k easily but is not really necessary if you don't have de currency to buy it. Why Inquisitor? Many reasons, the main one is because of the damage/atk speed. The one thing you dont get a lot on the skill tree with this build is attack speed, which is important if you dont want to take 2 years to swing your weapon and leap around, this character dont have stun imunity (read edit3) so you have to hit things fast in order to dont get hit/stunned and Inquisitor gives you 59% atk speed. 4% from a small Ascendency node, 20% from Instruments of Virtue and 25% from Pious Path that requires you to be standing on Consecrated ground to work. First i thought that consecrated ground was going to be bad but surprisingly enough the 25% chance of create cons. ground on hit and +25% chance on kill makes you spam this ground effect all over the place, and with a little help from a Suphur flask you can have this buff up 100% of the time, doesn't matter if you move a lot since you can kill fast enough to always pop that flask before every pack. Cons. ground also give you 8% ES regen per sec (with Zealot's Oath node), 4% mana regen per sec and immunity to all status ailments. Pretty strong overall. Personally i don't claim Inquisitor to be the best ascendency for this build, but definitely give you a lot of damage, leap speed and safety with the cons. ground mechanics. But all of this is basicaly my playstyle preference. You can do the same with other templar ascedencies, Witch or Shadow too. Comparing this with other life based EQ builds that i have played so far (and i have played A LOT of them, in SC, HC and races) this is very strong. Stronger than most of them. I can only see this being comparable with a disfavour EQ build in terms of damage but the survival hability is still way higher than life based....

453,vulnerability,pathofexile,Some Math on Reflect and Crown of the Pale King,40,4v7oqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4v7oqs/some_math_on_reflect_and_crown_of_the_pale_king/,2016-07-30 03:16:08,"So I wrote this up on my build thread but figured I would share it here too. Ok, so I did some basic testing in Merc Dried Lake on how Vulnerability affects the healing portion of Crown of the Pale King (and when I mean basic I mean BASIC, this is like an 8 entry dataset but was well within statistical variance to prove the expected point). tl;dr - Vuln does increase the healing by increasing the reflect damage. Also, PoE rounds down to whole integers. **Methodology** Specced into Zealot's Oath temporarily so that life regen did not take place. Equipped two Advancing Fortresses, one with 84 damage on block, the other with 72 damage on block for a combing 156 damage on block. Added to Crown of the Pale King's 100-150 damage on block, our damage variance is: 256-306 damage reflected on block We're assuming we heal 30% of the damage we reflect. 30% of 256 is 76.8 (which is rounded down to 76 as evidenced by testing), and 30% of 306 is 91.8 (which is also rounded down), giving us an expected healing range of: 76-91 life gained from reflect [VIDEO ONE WITH NO VULN](URL Our dataset from this video for life restored is: 91 89 82 84 89 89 76 82 76 all of which falls within the expected bounds of healing. Baseline parameters are looking good. **TESTING WITH VULN** Same character and equipment setup, only difference is that we toggled a level 18 Vulnerability (enemies take 28% increased phys damage) on a level 19 Blasphemy (so no effectiveness bonus). We have an additional 34% curse effectiveness from skill tree and the Conqueror's Potency gem, giving us a total 37% increased damage taken from phys. Applying that 37% to our damage range, we get an expected: 350-419 damage reflected on block and 105-125 life gained from reflect [VIDEO TWO WITH VULN](URL Our dataset for this video for life restored is: 113 122 119 105 110 110 all of which fall within our new expected parameters. **CONCLUSIONS** While I would definitely want to test at least 100 samples of each (Vuln and No Vuln), I think it's pretty clear just from the initial tests that Vulnerability works exactly the way it's expected to in terms of increasing the healing done by Crown of the Pale King by increasing the reflect damage. In addition, I'm unsure if reflect damage is modified by enemy mitigation, as Crown of the Pale King is specifically worded to say ""30% of damage you reflect to enemies is gained as life"", and I think that means it calculates it after the damage reflected is calculated, but before it's actually applied. I don't think that enemy type or armor matters, as in the second video I was hit by a grasshopper mob several times along with the rare gull, but further testing would make it more clear. **BONUS SECTION** Assuming a max reflect Advancing Fortress (90 damage), Crown of the Pale King (100-150), the Anvil (240-300), and Thousand Teeth Temu (1-1000), our maximum possible base reflect damage range is: 431-1540 phys damage on block If we had a 21/20 Vulnerability gem (40% increased physical damage taken) on a 20/23 Blasphemy (11% increased curse effect) along with 34% from tree (44% is possible, but I judge not worth getting) along with a 30% increased Vulnerability helm enchant) we get 75% increased curse effectiveness on our 40% increased physical damage taken curse which equates in total to: 70% increased physical damage taken. Applying that to our damage range we get: 732-2618 phys damage reflected on block and 219-785 life restored on hit adding in a max rank Anvil (48 life restored on block) we get: *DRUMROLL* A maximum possible healing value of 267-833 life every time we block. Which seems ok."
454,vulnerability,pathofexile,What if damage increasing mods on map gave experience bonus?,2,4ve44v,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4ve44v/what_if_damage_increasing_mods_on_map_gave/,2016-07-31 07:36:29,"So, I got bored of running perpetual gorges (big mistake) and I tried to go into red maps. I can run any red map if the monsters don't have % elemental damage combined with other deadly mods like crit/vulnerability. I got killed by overgrown ruin boss on a totem map (he had turbo totem unfortunately), crit, lightning/fire damage and vulnerability. The problem is that those mods provide little quantity and no pack size, so it's almost mandatory to avoid double elemental damage coupled with other deadly mods. So I was thinking what if % monster physical/elemental damage, increased crits etc. (basically any modifier that doesn't provide packsize already) provided bonus exp in range of how packsize works. For example 12% bonus xp for % monster damage. You want to run that double elemental vulnerability overgrown ruin? Prepare to get 2shotted by the boss or play it very risky. But at least now you get increased xp for mods that are harder than those who provide packsize (curses, except vulnerability to a certain extent, are pretty much a joke compared to the amount of damage monsters can stack in high tier maps from modifiers ALONE)."

Sorry for the wall of text and all this ""train of thought rambling"" but I can't get my **S** together and decide on the ultimate golemancer. I need your help! My golemancer in prophecy league only got to cruel but my golems were wrecking everything. RL got in the way of PoE though so rerolling next league. So I used a lvl1 chaos golem with lvl1 poison support and 4 x chaos golems on a boss in cruel. This to test if poison support was still bugged with minions. It was not. lvl1 chaos golem with lvl1 poison support ONLY totally destroyed a rare in mere seconds, the poison stacking was incredible. After only a few attacks the DOT damage was melting him. So I got an idea. Either 1 x stone golem (to tank) and 3 x chaos golems OR 1 stone golem, 1 lightning golem, 1 flame golem and 1 chaos golem. Then again I got another idea. What if I **drumroll** go necromancer instead? You lose 1 golem, but then get a lot of minion damage + you can use spectres to support your golems. The last idea is to go occultist and use heretic veil for quad-curse. Enfeeble, temp chains, vulnerability + ?. Why? Because if chaos golems deal that much DOT damage with poison support then surely this would be strong as hell if you include temp chains and vulnerability? To sum up the choices are: **Elementalist** for Lightning, flame, stone, chaos golem combo. **Necromancer** for poisonous Stone+Chaos+Chaos golem. **Occultist** for poisonous Stone+Chaos+Chaos golem. The advantage of elementalist is the +1 golem. The advantage of necro is the + minion damage and potential spectres. The advantage of Occultist /w heretic veil is the quad curse to aid your golems. I guess other options could be Flame+Flame+Lightning+Stone golem Golementamancer. However elementalist has **no other spells in the tree that helps golem damage**. I'm also unsure what skills to use myself atm, what would be good? I just want to build a golemancer! I really need advice I'm so torn between these options. Currently I'm leaning towards necromancer with stone+chaos+chaos+spectres. Then again elementalist gets the +1 golem. Ugh. Any help appreciated. "

465,vulnerability,pathofexile,My dream prophecy right now is that some future patch notes say what's in this post [long read but has TL;DR kinda],0,4q5bxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4q5bxe/my_dream_prophecy_right_now_is_that_some_future/,2016-06-28 05:55:26,"Disclaimer : ALL numbers arbitrary and sucject to balance. This whole thing is pure fantasy anyways. For a **TL;DR**, read only the **bolded parts**. Best i could do. -Summary- 1 ) New Features and passive nodes 2 ) Clearspeed and skip rares meta 3 ) Mobility Creep 4 ) Gameplay 5 ) Leveling relevance 6 ) Defenses 7 ) True hardcore 8 ) Lag and crashes _____________ NEW FEATURES AND PASSIVE NODES Three new **crafting threshold jewels**: they require a ridiculous amount of Intelligence/Strength/Dexterity from allocated nodes in the passive tree only (equipment doesn't count), and give  You cannot craft low tiers of caster/defensive/attack mods  respectively. **The chance to 6-link an item increases for every fuse used** by 0.25%, so after 400 tries your chances to 6-link it are double what they were before, and triple after 800 tries and so on. This is tied to the item, so if you trade it, it will still have the increased chance. Can be seen by pressing alt. **You can show your items in chat with the gems socketed in them too** by pressing ctrl+alt+something else. **Minions with sufficient movement speed will position themselves in front** of you rather than behind. This is made easier by the movement changes below. New nodes for spectres (1/2): 20% less Spectre HP, your **spectres resurrect** after 10 seconds of being dead. New nodes for spectres (2/2): +1 spectres, 50% reduced max amount of zombies, skeletons and raging spirits. **Cyclone no longer gives stun immunity**. Any other obscure bonuses and maluses hidden in other skills like that secret stun immunity are revealed too. **Cyclone can now be recast** during the travel to change direction, and the mana cost is changed to some mana drained per 0.25 second while cycloning, instead of one big cost at the start. If you run out of mana it stops. Flat mana cost reduction (Elreon mod) applies to the mana drain at 25% effectiveness. Killing **merciless Malachai** solo without dying once in the instance makes him **drop an exalt**. This can only happen once in the life of a character. The game is also harder, see below. You can now type an amount with your keyboard to split currency stacks easier (my mouse has troubles, don't judge). New gem type : **Switching gem** (takes 2 inventory slots, like a belt). You can socket 2 non-switching gems in it, then you can socket the switching gem (it's white) in any single gem socket (only one switching gem per link chain). Then, you can set a button in your action bar to activate one gem or the other in your link. Practical example : you put Inc AoE and Conc Effect in the switching gem, put that in your Flameblast links, then switch in-fight depending on what you're fighting. Other example : Enfeeble or Vulnerability in your Curse on Hit links. _____________ CLEARSPEED AND SKIP RARES META **AoE damage falloff for AoE, chain, and pierce.** When a damaging effect hits multiple enemies, it deals X% less damage for each enemy hit, down to a cap of 40% of the tooltip damage. This will reward optimizing how many enemies you damage at the same time, and will stop multi-target effects from multiplying your effective DPS by 20 when you hit 20 enemies at once for example. For chaining, first hit deals tooltip damage, 2nd hit deals 80%, 3rd hit deals 60%....... 20th hit deals 40% because that's the minimum. For piercing, same thing as chaining but 15% less each time because it can't hit the same enemy again. For AoE effects 15% too, all calculated at the same time and then the damage is dealt. The **radius of damaging effects has also been reduced** by 20% across the board. This also helps with performance problems and crashes, which we will talk about in a moment. To compensate: **Currency drops and XP gain doubled** since monster packs don't get one-shot in t15 maps anymore and getting lvl 90 in one day shouldn't be possible. Monsters spawning from **fracture give 12% XP** of the parent monster. More about the rares in  Leveling  section below. _______________ MOBILITY CREEP 15% **higher base movespeed**. **Waylines** (""based on ""waypoints"") are basically two-way instant subway lines **to avoid too long backtracking within big areas**. They look like red waypoints. They have a cooldown per character so they can't be used to dodge stuff during a fight. **Movement speed bonuses reduced** by half, except those from the skilltree. So with 30% (now 15%) movespeed boots, you'll be exactly as fast as before, but any increases beyond that (frenzy, rampage, onslaught etc) will be weaker than before. _______________ MONSTER GAMEPLAY **Monsters in hiding show very small clues of their presence every few seconds** (grains of sand moving, grass moving, water glowing strangely) but if you move past the screen too fast you'll miss it. At that speed however, you could have just moved there to force them to reveal themselves, so adapt your hunting tactic to your speed. **Some monsters are less stupid**. When all you do is run past them and throw firetraps and caustic arrows behind you, some of them will just stop chasing you instead of dying without landing even one hit. **Really smart monsters use tactics**: For example, blackguards can shield charge parallel to each other to form a wave, or they can form a blockade to protect their lightning casters instead of charging you at all. If you still manage to take the caster to 2/3 HP, then they charge. Animals like monkeys can pretend to run away only to lead you into a trap. Big enemies like gorillas and golems can make trees or pillars fall to block your path (predetermined by level design like master locations, so that it can never make progression impossible). Overall it should no longer be possible to zoom through an area at lightning speed without being stopped by anything. _______________ LEVELING RELEVANCE **Killing strong enemies and clearing areas gives stacking permanent bonuses**. Let us explain a bit here: Base HP per level and mana per level reduced, but killing a rare/unique (including just being in a party that kills them, we don't hate supports) gives 1 Growth point, and fully clearing an area gives 3. This is capped per area and per difficulty, and you can spend those points in a box in the passive tree for permanent bonuses like +2 life, mana, or ES. This means for example you can clear Dread Thicket in Cruel until you maxed out the 8 Growth points you can get there (bigger areas = higher cap), and then you never have to go back there again. Also rares/uniques are guaranteed to drop at least 1/3/7 random currency items based on normal/cruel/merciless (could be some divines, could be full transmutes). _______________ DEFENSES AND IMMUNITIES **CI, ""Can't be Evaded"", Armor, and more.** Just like we made previously made it virtually impossible to have 100% resistance to anything, we now tackle Chaos damage. **Chaos Inoculation keystone now reads ""Chaos damage doesn't bypass energy shield - Maximum life reduced to 1""**. The 3 nodes behind CI now give a total of **36% More ES and 120% chaos resistance**. As a result, **a few rare/unique enemies now have CI**, so if you let them start regenerating, they'll recover completely. Of course, they give great loot &amp; XP to players or parties who beat them. In the same theme, to balance the reliability of ""Can't be evaded"", attacks with this mod will still run an evasion check: **if the attack *Would* have been evaded without the mod, that attack and any spells it procs will deal 40% less damage** to the target. Note that Resolute Technique already has the downside of never critting, so it ignores this penalty. Armor needed some more reliability against big hits so it now gives a multiplicative **guaranteed 0.5% physical damage reduction per 1000 armor**. For example at 50k armor you will roughly have a guaranteed 22% less damage protection (99,5%^50 = 78%) from physical damage, on top of the usual armor effects. Bosses with  Cannot be shocked, cursed, etc  cannot have them permanently. Either it's only when they're not attacking, or they have to cast something specifically to get the immunities temporarily. _______________ TRUE HARDCORE In Hardcore leagues, **portal scrolls and the Portal gem do not exist**. Logging out will leave your character exactly where he was, not invulnerable, and when you login again you'll be there. If the logout lasts longer than 1 minute, he will be teleported back to town like before. To compensate: **Free IIQ and account MTX.** Hardcore leagues have +50% IIQ in all areas. A random non-event-restricted MTX is gained at levels 75, 95 and 100 (that means you can't get Prophecy challenge weapon or Pay-To-Win fireworks, but you can get a piece of Seraph armor, or a Frog pet). _______________ LAG AND CRASHES **Cast on Crit and insane speeds reworked.** Overall we reduced the amount of things that the game has to calculate in any given frame. **Cast speed and Attack speed are now capped** to 16 attacks/casts per second. **Bonuses beyond that limit are converted to increased damage at 50% of their value**. For example if i'm already attack speed capped and i get a buff giving 10% increased attack speed, i get 5% increased damage instead. With this change we can allow Cast on Critical Strike to have an additional 100% chance to cast supported spells (still requires a crit) once every 5-&gt;3 seconds based on gem level. AoE knockbacks (including Vaal Cyclone) can now only affect the first 10 targets they hit to move them. If they hit more than 10 at once, only 10 randomly chosen ones are affected. This should help the game not crash when vacuuming sea witches + beyond. _______________ That's it ! Maybe i forgot a thing or two but this seems long enough already. I guess you can get yourself a cookie if you made it this far, and tell me what you want or don't want in that list while you're at it. EDIT: Obligatory thanks for my first gold! Even weirder on a post with mostly downvotes :D but hey i also just bought a 6L unique so it's quite a good evening tonight. EDIT2: removed some nonsense after u/MorbidEel eplxained why it was impossible."

However, some builds cannot run all mods, self cast pure RF being one of the worst offenders; 4 out of the 7 common packsize mods are at least very dangerous / tedious or outright impossible depending on the RF falvour (Vulnerability, -max, less regen, no regen). Getting zero returns over multiple maps in a row due to variance in which you have invested a lot of currency in is not fun. While I'm well aware that such is the nature of poe and its gambling system, I don't think it should be ""as bad"". What I suggest instead of requiring lots of rerolling per map is either narrowing the gap between non-packsize and packsize maps or to have more affixes grant packsize. This would hopefully allow players to run maps that are most enjoyable to them rather than that Chilled Ground + Temp Chains map that happens to have good quantity and packsize. **Uber Lab** Lab and especially the trials require at least double life flasks to do safely, I don't really want to change my flask setup whenever I encounter a trial. Even though the offerings are worth quite a bit, I just can't be bothered running most of them since they take so much time too. Why not have it just drop the offering when touching the plate in front of the trial if it has already been completed? **Uber Atziri** As is, Uber Atziri is ""double rng gated"" with normal Atziri being barely worth it 3 days into the league unless you get a hope or ignorance. Corrupted T12+ maps could have a chance to drop uber fragments, the higher the tier, the higher the odds for hope / ignorance. Furthermore, some builds which are viable into red maps can barely or not at all do Atziri due to ignite immunity and the reflect clone, arc or flameblast for instance. Immunities in general aren't a very fun mechanic as they can take away core mechanics of some builds."
467,vulnerability,pathofexile,I don't understand reflect.,1,4qjjoy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4qjjoy/i_dont_understand_reflect/,2016-06-30 13:05:58,"I've read the wiki page, but that didn't really clear anything up. I always try to mitigate reflect with leech and vaal pact, flasks, defense etc, but it seems very unpredictable. I played a whispering ice build with life leech and vaal pact and never had trouble with reflect. I played storm call with LL and VP and reflect murdered me constantly. I played a wander with crown of eyes, a little leech, vaal pact and never had reflect problems. I played Tornado Shot and reflect wasn't all that bad. I played Blade Vortex and reflect always chunked me. Playing LA now with VP, warlord's mark and leech on the tree. Sometimes I 1 hit myself and sometimes my life doesn't move. There are so many Reflect variables. Phy reflect in vulnerability map. Ele reflect in minus-max res maps. The damage skills mechanics, amount of hits, etc Amount of monsters you can leech from and so on. The wiki says the order of reflect is. You hit target, leech, receive reflected damage. That makes it seem like, unless you instantly hit the target again while the damage is being reflect, you have a high chance of chunking life or dying. So 1 hitting a reflect mob almost 1 hits you. Reflect is in the game, I guess, as a hindrance to high damage builds. But it doesn't really work that way. Reflect kills you in act 3 merc the same way it does in a Wasteland map. Outside of high armor/life physical damage builds, and skills that hit numerous times quickly, reflect is a problem no matter how much you try to defend against it. Reflect mobs are much more visible now, easier to identify, but in most cases that just means leave them alone. I'm not saying that reflect should be taken out of the game, I just don't know what else I can do to not die from it, other than running every time I see one. I guess I'm asking, is that what you are supposed to do, just flee? "

We now the technologies is there since Forsaken Masters, and that is game design decision. You could also throw in some XP penalties if needed. But currently my toughts about endgame dont give le incentive to play THE EXACT SAME content over and over again. Usually its hard for me to get the motivation to push pas 86...sometimes 92, because currently there is too fews options: * the most efficient: grind t9- t10 map with at least 25% packsize (3-4 minutes per map maximum) *Only two maps* * the most expensive, longer and dangerous and LESS rewarding do reds maps..more maps..but very repetitives and finally LESS build diversity. I agree that lv 100 should be something hard to get and that sustaining Reds maps is a gated challenge..bla-bla-bla..but more incentive has been destroyed by the recent XP change.. If map scaling were in play we could have a broaden range of maps and some ""low levels"" like Museum, scaled to t15 could be totally the scariest and challenging map ever (Bog or Wharf in t15 with Vulnerability, Overlord, Twinned, of Chaining and multiple projectile could insta OsKo party of 6 even with 9k HP if not maxed on chaos. Uniques maps are never scaled and current scaling stop to lv 78 if i am correct, but aren't rollable :/ Today i got a twinned Plateau lv 72 ( T4) through Zana...the map didn't drop higher maps than +1 or +2 from the boss but i got the challenge ""full clear Twinned boss **T10** "" even if the map was at most a T4.. * We already got color on maps to show the tier , so that shouldn't be such a hard problem to solve or use too much ressources. * We already drop +1 or +2 levels of maps in scalled version through Zana. That will lessen the burnout feeling you get when you hit endgame and enable more challenges and add some variety for endgame. The last request (but need some help from crafty redditor familiar to image edition ) is to have map COLOR : When we drop a magic or rare or unique map we know at glance what there rarity tier is... but as long as you stash them or put them in your inventory, unless you type some filtering keywords or hover your mouse you cannot tell what is rare, magic, corrupted. Its a little request and it should greatly help when you search map and it dould look beautiful. For exemple: Divination cards stacks were SUPER HARD and eyes bleeding to discern until you fixed the colour for full stack. Maps - hey come on it represent half of the game content and all of the END game content- could use that little Qol like divination did and they will look better. I know we can notice Unique by their Arts.. but having that little halo would look so cool, don't you think?"

The map had no further modifier (eg vulnerability or something like that). which might have influenced the outcome. I tried to calculate what my weakness was and thus tried to learn how to improve the build. Since i just cannot get it in my head how i died i'd be glad if someone here can enlighten me. My char had 4700hp and 8500 armour. The maximal listed damage with one shot was given by 3911 physical damage, i have no charges. So if i understand it right, the map reflects 15% damage, thus i get 0.15*3911*1.5=880 for a maximum damage rolled crit (6%, not sure if it occured). The armour, to my understanding, removes 1 point damage per 10 point armour, but only up to 95%. Since 880-8500/10 &lt; 0.05*880 i instead would receive the 5% of the reflected damage, making it 44 damage per hit. Having 4700 hp i would need to hit 4700/44=107 mobs with a single attack, which seems rather implausible even with GMP, but only 70% additional projectile speed. So can anyone help me understand, what it was, that killed me? Many thanks!"
472,vulnerability,pathofexile,A strong alternative to Block Aegis,67,4svzgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4svzgy/a_strong_alternative_to_block_aegis/,2016-07-15 08:23:01," I was bored this week, and I tried out a new block build that I have not seen anyone efficiently use before. I use [Crown of The Pale King](URL along with [Thousand Teeth Temu](URL and [The Anvil](URL to create a psuedo-Aegis character. I sent a mail to GGG, in which they confirmed that the ""reflect x-x to attackers"" apply to attacks **and** spells. The reflected damage can only be increased by ""enemies take more damage"" and can not be scaled from other sources. The base reflected damage on a blocked attack/spell (78%block) is 100+1+240 - 150+1000+300 = 341-1450 / average reflect is 895.5 damage. Since this is hard to scale is use a 20% lvl 20 vulnerability with 30% curse effect and Enchance for a total of 61.1% extra phys damage. So in total I reflect a average of ~1440 damage, of which I get 30% as life. So on a average block I deal 1440 physical damage and get ~430 life back. Now compare this to a Aegis build. A non-legacy aegis get 2% of armor as energy shield on block. With CotPK you get life instead, not needing ES gear. For the 2% of aegis to be 400 ES you would need 20.000 armor, and it would still not be on life. I tried it out on a Gladiator @lvl 80, and I can handle pretty much any maps and mods, been doing t14-t15 without issues. It's super strong, and I bet it can be refined even further. It's also fantastic for making people pissed in PvP because they don't understand why they die ;P ***Edit:*** I don't use the reflect offensively, only as a way of ""defense"". For offence I use regular attacks, ex Eartquake/voidheart, cyclone, lightning strike etc. ***Video Edit:*** URL"

Most of the stuff is figured out. One of the biggest things, however, is deciding on wich class to start as. Im thinking of going marauder chieftan for the leach and endurance charge generation. But inquisitor gives crit chance and penetration (would free fire pen from the links, although a +3 fire pen is nice to have still, and chieftan also has 10% fire pen). There's also the possibility of going elementalist, because 35% penetration and releases prolif from the link set up. PS: i'm not really used to theorycrafting builds, so i might have just done something really stupid im my train of thought, so if i did please warn this silly man PS: this is my first reddit post, so i might have done something that goes againts the reddiquette. sorry :P PS: if i do go chieftan, im thinking of something like this URL SecondIteration of The Build------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ IMPORTANT: So just now i saw that power charges give lightning damage, not cold :P. thanks to WelpxD for correcting me on that. After reading the comments, im now thinking on going 9/10 endurance charges (depending on ascendancy) 4 frenzy (generation through blood rage) marauder using dual Kaom's Way (thanks Caldoni). Dont know if i should go chieftan for 35%pen, Burning damage + ignite chance and fire leach or juggernaut for +1 endurance charge, charge generation, 14%moove speed (always nice) and the tankiness from unbreakable. with this build it would probably be better now to try to scale the inicial hit rather than the burn, i dont know wich is better. and with 4,9% life regen, + 1% per endurance charge (0,2% from tree, 0,8 from dual Kaom's Way) and the +1% to max fire res, it might be viable to sustain both blood rage and RF. What do you guys think? RF or not? Im also thinking if i should follow Caldoni's second tip and go for dual curse (im thinking blasphemy is the better way of delivery). But even then what would i put besides flamability? warlords mark is probably best if i go chieftan, but if i stay as a juggernaut it may be better to go ele weakness, or maybe a defensive curse like enfeeble or temp chains. maybe vulnerability even? Im really in the dark as to where to go, so if you have sugestions, please go on and tell me. two possible passive trees (same amount of points just for comparison)?: URL this one is more geared towards life regen to sustain RF: URL Third Iteration of The Build-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Ok then. After a bit of brainstorming alone and with the awesome people in the comments (love this community) this is the final idea so far: Juggernaut ( Unflinching &amp; Unrelenting for charge+damage+denfense and Unbreakable for defense. unstopable in late-game for quality of life) 10 Endurance Charges, 4 Frenzy Charges(half of the damage converted to fire because of the cold to fire) and maybe 3 Power Charges(still deciding, bur prob will use) generating Frenzy through Blood Rage and Endurance Through Ascendancy Passive + Warlords Mark and generating power through PCoC setup scalling burn and AoE mostly, with dual curse Warlords + Flamabbility (would LOVE to have ele weakness too, but i think Warlords is more important to guarantee Charges. Maybe with Endyring Cry i wont need warlords mark, but i dont know) Aplying the curses and Ele Equilibrium Through Orb of Storms Curse on Hit also having a PCoC to proc Ele Overload + Generation power charges for some extra lighning damage just for funsies. the main links would be: Realm Ender: Cold to Fire lv5(from item) + Discharge (+4) + chance to ignite (+3) + inc Burning dmg (+3) + Ele Prolif (+3) + Fire Pen (+3) + (if 6-link) Controled Destruction / Inc. AoE / Conc Effect (most likely Controled Destruction) Chest: Orb of Storms + Curse on Hit + Warlords + Flamability + inc AoE + (if 6-link) Crit Chance (to proc Ele Overload) Gloves/Boots: Orb of Storms/Blade Vortex/Whatever + Crit Chance + PCoC + Faster Casting/Increased Duration? (to proc Ele Overload) Gloves/Boots: a CwDT + Immortal Call setup, because we can. Helm: and since we have 0% reserved mana so far and a 4-link freed up, maybe get Determination/Anger + Purity of Fire (to deal with Inicial Hit Reflect) on an Alphas Howl.

Some niches are still not really accounted for. **Auras** * Pride - x% more physical damage - 50% reservation Currently physical builds are stuck with Vulnerability, they have no aura or herald that scales physical. * Courage - flat armor - 50% reservation It's a shame that the only aura atm that gives flat armor is an Evasion aura. In response, Grace should give less Evasion, but in addition should give a bit of Dodge and spell Dodge * Kindness - x% of damage is redirected from party members to you. Redirected damage cannot be fatal. - 25% reservation Be the tank you always wanted to be **Heralds** * Herald of Entropy - x% more damage over time - Enemies that die from a damage over time effect will weaken enemies around them for 4 seconds, reducing their damage by x%. **New mana related skills** Reposting some older ideas * Manifestation of Fire Buff that needs to be toggled on, unlimited duration (like the old AA). Drains x mana per second (or life per sec if linked with BM gem), you gain 15% extra fire dmg ,applies both to attacks and spells, on death targets have a x % chance to explode in a radius, igniting for x % of their max life done, multiple debuffs stack and refresh the duration. Supports like increased burning dmg, increased aoe, conc effect, etc, work, but increase the mana/life drain accordingly. * Manifestation of Ice Same base mechanics as MoF Drains x mana per second (or life per sec if linked with BM gem), you gain 15% extra cold dmg, applies both to attacks and spells,on death targets have a x % chance to grant Ice Barrier for 4 seconds, Ice Barrier grants x-y Fire and Physical dmg reduction (like the old AA). Increased Duration prolongs the buff for increased mana/life drained per second. * Manifestation of Lightning Same base mechanics as MoF Drains x mana per second (or life per sec if linked with BM gem), you gain 15% extra lightning dmg, applies both to attacks and spells, on death targets have a chance to grant the user Overcharge for 4 seconds, Overcharge grants 100% shock chance and Shock immunity for the duration. Overcharge makes life flasks have no effect. Increased Duration prolongs the buff for increased mana/life drained per second. The idea behind these skills was to provide an alternative/additive to Heralds,but making them require build investment, unlike Heralds which can be used by pretty much anyone. I really liked the old AA mechanic which drained mana, and think it's a shame GGG removed such a unique mechanic. I want the mana/life cost to be hefty, especially when augmented with support gems.

First, would Bino's spread the 8+ second poison from Viper Strike (assuming it was the most damaging poison to spread, of course?). Working with Adder's touch, it seems that it spreads 2 seconds base duration poisons, but that might be due to Adder's Touch being a poison from a crit being more damaging than the viper strike poison and thus be spread instead. Second, can Dual Strike apply two poisons? I'm guessing not, since effects which occur for a hit only proc once with Dual Strike; if only once, does the poison scale from both hits, or just the highest? Is there any thing else funny about how Dual Strike and Poison Works (like if each one rolls separately for application, say from Adder's and assuming both attacks crit, each rolls 30% chance to apply poisons; giving a 51% chance to apply poisons instead of 30%). Finally, how well would it be to invest into the poison side of the build? I have more experience with the herald of ash + hatred while stacking as much crit/physical damage as I could with dual strike. I'm planning on going Assassin, so critical hit poisons will do 20% of base physical. Would it be worth it adding an added chaos damage gem to my main attack (in place of, say, melee physical damage on top of melee physical damage on full life if CI), should I pick up Noxious Strike to boost the poisons further, or go all the way down near duelist for the additional chance to poison against bleeding targets on top of Assassin and Adder? I was thinking of running Haste and Plasphemy + Vulnerability auras instead of hatred/herald of ash to try and boost the physical side for the poisons, since the elemental damage won't scale with poisons. Either way, I might try the latter ideas out. It'll likely cost 20-30 respec points to go a traditional build if it doesn't work out, but I'd appreciate any input people more experienced with the game might have."

The build is going to be: Low Life 7 Frenzy Charges Trickster Ascendancy [Passive Tree lv 90](URL Tree Stats: 300%+ ES and almost 500% Damage **Gems:** 6L: ED, Void Manipulation, Controlled Destruction, Rapid Decay, Pierce, Empower 3L: Contagion, Faster Casting, Increased AoE 3L: CWDT, Immortal Call, Increased Duration 4L or rather 2 2L: Blood Magic, Haste and 2L: Blasphemy, Curse The Curse will probably be Vulnerability for the damage but can be switched with temp chains or enfeeble as needed 4L or rather 3L: Flame Dash, Faster Casting, Flame Golem and without links: Discipline 4L: Wither, Spell Totem, Faster Casting, Increased Duration **Flask Setup:** Since no one of us has expericne with LL Essence Drain we don't really know what to do here: Mana Flask probably useless because of low mana consumption and high mana regen (Patient Reaper) Probably one or two Quicksilver Flasks, maybe none and flame dash will be enough Onslaugh The Sorrow of the Divine --&gt; zealots oath which is quite useful for the regen of ED probably some elemental resistance flasks **Why no poison?** With poison (and some poison passive notes) I reached 38k DPS on my test character. For poison to work we need Consuming Dark (to generate the poison, the support gem costs too much DPS) and Bino's to spread it. Without that we can use a normal wand and shield with some spell damage, resulting in 40k DPS (and 3 more passive skill points). And the poison damage is also scaled with the HIT damage, which is very low on Essence Drain. **Generating Frenzy Charges:** The main source will probably be Swift Killer (Ascendancy): 15% on kill Since I have never used it I cannot tell if this will be enough keep 7 charges up all the time, depends on the clear speed, which will hopefully quite fast! Alternatively I can put a Quill Rain with Frenzy (gem) and faster Attacks in my offhand and switch to it if needed (for bosses for example). Another idea would be to use blood rage but I don't think it'll work out. **Gear will be quite simple:** Shavronne's Wrappings That's it, the rest can be filled up with rares, making capping resistances and the defense really easy and strong. There are other useful uniques like Winds of Change but I don't find them that great. What do you think? ideas? suggestions? improvements? criticism? comments? Let me know! gl hf - Tobnac edit: thanks to everyone for your input! results: poison = OP single target, I will use Consuming Dark to decrease my trash/AoE DPS a little bit but increase my single target a lot for rares, uniques, soul eaters, bosses (Atziri, Izaro and so on), ..."

Elemental Overload is triggered with a single cast of Blade Vortex with Increased Duration and Increased Crit.

Of course, the build works fine especially since my defense is a nice block rate (53%, max with rumi's) and a sexy amount of armour (about 11k, no flasks or anything). The build is obviously based on Voidheart since i want the poison all the time, and i dont wanna waste a gem in my 6link. And since voidheart comes with a bonus of bleed then its even better. Thanks to the Toxic Delivery and some DOT nodes along with Chaos Nodes on the tree I can muster some noice poison dmg. However as the league goes and lvl comes closer to the end I get bored. And here's my question, which is pretty much only based on the dmg. Im sure the build im working on has more defensive ability when it comes to amount of life, armour and life regen (not so much on block tho, since it will get halved)... The thing is I want to learn how my DPS tooltip will improve and how this change will affect the poison and bleed combo which I still want to use. The Assassin is using a shield for defense purposes, however the build Im working on is a dual wield sword based one. Along with a lot of crit chance and crit multi nodes Im extremely close to dagger values. Phys Damage is higher by 90% (just the tree) and my AS is higher by 20-30%. The amount of jewels stays the same and I will use the same ones for this build. Also the accuracy rate will go up from 82-83% to 95%(max) with this build. The crit multi might be improved etc, and ofc we got the More Phys dmg from dual wield and more AS as well. and so, id like to ask someone good with the maths in POE. Here're my stats from the tree for the dagger and the sword. and also a question after ure done thinking about them. What dmg would the 2nd build have? Dagger: Bino 9.5 crit 241 pDPS. 477% Phys 99% AS 83% Acc Note: 83% acc doesnt mean i have 83% on the tree, its the actuall hit chance at lvl 86 which i currently have. 390% Crit Chance 175% Crit Multi 40% global Crit chance from bino and 25% multi from bino as well. 76% Chaos damage 30% Dot +30% from bino 100% more damage from poison on crit (95%) Vulnerability Sword: 1st. 9.7% Crit chance 263 pDPS 2nd. 7.5% crit 320 pDPS 568% Phys 119-129% AS 95% Acc 30% multi from 1 sword 50% multi from the other one. Crit chance 385% Crit multi 160% 0 mods to DOT or chaos damage Assassin's Mark (more dmg from crit and 100% crit chance instead of 95%) and ofc dual wield bonuses 20% more attack physical damage and 10% more AS If the damage i get from dagger with following gem setup: Reave -&gt; Melee Physical Damage -&gt; Faster Attack -&gt; MultiStrike -&gt; Increased Critical Chance -&gt; Inc Aoe is about 90k with no charges then how would i go with the dual wield build?

But here I've stumbled on a math/dps problem. I've been playing with various items/gem/ascendancy setups. I started out with a LL RF Redbeak ED. Was rocking 50k dot, and it was preety good. But many map mods cut my damage (like vulnerability, -max), making impossible running RF (I wasnt using RotF). So I went with a scion/jugg-ocu build, with Consuming dark for poison. The damage feels much beter, even tho the numbers on paper are lower. So, here's my math for full dps over 4.7 second span ED dot = (1227*700%)*1.3*1.35*1.29*1.39*0.9*1.44=35 029 My multipliers are: Pain Atunment, vulnerability, pierce, void manipulation, spell echo (for those poison stacks) and controlled destruction. I've skipped here the -15% chaos res from ascendancy node or any eventual frenzy charges. ED hit: 2*(442*490%)*1.3*1.29*1.39*0.9*1.44 = 13 085 this is the damage of a single cast of ED with spell echo (2 projectiles fired) As you can see I've taken into account increases that do not apply to ED's initial hit, but do apply for the DoT. I did the same with poison, and my formula for calculation poison DoT is the following: Poison ((13085*10%)*540%)*1.35 = 9538. 2 projectiles/single cast of ED applies 2 stacks of poison, which dps totals to 9538. With the cast speed of ~2.5 casts/sec and some skill duration nodes + temp chains I've assumed that my poison will last about 4.7 sec. So I wanted to calculate the full dps in that 4.7sec. 4.7x35 029+6(number of casts with spell echo possibel to shot in 4.7sec. 1cast=2projectiles fired)x13085+6(in 4.7 sec i will apply 12 stacks of poison, so I too the middle number to average out the dps from the t0, where i will have 0 stacks to t1 where I will have full 12 stacks)x9538= 300374. I was quite pleased with that. But then I did some further math, changing some gear and gems. Here is full dps with Rapid decay instead of Spell echo: 329090 This was very surprising for me, becase it means that ED's base DoT increase is bigger that fastly applied Poison stacks. So I took another look at it, this time with Redbeak instead of Consuming dark and got: 316884. But when I'm testing it during play, against strong single targets CD + echo is beter (by a very narrow margin beter than CD + rapid decay) and significantly beter than Redbeak + Rapid decay. Its beter by like 20%, not the 16k total dps. So, where did I go wrong with math? Why is CD + echo beter, even tho it's sheet dps is 30k lower than CD + rapid decay? and Why is it so much beter than 16k dps higher Redbeak + rapid decay?"

Wouldn't want maps system altered for those who like it - numeric values are just my idea, they should be subjected to GGG/community balance choices ofc ---------- &amp;nbsp; Well, I'm on the road to reach my second lv100 in HC leagues (I write this only to specify that I know this game pretty well and I like it a lot...), and after many hours spent clearing maps I'd like to propose you my idea for an alternative to current end-game mechanics, which aims to three different goals: &amp;nbsp; 1- to give players who want a smooth gameplay a way to just actually play the game; no time wasted in farming/rolling/buying maps, searching for that last pack, etc... Just a non-stop enjoyable experience. &amp;nbsp; 2- to give players who want to test their limits/abilities an actual challenging experience, and make lv.100 a true accomplishment. (But I think that this goal can and must be reached without altering the accessibility of the game for new/casual players). &amp;nbsp; 3- to satisfy both group of players: those that like current state of the game with powerfull ascended chars and those that instead think it has become too easy. &amp;nbsp; Right now the end-game is not challenging (unless you self-challenge yourself), is just time-consuming. If you want, with enough currency and time, you can reach lv100 completely risk-free by buying and running white T10-T11 maps (fast ones, like plateau and springs) and even skipping all bosses. It will be not only easier, but even faster then running T15 maps, if your clear speed is good. How can we change this? This is my idea: &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ---------- || CHANGE TO BASE GAME || &amp;nbsp; In cruel and merciless difficult al waypoints are activated, trials are already completed and you only need to face mandatory bosses (Brutus, Merveil, Piety, etc). &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ---------- || CHANGE TO MAPS SYSTEM || &amp;nbsp; Just one: they grant experience only up to lv95. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ---------- || INTRODUCTION OF ""insert name (free?)"" MODE || &amp;nbsp; A sort of customizable ""endless-ledge like experience"", unlocked when you complete normal difficult. By ""endless-ledge like experience"" I mean an endless succession of random-generated areas that alternate available tilesets, with a pretty linear layout, one entry and one exit. By ""customizable"" I mean you can set the area level up to +5 levels compared to your char, you can set mods (quantity/type - even random if you want), and exclude some tilesets (for those who hate some ot them because too dark/bright/whatever). This ""casual"" mode is for those who like to simply relax and play, without the complications of maps system and the tedium of doing the story mode for your 10thousand time. Obviously it should have some penalties like: &amp;nbsp; - grant no exp. past lv60 if you haven't completed cruel difficult - grant no exp. past lv80 - grant -50% quantity and rarity to drops - drops are iLevel 68 max - no maps drop - some uniques cannot drop &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ---------- || INTRODUCTION OF GAUNTLET MODE || &amp;nbsp; Unlocked when you reach lv95 and this should be the only way to go past it. This mode should be very similar to the previous one but with this modifications: &amp;nbsp; - area level is set to 82 (like T15 maps) - drops are iLevel 82 (or it would be too easy to farm ilevel 83-84 bases when you reach lv95) - parties are disabled. This must be a personal achievement, it's already sad to see challenges sold/bought. Don't want to see ""Gauntlet services""... - at level 95 enemies have +20% life and +10% damage; you must choose 4 mods (or affixes as you prefer to call them) - at level 96 enemies have +40% life and +20% damage; you are cursed with enfeeble; you must choose 5 mods - at level 97 enemies have +60% life and +30% damage; you are cursed with enfeeble and vulnerability; you must choose 6 mods - at level 98 enemies have +80% life and +40% damage; you are cursed with enfeblee and vulnerability; you must choose 6 mods and at least one must be damage-type - at level 99 enemies have +100% life and +50% damage; you are cursed with enfeblee and vulnerability; you must choose 6 mods and at least two must be damage-type - every 19% of experience gained toward next level, the successive area transition will lead you to a predefined boss room: it will grant the missing 1% and you must defeat it in order to continue to gain experience. This means a total of 25 mandatory bosses; GGG here have plenty of choices considered the amount of material already available (from invasion, beyond, story, maps, etc). - (not sure about this, but I would like it..) legacy and mirrored items aren't allowed, in order to limit the use of OP items available only to rich players (and consider that a lot of players would include me into this definition :D ) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; To conclude I want to say that I thought to this alternative by considering only options that require little to no need for GGG to create new content. It's just a way to ""recycle"" existing material in a more smooth and challenging way, without replacing what we already have. And this changes would give players more freedom... Freedom to play the game as they prefer. &amp;nbsp; Thanks to those who will take the time to read this long post :)"

For the other 2 links I think the main options are either Conc Effect plus Poison for even more damage over time or going crit with Increased Critical Strikes plus Increased Crit Damage (or Accuracy if required). I don't really want to go elemental because I've done that a lot before. I'm not sure about what weapon to use. I'd like to pick up a Varunastra eventually but is there a good budget weapon for something like this? Anything else I should bear in mind?"

500,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Question] Help me with my build?,0,4iwf5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4iwf5w/question_help_me_with_my_build/,2016-05-12 04:43:31,"**DISCLAIMER**: I am not a professional at making builds. I am soliciting your help with this build. **Concept:** I've seen the meta of Voltaxic Pierce Sparkers. They're pretty OP. **So I tried to one-up this conceptually with Voltaxic Pierce Spark Totems.** **The idea is to have four totems casting at once, thus generating enough sparks to repeatedly bounce off walls and inflict the enemy with more poison stacks than would be possible with self-casting. The idea isn't that each totem will deal as much or more damage than a self-casting sparker: It won't, especially with Ritual of Awakening/Spell Totem -mods.** Theoretically, the number of spark projectiles will inflict more damage overall, especially with enough speed and casting sources, since Poison stacks infinitely. **Execution:** **The idea is to go budget. All you need is a 4-5L Soul Mantle and a Voltaxic Rift.** Could even be a bricked one from Anarchy's Price, doesn't matter. You can basically wear Rare gear for everything else. **You also need another 4L minimum for Vaal Spark.** If you decide to use Soul Mantle (Lv. 49) before you get Voltaxic (Lv. 64), use Lightning Penetration and Conductivity. The point of Voltaxic is to essentially provide 100% penetration, which beats out that gimpy Penetration + curse. The immunity to reflect is also nice for keeping the totems alive, but is naturally not as important on a totem build as it is on a self-casting build. Also use a wand/dagger + shield setup or Quill Rain + a quiver when leveling. The potential 100% increased Projectile Speed from Quill Rain is hilarious on Spark builds. **Here are my proposed links:** * Spark - [Spell Totem from Soul Mantle] - Pierce - Poison - Faster Casting - Void Manipulation - Controlled Destruction * Vaal Spark - Spell Echo - Pierce - Poison - Increased Duration - Void Manipulation Totems cannot Echo or Multistrike. Links are in order of priority (not sure about the totem setup though). **Other links:** * CWDT - IC - Golem - Increased Duration * [If you have Essence Worm] OoS - CoH - Vulnerability/TC/charge generating curses - Culling Strike * [If you do not have Essence Worm] Wrath - Herald of Thunder - CoH - a Curse * Blink Arrow - Phase Run - Rallying Cry - Increased Duration These are never set in stone. Modify as gear/coloring demands. **Here is my proposed tree:** URL This is how the tree would look at level 91. **Ascendancy Stuff**: You ascend as a **Hierophant.** You go for **Ritual of Awakening through Pursuit of Faith, and then a 2-pointer of your choice.** * If you aren't running auras or are using Essence Worm, run Divine Guidance for the boost to MoM. * If you are running Vaal Spark in your 4L boots, go for Illuminated Devotion.The 2% life leech will help you run through packs with Vaal Spark active. Phase Run also helps. * If you are running charges and a crit build, Conviction of Power is also an option for an extra defensive layer and easy charge generation method. Unfortunately, the effects are on-kill, so maybe not so good in prolonged boss fights without adds like Daresso. **Bandits:** Oak - Kill - Kill (The last one is tweakable. You can go for a charge depending on how you build this/your gear). **Pre-requisites of getting the build to a functional state**: * You have your Spark in a 4L or better Soul Mantle * You have 100% Pierce: 50 from the gem, and 50 from the ranger side of the tree. * You have the duration nodes, thus improving the poison, the spark range and effective ricochets, and the totem duration. * You have Voltaxic and Poison linked in your Spark setups. **Highlights:** * 193% Life and more EHP due to MoM/Divine Guidance * Fairly good early leveling due to life access * Can go non-crit if budget, or crit once you've got Rat's Nest, crit gloves, Diamond Flask, Power Charges and a method of generating them, etc. * Can get even more life with endgame tree. **Flaws:** * Point odyssey to go from Templar to Ranger/Shadow * Can only get into the build at level 49 * Killing Normal and Cruel Izaro with a leveling setup/incomplete totem setup might be tricky * Questionable damage output because untested **How to push the build further:** * Clear Mind + Essence Worm with Wrath. Just use auras normally before this * Spirited Response in Witch jewel node for MoM utility * Drillneck once you have 100% pierce * Winds of Change/Karui Ward/Victario's Acuity for Projectile Speed * Aforementioned crit variant * 6Ls **The real question, of course: Does this beat a regular Voltaxic Sparker? The answer is: I have no idea.** That's why I'm soliciting your guys' feedback for how to improve this build. Thank you guys in advance. This is my first time attempting to create a build via mechanical idea I had. I really hope it can work out."

Whenever I see a map boss I like to use 1 skill and run away and hear them die offscreen. That's why I think puncture might be fun (I already played the hell out of caustic arrow and want to compare it to something with bleed). Also I don't like the way ED + Contagion feel. Let me know if I should try something else. I saw Ad1ce's blood seeker build and it runs crit, as assassin. Which I don't want to do cause, in my experience and calculations anything that hits him at around 6k+ damage should kill him. Plus he has no armour so multiple 1k hits would easily kill him as well. **Build Overview** Offense: Use bleed from either punture or split arrow + tora modded bow. Thinking of budget friendly (less than 15ex in total), gonna try without crit cause [1] I don't want to deal with reflect too much (i want to run all map mods) and since [2] I'm one shotting packs and not getting 100% crit with assassin, I want reliable damage every shot.

505,vulnerability,pathofexile,"The Labyrinth, and why it's not that bad...",0,4da612,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/4da612/the_labyrinth_and_why_its_not_that_bad/,2016-04-04 18:08:11,"Okay, so I've heard a LOT of complaints about how the Labyrinth is either too long, too tedious, too grind-heavy or simply too difficult. And it's not because of Izaro either, who was supposed to be the most difficult part of all. There's no denying that our expectations was that he'd be insanely difficult, but he just isn't... I'll try to explain why I personally think the Lab is amazing, all in all. **First of all, Atmosphere** The lab, when you just stop to enjoy it for all that it is, is more than just an area 'I have to get through'. It actually looks like it's in ruins. Floors are missing, traps are ruined and it's inhabited primarily by skeletons and animals. This really does show that the Lab was once a great creation, now worn down by age. Imagine how pretty it would be, if we went into it the day it was created? It could possibly compete with Solaris, if not beat it. Occasionally, when walking on thin ledges in seemingly bottomless pits, I see something below, and wonder just how massive this area would really be. It would probably be something akin to Lord of the rings' Mines of moria, and we all know how grand some things in there might have seemed. **Secondly, the traps** There's no denying that these feel overtuned. Especially for anything energy-shield based, that cannot endure the torment of running through a larger trap-based area. It's actively suicide, right? I'm inclined to say no, here. It's not as insanely unreasonable as some might argue. I've ran through the area multiple times with Vaal pact and regen, and both seem to do equally well. I rely on potions, personally, but I rush through areas, rather than take it slow. We've gotten used to a playstyle where we rush through mobs as fast as possible, and traps really punish us for this. Still, I run through them like a headless chicken, and have yet to die to them on my VP character. And it's not because I'm amazing at dodging, it's because of how the traps are designed... Most of the more convoluted and hard-to-navigate traps are always the same. They aren't randomly generated like most of the things in the lab. They have a consistent pattern. This means that, like with bosses, we have to learn the patterns, and get them down. The last time I had to learn anything, was with Malachai, and even he feels slightly old now. It's refreshing to actually have to pay attention to my surroundings, rather than half-AFK run through it like with everything else. And outside of that, there's always mobs between each of these harder-to-do traps, so potions are never an issue. There's always room for a break between these 10-15 second long rush-throughs. And that's rushing through. You could take it slowly, and it would take 20-30 seconds. It takes longer, but you don't die. There's no reason to faulth GGG for our desire to go fast. The Lab was designed to be lethal, and the only way to do this, is to force players to consider their actions. The traps weren't 'overtuned' or anything of the likes. I have no doubt GGG tested labs multiple times to confirm just how much damage they did, and eventually came to the conclusion that 'This is the right amount', and I, for one, agree. If they downscaled it as much as Reddit seems to desire, they'd do less damage than the mobs. **Then there's Izaro himself** He's an epic design. I doubt anyone can deny that. He looks badass, intimidating and like an Emperor might. The green ghostly creature on his back is a woman carrying scales, which might symbolize the fact that he's always been really cautious with his decisions, yet in the end, it still lead to the downfall, as seen by the Labyrinth's current state. As far as design goes, GGG gets all the kudos here. But design alone doesn't get many points - The fight itself is difficult, for various reasons - For one, he has a lot of HP. Two, depending on his phase, he could do a ton of damage. These two usually don't go well together. Especially not since there's a reward at the end that we have to get. And that's precisely why he gets so much hate. He's difficult, but gives a grand reward that we really want. And that's the issue. We consider ourselves entitled to the Ascendancy, at no cost whatsoever. We want to be rewarded, without investing the effort into beating him. We want to rush in there as soon as possible and finish up the ascendancy buff, without considering the fact that he was designed not to be done so easily. His design is what it is, to make you really consider whether or not you are able to do this content. If you die, the answer is no. I don't hear anyone past level 80 complain about how he's OP. Most people at this point are even farming him, and there's only the occasional 1-shot from prepared characters, and they're running around in Tabula's with 3.5K hp and no mitigation. His phases are cool. All of them. The only reason we don't appreciate them, is because we're so used to rushing past everything, to really take the time to enjoy the design, and just how epic this fight could be considered, if it lasted longer. You have to pay attention to this grand threat, while simultaneously dealing with his minions. And they don't all come up at once either. You have the option to take them out one at a time. This is the balanced way to deal with it, to prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. There's nothing wrong with Izaro in my personal opinion, and that is despite my unlucky one-shot 5K HP because of vulnerability and a crit shield charge. I've also died after killing him in the third phase, to his minions. I got greedy with the keys, and ignored them, and got punished as a result. I have yet to find myself able to blame GGG for the Lab in any way, including the traps. **And then, finally, there's the 'grind aspect' of getting the enchantments** This is undoubtedly the worst one for everyone. It's A. a challenge and B. Most people run 100+ times to get the enchantment they desire, because of the grand pool as far as helmet enchantments go. This is however, not mandatory. At all. It's a DPS boost, and we want to get it. If it weren't worth it, we wouldn't run those 100+ times. On top of that, at the end, we get treasure keys, that provide potential loot. It's not like a shitty enchantment's the only reward at the end. Furthermore, pretty much every enchantment has some use to someone(Excluding things like Shield charge damage. Yes, I got that at some point) - Imagine how unfair it would be if they removed some of those, just so you could get your enchantment faster. On top of that, the fact that enchantments are rare, means that you can turn something essentially worthless(Like the Alpha's howl) into a money bank. This is pretty much a guaranteed chance at something valuable, which I'm certain some MMORPG fans feel is lacking in PoE. People in WoW ran hundreds of raids to get properly geared out. The fact that we need to invest some extra time into perfecting our gear shouldn't get this many complaints. The only reason to complain about this, is for the challenge, but even then, they present us with free stuff at the expense of effort, rather than paying 50 bucks for it. "

It is basically a Scion (Deadeye, Occultist) ED poison prolif build utilizing a Bino's and the poison skill gem. It is also CI so that is nice as well. The build uses the duel projectiles from scion with projectile speed and damage to clear very well as well as using the Occultist for the -Chaos Res. The 100% Pierce you get from the Pierce Support Gem and Deadeye class, will actually allow you to get multiple stacks of ED on mobs helping with the regen (if you are running life). **6 Link**- Essence Drain, Controlled Destruction, Pierce, Void Manipulation, Rapid Decay, Poison (but not in that order) **5 Link**- Drop Poison unless you already have a bino's then drop controlled destruction instead **4 Link**- Abyssal Cry, Inc. AOE, Contagion, Faster Casting **4 Link**- Discipline, Clarity, Blasphemy with Temp Chains: in a Alpha's Howl helm (mine cost 20c for those blue rolls). You could also drop clarity and just have two blue if you want to use a mana pot. **3 Link**- Spell totem, Wither, Faster Casting (on shield or dagger) **3 Link**- Whirling Blades, Faster Attacks, Fortify (on shield or dagger: your movement skill) **4 Link**- CWDT, Immortal Call, Contagion, Temp Shield I run a few uniques I think you should pick up. Since you will be running CI: The Sorrow of the Divine is a great flask since it will give you 4% ES regen while on concentrated ground and allows for your Bino's life regen to apply to ES, along with taste of hate, and Atziri's Promise (since we run Ghost Reave as well). I also run Bino's, Alpha's Howl, and Winds of Change gauntlets. Now currently I have not had any problems with clearing on the build. Most of the time with just the Bino's Poison prolif it is enough to clear all mobs after a few casts. You could use the contagion to speed it up but I mostly just use the self cast ED and the occasional Abyssal Cry to clear large mobs fast. **Maps Cleared**: T15 [Colosseum Map, Abyss Map] T14 [Conservatory, Shrine] T13 [Courtyard, Excavation, Waterways] and I have killed Atziri multiple times (haven't tried Uber yet) I am currently Running CI because I was able to craft a decent 6-link Chest however I think Life based would be better because of the way regen from ED works it does not apply to ES. If you want to go life based I have also provided a tree below. If you go life and do not have a six link that is perfectly OK. Drop the Poison support gem off the 6L and add a consuming dark as your other dagger. This will allow your Chaos Damage to Poison and will really help out damage and regen from Bino's. **NOTE:** if you drop CI and opt for life you will be dropping Clarity and picking up another aura of your choice. If I went life I would personally go Heretic's Veil and spec into Dual Curse and run.

But i'd like some input to help out and improve the build, or just kick it into the dust. Whichever.. The idea is this; we go trickster and take Walk the Aether, Ghost Dance and Shade form as the nodes for our 6 points. **Walk The Eather** gives us: *Movement Skills cost no Mana and 20% increased Attack and Cast Speed if you've used a Movement Skill in the past 4 seconds.* **Shade Form** gives us: ""*+500 to Evasion Rating +250 to maximum Energy Shield 20% increased Attack and Cast Speed if Energy Shield Recharge has started in the past 4 seconds 20% more chance to Evade Attacks while not on full Energy Shield*"" So if we use Eldritch Battery and have our ES pool protect our mana, the only time that we will be losing ES is when we are using a non-movement skill, So what we need to do in order to stack the 20% cast and attack speed from Walk the Aether with the 20% from Shade form, is cast blood rage and all of your blade vortex stacks, reducing your ES, Flicker strike into the mob to initiate the 20% increase from Walk the Aether. By the time you flicker once or twice, your ES should start to replenish, so you get the 20% cast and atk speed from Shade Form. Now you have 40% more atk and cast speed, and you can either fast stack more Blade vortex, or continue to flicker at ultra speed. You need to time your Flickers + blade vortex refreshes to upkeep the atk and cast speed buffs. But once you get the timing down right, it could be pretty consistent dps. **Required Gear:** * [**Crown of Eyes**](URL - To boost our damage with Flicker strike, and to help with more ES for Eldritch Battery. * [**Hyrri's Ire**](URL for spell and melee dodge. * [**Cybil's paw**](URL for the great life per hit with a fully stacked Blade Vortex. * [**Doedre's Damning Paua Ring**](URL for the extra curse. (Enfeeble + Vulnerability) * **For Damage**, we use Crown of eyes, which has the unique characteristic of making the increases and reductions to spell damage also apply to attacks. This means our Flicker strike will actually hit for some sort of decent damage. Not fantastic or ground breaking, but better than nothing. Then we use **Blade vortex**, linked to **Spell echo** + **poison** + **Increased Duration** + **Faster casting** and something else. You can slot **increased aoe or concentrated effect**, whichever you prefer. Since you will always be in melee range thanks to flicker strike, Concentrated effect should be a good gem here. But I have never had a 6 link, so i'm not sure. For a curse, we run **Vulnerability**, which is great, because it boosts the damage that our DoTs from the poison gem do, as well as direct damage. In addition to this, we can run **Herald of ash** for an additional free 15% physical damage as fire. Since Blade vortex and flicker are both physical attacks, we stack as much as possible of this in the tree, so it becomes a decent little boost. (If you have a level 4 enlighten, you could run a 3rd curse instead of HoA, by getting a corrupted amulet, or taking Whispers of doom on the tree and sacrificing points elsewhere) * **For defense**, we take **Acrobatics**, **Acrobatics Improvement**, **Phase acrobatics** for 40% chance to dodge attacks and 30% chance to dodge spell damage. Using Hyrri's Ire, we get another 10% chance for each, and when we take Ghost dance (since we have to take it to get to Shade form) we get an additional 5% to each. Leaving us with a total of 55% chance to dodge attacks, and 45% chance to dodge spell damage. It's not too bad. Using Blasphemy and doedre's we can use **Enfeeble** as a second curse which will reduce incoming enemy damage for when we actually do get hit. [***Full Build***](URL I feel like this tree really lacks life%, and will end up being 1-shot city when we get hit by anything remotely tough, so I seriously doubt it could be a viable HC build. But for SC it should be ok. There are close nodes with Life and Mana, but mana is 100% useless, since we reserve 95% of it and use EB, so I don't like taking those. Edit: ogod wall of text. sorry. "

I would love to do some math with you guys, because i started to realize some things about damage over time: 1 - Physical damage attacks can apply all the major DoT's in the game: poison, bleed and ignite. The most obvious way would be puncture linked with poison while using herald of ash, but there are other ways. 2 - There are ""more"" modifiers in the game that double dip this DoT application total damage. One of them is vulnerability. Another obvious one is the frenzy charge. 3 - There are ""increase"" modifiers that double dip as well. ""increase Physical damage"" increases both the bleed and the initial hit. ""increase chaos damage"" increases both the poison and the initial chaos hit. Projectile damage does the very same thing and applies to all the damage dealt by the projectile. What do you think? Could a build that focuses on double dipping physical attack damage and DoT be viable on ascendancy? Bow Assassin seems to be a really good candidate for this. "

I have a tree and gear in mind but I'm worried about survivability in higher tier maps. The plan for this build is to utilize the life regen from bino's with zealot's oath in conjunction with three curses on blasphemy (temp chains, enfeeble, vulnerability), energy shield recharge from wicked ward and arctic armour to stay alive. The final tree would look something like this (copy in offline tree planer): URL This tree is for level 97 which I probably won't reach but skipping some damage nodes shouldn't be a problem. There are seven jewel slots, one of which would have to be filled with conqueror's efficiency, the rest with damage/es. If my calculations are correct, reaching at least 8k ES with decent gear and jewels should be pretty easy. Planned gear and links: Helmet: rare Shield: rare Weapon: Bino's Chest: Shav's Amulet: rare, ideally with +1 curse or Eye of Chayula if stun becomes an issue Belt/boots/gloves: rare Rings: Doedre's damning (if no +1 curse amulet) + rare unset ring (golem) Links: * 6L essence drain | controlled destruction | void manipulation | rapid decay | poison | empower * 4L blasphemy | enfeeble | temp chains | vuln * 4L abyssal cry | contagion | inc AOE | faster casting * 4L discipline | AA | blood magic | vaal discipline * 3L wither | faster casting | spell totem * 3L whirling blades | faster attacks | fortify * Golem in ring Now for the questions: 1) Obviously there is no leech on this build. So... is the regen from Bino's (if it doesn't get nerfed too much) + uninterruptable ES recharge from wicked ward + curses + AA + vaal discipline + defensive flasks enough to stay alive in high tier maps? Wicked Ward obviously synergizes with not getting hit but it will be hard for me to get evasion from gear. Maybe some evasion + ES pieces with a Jade Flask of reflexes + Stibnitz flask + enfeeble could be enough to reliably evade hits. I also get 70% increased evasion from the tree (yay). 2) The tree: The pathing looks weird but I believe this is the most efficient way to get all the stuff I need. I'm not sure about Essence Surge, I only tried it in the awakening beta and had the feeling that it sucked. It synergizes well with Wicked Ward so I feel like not taking it is a wasted opportunity. Does anyone have experiences with builds that use this notable? 3) Mana sustain: With some mana from gear I should have around 180-200 unreserved mana, not exactly a lot. I have seen videos of ED characters with only slightly above 100 mana unreserved so I guess this won't be too much of a problem.

540,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Discussion]How good is ES/Evasion? Aka my talisman league post mortem,82,46nnte,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/46nnte/discussionhow_good_is_esevasion_aka_my_talisman/,2016-02-20 11:17:02,"**Intro** Greeting exiles. I'm Miragent, and i'm playing PoE since the closed beta. My favourite class is the Shadow. As you know he is aligned with dexterity and intelligence, making evasion and energy shield his most thematic defences. Years ago, when i made my first Shadow, i was really into the energy shield mechanic. ""Look at this, it protects my life pool! So cool! Ok so Energy Shield replenishes itself when i'm not taking damage. Oh, and evasion makes me evade damage. That is perfect!"" So, as you can image, i geared him with all the hybrid stuff i could find until i realize... The setup sucked. Big time. Es recovery started after 6 seconds of not taking ANY DAMAGE. That was too much for evasion alone to handle, as you cannot evade spells, and cannot avoid attacks consistently for 6 freaking seconds in row. ""Ok, ok no big deal, Chaos Inoculation, Zealoth's Oath, Eldrich Battery and Ghost Reaver all make good use of ES, i'll just build around these keystones to make evasion/ES work!"". Well i did and... let's just say i was heavily disappointed. ZO, CI and GR felt like my ES was just a big life pool, removing the uniqueness of the mechanic almost entirely, and eldrich battery... was LITERALLY removing the es mechanic from the UI by turning it into mana. So what i did? I went pure evasion. And i eventually switched all of my builds to ranger, because her evasion starting nodes were better. Depressing. **The big change** Years passed. The game had a massive revamp during 2.0 Awakening. One of its main targets was the ES mechanic. The patch notes said: ""Energy shield will now regenerate naturally after the character has not taken any damage for 2 seconds"". TWO SECONDS? ""If it's 2 seconds i can do that. Without ZO, GR and all that crap. I can stop damage for two seconds. After that, my massive ES pool will recharge and i will be fine. 33% of 6k is 2k. That's like 3 seething life potions per second. It's defintely a viable alternative"". I started to theorycraft something, but i could not play much because i had to study really hard during the awakening leagues. (College sucks sometimes) **Talisman begins** December 2015, i did my last exams and talisman league came out. My Eva/ES crusade started on HC. I went contagion/essence drain. I took the chaos damage nodes near the shadow and, conveniently, they provided me with a good amount of chaos resistance. In order make my ""two seconds of vulnerability"" pass quicker and safer here's what i did: a) i grabbed the ""faster charge of es recovery"" node in the tree and equipped the unique dagger Heartbreaker. b) i set up a blasphemy + temp chains aura to make enemies cast and attack slower. c) i used the grace aura d) i equipped an es shield and paired it with a Stone Of Lahzwhar unique amulet to block attacks and some spells. I also took the spell block nodes near the witch start. Spell block was mandatory since evasion only affects attacks. e) i used a chaos golem all the time to try and intercept some of the non-piercing projectiles aimed at me. f) i used whirling blades as my last resort to zoom out of any dire situation and let my shield regen back to full g)last, i equipped a remove burning flask and a remove bleeding flask. Degens are dangerous for ES recharge. Everything was working in a perfect harmony. I was level 70, with 5k energy shield, 50% chance to evade and 25% block and spellblock, and there was no way my temp-chained enemies could pass my golem and burst me down in a 1.6 seconds time frame. The build was working. I rapidly farmed currency. I bought myself a pair of rainbowstrides and a rumi's concoction. With rumi's up. i capped my spellblock. A 5 link came along. Turns out Essence Drain links are PERFECT for an eva/ES chestpiece. 2 Blue, 3 green. 2 chromatic orbs and i was done. While i was farming i noticed two things. First, i was dodging stunlocks. AKA i was not taking consecutive amounts of big damage in a short period of time. Time was my ally. I had all the time in the world to recover between big hits. Second, between my skill tree, jewels and gear i had a decent amount of chaos resistance. I started to notice that in ""enemies poison on hit"" maps, i was taking zero damage even from chaos snakes. ""Well, screw this"", i said, ""i'm going low life with no shavronne"". I bought a lori's lantern in addition to a pair of gloves to get more than 50% chaos resistance for a grand total of 3c, i specced out of my life nodes into Pain Attunement and i activated the discipline aura on blood magic. I also had vaal discipline ready on a spare socket. Essence drain tooltip damage skyrocketed. Things where dying so fast that they could not hit me, even in t11 maps. Energy shield went to 6k. Then, with better and better gear, to 7k. After i got a six link i did every single thing in the game, with the few exception being Uber Atziri, Uber Kaom, Uber Daresso (resolute tecnique lmao) and Uber Malachai. I was so tanky that eventually i replaced my Heartbreaker with a Redbeak and i specced out my faster start of es recharge nodes because 2 seconds were more than enough. **Conclusion** Then, at level 88, i was killed by the only thing that could kill my character. My own stupidity. Remember when i said that degen effect are dangerous? I was chatting with my brother and was not paying too much attention on what was happening on the screen. I found myself standing right on top of a bonespire with the rumi flask up. Rumi's effect ended shortly after i whirl'd away from the danger, but the degen killed me instantly. Had zero time to react. I deserved that death. Now, why am i sharing this wall of text with this subreddit you might ask? Well, not because i want to rant about my death (fk bonespire), but because playing a pure eva/es character was the most fun i had in Path Of Exile since the closed beta. And with ascendancy around the corner, maybe i can ~~bonespire~~ inspire some of you into trying the true way of the Shadow! Also if any of you had an experience similar to mine, feel free to share it. How good do you think Eva/Es will be in the ascendancy expansion? **tl;dr i played an eva/es lowlife shadow on a fair budget with no shavronne/lorica/GR/ZO based on pure energy shield recovery on talisman HC and i had a blast!** EDIT: Formatting"

543,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Build Theory] Heartbound Loop,4,3ypbtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3ypbtd/build_theory_heartbound_loop/,2015-12-30 08:43:40,"So I found a Heartbound Loop in Warbands, and was immediately intrigued by the possibilities it possessed. I saw several build ideas surface and quickly die away as people toyed with it. [Here](URL is my skill tree I've come up with. I am an avid Righteous Fire player, and so I looked to my experience to come up with this build. As such, it is very Life- and Regen-heavy to combat the 350 damage per Heartbound proc. We need as many skill points as we can get, so ideally you'd help Eramir in all difficulties, but you might choose to instead help Oak in Merciless for another Endurance Charge. with 11.7% regen per second, you'd need about 3200 life to counteract one Heartbound proc each second. With 231% increased life, I'd imagine we'd easily have about 5000 life with decent gear; alongside 170% increased armor, and Perpetual Granite flask, our tankiness should be fairly hefty. We've taken the ""Life Regeneration per Endurance Charge"" node as well as 3 Endurance Charges from the tree; decide for yourself whether or not you wish to take the 7th Endurance Charge from Oak in Merciless. For your Chest Armor I recommend one of either Carcass Jack, Belly of the Beast, or Kingsguard. Obviously, we'll have to play around with our links. Not everyone has the same taste, so I'll leave the decisions to you for element specialization - the skill tree is ambiguous. If you opt in for Fire damage, there's a wheel near Templar that also gives an additional 1% life regen that might entice you. I haven't decided what skills to use, entirely. I've been giving some thought to a Whispering Ice staff - free 7-link, utility and so on. The tree will need to change to allow for more INT if we go this route, but Whispering Ice =&gt; CWDT =&gt; Increased AoE =&gt; Spell Echo =&gt; Curse on Hit =&gt; Warlords' Mark =&gt; Enfeeble/Temp. Chains/Vulnerability sounds like it'd be pretty sweet. Ideally you'd have Additional Curse Vaal'd on your Heartbound Loop for this, but you could also get up to Whispers of Doom. Giving up some Life and a shield for the freeze and curse combo might be well worth it. The only mandatory links for us would be a three link Lv. 1 CWDT-Lv. 1 Summon Skeletons-Lv. 20+20% Less Duration. If you put this in your gloves as a 3-link, the single link should be a regular Lv. 1 Summon Skeletons. Ideally, you'd have two 20% reduced duration Army of Bones Unique Jewels, which would put your CWDT-linked skeletons at a 99% reduced duration, if my understanding of that interaction is correct - which would allow for a near-instant double Heartbound proc. If you have a Level 20 CWDT you require 3 sets of skeletons to die to proc any spells linked to it. Aside from Molten Shell, I really don't know which spells to use. I think AoE spells would be best, but we've only a sad few to choose from. Any suggestions would be most welcome! --Blade"

Over Xmas vacation, I decided to just grind up my Scion (now 88) So, I'm going to take this time to share some thoughts, in no given order. On trading: Is it me, or has PoE essentially repeated the same mistakes of Diablo III in the beginning, which prompted Blizzard to disable all trading? Namely, in balancing all of the drops around PoE.trade/acquisition? Essentially, while they don't want the wealthiest players suddenly making it rain and creating obscene wealth, IMO, it's definitely a bit of a mistake to balance casual player A's drops around top-tier player B's item flipping, stream-gifted uber map clearing with MF character's abilities. Because I believe that as /u/ZiggyDStarcraft recently said (or was it Yoji, or /u/Mathils ), that good players will find a way to amass obscene wealth anyway, but that it'll be other players that get hurt. Right now, looting definitely isn't as fun as it was in Diablo 2--for several reasons. 1) You can't *do* anything with a junk item besides vendor it. For instance, in Diablo 2, you had the crafting recipes. Anyone remember these? URL In PoE, if something's junk, it's vendor trash, or maybe chaos spam material. 2) There's no real place to ""stop"" gearing a character besides having absolutely obscene gear. In Diablo 2, we had the character-specific set items which would allow someone to compromise between casual trashcan MF character and ""I solo uber tristram with my eyes closed"" GG runewords (aside: fuck enigma. That ONE runeword was when Diablo 2 jumped the shark--when Blizz said ""fuck it"" and homogenized everything that made gear more important than characters). In PoE, we really have very few affordable options. I think there's a Rigwald sword and axe that's basically the first ever true ""set"" in PoE. While GGG has stated that they're against set items because they stop character progression, but...doesn't that happen anyway, unless someone is so obscenely wealthy that they can craft the top end GTFO GG gear? 3) That the dopamine release system of ""OMFG ASDF I FOUND AN X"" (E.G. vampiric Gaze, windforce, grandfather, skullder's Ire, Tal Rasha's armor, Windripper, Voltaxic, Consuming Dark, Lightning Coil, etc.) for any individual player is balanced around said player instead spending a zillion hours farming dried lake and then buying said amazing item off the auction house. I mean, ahem, PoE.trade. Let's get serious. The reason Diablo III initially was very poorly received was exactly this reason--that the auction house became a tumor on the game, leading Blizzard to remove trading completely and replace it with Loot 2.0. Yet, isn't PoE.Trade + acquisition essentially doing the same EXACT thing--which is to cause every single player's individual experience--whether they're a hardcore 20-tab stash acquisition/poe.trade flipper, or your friend you're just trying to introduce to the game, to have the same exact miserable experience of the actual act of killing monsters to find loot. In my own personal case, I've self-found everything but my dagger and shield on my current EK character (who performs far from expectations as I can only hit 25k tooltip at level 88 before 6 frenzy charges which bump it up to a paltry 35k, a far cry from the 100k advertised, which I now realize was a result of a 6L with a +1 to gems Tabula and a level 3 empower in that sixth slot), INCLUDING a lightning coil that I 5-linked myself. So yes, I luckered into one of the best items in this game outside of Voll's or the new omfg-seriously-GGG-why-did-you-even-make-them obscene /u/skyforth boots. However, the road to actually SIX-linking the item is such an obscene slog. It was tough enough to amass 150 fusings. But TEN TIMES AS MANY? And level up Vorici to 7 with his ""can't kill a single guard"" missions? REALLY? 4) Also, remember the hybrid mods that got removed from master crafting? You know, like the +% damage/+ accuracy from Tora/Vagan, and I'm assuming the +%spells/+mana from Catarina? Bring them back, however, make one small change: items with more than one master mod can't be traded. That way, people can still pay for an Elreon service, but as soon as they craft that multimod item, it's stuck on their account, not flip bait. That way, individual players can still get their endgame item without worrying about messing up the economy. Also, implement more set items. The Rigwald axe+sword combo is a start, I suppose, but there needs to be far more. Furthermore, given that we now have A: currency, B: jewels and C: gems, I think it's high time we got something like the good old Diablo 2 blood/hit power/caster/safety crafting system. That is (and just spouting hypothetical stuff here): Rare bow + 2 chaos orbs + 2 green skill gems + rare jewel = rare bow with guaranteed tier 3 damage + accuracy mod, + critical strike chance mod and any other random mods. Sometimes, you brick it, sometimes you get something you can throw a master craft on and be happy with. Etc. Simply, it'll be a vast improvement over ""welp, got a rare, time to chaos spam it"". Next, on the topic of defenses: Tons of HP (or ES, but ES builds are definitely more expensive than stacking life nodes) still mandatory or you'll get blown up by something. On the topic of lightning coil: isn't it sad and pathetic that one of the most sought-after pieces of armor is basically a worse version of Diablo 2's Shaftstop? (see pic: URL ) In Diablo 2, shaftstop was an economy-class, middling mid-tier item on your way to much greater things (runeword armors like Chains of Honor/Enigma/Fortitude, character-specific sets, etc.). In Path of Exile, this VERY SAME ITEM with a massive drawback is now omfg BiS. Why is this the case? It's not because shaftstop was sleeper OP in Diablo 2--but because In PoE, unless you have some amazing ES setup going, there is basically NO defense against big physical smashes. Armor, BY ITS VERY DESIGN, falls off (damage taken = DMG * 1-armor/(armor + DMG * 10), while evasion does absolutely NOTHING when the big hit comes through. Now, here's the thing about evasion: in theory, it's good design, since in the long run, you'll mitigate your evasion percentage proportion of damage. However, in order for such a system to actually be meaningful, it has to actually SURVIVE to see the long run. PoE's lategame content is dominated by the exact opposite--such that if even a SINGLE hit goes through, you're screwed. To that extent, ANY mechanic which can reliably mitigate the ""PAIN TRAIN COMING THROUGH CHOO CHOO"" is automatically BiS if it doesn't brick the rest of the build--not because it's amazing, per se--in fact, lightning coil mitigates only 22.5% of incoming physical damage given 75% lightning resistance--but because it's the ONLY thing that can. The people that are saying Lightning Coil/Taste of Hate are broken have it ass backwards IMO. It isn't that they're ""too good"". It's that % damage reduction is the ONLY reliable way of mitigating the monster physical damage that comes through, whether it is through physical spells (which evasion does jack shit about), whether it's resolute technique (lulz, nice evasion you got there? Mind if I skip that roll?), or whether it's vulnerability + a hit (a hit from anything the size of your character or bigger, really). So basically, the only real reliable defenses are: endurance charges, arctic armor, lightning coil, and taste of hate. Which, of course, aren't really found on the tree--AT ALL. Solution for this, as /u/ZiggyDStarcraft mentioned on his podcast: a sort of deflection mechanism for evasion. I'd argue that it should be put beyond phase acrobatics. In fact, IMO, the whole acrobatics cluster should be changed and simplified into 30% dodge + drawbacks, 10% dodge, phase acrobatics, and deflection beyond that. Here's my idea for deflection: Deflection--a third keystone beyond phase acrobatics: Reduce all incoming damage by 30% of your total remaining proportion of energy shield and life. (That is, if at full life + ES, reduce 30% of all incoming damage. If at half health, reduce by 15%, etc.) In other words, it does exactly what it should and no more--defends you from the occasional burst of spike damage, but if you play recklessly, it won't do you much good. Also, regarding the keystones... I really have a bone to pick with the added drawbacks of some of the keystones. Namely, that some of them shouldn't even HAVE the drawbacks they do. For instance: why does unwavering stance even need a ""you can't evade attacks"" clause? Given its location on the tree, the only people branching down there aren't going to have a lot of evasion anyway. Regarding acrobatics: all of the good armor improvement nodes are on the bottom left side of the tree. Acrobatics is about as far from there as you can possibly be. IMO, acrobatics doesn't even need any of its drawbacks, really. Shield blocking has gotten hosed across the board such that it takes a herculean effort to even REACH max block without Rumi's, and it shouldn't have an ES drawback EITHER because the Shadow is theoretically supposed to be the ES + evasion character, and acrobatics + phase acrobatics arguably does more in terms of defense for rangers than the nonsense that is evasion itself. Eldritch battery: is it really worth another 11? 15? points just to reserve your whole mana orb instead of just 90% of it? Arrow dancing: does ANYONE still take this node? I mean it was obvious that any evasion ranger took it--as they *should* because of A) proximity and B) the fact that they were already using the least reliable defense to begin with. But now, well, if you take it and something gap-closes on you, you're in deep trouble. Unwavering stance: again, does it REALLY need to do away with all evasion? Do any eva characters even get this keystone? Seems silly. I'm sure other examples exist, though some have their drawbacks by necessity (E.G. blood magic has to remove your mana so it doesn't become a free reservation orb). Aside from that, I suppose I'll share thoughts on Talismans... Good idea, horrid execution, could have been fixed so easily. Just roll whatever rarity as originally, then up the rarity to one more. Also, require four instead of five. Also, allow for the same bases. These are all QoL issues. On Act 4 itself: IMO, it's really lacking. Dried Lake is decent, and Daresso's dream is all sorts of amazing (aside from the Daresso fight itself, which is just ""throw the occasional spell in his general direction, then run like a sissy!""). But beyond Daresso's dream, it's just really uninspired. You have all of these legendary lore characters with multiple uniques in the game named after them reduced to generic villains. Kaom, the incredible legendary badass that he was, has been reduced to a delusional train wreck that you have to put out of your misery. Shavronne, Maligaro, and Doedre--important lore characters with multiple uniques named after them--are forgettable sub-bosses with one line of dialogue. Malachai himself--architect of every bad thing that happened on Wraeclast since the eternal empire itself? Just a big black deformed monster deep inside a vagina spouting nonsense. How did this well-spoken, sophisticated sorcerer turn into a Saturday morning cartoon villain (albeit one that hits like a freight train)? On mobility skills: Whirling blades + faster attacks + fortify is just head and shoulders better than any other mobility skill there is. Blink arrow is a joke that can't get you out of dangerous situations. A lightning warp setup? Apparently even WITH faster casting and some from the tree, you're still talking about half a second of waiting around instead of the instant jump you get from whirling blades. Flame dash? WHY DOES IT HAVE A COOLDOWN YOU PUTZES? Like, there's simply no justification for it at all! It *SHOULD* have been a whirling blades that'd be able to jump terrain, but instead, it's complete nonsense because after three short hops you're simply stuck without your mobility. It makes no sense in terms of how bad it is. Leap slam: not sure how it compares to the other four. However, the bar seems to be set very low by anything not named whirling blades. Some requests going forward that I think would really improve things from a quality of life perspective: A) Bring back the hybrid master crafting mods. B) Bring back the chaos pricing on meta-mods. That they're denominated in exalts have ballooned the chaos:exalt ratio from when it was 30 once upon a time to 70 (holy shit). C) Address evasion's shortcomings--namely, why do its keystones have such massive drawbacks that only a pure evasion build can use them? D) Provide support for eva + ES. Acrobatics cutting energy shield in half = WTF? E) Provide a Diablo 2-like crafting recipes. Once again: an analogy to the blood/caster/hit power/safety items would be absolutely terrific. Okay, that's all I got for now."

Each poison effect remains present on the target dealing chaos damage over time until it runs its course.[3] There is no limit to the number of poison stacks an enemy can have.* Poison support gem does 10% phys, 10% chaos.

My plan for the upcoming Talisman league is to make a Contagion/Essence Drain Build while using the array of slowing abilities and curses as my defences. A lot of inspiration was taken from /u/dmillz89 who has a really great write-up of his build. I, in no way, take credit for any of the idea's in this build. most of them are well known or are ideas of others in the community. I'd love to get any feedback I can from you all and if you have any questions feel free to ask. This is probably riddled with spelling errors, my grammar is pretty poor. **Overview/Plan** I will be using Animate guardian with a ""Dying Breath"" and ""Leer Cast"" for the curse effectiveness and increased damage. It will also provide a slight distraction for some mobs. Wither will be linked to spell totem to make the killing process more automated. again, this will provide a slight distraction to some enemies also. Abyssal Cry + Wither + Temporal Chains (Along with the curse effectiveness) Should result in most enemies being unable to reach me. However if them do manage to crawl their way to me Enfeeble will be there to decrease the damage of any hit taken. Abyssal Cry will also have the secondary effect of creating a chain reaction once the mob that was initially hit with essence drain dies. Because this damage is also a percentage of the mobs maximum health, this should scale well into higher content. **Playstyle** Pretty simple here. 1: Whirling blades towards a pack. 2: Place Wither Totem down and Abyssal Cry to slow enemies down 3: Essence Drain a single mob and Cast Contagion at the pack. **Tree** URL The focus of my tree is: Mid-high life, Curse effectiveness, Skill duration and finally Chaos/Spell damage and DoT. With the changes to AoE, I don't feel that nodes such as 'Amplify' and 'Blast Radius' are necessary and the points would be better invested elsewhere. I have taken a single ""Minion Life Regen"" node to help keep my animate guardian alive. The 5 jewel sockets will be socketed with rare jewels with Health and Chaos damage ideally. I don't think there are any rare jewels that would benefit this build too much I don't ever intend to get to lvl100 so I feel i'll only ever get up to 110 points on the tree. **Gems** Essence Drain + Controlled Destruction + Void Manipulation + Rapid Decay + Empower/Slower Projectiles/Other? *Not too sure what to put as the 5th link or even 6th link. Will likely be empower if I can get my hands on a leveled gem* Contagion + Controlled Destruction + Void Manipulation + Rapid Decay Blasphemy + Enfeeble + Temporal Chains + Vulnerability Spell Totem + Wither + Faster Casting + Increased Duration Animate Guardian + Minion Life + Fortify Whirling Blades + Fortify + Faster Attacks OR Abyssal Cry + increased AoE + Conc Effect? *The final set of gems depends on which I find more effective. The other will simply have the base gem ""Abyssal Cry/Whirling Blades"" in a rare unset ring* **Gear** To keep things mostly cheap, the only unique item I will be using is Doedre's Damning I will be gearing my Animate Guardian with a Leer Cast, Dying Breath, Zahndethus' Cassock, Southbound Soldier and then Rare gear to max out it's resist's.

I can self cast one curse to free 25% mana for either Hatred or AA+Herald I realize we don't have all the information yet, and that it still might be worse than just going crit with elemental supports, but I would like to explore the new mechanics GGG has given us and believe that BV is a prime candidate to do so.

No blood magic on tree, or gear, so that frees me up to use 2-3 reservations (eg blasphemy + hatred) and an extra support gem.

First, there are a few key areas I wanted to path to: * Bone Breaker/Skull Cracking Wheel for Stun Threshold (18%) * Stun Mastery Wheel for Stun Threshold (15%) * Master of the Arena (+2 Weapon Range) should be helpful in actually hitting things and increasing AoE size for melee splash - correct me if I'm wrong * The new Mana/Life Leech crab wheel.

Perferably with Stun Threshold Reduction on it. * Blasphemy + Vulnerability (more phys damage). * Or, perhaps Blasphemy + Warlord's Mark for the stun chance, free ECs and leech. Possibly situational. * Belt with Stun Threshold will be extremely strong. Stun Duration hopefully not needed, as it only gives at max roll (35%) an additional ~100ms of stun. 95% from tree + 20-40% from weapon should be enough for the majority of content. * Normal type of equipment with high life, armour and resists. Accessories with phys damage probably? Perhaps one Ming's Heart to help DPS + cap chaos resists? Anyone's ideas or questions welcome!"

I skipped a lot of the increased defenses from shield nodes because I think the plan with the build would be to use Broken Faith. However since this is a melee build, that is definitely subject to change. The core of the skill gems would look something like this Viper strike - Melee Splash - Void Manipulation - Multistrike After those the choices are less obvious, rapid decay, added chaos damage, melee physical maybe, I dunno.

I would love to hear your ideas if you dont agree with some of my assumptions! * Contagion and Essence drain will to almost certainty both deal damage to the same target, as all other chaos skills currently can do this. They will however not stack towards for instance 2 contagions that you cast both dealing damage to the same target. * The way you deal with singletargets is by using wither + echo + faster casting + inc duration. This setup with wither (0,25cast speed, or 4 casts per second) can easily make you cast 10 withers per second when standing still spamming. Base duration is 2sec so with +inc duration you will get a duration of about 3,2 second. This means that if you stay still spamming wither the target can reasonably get 30 stacks on him 30*10 = 300. 300% increased chaos damage taken, this means tooltip *4 * This would mean that the target would end up taking your tooltip dps * 4 as chaos damage per second while also being slowed 30% for wither. This to me is the way to scale singletarget dps on the new chaos skills and maybe also on ""caustic arrow"". * Temporal Chains is very desirable for survivability since you are not freezing or stunning by attacking * The way this build will be played is simular to a manual cursing spell caster. First you cast contagion &amp; essence drain (instead of first manually cursing). Then you will cast(read spam) wither ( instead of your mainspell). I imagine using blashpemy with vulnerability will be standard on this build since there are no good auras too boost chaos damage. * IF this ends up being the way this is played there might be some high mana requirements from spamming wither constantly. Links for playing Contagion or Essence Drain will most likely be: * Contagion or Essence Drain * Controlled Destruction * Void Manipulation * Rapid Decay * Empower (level 3) * Conc, Aoe, Iron Will (since tree allready has 330% total damage i dont think iron will is going to be good) Skill tree, requires copy/paste into offline skill calc: * URL Hope for a nice debate/discussion"

These are all theoretical general remarks but would appreciate any help to improve (or crush) my build. 1) Class starting choice and pathing Scion because life wheel and duration nodes. Fatal Toxins as obligatory node with Damage over Time nodes as high priority. For the pathing itself: focus on life, cast speed, spell damage in the shadow/witch part of the tree. Perhaps an Life/ES hybrid build would fit here? Could focus on crit but then the build itself would be really late game. Could go mine passives since the clusters are close by so the route is optimal. 3) Spell choice: Fireball, Fire Nova Mine, Firestorm, Flameblast. Firestorm would be the easiest to inflict multiple stacks, however, the base damage of every hit is rather low. Fireball with the new threshold jewel might make spreading poisons with overlapping AoEs efficient. The new buffs to mines and the relative good aoe and base of fire damage might make Fire Nova Mine an interesting choice for this build. The mine passive on the tree are also close to chaos/poison nodes. The only problem is the clunky mine gameplay. Flameblast might work by getting high as possible initial hit + stacking skill effect duration to focus on one powerful poison hit. 4) Itemization Obviously Consuming Dark. With Infernal Mantle it's possible to achieve 100% chaos damage conversion, however, I dislike the defensive drawback it provides (unless playing blood magic which would be just too crazy). Other gear pieces would be generic offensive and defensive stats. Might be forced to go dual daggers to get decent damage. 5) Supporting skills Curse, choosing between: Temp chains (longer poison duration + defensive aspect), vulnerability (more poison damage), Wither (increased chaos damage - although seems rather weak) Auras, choosing between: Anger, Clarity, Haste, maybe Disciple (if hybrid build). Whirling blades with fortify (because why not) 6) Support gems Too early to tell if the new gems: void manipulation and rapid decay would be beneficial here. Perhaps more generic spell support gems (i.e. faster caster/echo) would be better. Controlled destruction might be interesting to scale the poison damage with as big hits as possible. Again, pure theory. Not even sure if it would end up being viable. But I am willing to give it a shot for science. Any help is welcome."

The extra gems slots that you don't path right next to would be the last things you pick up, preceded by some of the damage nodes. I am aware that Vaal Pact makes the regen portion of Enduring Cry worthless, but it's there for the Endurance Charges, not the regen. Personally the first build seems a bit stronger to me, mostly because it gets a bit more Block as well as damage. Additionally, because the Claw Wheel gets so much Increased Leech per Second Vaal Pact might not even be necessary. That's part of why I am asking. Ready... GO! Tear this build apart! Please."

The poison will deal 20% of the physical and chaos damage of the attack over 2 seconds. The poison dot will be increased by increased chaos damage, damage over time, and increased poison damage. An attack build that picks up the new hybrid phys/poison nodes will get 86% chaos + 100% poison + 46% poison gem (wild guess, could be lower or higher). Which makes the poison deal around 66% of attack damage over 2 seconds. So at that point the Poison gem is a 1.66 multiplier which is very high for a support. It does cost a few nodes though. If we use vulnerability(assuming its multiplicative) we get a much higher intial hit and also a much higher poison dot. Poison will now deal 120% of the initial hit or 186% if we factor in the more damage from the initial hit since it double dips. On top of this we can add 7 frenzy charges which pushes the value to 238%. But this assumes we are not running hatred or added fire or any other elemental scaling, rather focusing on pure phys damage + poison. So the question is, do you think it will be worth the investment for skills like Cyclone, Bladefall, Blade Vortex? Viper Strike will be insane for bosses I think. Base 80% over 8 seconds.

I have passives that enhances its damage but still it doesn't really get to 80% over 8 seconds which it should do standard. Rather it seems to do 10% over 8 seconds or so. Also it seems that I do less damage against things with it with +% elemental resistance modifiers (I'm not sure if chaos also includes this otherwise that would explain it otherwise it's another bugg). It ignores vulnerability curse extra +% physical damage, however the dot seems to get stronger if I use vulnerability. I noticed more increase in damage with the dot just using vulnerability than from the 125% poison damage nodes. It is very obvious to me that there are some pretty huge buggs affecting the rework on this skill and I hope there will be a quick fix for it soon.

Anyway, my question is this: with things like Doomsower and Herald of Ash and eventually Added Fire Damage adding so much extra fire damage on top of the 50/60% phys-&gt;fire conversion of IB/MS, it should be more beneficial to use Flammability instead of Vulnerablilty, right? Since the curses scale the damage they take, not the damage you deal, they are applied after all conversions and increases.

Playing ES/EVA Shadow. (SC) ----- **Leveling (Normal)** - It was a bit clunky at first. But once you figure out the basics, it starts to melt large packs. Cast contagion first and then try to aim ED at a low health* affected mob. I put wither + spell totem + faster casting, but rarely used it. I finished normal with a blue level 5 weapon/shield that literallly did nothing for my build. They just happened to have decent sockets and I never found anything better. *The biggest frustration with Contagion+ED is casting contagion, then hitting a rare mob with your ED. The rare mob doesn't die right away, so the DoT doesn't spread. Or the mob you aim at dies before the ED hits it and your ED misses the pack or hits one of the mobs in the back that doesn't have Contagion on them yet. There are definitely early game skills that can clear faster.. but there is no doubt this is viable for SC/HC. **Leveling (Cruel &amp; Merciless)** - Fun and fast. You start putting all of your damage supports (Void Manipulation, Controlled Destruction, Rapid Decay) on ED. Contagion I used AoE + Faster casting, but could probably use damage supports in place of the faster casting. Then use blasphemy + Vulnerability. Now everything is dead. **Maps** - I just started T1/T2 blue maps and not having any issue at all. Some layouts and mob types are simpler than others.. but really it's pretty simple. The challenge is to fight the temptation to go for massive kills by casting contagion + ED then running through the pack trying to draw more mobs close. I've managed to kill 100+ mobs spread over several screens with one single cast of Contagion+ED. Once I link increased duration I'll try to clear a map with as few casts as possible. **Build** [*Passive tree @ 70ish*](URL Note this is (SC) .. I went north first. Generally alternating between a life cluster then a damage cluster. I just got to the Scion life wheel as I got to A4 Merci. I died a few times to just being dumb and at least two-three times for being just plain undergeared / too squishy. I've been tinkering around with Abyssal Cry too. It feels GREAT.. but I think it's mostly unnecessary. With Contagion + ED everything dies silently. Casting Abyssal cry makes an enemy that was going to die anyway die with a much louder animation and really gives the build a powerful feel. **Equipment** I've gone back and forth between dual wands and dual daggers. I prefer whirling blades over flame dash, so I like daggers. I [found one of thse](URL and might just buy another and dual wield the set until I find dual wands with 70+ spell damage + cast speed + mana regen. Otherwise, it's just life and resistances across the board. Aside from the Chaos talisman and spell damage, there aren't many ways to to boost damage. I do have chaos gems +1 in the dagger with contagion. (but ED is the real damage dealer) ----- Overall - I really enjoy the build. At this point, I feel like I'm not going to find much more damage other than ED leveling up -- which might be plenty. Also, I killed level 60 Rigwald with it pretty easily."

Vaal Grace is like Rumi's on steroids when high enough level, and lasts a long time. * CWDT - Tempest Shield - Chain - Blind (if you have the space for a 4 link) Enfeeble with the 2 curse clusters i use goes up to almost 40% less damage from enemies, that's insane combined with the fact that when you're standing still and casting BV, AA's chill and mitigation are active. Vulnerability with 20/20 goes up to over 50% increased physical damage on enemies, and also scales the huge amount of poison stacks you inflict (this is relevant to tanky bosses, normal mobs melt before many stacks get applied) "

Another big trash clear upgrade is Bino's which I'm working on right now. With both of these upgrades the blue packs should melt like they aren't even there. You can see how powerful the poison stacking is since the poison DoT is scaled with the same stuff ED is. I have relatively crap gear and the bosses still die extremely quickly."

I was recovering from surgery and had tons of time to play, so for once I fully planned out a build and committed to it. It's working out pretty well so far. Fortunately I found a Tabula and corrupted it with +1 gems when I was still in Cruel, so I was able to get a few exalts to buy the build-enabling uniques I needed for the build to work. Summary: Life + ES Witch, using Firestorm as my primary damage spell. I have The Consuming Dark and a 5L Infernal Mantle, which converts 100% of my fire damage to chaos damage and poisons on every hit. The poison damage is decent, but I'm waiting to see what it's like with the +125% poison damage nodes in the Shadow tree (only need 2 more skill points). The skill tree is linked below. I have 2k+ Life with somewhere around 4k ES. Survivability isn't too much of an issue as long as I keep my resists above 50%. Character link (Monopsony): URL Here is my build: URL Questions: What is the best setup with my 5L? Right now I've front-loaded the damage with Firestorm - Concentrated Effect - Void Manipulation - Controlled Destruction - Spell Echo. Are there any other gems that would give me better damage? I've considered Rapid Decay, Added Chaos Damage, Poison, and Increased Duration. Is it better to just get more fire/chaos damage instead of trying to buff the poison damage? Everything dies very quickly if they get hit by a couple hits from my firestorm. Is it better to have 100% fire to chaos conversion, or are there benefits to only having 75%? On my skill tree, I have the fire damage nodes near the top, which give 3% fire damage penetration. Is it worth keeping 25% fire damage with those nodes, or should I use those points for increased chaos damage? Basically, I want to know if there's an upside to not using Infernal Mantle, because the +100% spell damage taken on low mana mod has led to a couple deaths, and is preventing me from reserving mana for more than one aura. Right now I'm using Blasphemy + Vulnerability to maximize the damage over time, but I'd love to be able to use both Vulnerability + Temporal Chains to deal absurd damage. With Infernal Mantle that's just not a smart option. I also need a few more skill points (or a lucky corruption) to make that possible so I can get the +1 curses node. If I used Pyre, are there any cold spells that would be fun? I think it would be crazy to have a Frost Nova that converts 100% to fire then 100% to chaos and poisons, but I don't think the damage would be good at all. It would be really fun to see though. It would be really cute to have that cast on stun. Any other directions I could push my build in? Would Mind Over Matter help with survivability any? I've never used it before but have plenty of mana. Are there any easy ways to leech Chaos damage without using the Life Leech gem? Thanks for reading, sorry for rambling. Just wanted to share the fun I've been having in Talsiman SC since I started playing again. EDIT: Have an Agnerod South if anyone wants to buy it."
596,vulnerability,pathofexile,Mutli-curse Blasphemy viability for melee?,2,3xyjoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3xyjoo/mutlicurse_blasphemy_viability_for_melee/,2015-12-24 00:07:19,"When Blasphemy was announced one of the ideas that immediately appealed to me was a full pdps melee char. No more Hatred etc. I was thinking along the lines of a tri-curse* Cycloner: Punishment + Vulnerability + Warlord's Mark. (\* due to the mana reservation, only 2 of these can be applied via Blasphemy, but that's a non-relevant issue here.) **The problem is as Blasphemy obeys the curse limit, it doesn't seem viable for melee builds to run multiple curses without sacrificing more than you gain.** *Whispers of Doom skill tree node*: Even if your tree dips into the Templar area, which is not unusual for a cyclone build, you'd still have spend some where in the region of 9 skill points just to reach to reach it with no other gain. Not practical. *Doedre's Damning*: You lose a ring slot, which means sacrificing life, res, and flat phys. *Windscream*: Low run speed, no life, insignificant resistances. More loss than gain aside from the +curse. *+1 Curse Corrupted Gear*: Probably the only way to go about it without gimping your build. Potentially expensive though. **Has anyone else drawn any conclusions about multi-curse Blasphemy set ups for melee?** To be quite honest, I'm simply not proficient enough at meta-gaming to know if investing in this route is even worthwhile beyond the simple appeal of being true physical.

Say I poison an enemy. That enemy now takes 10% of my initial hit per second as poison damage. Now say I curse them with vulnerability so they should take 33% increased damage from damage over time effects.

At first the ignite deals 0 damage, but once the boss gets the endurance charges (increases his fire resistance) he starts to die to it.

Since all of these work around degeneration you can massively boost it's damage while keeping mana costs at a minimum. Since the degenerations also scale with spellpower you can MASSIVELY boost it's damage to ridiculous levels. *Imagine the following setup:* Contagion - Chance to flee - Conc. Eff - Controlled destruction - Void Manipulation - Rapid Decay The total multiplier becomes massive. In a worst case scenario Controlled destruction is a 34% multi, and void man + rapid decay is 29% each, or best case 44/39/39. I happen to own a 6link shavronne, so If you do that you can run Pain attunement* as well, for a total of: **Worst case:** Damage of Contagion * 1.34 * 1.29 * 1.29 * 1.69 * 1.3 for a total of 4.89 times the base damage. **Best case:** Damage of Contagion * 1.44 * 1.39 * 1.39 * 1.69 * 1.3 for a total of 6.11 times the base damage. Not only that but if you use Essence drain in a 4-link with those gems - conc eff. you gain 2.89 to 3.61 times the damage. Imagine the following scenario: You use Contagion to clear shit monsters, and Contagion + Essence Drain + wither spam (10% MORE multiplier per stack) to take down hard enemies. You pair this with aurified Vulnerability (essentially a 33% MORE mod since its percentual outside of (gear+gems+passive tree)), Enfeeble and Temporal Chains for a no-go zone around you. Since the % increased damage from wither and vulnerability stacks, along with 20% aura effect you get a 120 (80 from wither + 40 from vuln.) with 8 stacks of wither, which is the same as a 120% multiplier, which is GODLY. [You use a build similar to this with shavronnes or ES](URL along with ~200% spell damage from gear for a total of 500-600% flat spell power and chaos scaling.

They way these gems interact with spell power and eachother is so insanely strong with the new gems, and I can't wait to re-roll a witch next league to test it out. Hnnggggghh"

But, with a good number of degen skills and support gems being added in the new patch, there's definitely some potential to make a low-effort degen build with Death's Oath work. For those who don't know, Death's Oath is a unique Astral Plate. Among other things, it has the mod ""Deals 450 chaos damage per second to nearby enemies"". Since it's ""Deals"" and not ""You deal"", the damage does not scale in any way with your gear or passives. It's only affected by increased damage TAKEN, which until the content update is limited to curses and a couple niche uniques. Enter Wither, which causes mobs to take 10% increased chaos damage. Wither is awesome for a few reasons - it stacks, it's a debuff rather than a curse (no reduced effect on bosses!), it has a very low cast time, and has a very low mana cost. This gives us a unique opportunity - to use both a spell totem and a self-casted version of the spell in order to maintain a very large amount of stacks (More than 50 should be easily doable) For extra damage, the new skills Contagion and Essence Drain can be put together in a five link easily: Contagion - Essence Drain - Void Manipulation - Rapid Decay - Increased Duration Both of these skills' damage will be increased by Wither stacks. We also get the luxury of Blasphemy, which can be used to keep all enemies within Death's Oath's radius dual-cursed with both Vulnerability and Temporal Chains, the only two auras/curses that could be used to increase our damage. Putting Arctic Breath in a CWDT setup could offer extreme survivability when combined with Temp Chains, Wither's slow, and Abyssal Cry's slow (and bonus, Abyssal Cry's explosion damage *also* gets increased by Wither). The synergy of increased duration, increased damage taken, and the multiple potent slows could make for a very viable, potentially very powerful, build. Thoughts, criticisms, additions?"

I just wanted to post this to talk a little about the gratuitous violence, ascendancy and bleeds. Causing stuff to bleed (vagan 7 in particulat), blow up, while maintaining high defences, seems like a crazy interaction. Am I just hyperventilating, and forgetting something obvious? Use an AOE skill, whirl around, hit a pack - if you crit, at least 1 of the mobs is going to be tagged by high end damage, and then cause a chain explosion. It's like infernal blow, with physical damage instead of fire. Versus bosses you'll lose out on crit from the power charges. Thats a fact, but bleeding seems pretty good, if you deal 10% - 60% damage pr second of the highest crit you given the boss, that is at least a thousand extra dps, if he's standing still. Its nothing gamebreaking, but definetly an ability that has some potential if you are able to kite around. I dont know, ascendancy just got me well excited and I wanted to hear what other people think about this particular class. Obviously, versatile combatant is the MVP of the gladiator tree, but gratuitous violence seems like a very strong node as well, and what about bleeds? What do you guys think? (Yes, Aegis is best shield I know, but other approaches exist as well.) (If the GGG removes curse immune, and adds some kind of curse resistance instead - Dual curse would be crazy!

Place down a searing bond. 2. Whirling blade into a pack. (gaining fortify) 3. Start Cycloning. (2-3 curse the enemy and activate elemental equilibrium. Gain stun immunity and life/mana gain on hit) ------------------------- So the **details** of the build. **Mana Regen:** Gained from both mana regeneration and a gemini claw. **Life Regen:** About 5,1% life regen from tree and life gain on hit. **Defense:** Hybrid Armour/Evasion, tri purity auras, some block, stun immunity, can Curse with dual/tri defensive curses. **Damage:** **Tri/dual offensive curse and elemental equilibrium** to lower the fire res of the enemy to a negative value. Also Searing bond has one of the most effective damage scaling per level of any skill because of the low number of supports you can link to it. -------------------- Links: **4-links:** 1. Cyclone - Curse on hit - Flammability - Ele weakness - Fortify/Vulnerability/Enfeeble/Tempchains 2. Searing bond - inc burning damage - Empower - Hypothermia/Totem res. 3.

Whirling blades - fortify **Auras:** Tri purity or dual purity/Arctic armour. ---------------- Gear: Anything really that focuses on **life/armour**. If you run tri purity's resistances is not going to be a problem either and can probably be solved with only rings. You could run into dex problems if you want to run evasion hybrid evasion gear so I would look for dex rolls on gear for this. Other than that this build can run with any chest even **Kaom's heart** because we don't need a six or five link. **Linking can be done completely with Vorici** at very low prices and **almost all gems are red** making it easy to color. -------------------- So improvements to the tree, leveling strategy and other opinions is greatly appreciated.

Thanks for reading and good luck!! Please comment and let me know what you would change or what could be done better! Iron Will Block Scion: The Goal of this build is to provide a high damage, tanky character that requires very little gear investments to get running. We utilize high life from passives and strength as well as a moderate amount of block. The character gains damage from the strength as well as the projectile damage passives and frenzy charges. We use the Inertia and Fertile Mind unique jewels to convert Dexterity in the Shadow, Ranger, and Duelist area into Strength and Intelligence respectively. Required Items/Gearing- 2 Inertia Jewels and 1 Fertile Mind Jewel---&gt; These are two of the highest drop rate unique jewels. They should be available very quickly. (on the tree below these jewels go in one of the three jewel passive slots allocated on the tree, take your pick). Other than these just pick up any rare gear with Life, Resists, and Strength. Since we picked up Iron Reflexes keystone, both armor and evasion based gear works well and makes gearing much simpler! Also, as we progress it would be a good idea to find some Elreon reduced mana rings. We won't need them immediately but they will be helpful as we add links and spell costs increase. Ideally we would want to grab a Doon Cubeyari late game. On a side note, Doon just had its drop rate increased in 2.0 which means it will most likely be cheap and available! The most expensive upgrade to strive for would be a Rumi's Concoction unique flask to max out our block. Again, these two items are by no means necessary but are great upgrades to work towards. Gem Links- 4L---Incinerate-Spell Echo-Fire Penetration-Lesser Multiple Projectiles (5&amp;6L add Iron Will and Life Leech) Vaal Molten Shell-Life Leech-Spell Echo &lt;----(in Doon late game) lv1 Cast When Damage Taken - Tempest Shield - Blood Rage &lt;---(Can remove and use Blood Dance Unique boots for frenzy charges) lv12-20 CWDT - Molten Shell - Chaos Golem - Enduring Cry &lt;---(CWDT will NOT proc this but its nice to have on hand) Warlords Mark -Curse on Hit - Greater Multiple Projectiles - Ball Lightning Arctic Armor-Clarity(low level)-Anger OR Grace&lt;---(Anger for more damage or Grace for defense) The idea is to run up to a mob, shoot off a Ball lightning to curse them if needed, and then incinerate. Mobs will die fast. If fighting a boss, you can swap out LMP in the incinerate setup for Slower Projectiles. If you don't like blood rage and want to use Blood Dance boots I would recommend adding flame dash for movement. Bandits- Oak, Kill, (Oak or Kraitlyn) &lt;--Oak for more defense, Kraitlyn for more damage Tree- URL Poison Arrow Scion: The premise of this build is to have high life and evasion. Since poison arrow is a hit and run type skill, we can manually dodge many attacks that other builds have trouble with. For this reason I opted to not take the Acrobatics keystone and to take more life instead. Since Acrobatics is chance based, we are going to be hit by a huge hit sooner or later. I would rather have allocated much more life when that time comes so I can survive and run away to recover. Starting off with poison arrow is not the fastest clear speed so I would supplement its damage with either fire trap, fire storm, or flame totem when leveling. Required Items- Again there are no required items but try to look for a +1 bow as soon as you can since poison arrow scales off of gem . By lv 64 you can start looking for a +2 bow! Other gear should include Life, Resists, and Evasion. The upgrades for this build can get quite expensive but are not necessary until late mapping. These include a Drillneck unique quiver and a 5-6 linked +3 bow. A 5l +2 bow will easily take you to mid level maps and are very cheap to create(buy a white 5l bow for under 10 chaos and use alteration until you hit +2. Should take between 60-80 alterations). Also be on the lookout for jewels with mods like area damage, projectile damage, chaos damage, and life. Gems- 4L Poison Arrow - Slower Projectiles- Increased AOE- Concentrated Effect (5&amp;6L would be Empower and Pierce&lt;---only if you have a drillneck!) Lightning Arrow OR Ice Shot- Greater Multiple Projectiles - Curse on Hit - Vulnerability (Temporal Chains is also a very good option. It provides both offense and defense since enemies sit in your poison cloud longer and have trouble hitting you) Grace- Rallying Cry(for mana regen) -Vaal Grace - Blink Arrow (the last two will get you out of sticky situations) (Feel free to add a low level clarity or one of the purity's if you need them since you will have extra mana and move vaal grace and blink arrow to different links) You can go with Flame or Chaos Golem, it is up to you What you want to do with the rest of your links is completely up to you as well!

Leveling** - Early on, level any way you feel most comfortable with. Personally, I leveled with EK from 1-10, where I put a club and ground slammed (used STR belt), then I put Wideswing and Sweeped for 10 levels and I was level 28. - Act 2 normal, kill all bandits. Nothing in there is worthed to be taken. [Skill tree 28](URL - Level 28. Take any wand, that has crit/attack speed on it and put it on. You are going to level with wands till level 62, so keep that in mind! The 4 link leveling should be KB + LMP + PCOC + Added Cold/Lighting, while using Herald of Ice and Thunder. [Skill tree level 45](URL - Level 45 is nothing special for you. You will continue leveling with whatever you find and use whatever you feel best with. Self found items and etc. By now, you will have a decent amount of ES, so Ghost Reaver will be good. The Cruel Bandit is either kill all, or you take the Phys damage. Personally, I will kill all, since this can go into jewel. [Skill tree level 55~](URL - Level 55 is where usually you will have around 4k ES capabilities and you should be able to switch to CI, since you will be close or at act 2 Merciless, where chaos damage is a thing. [Skill tree level 62](URL - Level 62 is where it get's interesting. You will now have the ability to put on DarkScorn. Don't worry about damage too much. The bow has enough damage to carry you till level 70 maps without investment other then crit. Other items you will put on for now are Soul Strike and Eye of Chayula for the stun immunity. The links you will be using are (Tornado Shot + GMP + Proj Damage + Crit. Damage + Pierce) or (Split + Chain + Proj Damage + Crit. Damage + Slower Proj, while using puncture as single target). If you are going to use Tornado shot, I would suggest to also include the Pierce Jewel in there as well. (Total price of the build at this point is 6C) Personally, I will be leveling at the first piety encounter for 6L random chest till level 72. [Skill tree level 80](URL - Level 80 is where you need to decide what your build really needs. I have not reached this far yet in Tempest, so I will update it as soon as I do, but most probably, here you will need more damage in order to clear. Survivability should already be really good with high ES Chest piece, Helm, Gloves and Boots on top of having 5 utility flasks and 25% flat Phys damage reduction and stun immunity. The Quiver at this point should be changed for one with Crit, Crit Multi, Ele, Phys rolls on it. Perfect one would also have Accuracy on it. As far as Gear, you should be searching for: - Diamond Rings with Flat Phys, %ES, Ele Res, WED - Amulet if you decide to change it should have: %ES, Flat Phys, Ele Res, Crit, Crit multi. Best corrupted with +1 curse. - Rustic Stash Belt with ES, Resists, WED - Hybrid ES,EV gloves with Phys roll on them or Dusk/Maligaro unique gloves for rampage bonus and crit. - Helmet should be Rat's nest for Freeze immunity and the ability to have 22+ auras. (Hatred/HOI(COH setu on another piece)/Discipline/Vaal Discipline) - Boots will be ES/EV hybrid with High ES and Resists/Movement speed. - Chest piece is either Hybrid ES/EV with 700+ ES and EV, or pure ES chest with 700+ES. The Atziri base is also good for tripple ES/AR/EV bonuses. Links should be: -Split + Chain + Slower Proj + Faster Proj + Crit. Damage + Phys. Proj Damage -Puncture + Crit damage + Slower Proj + Faster Proj + Phys Proj + Culling Strike. -HOT + COH + Assassin Mark + (Enfeeble, Poachers Mark, Vulnerability if you have corrupted ammy) -Hatred + Vaal Discipline + Discipline + Enlighten -COH + GMP + LMP + Arctic Breath (Huge Freeze ground setup) Flasks(All surgeon for crit to refill them): - Cold resistance one with Freeze immunity if no Alpha's. With Alpha's curse immunity. - Fire resistance one with remove bleeding - Taste of Hate or Armor base one with +90% armor - Lighting resistance flask with remove shock and shock immunity - Another defensive or Movement speed flask with remove curse or something else useful. Statistics: According to my calculations, which are highly incorrect (Suck at this), I will have: - 20k Split arrow - 50k puncture - 9k ES - 25% Flat less Physical Damage received - Another 22.5% Less physical damage received on CD(Tate of hate) - Curse, Shock, Freeze, Stun, Bleed immunity through Crits. - 13.5k ES with Discipline However, the issues with the build are the following: 1. The gear is oddly specific. You need specific combinations of gear in order to make it perfect. Good thing is that the gear will be 90% cheaper then any other build's gear, since it doesn't require life and in current meta, life = money, since ""nobody"" plays CI. 2. The Life leech you will get will have to be from items, so somewhere, you need to sacrifice resists or something and play around to gain 1-2% LL, or even more. Otherwise, you might need to drop LMP from your CWDT setup and use Blood rage and play really fast phase game, since your ES will degen now. 3. If you find enough life leech, Frenzy charges will either become hard to generate, or you will have to spec out of them and gain just more flat damage via other means. (Actually considering it O_O) 4. Here is a question, towards all of you. Do you think it would be better to use Ice Golem + Blind + COH + Assasin mark instead of HOT COH Assassin mark and instead of HOT, put HOA. Please, critique if any suggestions. Most of the things in there are out of personal preference and can be easily swapped out, such as damage spell, type of scaling, aura setup and etc. "

Those are pretty nice gloves ! Up to 50Coldres and 16%Life is very good for gloves that cost 4alts currently in warbands. 16% Life is very good early on before youve picked up all the life nodes from the tree (then an 80life roll on rare gloves is about the same, correct me if i'm wrong). Added cold damage is nice to trigger EE as a RF guy. i think it can have some potential, a curse on hit vulnerability corruption also would help both builds out alot, since they cost nothing atm, its very easy to get that. That in turn makes it very easy to get a double or even triple curse on hit ice shot on just a 4 or 5Link. Opinions?"
620,vulnerability,pathofexile,[HC Viable] Full guide for CI DarkScorn. Critique please,1,3fzmvt,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3fzmvt/hc_viable_full_guide_for_ci_darkscorn_critique/,2015-08-06 20:39:15,"Hello guys, After reaching 62 and switching to CI, I would like to give you an update on my guide. Even though it says full guide, the char is far from decently equipped at the moment, due to lack of currency, but soon we will reach this point. Here is the details on the char in a Spreadsheet: URL And here I start describing how it actually functions (Haven't updated anything in the sheet since I started it): Skill tree used till level 62 was starting as witch, taking ES and Life nodes along the way and not taking power charges. Going for the Shadow as quickly as possible to start taking crit and leveling with the level 12 lighting unique bow and level 32 Death's harp. [Skill tree 40](URL [Skill tree 50](URL [Skill tree 62 (just before respec)](URL [Skill tree 62 after respec](URL [Skill tree progression till 72](URL [Skill tree when you can consider the build done](URL Now, some information. I leveled with Tornado shot, since the +1 arrow gives it tons of damage, making it outscale easily Split/Chain. The damage was really good and survivability was above the average always. Felt better then leveling my BM Cyclone (BM only for leveling). I used Anger + HOT through the whole time till level 62 where I switched to HOI/HOT/COH/Assassin Mark and started taking Power charges. Currently in Act 1 normal with 4.7k ES and playing with a 4L with tooltip DPS of 1.4k for Puncture and 760 for Split/Chain. Keep in mind, that I haven't taken any damage yet, nor crit multi and my gear is underwhealming at best. Currently, slowly updating my gear and the result should be a soon to be 6L 560ES chest piece 4G/1B/1R, if the guy is still online when I go home. This will bump my ES with about 600, making me pass the 5k ES and also allow me to run Split/Chain/Proj Damage/Slower proj/Crit Damage/LL bumping my Split/Chain damage to about 1.6k. In the next 10-12 levels, I will take about 300% physical damage, 2 power charges (1 bandit reword and 1 from tree) and a few other things, that will allow me to finally reach the 6-7K Split Chain and pass the 12k Puncture. From there, if I need more damage, I can go for 2nd curse with the curse wheel (5 points) and use vulnerability, for survivability, I can use Warlock Mark (extra end charges and LL/ML), Proj Weakness(Frenzy charges) or Temp Chains (Slow/utility/defense). My current level is 62 and I am pretty much shooting twice to clear a pack of mobs in ledge. My gems are still underleveled, so are my Heralds. Here is more details on what the end build will have: - 15k Split/Chain - 25k+ Puncture - 8.8k ES with 14k ES with level 20 Vaal Discipline - HOI/HOA/Discipline setup. HOI will be setup with COH/Assasin Mark/Frostbite for Frenzy generation, or another curse depending if I have 2 or 3 curses via Amulet as well. - I will use 5 Utility Flasks, since I am CI and I plan one of them being Taste of hate. - Taste of Hate + DarkScorn bow + 3 end Charges results in 60% less physical damage received, before armor gets in effect. - 3x Resists utility flasks will allow me to constantly have 85% or above resistances **Big Problems of the build** - Hard to find the correct items in current meta. They are cheap, since they don't have life, but almost nobody saves items that don't give life. Often even streamers vendor 100%ES+ pieces, just because they don't have life and they think CI is a no-go. - Leveling process requests from you, if you have not prepared items beforehand to take a lot of ES nodes to survive. The result is low damage till you get some levels past 62, where your ES is at a good position for at least 20 levels. - The build requires quite a bit of knowledge as to what can hurt you. You have a lot of defenses towards all sources of damage, so if you utilize the correct defenses at the correct times, you shouldn't really die to anything. - Stun vulnerability. It's easy to get you stunned, so remember that and play around it, or buy Eye of Chiyua lowering your damage by about 12%, your ES by about 4% and other negative effects. **Biggest Pros of the build** - Really easy to start. Costed me around 8C to purchase everything I need for level 64. - A lot of place for improvement. The build is new, so this is most probably far from his end and most optimized form - A lot of defenses if used correctly. Like I said above. If you use Utility Flasks correctly once you have set up, you will be more tanky then any Cycloner out there or any character that is considered a tank. - Easy to be first build in a league, as proven by me, since this is my first Tempest league build. Thanks for reading guys. Sorry for not formatting this better. I typed it real fast since I am at work. Please, go through it and tell me what you think, but keep in mind that there will be more of these incoming till I find the perfect scenario and make up for all it's negatives. "

I can't do lower/no regen, cursed with vulnerability or minus max resist. All these mods provide increased pack size. Standing on shocked ground makes you degen so fast. My aura choices have decreased. I would of run herald of thunder. I can't dual wield another wand which decreases my damage and more importantly my projectile speed. So in conclusion my damage is slightly higher with RF but is simply not worth running. Either I have a smaller map pool of mods or I run them without RF turned on. Honestly what is the point?

Did I got it right? URL Another issue, assuming that I would run both Anger and Hatred auras, is weather the 'increased phys damage taken' from Vulnerability OR the increased elemental damage from elemental weakness debuff would be actually better. Vulnerability increases damage AFTER mitigation, while EW can throw the resistances down to negative values and deal more damage before mitigation... At first glance it looks like going for raw explosion damage (instead of chance to ignite) and reducing elemental resistances as low as possible is better than increases to physical damage or DoT - at least in the case of zombies and dual curse set up with elemental equilibrium, but I would love to be proven wrong! The whole mechanics of this game are still black magic to me :)"

New total damage should be 214% more. So basically that's a very small buff for max range shield charge and a half damage nerf at melee range. Correct me if i'm wrong. --------- Phase run gives you 0.5 seconds to use the damage buff. The wording suggests that frenzy charges will extend the duration of that buff too. So if you consume 5 frenzy charges per cast, you should be able to keep it up permanently since that would make the damage buff last 3 seconds, and the cooldown is already 3 seconds (as well as have the running part be crazy long), right ? --------- Assuming all of the above works, could we hope to oneshoot bosses with something like this? : * Shield Charge + Melee Phys + Added Fire + Increased Critical Damage + Hypothermia + Culling Strike * Herald of Ash + Hatred + Arctic armor (take a quick walk near boss first for chilled ground to proc hypotherm) * Vulnerability + Elemental Weakness + Assassin's Mark * Atziri's promise + taste of Hate * 6 frenzy charges Phase run + Increased Duration -&gt; trigger buff -&gt; hit Frenzy 6 times on trash mobs for the charges More multiplier -&gt; proceed to max range shield charge the boss before Phase run buff wears off and land a crit.

Thanks for your time guys. Edit 1: After talking to /u/AGodlessAmerican regarding builds and the nerfs to aura builds (reduced mana doesn't affect aura gems anymore) I've eddited my build. [here](URL is my new build, I've removed the reduced mana reserved nodes and spec'd more into ES. I've taken the ES on Shield passive as this would give me an additional ~160 ES (WITHOUT % increase). This could be changed if I decide to not use a shield. I've kept my Zealots Oath Keystone because 7% ES regen per second will equate to 560 regen (~8k ES total).

631,vulnerability,pathofexile,Is it worth converting all Fire damage to Chaos damage?,8,3dpw7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3dpw7t/is_it_worth_converting_all_fire_damage_to_chaos/,2015-07-18 18:04:34,"I'm running a Flame Totem build in Warbands (yeah, yeah, FOTM, I know), and I realised I could use Infernal Mantle and The Consuming Dark to convert 100% of fire damage to chaos. I love the idea, but I'm not sure whether execution would work out. As it stands, if I were to do 100% conversion, my fire penetration would be useless. This frees up a link (Fire Pen), which is nice, but I'm not sure what to replace it with. It also frees up potentially 2 points on tree (Heart of Flame and Celestial Judgement), but I think 18% increased damage is probably still worth it, let alone 25%. However, I'd be losing that 40% resistance penetration, **and** currently -43% Fire Resistance from Flammability. There isn't really a curse to take advantage of the chaos conversion; I'm not specced for any charges, Proj Weakness is kinda lost in the increases, and I wouldn't expect the Consuming Dark's degen to be enough to make Vulnerability worth it. On top of this, I'd be replacing a +100% damage wand and a Tabula, and I'd need a 5L Infernal Mantle at least, which isn't exactly cheap to me. Previous to this, my objective was an Apep's Rage, which stands to add about 1.3k to my 7.3k DPS, if I can believe the wiki, but the Consuming Dark, at least, is considerably cheaper (though not cheap enough for me to throw an ex at and not worry).

632,vulnerability,pathofexile,Philosophy: Health Bars,7,3ec5q4,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/3ec5q4/philosophy_health_bars/,2015-07-24 02:14:25,"After seeing posts on the balance of player and creature damage I wanted to add my own two cents on what a health bar is (or should be), and how this can inform discussions on issues of balance. Most of the posts say either ""buff defenses!"" or ""decrease monster damage!"", but I think that misses the core principle of health bars and what they represent. I think that [EgoRaptor's video on megaman design](URL does a great job explaining it. The whole video is worth a watch if you haven't seen it before, but I've linked the timestamp to the one idea that crystallized my idea of what a health bar is. Succinctly, player health bars allow players to make mistakes, while monster health bars raise the need for precision play over a longer period of time. This design principle requires a few important elements that must always be adhered to (in the context of an aRPG): * Players should know the appropriate reaction to any game event, and that reaction should be learned by observing the game itself. Subtlety is totally allowed. * Enemies should have predictable patterns of attack and vulnerability, and no combination of attack patterns should make it impossible for a player to avoid damage, nor make it impossible for a player to deal damage. (unless caused by player stupidity a.k.a dragging adds) * Enemy damage should be avoided mostly through player preparation, action, skill use, and positioning, with a smaller portion devoted to avoiding damage through equipment (otherwise you get into a situation where you either live because you're wearing an item, or you die because you're not, which is pretty boring) * The length of any fight should be directly proportional to the complexity and variation of patterns that an enemy uses to attempt to defeat the player's predictive skills. There's no sense in making a simple fight last a long time. * High **player damage** relative to enemy health should be seen as a mechanic for **skipping content**, essentially this is the mechanism that allows you to say 'I've learned that attack pattern and I don't find it interesting anymore'. * High **enemy damage** relative to player health should be seen as a mechanic for **reducing the number of mistakes a player can make** before negative consequences happen. Some implications are that **high enemy damage skills should be clearly telegraphed and avoidable through player positioning** (Oversoul best boss IMO). Also, high enemy damage should only occur when that damage is actually avoidable. Unavoidable damage checks for equipment quality or configuration are just a disguised pop-up window that says 'You must be this tall to enter', and should be used sparingly (i recognize these have some value as puzzles, though). Secondly, **damage mitigation is a substitute for player skill**. In an ideal system, damage mitigation allows lower skilled players to complete content. As player skill grows, it should be possible to shed damage mitigation in favor of damage increases, so that the player completes content faster in accordance with their higher skill level. As a corollary, if output damage and damage mitigation are in relatively good opposition to one another, a player can calibrate the amount of risk he is willing to accept based on his own skill level. By and large, POE adheres to these principles most of the time. Based on everything above, I think that the Vaal Oversoul is the best designed boss in the game, with a perfect balance between high damage skills and predictable but challenging attack patterns. However, with the recent damage increase, I think we're in a situation where white monsters can kill players in one attack volley, which means the player makes one positioning mistake and is instantly punished for it. The problem is most of those monsters previously had damage that was relatively unavoidable (super fast projectiles, low wind-up time, very subtle telegraph), but also relatively low damage. Since the damage is relatively unavoidable, no amount of skill will ever prevent that damage from occurring. **Making unavoidable attacks high damage effectively makes player skill irrelevant. That makes the game boring.** Fundamentally, you spend most of your in-game time interacting with enemies and their attack patterns. Player health and enemy damage should be tuned to support that interaction, the learning that players experience as a result of their exposure to the game, and their resultant increase in skill. **Higher skill players should be rewarded by being allowed to take fewer damage mitigation modifiers in favor of more aggressive ones**, thus increasing the rate they clear content, and all of the attendant rewards that a higher clear speed brings. I think what has happened with Awakening is that GGG has looked at its **item generation** and **speed of leveling** data, and has started to use enemy damage and player health as a lever to adjust how quickly players progress through game content. **They're using enemy damage as a gate to content**, rather than increasing the complexity of player / enemy interactions (so that skill is the gate, rather than raw damage). I think that's an incorrect use of player health and enemy damage, and it strays outside of the principles above. I think that straying is why this version of POE feels off-balance.

Pros: * Very basic gear needed although links are almost always necessary * Very tanky * Good clear speed * The new item filter makes it MUCH easier to spot weapons in the sea of white items on the ground. [my filter] (URL * Don't need to place as many points into minions on the passive tree * Can be started from Marauder, Scion, With or Templar easily * When you run out of weapons you can go to town and buy some from the store * Simple to learn * No difficult to find skillgems * Base duration of animated weapons (without increased duration gem and after taking skill duration on the tree) is 71.25 seconds Cons: * When you run out of weapons on the ground you are limited to your own damage or any other summons you decide to use. * Relies a bit on luck of weapons dropping (that said I haven't had any troubles having about 10-15 up at a boss and average about 8-30 when walking through maps) Passive Tree: I don't think there is a beta passive tree available at the moment and it wouldn't really help for the following reasons. The tree is extremely flexible because the only necessary nodes are the 2 skill duration clusters, lots of life/armour/ev/es (whatever you feel like using) and some minion damage (don't bother with minion life/speed/leech) you can make the passive tree pretty much the same as a raging spirit tree.

Links: 4L Zombies: Zombies - multistrike - melee splash - melee physical damage 4L Skeletons: summon skeletons - spell totem - minion damage - faster attacks 4L Spectres: Spectre - Faster casting - Spell echo - GMP/LMP 5L/6L: Arc - Curse on hit - curses *(see below for analysis) **(i am also open for suggestions on replacing minion damage + faster attacks if there is higher dps alternative) Also something to take in to consideration is that: I have Elemental equilibrium spread by arc and i have Mon'tregul's Grasp that gives Zombies ~95% increased physical damage. So the question is this: which spectres give the combined better average DPS: Flame sentinels with curses flammability AND elemental weakness OR Tentacle miscreations with vulnerability? Flame sentinels on the other hand do fire damage so they get amazing synergy from flammability + elemental weakness + elemental equilibrium. also exploding skeletons do higher damage because of all the fire vulnerability combined with minion instability when they die on bosses etc. Tentacle miscreations however do 50% physical damage and 50% fire damage BUT they allow you to triple dip in to vulnerability as zombies AND skeletons do physical too however this diminishes the functionality of elemental equilibrium. What do you think or have you done some play testing on both of these? Which Spectres/setups come on top from these two in effectiveness? Additional things to consider: Would running vulnerability AND flammability make sense with tentacle miscreations? Because of how monsters can have high resistance running just one -resistance curse seems questionable to me because you might end up in a situation where 140 resistance - 39 from flammability -50 from e.e would be 140 - 89 = 51 for instance and you would not get the full benefit from the aura at all if you run only one combined with the fact that you don`t have that much fire damage anymore anyway. also does the fact that solaris temple is lvl 62 and therefor Flame sentinels that you raise with concecrate are only lvl 62 (right?) while Tentacle miscreations come from lunaris temple lvl 66 affect their dps compared to each other? In this analysis we are only concerned about the mathematical comparison between the two builds and do not need to take in to account the potential extra free curse slot or the fact that tentacle monsters stand still for a while when they shoot etc. also the AoE of the zombie hits do not need to be considered for the sake of simplicity. Is there no info on the exact damage miscreations and sentinels do? i was unable to find a sheet that shows them having a certain dps so you could actually put this in to formula format .. also bonus consideration not related to this: if you find flame sentinels / Tentacle bitches from lvl 78 map and summon them there do they retain their level? meaning if you then run a lvl 72 map they downscale to 72 and then after that run a 76 they up back to 76 because they were 78 when summoned? edit: playtested the miscreations too and the results are in. Flame sentinels came on top by a huge margin. i did not have all the equal gem levels to really make it solid but it seems there is no contest. i used faster attacks, GMP and minion damage instead of echo, faster casting and LMP for the miscreations. they die easier, do less damage and are clunkier. so unless someone has something to add in this setup flame sentinels outperform tentacle bitches by a huge margin :/ edit 2: and by damage i mean the overall damage which everything dies zombies and skeletons included.

Nodes that would increase the damage of the bleed without increasing physical damage. (I'm thinking like 100-200% bleed damage wheels or even more then that) You could put a few wheel far away from each others so that players would have to somewhat commit to it. For example you could have 1 or 2 of these wheels in Ranger or even Shadow so that you wouldn't be able to scale physical damage at the same time as well as if you went to the marauder and duelist area.

I probably won't follow up most of these with fully fledged build guides unless I make a complete functioning build and level it to 85 or so. Keep in mind this is mostly tentative and will need to be revised once the patch is live. I also have a few rather more esoteric melee builds in mind, but will likely release the build guides only once I've done developing and leveling them. **Build #1: Oro's Crit Proliferator Shadow** Abstract: Burn prolif, again! (Assuming it isn't nerfed into the ground.) Effective and relatively safe because you aren't really being in melee range until you go in for the kill. All those who wanted to make An Oro-based build, now's as good a time as ever. Items: Oro's Sacrifice, Dyadian Dawn, Maligaro's Virtuosity, Belly of the Beast, Windscream, crit/resist jewelry, Selfless Leadership. A cheaper version can be done using Cloak of Flame. Main skills: Vigilant Strike + Elemental Proliferation + Fire Penetration + Weapon Elemental Damage + Increased Critical Damage/Strikes (+ Increased Burning Damage for 6L) (RRRRBB, put into the sword); Ice Golem + Curse on Hit + Flammability + Elemental Weakness + Assassin's Mark (GBBBB, put into Cleak of Defiance/Flame). Flicker strike and/or Leap Slam for movement. Auras and buffs: Herald of Thunder, Purity of Fire, Clarity, Arctic Armour, Enduring Cry. [Tentative 1.3-based tree](URL bandit rewards: Oak/point/Alira. Put Selfless Leadership in the jewel slot near Elemental Equilibrium so that you don't have it but your Ice Golem does. General tactics and leveling: Let Ice Golem debuff a few enemies, go in, hit one of them, go out, watch the room burn. Level using Chance to Ignite in place of Increased Critical Damage, and Poacher's Mark in place of Assassin's Mark. Avoid Anger after giving EE to your Golem since it'll proc +25% fire resist on enemies it hits. Offense elaboration: You get around 250% worth of fire damage from the tree, and around another 20% from gem quality and items, so each of your attacks deals 5183.91.591.65=5300 average fire damage before crits/resists. With ~45% crit and ~37% non-crit chance to ignite from crits/curses/passives/items, ~2/3 hits will ignite and ~1/2 will shock. Ice Golem does cold damage with every one of its attacks/spells, and as such debuffs enemies by around 140% fire resist (EE + two curses), penetration on our VS drops that further by 40% (35+5). Bypassing Vigilant Strike cooldown or raising attack speed isn't needed because we only need a One Good Stab: even a *non-crit* that happens to shock will deal between 10-18k fire damage depending on target's fire resist and curse effect penalty (6.7-12k without shock) and will result in a 5.3-14k DPS burn accelerated by Dyadian Dawn whose downside is bypassed since we do no physical damage to begin with. A crit with ~400% multiplier (with Ass Mark factored in), on the other hand, is guaranteed to shock thanks to HoT and will proliferate it as well, resulting in a 53004=21200 fire damage hit that gets multiplied by 2.2-2.8x further thanks to debuffs and results in a 55-70k DPS burn. This is enough to mow down *any* map boss in a single hit if it can be cursed at all, since up to 75% increased burn duration from passives and gem quality will net a 320-410k total burn damageeven if the golem dies shortly after hitting the boss. A non-cursable boss will require 2-3 hits, so at most 20 seconds in any case. Thus, keep crit multiplier lower than 400% with Ass Mark factored in: any more will be dangerous and not really justified; instead, offload further damage increases onto burn exclusively. Defense elaboration: Oro's forces us to take more physical and fire damage, so Arctic Armour and the essentially free Fortify are naturally strong and important here, even without the soon-to-be-nerfed Cloak of Defiance MoM (rip!). Thanks to decent EHP pool and 80% fire resistance, reflect isn't too much of a problem as long as you keep your crit multiplier in check (I suggest no more than 400% with Ass Mark factored in). A top-end 60k fire damage crit will be reduced to mere ~1400 fire damage taken after resistances/Fortify/AA. I will suggest, however, swapping ICD gem in favor of Increased Critical Strikes on ele reflect and extra damage maps because large crits may become unmanageable on double reflect (think ~2500-3400 damage per crit). Having a Surgeon's Ruby flask is a must for this build in any case. Leeching is available via Dyadian's Dawn 3% leech against chilled enemies which we'll have a plenty of thanks to AA and Ice Golem chilling everyone around. A 10k hit may heal only 300 life, but a 40k crit and the ensuing massacre will replenish around 1/4-1/3 of our life globe at once, which isn't all too shabby. Enduring Cry can be used as a defense supplement as well as an emergency supply of ECs to feed to Vigilant Strike in case the first hit didn't ignite or dealt bottom-end damage. **Build #2: Fortify Supertank Marauder** Abstract: Kinda abysmal DPS, but borderline gamebreaking tankability without investing tons of exalts into mirror-worthy gear or super-rare uniques. Strictly solo/duo build. Items: Lightning Coil, Facebreaker, Saffell's Frame/Lioneye's Remorse, Meginord's Girdle, flat phys/resist jewelry, Forbidden Taste. A more expensive version can be done with Soul Taker (in which case Blood Magic, Cyclone, and Facebreaker go out, Reave and Added Fire Damage go in) and Atziri's Step. Corrupt your Meginord's for +1 EC as soon as you can afford it. Skill setups: Cyclone + Melee Physical Damage + Fortify + Blood Magic + Conc Effect (+ Faster Attacks) (RRRGGB). Chaos Golem + Curse on Hit + Blind + 20% Enfeeble (GBBB). Auras and buffs: Purity of Fire + Purity of Lightning + Hatred + Herald of Ash. Blood Rage, Vaal Immortal Call, Molten Shell (on CwDT), Enduring Cry. [Tentative 1.3-based tree](URL bandit rewards: Oak/Kraityn/Oak. General tactics and leveling: You won't die as long as you keep cycloning and maintaining your Endurance Charges. Nor will your Golem as long as it keeps putting that 20/20 Enfeeble on everyone and staying in range of your Purities. Leave an enemy in front of dangerous boss rooms so that you can cry at it and go in with full Endurance Charges. Use Forbidden Taste if you have fun tanking huge hits and don't want to die to that little inconsequential enemy that happens to hit you right afterwards as you're reeling from your badassery. Cast Vaal Immortal Call (and log out without a care, lol) if things truly go out of control. Offense elaboration: I estimate around 7-12k DPS with a 5L Cyclone depending on your jewelry. Unless I grossly miscalculated somewhere (I admit, Facebreaker Cyclone DPS is kinda hard to calculate), this is the most you can really hope for, considering almost none of the DPS nodes are allocated, at least two important DPS supports have to be left out (Faster Attacks and Added Fire Damage), and neither your shield nor your helmet add flat physical damage unlike conventional Cyclone builds. Your DPS in groups larger than two (you included) will basically vanish, but if you simply enjoy taking one for the team or showing off facetanking Igna/Magnus/Avatar of Apocalypse/Maze Vaal/Abaxoth/double boss Courtyard/Residence Dominus/Hall of Grandmasters, sure, have a blast with it. I don't know exactly how much damage Maze/Alluring Abyss Vaals' slam and Palace Dominus's Touch of God do, but you can most likely take those on as well if you flask it up (Granite of Iron Skin + Ruby/Topaz) beforehand. If you party with several people, make sure one of them runs Haste or Anger+Wrath so that your DPS can go up a bit. Defense elaboration: If you're a fan of tanky builds or are really afraid of dying, you'll have a field day with this. You get ~30% *passive* physical reduction off of *any* hit as long as meremy your golem is present, and 70-95% when fully self-buffed, so CwDT Immortal Call is never needed. Furthermore, since armor doesn't mean much in this build, we can afford the trip to Acrobatics and enjoy 40% less hits coming through. Furthermore, since Cyclone grants a built-in stun immunity during the effect, Unwavering Stance is unnecessary and we can take advantage of some modest evasion + enemy accuracy reduction from quality Enfeeble + Blind, so *even less* hits will be coming through. Furthermore, there's Ondar's Guile for even more protection against projectiles in case that wasn't enough. Furthermore, we can use Saffell's Frame for extra resistances and some modest spell block (so that the overall chance to be hit by a spell with Phase Acro factored in is just over 60%). Furthermore, your effective elemental resistances with Fortify on are 89%/84.5%/88%. Furthermore, you can outregen Blood Rage even at -20% chaos resistance and enjoy 13.5% life leech or even more (depending on your jewelry and FB roll). Furthermore, we can use Lioneye's Remorse on swap to tank even more physical damage. Oh, and you have around 5.6-6k life and a walking decoy just next to you, so **if you die with this build even once I'm going to reach out to you through this monitor and punch you in the face, scrub**. **Build #3: The Bloodletter Witch** Abstract: Yes, a melee CI witch. Not the only one I've made/plan to make. The build makes use of tons of *more*-type damage multipliers to deal crit-like close quarters DPS with RT and cheapo gear. Items: Incandescent Heart, Dream Fragments, Doomsower or a 350+ DPS one-hander, whatever ES items you need (aim for &gt;6k total or &gt;7.5k if using a shield), attack speed on gloves and one of the rings, mana leech on jewelry, WED on belt or one of the rings.A more expensive version can be done with Atziri's Disfavour and other things. Skill setups: Leap Slam/Cleave (or whatever you prefer really, green gems won't get Doomsower's bonus though; it needs to be an AoE skill by default, too) + Melee Physical Damage + Melee Damage on Full Life + Concentrated Effect + Bloodlust (+ Faster Attacks) (RRRRGB). Puncture + Fortify + Melee Splash + Endurance Charge on Melee Stun; Reckoning + Endurance Charge on Melee Stun (RRRG+RR). Fire Golem + Curse on Hit + Vulnerability + Enfeeble/Warlord's Mark/Elemental Weakness (Alternative setup: Chaos Golem + Added Lightning Damage + Curse on Hit + Vulnerability, then repeat the Elemental Equilibrium trick from above since you aren't using lightning damage in this build and roughly 40-45% of your tooltip DPS value is elemental). Auras and buffs: Discipline, Hatred, Herald of Ash. Self-cast Blood Rage and Rallying Cry. High-level Molten Shell or Immortal Call on CwDT. [Example 1.3-based tree](URL bandit rewards: point/Kraityn/point. General tactics and leveling: Level as life or hybrid build with good leveling uniques (Limbsplit, Geofri's Baptism, The Blood Reaper, Kaom's Primacy, etc.; Wurm's Molt + Slitherpinch will solve all life/mana leech problems for the time being); switch to CI when you get Incandescent Heart, Dream Fragments, and some form of stun immunity. You can do it earlier as well if you know what you're doing. Use Rallying Cry when meeting large packs, Puncture on large enemies you need extra damage against, or singular enemies you want to renew EC duration on. Offense elaboration: There are 3-5 *more*-type damage modifiers that will directly apply to the physical damage you're doing. Assume you're using a 500 DPS Doomsower, level 20 gems, roughly 290% increased melee physical damage with the weapon of choice and 70% increased attack speed in total. 5003.91.491.491.691.7=12.4k. Add scaled elemental damage: 12.40.361.69=7.5k, 12.4(0.1+0.151.21)=3.5k; 12.4+7.5+3.5=23.4k. Add bonus for enemies cursed with Vulnerability by your golem: 12.41.391.1=19k; 19+7.5+3.5=30k. Add Bloodlust bonus for enemies you've debuffed with Puncture: 301.59=47.7k. Not bad at all for an RT 5L where most of the damage is physical, huh. If you have a 600+ DPS weapon, that can go even higher. Considering more than half of it is physical damage, and the only real DPS item we're using is the weapon itself, that's a lot, and will definitely be noticeable in a full-man group. (Note: I have slightly changed the tree after writing up this paragraph, but the new numbers should be within 10% of what's written here; i.e. still good.) Defense elaboration: Incandescent Heart and Fortify soak up roughly half of elemental damage you'd otherwise take, bringing your effective resistances to 87%/87%/87.5%. Some modest armor from Incandescent Heart and whatever other hybrid items you equip + Molten Shell on CwDT + some ECs here and there + 21% buff effect Fortify deal with roughly 45-55% of incoming physical damage, which is pretty decent for a CI build, and Unwavering Stance takes care of stuns. Having a build with so little ES wouldn't be possible otherwise, but compared to a vanilla 1.3-era build this has almost exactly twice the survivability than builds that have little to no phys reduction and no additional elemental reduction past 75% resistances. Finally, &gt;18% life leech allows for relatively easy sustain even without Vaal Pact. There was another build here, the Vigilant Overkill Marauder, but I've run out of reddit post space, so maybe I'll share it some other time. Thanks for reading! Hope some of it was useful to you, and we can share and spread the melee love."

651,vulnerability,pathofexile,The Hall of Grandmasters - How to make the map feel like an actual PvP Fight,28,2umnoh,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2umnoh/the_hall_of_grandmasters_how_to_make_the_map_feel/,2015-02-03 23:12:13,"Hey, just my thoughts about why I think The Hall of Grandmasters in his current state. I've seen many people talking about their disappointment, but I think the map could really work if 3 things were fixed : * Initiative. The ability to do stuff before the Grandmasters is kinda OP and feel cheesy. Either it's stacking EA on wall, casting a 10 stack Flameblast, stacking traps or remote mine. Like you can go near the wall, put 7 Remote Mine Fireball (stack Crit Multiplier, one of them WILL crit anyway), put a Smoke Mine. Then you just have to ""start"" the fight, curses them (see point.2), detonate your mines and they'll burn (see point.2 again) will you're waiting 2 screens away. * Potions. They don't use them, and it's big. So even if you're casting a 10 stacks Flameblast, they won't use a Ruby Flask to even try to mitigate it. Curse them + EE (or double curses, or triple), they don't have Warding Flask so they're probably low on resists, ready to get one shot. And if they burn ? No dousing anyway, or no health pots, so they'll just burn until they die. If you don't use Pots, no one can survive a Stage 10 Flameblast with Elemental Equilibrium+Flammability+Elemental Weakness+Temporal Chains(+Vulnerability). * Stage Space. It's just too big, the layout looks great but you just have too much space to kite. If you run out of potions or are low hp, you can chill because enemies won't follow you and will wait you to return. If the room was smaller, like Atziri Trio's Room, there would be no way for you to disengage the fight. It should be exactly like a PvP Fight, you can't rest because your enemy will chase you down. ----- My suggestions ? For each wave, put a visible trigger in the middle of the room. Each Grandmaster is a Statue (place them arround the trigger, so you're actually sitting yourself in the middle of the room and have grandmasters arround). When you press the trigger (like for Olmec's Sanctum), you can show a 3-seconds count before the start fight (meanwhile the player is frozen, you can't cast, and every summon, trap, mines, corpses are destroyed before the fight). That way, you can't ""cheese"" the fight. Once the fight is started, put a wall between the current room and the last one, so you can't evade and if needed, have Grandmasters IA chasing you. If they lose your sight, they can roam randomly to try to find you. And finally, give them Potions. I think the best way to do it is to give them fixed Potions, the same for every Grandmasters (while be wayyy easier than trying to ""learn"" how each Grandmaster is supposed to use them). That way, you can write a script common to all the Grandmasters. Like, give them 2 charges of Dousing (for Ignite), Heat (for freeze), Staunching (for Bleed), Grounding (for Shock). It's not actual potions, just specific Flask effect they can use on specific case (like ""use the dispel Freeze if the freeze is longer than 2 seconds""), with a cooldown. Since the room is no smaller, you can't just kite them until they've wasted everything. Eventually, they could get Healths/Utility Potions, but imo the priority is dousing/heat/staunching. You can notice I haven't talked about Rewards. Some people feels like the map isn't rewarding enough for the difficulty. While I agree, I think the priority is to actually make the map a nice challenge before trying to make it rewarding. We can't have both : High Rewards and Common Rarity, and GGG stated they want as many people as possible to try the map. We can discuss Rewards in the comments (I've some ideas myself), but I won't go futher on this post, so we can focus the discussion on the challenge first, and later on the rewards."
652,vulnerability,pathofexile,Ten simple guidelines to read before submitting a character intended for Hall of Grandmasters,87,2uo6j3,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2uo6j3/ten_simple_guidelines_to_read_before_submitting_a/,2015-02-04 06:59:39,"I've watched some of the clears thus far ([Hegemony's](URL [Helman's &amp; DontFuxWithDux's](URL and they feel so underwhelming I don't even know where to begin. But I have to begin, so let's round up all the major mistakes the first-gen Grandmaster supporters made and discuss ways to avoid repeating them. (Note that I'm well aware that many of the characters weren't intended to be competitive in that map, so this document is only intended for those who strive for that. I also realize that, at the time, no-one knew the layout of arenas and exact circumstances of spawn conditionsbut GGG still has the capability to change those.) **1. Test your character in PvP to see how its damage and defenses scale, and don't be a one-trick pony.** Self-explanatory. Skills that deal good damage in PvE may be absolutely worthless against a real player because they *will* have at least 75% elemental resists, high physical mitigation and/or Immortal Call, large EHP pool, etc. To give you a good example of a one-trick pony, the current iteration of HOGM has an Arc caster who uses Voltaxic Rift to convert all of its damage into chaos. Naturally, it can destroy a character who has low chaos resist but will do zero damage against CI (like in Hege's vid). You ideally want to avoid doing stuff like that, because people will learn of its existence and prepare themselves accordinglynot to mention chaos damage is high enough up on the list of things that can kill you for clever players to think about it in advance. **2. Make your character freeze- *and* stun-immune. Consider protecting it from other ailments in at least some ways.** People who are being serious about running this map will typically attempt to immobilize (read: completely neutralize) the enemies because that's the single most effective defense in the gamewhich, to their convenience, also doubles as an offense most of the time. If your character is susceptible to either stun or freeze, it will die against a clever player without doing much, if anything, to them. High life pool won't help because even map bosses are permastunned/permafrozen with modest gearand they have over 100k life. Note that it's possible to build a good PvP character without stun immunity, but it's really hard and requires a lot of clever setups to avoid falling prey to crit spellcasters and the like; if you know how to make it work, you don't need to read this document. Also consider ways to at least have a percentage-based avoidance of ignite, since it can be really really powerful in high-level PvP, especially when the players opposing your character have the benefit of preemptive strike. **3. Protect yourself from easy debuffs. Overcap your elemental resistances by at least 47%.** 47% is the amount that will be subtracted from your resistances by a 20/20 Elemental Weakness. Some people have increased curse effect in their builds, too, and some are additionally using Elemental Equilibrium, so *ideally* you should be aiming for a 90% overcap or so. But 47% is an absolute given if you don't want your character to die instantly. If you have items that lower the effect of curses on the character, that's pretty good, too. It will also help a lot if your build isn't too hurt by them in general to begin with; for instance, most summoners couldn't care less about Temp Chains on them, while a melee character is potentially done if it can't dispel it. **4. Level your character to at least 85, ideally 90+. Level your gems to 20 (full-quality where applicable).** For some builds going from level 85 with 20/0 gems to level 90 with 20/20 gems can well result in a ~50% DPS boost. I'm not kidding; do the math. Consider the fact that the league you're doing this on doesn't matter at all (it's even beneficial to do this on Standard due to easier access to legacy items), so powerlevel the fuck out of your character on any league it's faster for you to do so to make sure it gets all the most efficient nodes, all the required auras and gem levels, and enough life/ES to take a few hits. It doesn't take that much time if you do it efficiently. **5. Consider the fact that AI is much, *much* dumber than you.** Your build relies on lots of manual dodging, active defenses, kiting, precise pot management, strategic totem/mine placement, or something else like that? Think twice. If there's anything in your build that **requires** thought and decision-making on the level above ""if &lt;condition x&gt;, do &lt;action y&gt;"", just scrap it. If you want to do an experiment, invite somebody over who is **not** a PoE player, but has some experience with ARPGs, and explain to them how your build is played. Watch them do a couple PvP matches. That's how your build will be played, more or less. Which is why your attack/cast setup must be as simplistic as possible and your defenses as passive as possible. **6. Catch players by surprise. Don't telegraph your build. Use other Grandmasters to your advantage.** Most of the time players won't look exactly what kind of items you're using, but some of them really telegraph your build and its intentions (I'm looking at you, Righteous Fire). Consider using setups that hide their main damage vessel, and use skin transfers to cover up easily-spottable uniques (I'm looking at you, Tabula Rasa). Don't use Infernal Weapon mtx on your Searing Touch or Arctic Weapon mtx on your Taryn's Shiver, because that'll be the first thought of a player spotting your character. Multi-Cast on Death setup can be scary due to how great it can be for killing unsuspecting players (obviously, only use burst damage spells for it, not something sustained like Firestorm). Traps are also good because they're hard to spot (note how in both vids players were caught by traps at one point or another). Most of the time your character will fight close to at least one other master. Consider using skills that scale with friendly auras that your build doesn't self-cast; also consider using auras that might help another build (Purity of Fire immediately springs to mind). In fact, a tanky support build may well do better in this map than all of those 150k DPS guys by the sole virtue of letting the 150k guys not die instantly. **7. Don't use skills that lock your movement. Conversely, use skills that automatically get you to/from the target, or otherwise take your character away from line of fire.** You can pretty much expect that any player who will fight against your character will be either ranged, or a trapper, or a melee build with resistance flasks, Vaal Pact, and tons of life leech. What this means is that your character is, by default, a pin cushion if it can't deal damage from afar and/or clear the distance really quick. What this means in practice, is that there's a list of skills you're best off never using for this purpose. Some obvious examples: * Only use Cyclone if you *really* know very well what you're doing (if you're reading this, you likely don't). * Don't use Incinerate because anyone with half a brain will get out of range before it reaches level 3. It's good in manual play, but the AI won't be able to use it effectively. * Flameblast is insanely easy to avoid, and your character will likely be dead before it can finish casting. Crit Flameblast *might* be good though, but you really need crazy good gear for it to take off (your character will most likely won't be able to use power charges, for instance). Flicker Strike and Leap Slam are great for melee builds, obviously, even if they're only used to cross the distance between your character and the player. Don't forget to put Faster Attacks on that Leap Slam! Lightning Warp, Frost Wall, and Cold Snap + Added Cold Damage (for that extra chill duration) are decent candidates for passive CwDT setups for builds that can't sustain a lot of incoming damage. **8. Find a way to sustain incoming damage long enough to do yours.** This can be accomplished by several means. * Leech fast enough (google Exalton's Bloodseeker build for a rough idea on how this is done best). * Stack avoidance: high block/dodge is a good idea because a figure like 50% is easy to get, but survivability advantage it provides is insane; Grace + Enfeeble + a way to blind can be pretty decent against crit-based attack builds, too, especially considering it will benefit all the other grandmasters on that arenabut note that clever players likely won't use builds like that in the map, especially on HC. Don't use regeneration unless your character can regenerate over 1.5k life/ES in a second, and don't rely on pots for life sustain (something like using Avenger's with high crit rate could've worked if you were controlling it; don't count on AI being effective at that). **9. Use an auto-aiming spell or a totem that could debuff players or expose traps/mines.** Something as simple as Arc + Curse on Hit + Temporal Chains/Vulnerability can turn your character from an easy target to something that would require at least *some* work. Don't forget that each application of a curse incurs a potential flask usage by players, and flask charges are very limited. **10. Feel free to punish players who don't think before they act.** Techniques such as reflect/thorns, Vaal Molten Shell, Punishment curse, Minion Instability and the like can be used to make short work of anyone who comes in unprepared. Consider that Animated Guardian takes up only one socket, but can wear a full set of reflect gear, including such *amazing* uniques as Bramblejack, and at the same time help your character and its grandmaster allies by also using Leer Cast and Dying Breath. Who cares if it dies if you don't need to re-gear it every time? :D How about a horde of suicidal zombies with Mon'tregul's Grasp and Maligaro's Lens, each potentially dealing a fuckton of ignite-friendly damage on death? Think about things like this. After all, your character's goal is to *kill* a player, not to *survive* the encounter. If you've finished this document, thank you for reading, and good luck!"

I tried that from around 30-45ish but it felt kind of unfun to me, especially when fighting loosely packed mobs, I'd run out of traps often, sometimes desync would cause me to throw one where there isn't a mob and it goes to waste, etc. Eventually I got fed up with the traps and just played with Poison Arrow, it feels weaker, but being able to shoot anywhere rapidly and create a large zone of degen was fun. Now I'm level 70 and I feel my damage is pretty lacking, it's especially noticeable running a map with just one or two friends, but even alone I feel like I clear much slower compared to some of my other characters. I have a +2 5L Bow, but I'm starting to wonder if +3 is absolutely mandatory, since that essentially adds 5 to Poison Arrow's level (3 from Bow, 2 from level 2 Empower) instead of 3 (2 from Bow, 1 from level 2 Empower). I have Poison Arrow, Conc Effect, Slower Projectiles, Faster Projectiles and Empower linked together. Would a 4L +3 Bow be significantly stronger than the 5L +2? I don't really have the currency to buy one right now, I guess I could save up if it'll make a huge difference. As for other gear, I have a 6 socket Carcass Jack that isn't linked together well, I'm not even sure what I'd throw in there. I have a Skeleton Totem setup in my helm to act as a bit of a meat shield. In my boots I have Reduced Mana, Clarity, Grace and Arctic Armour, gloves I just have Vulnerability and Inc Duration.

I considered going back into traps since there are more damage nodes I can take, plus the Trap gem offers a 'More' modifier which is nice, but as I mentioned I didn't care much for the playstyle and running out of traps.

I stood there next to Zana for a few minutes. 150% monster damage 150% monster life Whipping miscreations and summoner/experimenters I decided that THIS is why I play hardcore, and I went in. Now remember I'm playing cyclone, so those miscreations will be in melee range, the extra damage followed by the vulnerability would be terrifying. Luckily I run two granite flasks of warding.

""Balls or go home"" I thought."" It's been a fun season so far, if i make it- I can tell about it, if not... Start over like I always do."" I went back in and slowly but surely worked my way through the map, only being forced to commit to large packs occasionally, keeping my granite up and hearing my Immortal Call go off with every hit. I made it. I did it! I killed the boss and cleared the map. It took 84 minutes and it's the most intense fun I've had since invasion. I acquired 4 trash unique, 13 fusing, 2chaos, and numerous mid tier currency. The odds were against me, but with knowledge and a solid build, I was victorious. I only wish I had recorded it. The beauty of hardcore comes through when your death is imminent, and a map like this, makes the dissapointment of previous deaths worth it."
656,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Bug] Flesh offering didn't work on a Necrovigil pack,1,2rnqhr,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2rnqhr/bug_flesh_offering_didnt_work_on_a_necrovigil_pack/,2015-01-08 06:38:01,I just did a Zana daily in a 74 Museum and the last corrupted monsters pack was in the boss room with Necrovigil. It was double curse ele weakness and vulnerability and was scared for my life because I had to run around to kill the pack. Is this a bug or real life? edit: they were bandits so they had corpses.
657,vulnerability,pathofexile,SRS - Totem+Arc or Arc+CoH+Curse?,3,2s9qk0,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2s9qk0/srs_totemarc_or_arccohcurse/,2015-01-13 21:55:25,"Pretty much what the title says. What do SRS builds usually use? I am aware some are running the totem to trigger EE, but if I can put Arc+CoH+Vulnerability or another curse, that kind of wrecks face more? I would presume the argument could be that you can't curse and summon at the same time, but why not just pre-curse and then summon, or summon and then curse, since SRS cannot trigger EE, it does not matter what comes first. Any thoughts?"
658,vulnerability,pathofexile,[Math]AssMark vs Vulnerability?,0,2sf7fj,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/2sf7fj/mathassmark_vs_vulnerability/,2015-01-15 04:59:22,"I'm trying to calculate whether AssMark or Vulnerability will provide an larger increase to average damage-per-hit. For the purpose of this calculation, I want to ignore the power charge generating effect of AssMark and the increased DoT effect of Vulnerability. So the question boils down to +9% crit chance and +39% crit damage vs 29% more physical damage taken. Given: * 75% critical chance * 427% critical multiplier Let x=damage-on-hit... AssMark damage = (0.75+0.09)*x*(1.39*(4.27-1)+1)+(1-(0.75+0.09))*x = 4.82x Vulnerability damage = 1.29*[0.75*x*4.27+(1-0.75)*x] = 4.45x Are these calculations correct? "
659,cybersecurity,pathofexile,New Subreddit Moderators!,1,f22zw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/f22zw9/new_subreddit_moderators/,2020-02-11 15:20:50,"We recently asked for a few exiles to join our mod team here to help us keep on top of busy periods. This last expansion especially has brought the subreddit to the biggest (and busiest) it's ever been. For reference, we have grown by a but over 50% since the last time mods were added to the team so this was long overdue. We had a lot of fantastic volunteers who posted in the recruitment thread but alas we decided to only add four new people to our team. I'm sure you've seen all of them posting on here at various hours and they have all been playing this wonderful game for quite a while. For anyone new to how mods show-up in threads, if we're just posting normally, you'll see their names in a dark orange tint. If we're ever posting in an official capacity, our names will be bright green and easy to spot. So, with all that said... -- # Meet the new moderators: ### Bulletti &gt;Hello! I'm pushing 30 years now and gaming has been my passion ever since I first picked up a controller as a kid. I've played most kinds of games and I've been a part of many different communities. I've mostly lurked the PoE sub ever since I started playing the game, so you may not know me yet. If you see someone use overly formal language with unnecessarily fancy words with a sarcastic tone, it's probably me. I'm fascinated by people and I'm naturally curious about most things in life. I can get carried away by rabbit holes and forget to eat all day, especially when trying to figure out how to make a build work. Most importantly though, I just want to help out! (Cat pics available in PMs) ### 2ne8 &gt;Hi everyone, Ive been playing PoE since 2.6 (Legacy) and recently passed my 10K hour mark. If you know me in-game, it's probably from my fanaticism for collecting near-perfect/perfect items and obtaining double corruption altars to make them even better! Like some of the other mods, I also play some LoL but PoE is my main game. My goal as a subreddit moderator is to be fair and to help form a less toxic community than there currently is (love most of you, just not the few bad apples out there). &gt;You might have realized that my username is a play on the Kpop group, 2ne1, which was disbanded in 2016. Although I do listen to a bunch of Kpop, my tastes are quite eclectic - I frequently jive to classical, rock, jazz, techno, and whatnot. Message me if you have any awesome suggestions to add to my playlist - doesn't have to be part of those genres I just listed. &gt;IRL, Im a software developer in the Eastern US, and have been honing my skills to become a full-fledged full-stack developer rather than just back-end. In this regard, I'm interested in learning more about cybersecurity, cryptography, and useful app development. Also message me if you have similar interests and are willing to teach me / talk about them! ### Swimmer249 &gt;Hello PoE subreddit! Been playing PoE since Talisman and Im always excited to sink my teeth into the next league and make some terrible builds. You might know me from this subreddit, although I dont post nearly as much as I lurk on here. Im really looking forward to helping this subreddit, and by extension, game, grow! Outside of PoE, I mostly play first person shooters. Some personal favorites include Dirty Bomb (RIP), Titanfall 2 (RIP), and more popular titles such as CS:GO and R6:Siege. But PoE is easily my most played game and I dont see that changing any time soon. IRL unfortunately I dont swim much anymore (if you were curious about my name), and Im currently studying computer science. Im going to keep this short but feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat! ### blvcksvn &gt;Hello everyone! I'm a ssf enthusiast that has been playing since the launch of Perandus league (2.2). Currently I've been grinding it out in Slipperyjim's Gucci Hobo league. I'm always up for a good theorycraft for a hipster build or discussing POE lore. &gt;Outside of POE, some of you may recognize my name from the Puzzle &amp; Dragons subreddit where I've been part of the mod community for a good 4 or so years. I don't play too much nowadays but I met a lot of good friends from there. Other games I currently play include Sinoalice, Dragalia Lost, GBF, AFK Arena and World Flipper. I haven't really had much passion for a game like POE before though! &gt;IRL, I'm a freshly graduated 21-year old mental health nurse living on the West Coast. I go by Jasmine if my username is hard to remember! It's nice to meet everyone. -- # The Retired While we should all congratulate and welcome the new mods, I also want to make a special shoutout to both Zaccie and Viperesque. As I'm sure most of you by now have seen, they were both officially hired by GGG which meant that, unfortunately, they had to leave our team. During their time as moderators, they both put forth tremendous efforts in building up this community and doing a ton of work behind the scenes. Frankly, it's a miracle we had them both for so long. We're sad to see them go but also thrilled about the opportunities opened up to them (especially since these new roles happen to actually pay them for once!). Congrats to you both!"
