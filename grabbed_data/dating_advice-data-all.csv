Which one is a better book? What are your experiences? Those books are very different. Models from Mark Manson is about honesty, vulnerability, connection, self-improvement etc. How to be a 3% man from Corey Wayne is about being mysterious, revealing less about yourself, let a women chase you. It doesn't talk about vulnerability, deep connection, intimacy etc. I don't know which one is better for dating and sexual relationships. I never dated and am new into it. Please let me know."
1,vulnerability,dating_advice,I'm curious about what romantic things guys wanna do??,1,i4fhtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/i4fhtp/im_curious_about_what_romantic_things_guys_wanna/,2020-08-06 08:35:34,"Guys, do you have any romantic things you wanna do with your ideal partner?? I never really thought guys would really care about romantic aspects or at least, daydream time to time about romantic scenes in their heads with an ideal partner? Because it's scientifically known that girls are the more emotional counterpart, but obviously I know there's slightly more emotionally in touch guys out there and most guys do have an emotional vulnerability inside them somewhere. But I'm talking about how most girls, we tend to fantasise time to time what could happen between us and our ideal partner romantically. Whereas we tend to think guys just think about the sexual aspects because you focus on the physical/visual aspects more than emotionally. But I've talked to a few guys where they mention things like this one guy said he'd like to kiss behind a waterfall as one of his bucket list goals or this other dude who wanted to pick a girl up into his arms and kiss her. So it intrigues me, because I never hear this side from guys that often to be very frank with you. So I'm interested in knowing! But if you'd rather not share here, just move on and don't comment anything :) have a nice day/night y'all."

A new guy [20M] started working in our workplace, and, as usual, I welcome him by frequently talking to him during our shifts. We did click because he took exactly the same subjects I'm taking right now at school. So, maybe you could say we're now friends(?). One time our boss mentioned my ex during a staff party and I accidentally cried which the new guy witnessed. After that incident, my co workers tease me about my ex which leaves the new guy confused because he had no idea what's going on; I cope with it well by making jokes out of it. Out of the blue, the new guy messaged me, asking about what happened to my ex. Because I was still frustrated at that time, I couldn't help myself blurting everything about that awful relationship. I cringed about how much I overshared since we just met; it looked like I was desperate for pity from him. I should not tell him something too sensitive! This is how our occasional long messages, spanning from 10pm - 1am, started. He shared his insecurities, stories about his past, his exes, what he wants to a girl, what he can offer in a relationship, his thoughts, and secrets. It is overwhelming. I am uncertain on how to respond so I just tend to listen to him and motivate him. I don't even know if I should share things like these to him. Should I? I doubt he'd care. I don't talk to him as much as initially anymore since it seems he's now well adjusted in our workplace, but I am just wondering. Why is he being so much sensitivity towards me? I'd just like to gain some perspective so your answers would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!"

Its okay to show vulnerability and emotions. In fact, it shows how powerful you are because you are in such control of the situation. What have you really got to lose? Being rejected is a good chance to move on, develop your personality and emotions, and become a stronger, more powerful individual. The whole dont text him he doesnt want you mentality is toxic to you, the texter, and I can guarantee with that mindset the textee probably has no idea you feel that way towards them. COMMUNICATION IS SEXY! And I can assure you your crush will appreciate it. This comes from my own experience lusting over a boy for 6 weeks, and spending the entire time fighting the urge to text him to hang out after we went on a date and he thought it would be better to stay in contact and be friends. Now hes moving 500 miles away in a couple weeks and Im distraught because its too late to start over again. Hes been on my mind every single day since and I can guarantee he has no idea Im this stupidly hung up on him. But now its too late. TEXT YOUR CRUSH SO YOU WONT REGRET NOT DOING IT LIKE I DID!"

Ever since this realisation, I've felt extremely insecure, anxiety ridden and fearful...I'm overanalysing his behaviour, looking for signs he's considering to leave me and engaging in self sabotaging behaviours as a result of this fear (picking fights, acting evasive and aloof, overthinking why he hasn't called me today and driving myself insane etc etc)...does anyone who has had experience with this fear of vulnerability have any advice for me?

But on Reddit, Im finding more and more that one perspective always gets pushed to the top. You spend too much time on this website and your worldview will get seriously warped. I call this perspective the archetypal Redditor. They hate all other social media. They dont text and they dont know anyone who likes texting: they only text to hang out. Their idea of a fun night is staying home. Theyre liberal, theyd support socialism, but at the same time they think women and minorities complain too much. They say they arent sexist, but theyll tell you how all women have shallow preferences in male bodies (height, race, etc) and despise vulnerability  apparently only men can have complex reasons for feeling attraction. If you talk about parties, theyll make some awkward joke about not having a social life. If you talk about sex, theyll make an awkward joke about being forever alone or virgins late in their life. They got no matches on tinder when they tried it, they think dating apps are toxic and only useful for the best looking people. They cringe at people posting dance videos online. They cringe at people acting romantic. They cringe at anyone taking a risk socially or romantically because theyd never do the same. A lot (but not all) of the traits I listed above are fine to have. They can be explained by the loudest voices on this website being people who are introverted or are shy socially, or are nerds/misfits. Thats cool. But please dont get all your perspectives from here. And dont be surprised if you talk to other people and watch movies and realize that what society and people are like is completely at odds with what Reddit is like."

Last night I [M47] assisted an X [F32] with a ride to a social gathering. I was going out anyway so I said I would help. On the way she said she will be early cause she doesnt want any of her friends to know we still talk. To me that was hurtful. I didnt express it at the time though. We were just chatting now and I told her that her behaviour or actions sometimes causes me frustration or hurt. I brought up the example of last night. Her response, I cant make you feel anything. Now fundamentally I believe I understand this logic or at least I think I do. It is true that she doesnt or shouldnt have the power or ability to hurt me. It is only through my vulnerability to be open to her behaviour that I hurt myself. Is this how it should be interpreted?"

Its been great, we hang out, he takes me out on dates, we talk and share things like actual friends. But lately he has mentioned at least 2-3 times that we are strictly casual, which I dont have a problem with. We see each other probably twice a week at most and we dont talk everyday, thats as casual as you can get right? So I dont understand why he keeps on verbalising that we are just casual and temporary? Do some people have the propensity to refuse to show any vulnerability and act tough to put their walls up? (Do keep in mind that him and his past FWB ended up catching feelings for each other and they decided to go serious however it didnt end well.) Or is he communicating that he sees no future of us dating at all? Another thing is, he keeps mentioning that he does not want to share me. And he told me he is the type of guy who doesnt see multiple girls at a time. Okay, fair enough. Yet he implies that our situation is kind of just a placeholder until he finds someone or I find someone. Im not sure how a situation like that would work out if we are not seeing other people. As my friend said why doesnt he just cuff you? I understand that I can only get the answers that I want from the guy himself, which I am planning to do. I was just wondering if any one of you have been in the same situation? Im hoping your replies will give me a bit of clarity, cheers."
9,vulnerability,dating_advice,Conundrum Regarding Overtly Expressing Sexual Intent VS Unattractive Emotional Vulnerability,1,ifkggl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ifkggl/conundrum_regarding_overtly_expressing_sexual/,2020-08-24 17:24:15,"I seem to have this problem with this particular girl I'm in an on and off again relationship. We've had sex in the past, but it's been few and far between. What gives me anxiety is making my sexual intention clear. For example, when we first started hanging out, I've gone in for kisses and I was given cheek. Later on, it just sporadically happens when we hang. At one point, when she asked me to hang out, I made it clear that I only want to hang out if it's on a sexual context. I've told her this numerous times and I can tell she gets annoyed by it - it's often met with sarcasm, ambiguity, or just straight up flaky behaviour. I've rationalized to myself that maybe expressing my sexual intentions overtly comes across as insecure and outcome-dependent. I've done that, and it ends up being a roll of the dice when we hang out, and I just hate wasting my time like that. So I've decided in my mind that I don't want to hang out with her anymore because it's too much of a headache. She just reached out and has literally begged me to hang out, and I want to make it perfectly clear to her about why I don't want to hang out (I don't want to flat out ignore her or act passive aggressive). **Do you think it makes sense to explain this whole situation to her or should I just let this one go? If I express my feelings about this, what do you think I should say?**"

12,vulnerability,dating_advice,Toxic people know I can be a punching bag for them.. which could have made me over react to a guys immature behavior,1,iil7vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/iil7vu/toxic_people_know_i_can_be_a_punching_bag_for/,2020-08-29 13:06:54," When I[19F] was 11 I became best friends with a girl I thought was extremely sweet and behaved that way for a while. It started with slightly tearing me down, isolating me from friends and trying to cut me off from good friends by tricking me theyre bad which didnt work so shed try to steal them, to direct insults, not allowing me to feel any happiness towards myself or hear a compliment, to changing who I am . I never treated her the same horrible way she did to me. I became guarded, unable to be vulnerable, or accept responsibility for 5 years. She had no empathy or care if she hurt me. If someone called me sweet shed scream saying I wasnt.. yet treated me as a best friend and spent everyday with me. I never stood up for myself or got even a little upset for her saying horrible things about me bc she convinced me they were true. If a normal person doesnt like someone, they act distant but this girl spent every second trying to hurt me. I had such healthy, happy friendships before her and never felt the way I did with her. She made me so defensive around her. Since I had to act defensive around her as a defense mechanism, i fully believed that I was the problem. Since I blamed myself I was so hurt bc I acted in a way that wasnt me and believed I was horrible when I knew I was a good person. Until Im accepted she was at fault, I struggled for years. I subtly tried to seem perfect, couldnt show vulnerability, accept responsibility, and would rarely say a backhanded compliment to friends who didnt deserve it. She made me afraid to show empathy, pain, or appreciation towards others. When I was 15 about a year after we lost friendship.. she was in my gym class. I think she saw how happy I was and Id notice her always staring at me with a genuine smile. It was like she was observing me and was desperate to be around me. At age 17, she had a gym class with my friend and told my friend she thought I was a bitch. My friend said how it seemed like she missed me. Shed unfollow and refollow me on instagram daily for months despite us never speaking. I wouldnt blame her for all of this, but knowing shes still talking about me years later when she has no clue who I am shows me she cant be healthy. Id assumed shed changed and grown so its funny shes unable to feel this way of others. I feel like I have a deep rooted fear of this because of my friend and manipulative mother. I let people treat me like punching bags and I feel like horrible people see that and want it. The confusing part is, abuse begins so slow that by the time its serious.. these people change the victim. Its hard to tell their intentions because they almost seem like theyre infatuated with me. I really try to see the best in people &amp; emphasize with others and believe they wouldnt purposefully hurt someone but its hard to understand how someone would want to abuse like this. TL;DR Ive never met someone else abusive like her and her effect on me has gone. Ive realized I am a good person and she cant take that from me. Im not sure if I would call the girl an abuser because we were so young but its hard to not. The problem is that at my age the majority of people use stupid tactics in dating and may over react when hurt. They try to make someone they like jealous, miscommunication is common, in experience, immaturity, and more contribute to an overall toxic dating environment. I think I panicked when I noticed a guy had a slight manipulative nature when everyone can be at times. He seemed to have this huge crush on me but was clearly struggling and nervous around me. We both communicated poorly and yeah. But he said something &amp; when I told him it was rude of him he said not once did I say that twice. I felt so dismissed and controlled. I understand he may have thought I was over reacting but thats an odd way for a usual sweet/shy guy to talk. Eventually after a confusion and hurt feelings I drunk texted him.. I was kinda panicked and angry and was extremely rude. I apologized but him &amp; I werent on amazing terms. A months went by without seeing each other. He was seeing someone else but seemed panicked and nervous to talk to me for an entire party. When he eventually came up to me I was quick to turn away from him annoyed. (I didnt mean to it was just natural). The next time I saw him he continued coming up to me and it seemed like he was trying to prove to himself he wasnt scared of me.. but he was acting intimidating/cold/petty. Id been kinda trying to avoid him but he came up a bunch. I sometimes wonder if my over reaction made me the toxic one. I only recently realized I have an abusive mother and friend so at the time didnt understand lying in a manipulative way would cause me to over react. He did a lot of stupid, insecure, hurtful things but they were all kind of typical things for a guy our age. I feel like he may be a good guy and I just got horrified.. but Im also scared he may be like the toxic friend. Im not sure why he was still so interested in me after Id sent the long hurtful text. My friends also noticed hed always stare at me than and for months after."

Jen says she must learn to love herself before she can love someone else. That made me like her more, I did let her know I was interested in her  not everyday I meet someone as certain of what they want and where they are at at life. OFC I took a step back because I myself also needed some self-growth. I realise I developed insecurities from my previous relationship and I don't want to bring that in for her to deal with. No one deserves to deal with someone else's insecurities that they didnt cause (thats what I believe). So, I understood her and decided to support her and grow as a person with her. Then I recently met up with a group of friends for a drinking session and this girl who I previously had a crush on (lets call her Kat) was also there. background story: I never persue her because we had mutual friends and its best to probably be just friends. I had a crush on her for 2 months until I eventually gave up, since I wasn't even planning to go further with whatever. Back to the story, we were drinking and yea confessions were made. Kat told me she noticed that I liked her and asked why I never pursue. We had a good laugh about our talking stage and how it ended. She was teasing me of the times I was simping for her and surprisingly she was aware of it all. The day after, my relationship with Kat just got stronger and our conversation has become more often. She started flirting and lets just say there was more effort being done from her side, compared to before. Now to my confusion and uncertainty to what I am feeling. There is Jen, she is sweet, cute and vulnerability is second nature to her I LOVE IT. She knows what she wants and what she likes but right now she is unavailable. I could say I am also not available because of the insecurities I have to fix but now that Kat is here, ready for a relationship, she is great too, not going to lie, Jen and Kat are both strong independent women. They both know what they want. I wonder whether I should wait for Sabrina or rekindle it with Kat. The fact that I'm even thinking of rekindling it makes me wonder if I just made my need for ""self-growth"" an excuse to make myself feel better. My attraction is to Sabrina right now, and I can't imagine liking Kat the way I used to like her, but its possible. Now my question is should I. I think both of them are WORTH IT.

My dating history is VERY limited; I've been on three first dates in my life and had my first kiss near the end of 2019. Unfortunately, that ended when she decided to move to another city and wasn't interested in continuing to build the relationship beyond what it was. She's someone I'm still on great terms with and reach out to occasionally to see how she's doing and such. I don't share this as any sort of brag or anything, but I think the context may be helpful. In the past, my feelings regarding a relationship were more about actually HAVING a girlfriend more than anything; I felt defective for never having had one and at times it felt like a monkey that needed to be off my back. Those are feelings I don't struggle with much anymore following getting SOMETHING under my belt. Now I feel lonely in a different kind of way. I have many great friendships with both men and women whom I can rely on when needed, but there's simply a level of companionship that I wish I had that comes in a romantic relationship. Just someone who's consistently interested in who I am, who wants to spend time with me, and perhaps just cares about me on a deeper level. I actually had an intense impulse for several weeks to adopt a puppy as a way to cultivate a relationship resembling long-term companionship (I didn't give in though lol). To those whose first reaction is along the lines of self-investment, I think I'm doing well in the self-growth department. I've been in weekly therapy to work through my vulnerability/depression issues, lost 160lbs, been enrolled in a master's degree to build my dream career while working full-time. Again, I hope this doesn't come off as braggadocious, but instead just shows that I'm not sitting on my laurels. ANNNNNNNYWAY, has anyone felt something similar to what I'm going through? It'd be nice to know I'm not alone in these feelings and I'd love to read about others' experiences with them too."

He asked to meet up and I agreed but honestly as a bigger girl there is always this vulnerability and fear, and I just couldnt shake this feeling off. I reversed google searched his image and it came up with someone entirely different in a whole different country. I asked him if he was who he was claiming to be and he said of course hed have to say yes. Long story short I told him I reversed googled one of his photos (I know I seem crazy but gotta protect myself) and it came back with someone else. I pretty much asked him to come clean, I dont want to be made a fool of if possible and that I enjoyed talking to him. I received no response for a good half hour and he blocked me in POF. So I was wondering if anybody been catfished before? If so how did you handle it?"

We seemed to have a nice easiness in conversation. We went out once and at the end of the date we realized we lived in the same building on the same floor, just a few doors down from each other. Perfect! Soon after our date he sent me a text telling me that he was too busy right now to date me. I was sad about that. And then a day later he starts sending me really flirty texts indicating that he would like to have casual sex. Finally, after several unanswered late night phone calls, he sends a message saying that if I want him to stop pursuing me for the casual thing, he will stop. I responded by telling him that although I want have something casual, Im not at a place where this type of relationship is the best thing for me. Things to know: Ive never had sex and have been working through lots of issues are purity culture and sex. In therapy and moving towards a healthier relationship with sex. The same day I sent that text, I run into him in the hall. Its a very sexy exchange and we make out a little until I stop everything and walk away. After that, maybe a week later we catch up with each other again. He comes over and we make out. Things get intimate though we dont have sex. After conversations with my therapist and my friends I decide that maybe I can do some sexy exploration with him. It would be fun and be good baby steps for me. And it might result in p-in-v sex but maybe not. It would be free and casual and fun. This is essentially what I told him in a voice note (I tried to make it sound light and positive). Was it too much?: So last time I saw you I mentioned I didnt really have a lot of experience with sex. And I know I mentioned something about working through personal things with sex and intimacy etc. I have had negative experience but I want my next experience to be positive. So my proposal is that since youre offering up your body to me to use it how I want. I need to have some exploration. Like freshman exploration. I can go into more detail later if you are so inclined. He didnt respond. Did I spook him? Was I too honest? I feel so stupid and am having a vulnerability hangover bad. tldr: virginal me offered to explore my sexuality with a casual partner and he hasnt responded yet. Did I do something wrong?"

She has opened up to me when she was at vulnerable parts in her life and I appreciate that because I am someone who doesnt really hide anything so Im not really vulnerable in giving info in that sense. My true vulnerability however is that I dont know how to express how I feel. Ive spoken to a lot of people on the app and I feel like this is the first time Im actually making a possible connection, with quarantine and everything going on however Im not sure howll shell feel about meeting since I dont want her to put her or her family at risk and the same goes for me but Im willing to put that aside for her. I genuinely care about her and I hope she feels the same way about me else she wouldnt be texting me. Tomorrow we have a 2nd face time date, do I express that I care about her and I would like to make something with her in the time we have left ( she lives in another province for varsity but for now shes like a 45min drive away) or do I try to play it cool. My gut and intuition are telling me I should say how I feel, any advice????"
22,vulnerability,dating_advice,for those in relationships &amp; also suffer with a mental disorder - any advice?

It was in a bar that Ive never been to before, we got confused because the place was so big, we were on the opposite ends of the building. When we finally met up, we had a laugh about it. We continued to have some fantastic banter back-and-forth, laughing and giggling with each other. I walked her to her car after a great night, a few hours had passed. We were both smiling and chatting, she turned to me and grabbed me and we made out. She said she had a great time that night, messaging me as soon as she got home, I replied and told her I did as well. The next day was busy, so I messaged her the following day and brought up something we had discussed on the night. We messaged backed and forth for a bit, finally I messaged her telling her I wanted to see her again. I asked her, so when are you free next week to hang out again? No response. I waited a day, no response. I waited another day, no response. I found it ironic, during the date we had spoken about ghosting and how a guy had done it to her and how she didnt appreciate it, ironic, I thought. A situation like this four or five years ago wouldve had me reeling with annoyance. I would have thought about it for days, perhaps even weeks later. Instead, now, I actually felt solace, like I had done on many other dates before her that didn't work out. Here's some unpopular dating advice, women/men don't owe you shit. Lately Ive been seeing a lot of posts about, being honest with the person, if youre not interested just tell them, sorry to burst your bubble, but people don't owe you anything. I dont know if its our generation, in which we feel like we are entitled for an explanation as to why someone doesn't want to see us again, but it seems like people are almost throwing a tantrum when they dont get, what they want. I see a lot of posts about people who seem to continually spend time with somebody who appears to not be that interested in them. My advice to people like this, who complain about being strung along, is to not be there in the first place. That is, if you have to ask, whether or not someone likes you, then theres your answer. There should be no ambiguity, they are either into you or not. In other words, if you are being strung along, its entirely your fault. I know that sounds a little Unpc, and yeah it made me squirm a little bit when I first realised it, but its true. If youre going to set loose boundaries, if youre gonna let people walk all over you then its your fault for allowing that person to do so. If youre willing to let people cancel dates last minute, if youre willing to let people sleep with other people when you want to be exclusive, then thats on you. Your willingness to let these people do this is a direct representation of your investment in them, In other words youre far too invested in them than your own values and needs. You are willing to put up with people who are simply not that into you. This isnt targeting anybody in particular, but telling people that they need to tell the person if theyre not interested, Is simply derived from a seeded belief that people should conclude an emotional venture, no matter how long it went for. Its ferried from neediness, a need to have your own needs met, a need to know. HOW DARE THEY NOT REPLY TO MY MESSAGES, HOW DARE THEY NOT SLEEP WITH ME. HOW DARE THEY START SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE, even though their actions clearly showed you that they werent interested. Here is some solid dating advice for you: 1. If you set the tone of the relationship in the beginning, and if you display some vulnerability and tell them exactly what you want, then your boundaries are set, what you are and not willing to put up with is cemented. This isnt about being an asshole, it just means you have high investment in yourself and you know what you want. It means, if they try to test your boundary, you hold your line. Look Im not after that, and you walk away and mean it. Not only has this brought women back into my life, but it has improved every relationship I have been in. 2. If somebody acts like they dont care, believe them. Why do you need to verbally hear, look Im just not into you. Basically you made a funny sound the other night and it reminded me of my ex partner. I thought about my ex partner and now that funny sound is stuck in my head, and Im not ready to move on. Because of that I cannot be with you any more, therefore I shall leave you. Do you know how ridiculous that sounds? Do you really think the person is gonna tell you the complete truth anyway? Nobody is ever gonna tell you the complete truth, and sometimes they simply dont know why they dont like you, they just dont! So fuck it. Do you really have such a lonely life, that you need someone to fill it? Men especially need to realise that if someone isnt interested in them, then they were never going to be happy in the relationship anyway. News flash you have other problems, go out and experience the world. Just to conclude this, people dont need to tell you why they dont like you, and no one owes you an explanation. Unfortunately a lot of people in this world, are just going to ghost you. Some people have had some seriously negative experiences with people, and they would much prefer just to walk away and not have to deal with the emotional abuse that may come from it. Some of you are saying well the majority of people arent like that, they are stable people. How the fuck do you know? Come back to me when youve been on hundreds of dates, and have heard about the stories from hundreds of people, horror stories and narcissistic people that make you think twice about ever dating again. Sorry to say, but there is a vast majority of people out there that have seriously emotional problems, and are willing to lash out or even emotionally manipulate, or verbally attacked somebody if theyre not willing to see them again. The bottom line is, you take what you get, what youre willing to put up with and what youre willing to stick with is an example of your own self worth. Hopefully people read this, I want this to hit home for a few of you. The only true dating advice out there is self improvement. You must be OKAY with being single before you allow someone to accompany you in your life. Edit: Grammatical errors. Edit 2: Im not going to get into details about past experiences. I feel like I have commented enough, maybe too much about specific details, and I would prefer to stay on topic to what is discussed. Feel free to message me, much more privately. I dont particularly want my personal life paraded around reddit, even though my username is discrete. In case you havent realised, I like a good discussion. This isnt a rant, and to clarify Im not butthurt by the girl in the story. She was a cool girl, and I wouldnt wish any Ill intent on her. Im being sincere about it. Final Edit: Just wanted to say thanks for the awards!! All I wanted was to move peoples perspectives into a different direction, I was also sick of seeing posts of entitlement. Im getting a lot of messages, I appreciate it, Im also glad it helped a lot of people. Im trying to reply to them all, might take me some time. For those of you who are questioning the validity of the story... well Im not going to waste my time replying on that sort of thing, so dont bother save your time. Theres another story I wrote similar 3yrs back, check it out through my profile, it happens. Also, just to make it clear, messaging the person after the date telling them you werent interested, Is common courtesy, its also a good hearted thing to do. The point is, youre not entitled to it. The fact of the matter is, you shouldnt need it or require it. A lot of you are missing the idea behind it, if someones shitty then theyre not worth your time anyway, so what does it matter? Because it makes you feel better? Regardless of whether or not I get an excuse after, I still have my answer, She isnt interested. Appreciate it! Thanks."

We've gone on serious dates, talked on the phone and text daily. He's not afraid to tell me he likes me. He lives about 70 min away but comes in town a lot with family. It's an easy drive and nbd to me. He recently asked me to open up more so we can move forward. I expressed vulnerability wasn't easy but worked through it. I was starting to feel excited to find someone I really clicked with and actually could open up to! I honestly thought I had him wrapped around my finger. We haven't had sex (my choice) but I started to feel ready with him. So this past weekend, we were cuddling on the couch drinking wine when he started asking me how I felt about us being distanced. I was clear it didn't bother me. He started going off about how he's unsure he could be in a relationship thats distanced. I started to tear up out of shock and disappointment. He babbled on and basically said he just liked how we were progressing. He spent the night and acted totally normally all day. Called me when he was home and apologized for it all- he said he didn't mean it and wasn't sure where it came from. I told him I wasn't interested in seeing someone if they already made up their mind a relationship was out of the question. Now it's been 4 days and I feel so guarded. Any one have insight on how to move forward? I don't want to be 'used.' For reference, I've been in abusive and unfaithful relationships in the past."

To pass the time (and to scratch an itch that I've had for years), I started taking Spanish lessons online. I had intro lessons with four different tutors, one of whom I immediately felt comfortable with and connected to. Comfort was so important to me because of the vulnerability of learning a new language. So I booked a series of 6 online lessons (2x week for hour each). I'm on sessions like 10 at this point. It turns out that my chosen tutor and I have very similar backgrounds, and through broken/5-year old level Spanish, I'm learning bits and pieces that suggest we are peas in a pod. She's truly wonderful. It's blowing my mind. Unfortunately, Im terrified that she thinks I'm an idiot because 90% of our conversation is at a first grade level where I forget the most basic words and have to sound out words one syllable at a time. I've been studying like 10 hrs a week in the hopes of being able to actually talk to her a little. Am I crazy for wanting to learn Spanish well enough so that I can actually speak with her, get to know her, show her I'm not an idiot, and ask her out? I'm one of those bizarrely committed people, so I'm feeling myself starting to embark on a two year journey of learning Spanish. But I also feel crazy for even thinking about it. Of course another challenge is that we live in different countries, but that's a problem for another day (I guess?). Am I crazy? I've been really lonely during covid, so I kinda worry I'm just latching onto what's obviously a bit of a pipe dream in the hopes of finding a distraction. But maybe that's ok? Maybe it's ok to chase after fairy tales sometimes? P.S., like half of the US, I took Spanish in high school and college but forget 90%."

The knee jerk response may be to find someone I feel relaxed and comfortable around, and be honest about the fact I've never been in a longterm relationship + my sex life is very lacklustre, but I'm not actually sure that's the healthiest approach. It's almost like I'm setting myself up for failure in both of our eyes? Perhaps just being myself and acting as confident as possible, and only disclosing what I need to if she literally asks me about it might be the better way to go? The first approach may feel like I'm taking a weight off my shoulders but it would be quite unattractive (let's be honest it's not that endearing when someone admits that in their mid 20's) and even a bit of a red flag which might have never needed to be raised in the first place. The latter approach may cause me to feel more pressure to play up to the role, but it's much more attractive and there's a good chance that if we click well then everything will fall into place and I won't have needed to over disclose anything.

I hope thats okay. Ive always been a closed off person. Not necessarily with friendships (Im really easygoing) but sharing feelings deeper than surface level. I cant say in my entire life Ive ever entirely opened up to someone, even though my 2 best friends have no problem opening up to me - so this is kinda big for me to be spreading it out online. Ive grown up in an English household - so theres no shocker I avoid vulnerability and instead mask it with humour. I have a father who didnt treat me well emotionally during my adolescent years, which I know has impacted my self esteem and also allowing myself to be vulnerable around other people. During high school were my friends were seeking out boys and hooking up, I preferred to stay home. I know there isnt anything wrong with that - but I do feel like its made me have no clue how to approach dating or even online dating. I did have my first kiss last year, while I was drunk and dancing with a guy at night club. It was horrendous but luckily the alcohol masked the realisation until the next morning. The guy was really sweet to me during the night and when we talked the next day, but when I began to properly think about it, I instantly backed off and basically ghosted him. I realised I was nowhere ready for a relationship, especially with other factors adding to it (we lived in different cities and I was constantly going back and forth cities for university). I knew the reasons I backed off were because I was almost guaranteed to get my feelings hurt with all of these things into play. I feel like a year of properly being my own person and maturing, Im ready to put myself out there. I want to try Tinder but Im really intimidated. I was wondering for tips on how to do my bio without seeming cringey, and also how to present myself better via messages as I find it difficult it put my humour in straight away as it can sometimes offend people. I have English humour (mostly dark) but live in Australia. It would be really appreciated. Thanks in advance  EDIT: looking for something genuine. Which is better - tinder or bumble for that goal?"

IDK why. Maybe someone will find this interesting. Abuse occurred around age 10-11. When I was about 17, I had a vivid nightmare of my abuser laughing at me and saying no one will ever love you until you fix yourself, which you never will. I spent a long time trying to prove that memory wrong, but relationships would always fizzled out. I only had one relationship that seemed like it would last &amp; I fully opened up- she was very supportive and loving; eventually, my insecurity and weakness proved to be too much so she ended things. I dont blame her. Nothing kills attraction for a woman like a man being weak. I found it increasingly difficult to open up; experience taught me over and over that all attachments are fickle and showing my vulnerability to women sounds good to them in theory but in reality, it always makes their attraction to me evaporate on a subconscious level outside of their control. Once I made peace with the fact I would never find love, I had lots of casual sex and flings. I moved up in management and ended up leading a complex network of supply sites abroad. I had 87 people working for me from different nationalities. Knowing I didnt &amp; wouldnt ever matter to anyone made me a very empathetic and compassionate leader. I mentored, coached &amp; promoted many people up through the organization. I did anything I could to add value to my employees lives. When I left, I had four going away parties thrown for me (two from different unions my employees worked under, one from regional HQ &amp; one from my entire branch). My employees truly loved me as a boss and I literally had grown-men crying and embracing me.... My employer promoted me up into a position thats located in the US in a college town that looks exactly like my undergrad campus a place where I first worked though my abuse. I never thought triggers were that big of a thing until I arrived here. Now, Ive relapsed to a 20 year old version of myself &amp; am in a never ending fight-or-flight mental hell. Im stiff, anxious and no where near the confident successful leader I spent a decade building myself into. Im quitting my job and torching my career. I dont care anymore. Also, Ive had zero genuine human interactions since arriving here. Its like relapsing back to the loneliness of being a weak boy who wears his unattractive weakness on his sleeve. I feel like Ive come too far to fall back to this... but here it is. In the end, human attachments are remarkably unremarkable and my experiences have taught me what the near future will be like. Its just all so disappointing how theres no poetry in life. Fuck all of this.. but it is what it is."

I believed he was too good for me: sweet, smart, cute and gifted in art, sports and science. When we were together Id cry out of laughter and I probably had the best dates ever with him. But without being conscious at the time, I was afraid I was not good enough. We met up yesterday in a group and I was looking around at our female friends and I was like: that was the right decision, hed be better with someone funnier, prettier, smarter and not boring as me. But I dont want to feel like this every time I find someone I like and find amazing and like out of my league  He has moved on btw and Im happy for him. At the end I disappointed him by thinking Id disappoint him... Hes so cool and he deserves someone as amazing as he is. And so do you random person reading this. Thanks for your time! Y."
34,vulnerability,dating_advice,Flirting advice for anyone who needs it,3,h9klgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/h9klgn/flirting_advice_for_anyone_who_needs_it/,2020-06-16 03:21:08,"My ex-boyfriend told me about 'Negging' (feel free to look it up), but it's basically when you playfully tease a woman instead of using pick-up lines. This may work in some cases (such as women with low self-esteem or experience). However, most men tend to be unnecessarily mean about this and thus lose out. I'd say, try negging but in a nicer way. Say nice things but keep it light people like people who make them feel good about themselves. Also, make sure it seems honest if you've just met them, you can't be too impressed by their work ethic. Stick to stuff you can know: appearance, choice of drink etc. Give a few personalised compliments and have some banter, maintain eye contact when they're talking, listen well. After a while of politeness, throw in a cheeky comment that will make them surprised at your boldness (shows confidence) and want to correct you to regain your approval. This will create chemistry and sexual tension and make them comfortable with you because it replicates how friends and family tease us. Make your compliments personalised don't just say ""you're pretty"", say something meaningful, which has some context, and say it with purpose and confidence: ""I'm sure you've heard this a plenty of times, but if you haven't, I couldn't help but let you know that you're the most beautiful woman in the room"". Don't linger though, let there be comfortable pauses give them the chance to initiate something after you have, so you'll know they want to talk to you too. Notable relationship psychologist, Esther Perel said that ""Desire is created in the space between two people, while intimacy is created by bridging the gap"". The way to maintain tension is to keep going back and forth. Also, play into their masculinity/femininity, (based on your assessment of how they're dressed, for example). But don't be too obvious do it through your actions and not just your words. Be gentlemanly towards women (open doors, walk on the side of the road, help while walking with heels, warm their hands if cold, hold firmly and protectively), and for men, compliment the things they're impressing you with (work ethic, gym routine), let them open doors for you, let them lead on the dance floor (if you want) and make a cheeky joke about how manly they are but only when you genuinely feel it. Most people can smell BS from far out. Don't overdo it, be authentic with what you feel like doing and are comfortable with. Basically, be playful and sweet 80% of the time but switch it up with something genuinely serious this shows that you're a fun person who also has depth. Talk to other people to show how social and easy-going you are, but never flirt with more than one person that's just douchebaggery. Also, pair this up with honesty. Talk about one of your insecurities that shows that you're human and confident about being vulnerable (such as how you also don't like ____ about yourself on some days), but the key to vulnerability is to never seem weak about it. Talk about your insecurity, but with self-awareness and always talk about what you're doing to overcome it. Shows that you are ambitious and serious about growth, which is a desirable quality. Flirting is about making the other person feel good by also making yourself look good, but in a way that they see you as a person of value that they would want to be with (whether for one night/dating). You'll get attention when you're genuine about your value when you're truly a valuable person. Tricks can only get you so far. And also, relationships are about a genuine connection, which can only happen when their authentic personality meaningfully connects with yours. If you're not too successful with someone, think of it as divine intervention you just didn't click and saved yourself weeks/months/years from an unhappy relationship. Posted this as a comment on this sub-reddit but I thought it might be useful to more people."

I have CPTSD from some of the things that happened in that relationship. I've been going to therapy to work out the trauma, but I can't deny that there are some lingering trust issues. I've been dating this new person for around 3 months now, and we have very high compatibility. I've never previously had an experience where the chemistry was just instantaneous like that. A couple weeks ago, we had our first fight. Tldr; it was about politics and it got really messy because I started to have a meltdown/partial flashback, and he got really defensive about his ego. I tried my best to employ tactics that would leave chances for mutual vulnerability and understanding, but he didn't take the bait. I don't think he really understood my side until I vented to a mutual friend, and she talked to him on my behalf. We both said a lot of really nasty things to each other, but ultimately when things calmed down after a few days, we apologized and he even said that I was probably the one that was more ""in the right"" in that situation. I've talked about trust with my therapist a lot. I""m trying to get better at recognizing which fear responses are just from past trauma, and which responses are actually trying to tell me something. But I just can't shake this feeling now. It's like the floodgates of insecurity open every time. I still have a lot of issues navigating arguments because my ex was really manipulative, so I have a hard time deciphering what's even happening amidst the emotional flashbacks. If I can be totally honest, sometimes I don't even remember what I do or say in arguments any more. It just becomes a mental block and it's hard to apologize for things I don't remember doing or saying. I'll have periods where everything is wonderful and happy, and then periods where I'll remember the argument and I just don't want to talk to him or interact with him at all. I get scared that he's not really the person he is in my head. Every time I get the feeling, I have to sit down and make an objective list of all the good things about him, and all the bad things. That usually helps me put things back into perspective, but not always. I'm not really sure what to do any more. I want to be able to trust him."
36,vulnerability,dating_advice,Was I a bad person for being in contact with my ex while seeing/dating someone new,1,heqglv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/heqglv/was_i_a_bad_person_for_being_in_contact_with_my/,2020-06-24 10:17:19,"Hi I was with my ex for 3.5 years and the break up was really bad since it was mediated by external factors i.e. family input. My parents placed so much pressure on me to break up with my ex-partner due to religious differences, and I felt extremely drained by the end of the process. I moved out for a couple of weeks until I realised for myself that despite my family, this person was not good for me de to their character. Instead of taking my time in ending things, I broke up right away and went back home to my family. However, due to the pre-mature break up, my mind was scattered and I did not feel like myself for a while. He tried to get in contact with me many times after the break up and since I was not myself, my vulnerability took over and I caved into speaking to him. After 2 months of speaking back and forth with my ex, I decided I needed to try and move on. I never planned on meeting or entering a new relationship so soon, but I met someone who was different and who I had excellent chemistry with. I tried cutting my ex out of my life after I met this person, but he tried to keep contacting me multiple times after the break up. He guilt tripped me into thinking I was a horrible person for finding happiness with someone else so quickly and that he was having suicidal thoughts. I will not deny, I felt like I still had unresolved feelings for my ex while speaking to this new person. At one point, I was very conflicted and felt like I had feelings for two people at once. I rushed things with this new person instead of setting a foundation of friendship until I was ready to commit which is my biggest regret. The new guy I met knew I was still in contact with my ex and said it was okay. Eventually, one day, my ex contacted me and begged me to see him to establish our confused feelings for one another. I turned down his request multiple times but he kept insisting, I gave in since I still cared for this person and their wellbeing. While hanging out with him on that day, one thing lead to another and we ended up sleeping with each other. After it happened I felt so disgusted with myself and knew that it was over for me so I cut my ex out. I told the guy I was dating and he was upset but told me to put it behind us and to move on from this incident. After this incident, my ex started telling me he had suicidal thoughts which scared me a lot, so I didnt know how to cut him out during this process. Eventually, the new guy and I had some issues of our own external from my ex and I took some time out and told him I wanted to break up since I was not ready for anything right now. During the break up with this new person, my ex called to try and establish friendship since his mental health was suffering. I went to see whether we could be friends and yet again, we slept together. Disclaimer: my past relationship only constituted physical intimacy for the most part and that's all we knew. At this point, I started vomiting, I couldnt finish with him and I hated myself yet again. I thought to myself, I made this mistake once, why did I think it would be any different now? At that point, I cut my ex out completely and he was no longer involved in my life at all. I started talking to the new guy again and we reconnected, we remained friends for a month and I told him about the second incident. He said he didnt really consider that any form of cheating since we had broken up but he was still very upset. I cut my ex completely out of my life and me and this new guy decided to start a new slate and put the past behind us. He said he didnt consider the past a relationship since we both had issues and were not ready for a commitment. I learnt a lot from my experiences but I feel disgusted and unforgiving of myself for doing such a thing. Any advice on how to move past this and whether Im a bad person?"
37,vulnerability,dating_advice,I have really bad relationship anxiety.,1,hfz8bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/hfz8bn/i_have_really_bad_relationship_anxiety/,2020-06-26 12:21:15,Ive been extremely unhappy and worried this past month because of my relationship anxiety. It started off small but it later became severe. Or severe to me and my mental health. Ive been dating my boyfriend for a year now. And hes very loving and sweet but in his own way... mostly when were alone together hell cuddle me and grab and kiss me. He used to have trouble with his vulnerability but he become more vulnerable. He has his moments where he can be mean and joke about things that can come off as rude. Now I can tell when hes joking and when hes not. They dont really bother me but as time went on and we got closer I would have a bunch of doubts and thoughts going through my mind.. oh my god what if he wasnt joking What if hes covering up the truth with humor. And sometimes when Im not with him I just think about things he did in the past like where he wouldnt reply fast enough or he wouldnt heart a comment and Id think what if hes talking to another girl what if he doesnt like me what if he doesnt like talking to me? What if he hates our conversations? does he thing Im boring? But I always ask about it and try to communicate and he tells me that since we now have real life he doesnt text me often and that we dont really talk like that during text anymore because we have great conversations irl. And i look like an idiot for overreacting. It got to the point where I would think about it al the time and it would make it hard to sleep or think or eat. I told my boyfriend this and he said I mean the world to him and he loves me. He always reassured me and comforted me the best he could. But now his words dont comfort me and I worry more. It makes me feel sick. My boyfriend has always been introverted and he always likes to stay home and be alone. Hes never lived with anyone really so he likes his own space. He doesnt want me to come over often because he gets drained from being with me all day. (Not in a bad way) just where hes out of energy and he gets real sleepy. I feel the same way. I feel really out of energy too and we both agreed on that. But I always want to come over because Im bored easily at home and hes not. My mind starts to overthink and I wonder if its because I love him more than he loves me it that hes not into me anymore or that he hates being with me. I know it sounds silly but me and him both agreed on the fact that it comes from my broken childhood. I have clingy and abandonment issues. I know a lot of you are going to suggest therapy but I cant afford it. Trust me I would get it if I could but I cant. I need something that will actually help me in the meantime to ease my relationship anxiety Got any tips?

A lot. And it kind of pisses me off. Let me just say that he is not a BAD person. Hes helped me through some pretty rough times and I like being around him because I can fully be myself, no walls up, total vulnerability. We can talk about anything which I appreciate. And hes so INTERESTING. I love to have deep conversations but I, sadly, dont get to have them often enough. But while I really like this guy, I dont like everything he says or does. It particularly pissed me off when he started rating a group of girls who are sisters by how hot they are (and dont worry, I always call him out on this behavior). This isnt the first guy that Ive been attracted to like this either. Im always attracted to the know it all kind of guy who just says and does what he wants and doesnt really care what others think. I think this is because Im naturally a really caring person, so in a way being with this kind of guy is my way of fullfilling that life that Ive never made for myself. I know Im a lot better than to be attracted to someone like this! Im smart, kind, thoughtful, and strong. I deserve someone who cares more. But its like I cant HELP that I like him! What can I do? Do I cut off the friendship even though hes the one person I feel like I can be myself around?"

Im adequately smart, attractive, and kind. But I find myself always lonely and hard to get into a relationship. Maybe its because Im too dull and cant handle emotions and vulnerability very well.

He tells me his vulnerability, goals and values, and he sounds interested in me as well -- he cares about me, paying attention, share what he likes, etc, etc. But sometimes I'm confused on whether he sees me only as a friend or someone to talk to. I'm kinda stuck in the talking stage. How am I supposed to talk about what he thinks of this relationship? I don't want to come off as pushy or in a rush of exclusivity. He had a bad breakup but assures me he dealt with it. Personally for me I like him but I'm okay if we take some space to get to know each other better.

Our chemistry was strong so we hooked up by third date. Even after hooking up we would have deep talks about family expectations, opened up about his vulnerability etc This was 3 months ago. During quarantine he would always reply to my IG stories but we barely talk, there's not much to go on about so I would always just like his replies. The only time I initiated a conversation was when he got a cat, I asked for pics &amp; he sent one. Got carried away, forgot to reply so I just liked the photo They're finally easing the lockdown where I live &amp; people can drive around freely now (roads were patrolled by police, roadblocks everywhere). Just a day before this rule was implemented he replied to my post saying 'hey it's finally over! Let's hang?' to which I said 'I thought it was a partial lift? No more roadblocks?' and since then I haven't heard back from him. Its been a week and I'm actually keen on seeing him, did I seem too uninterested? Should I text him again?"

Ive been ghosted plenty of times and have felt that despair. But Im confused on this one. Its a long one. Im a 22F who met a 21F on hinge (pre quarantine), and we started off talking easily and hitting it off great. It was the first time I felt like something could have came out of this. Problem is that we are both new in the LGBTQ+ community and dating in general, so we took it super slow, at least in getting to know each other first. I didnt mind, cause everything was new to me. Eventually she started to fade away, and I simply asked one day if she would be down to meet up. She said yes, and the convo continued between us steadily after, and we even exchanged social media. After awhile, she became really reliant on Snapchat, which was fine. But I was starting to hear from her less and less through text, and it was more or less texting a stranger. We did get to know each other slightly better, but not in the way I hoped. She went to school about 65 miles from me, so not too far. I definitely felt like she was losing interest at this point, so I decided to communicate with her and ask how she felt about us. I basically told her Id always think about visiting her at school, but wouldnt do that if she didnt feel the same way. I also said it was alright to end whatever this was if she wasnt feeling it. She apologized about the vagueness, but also admitted that she wasnt ready to be in a romantic relationship. Still, she wanted to eventually meet up and get to know each other better. So friends, right? She kept in touch steadily again, and I was fine with being friends with her. But the thing is, I felt like there was no effort on her part. I would try to start convos (not overwhelmingly. Maybe once a week since I know shes busy with school), but the enthusiasm and effort wasnt what I hoped for. Sometimes I wished she would have been honest with me, or hell, even ghost me like every normal dating app person would in the beginning. But I was understanding, and trying to convince myself she was new to this. She just wasnt the best communicator. Then I remember were just supposed to be friends, but shes even inconsistent with that. She even visited my city for fun and snapped me about that - she definitely knew I lived in this city and that really punched me in the gut. I wasnt sure if it was just ignorance, but probably. Fast forward to quarantine, and things are exactly the same. Weve never called, only snapchatted. Shes never interested in getting to know me anymore, and all our convos are very surface level. Even so, I try to make an effort to know her better, but it never gets very far. 5 months since I first talked to her and I still feel like a stranger. Thanks if youve read this long, so Im about to conclude this very lengthy mess. I want her out of my life, but I dont think she even cares that much about me. I dont like to ghost, Ive never ghosted anyone in my life cause I know how it feels. But if I open up to her again about how I felt, like how I did wish she was a better friend, or how maybe I did foolishly hold on to the fact that maybe things would work out if I waited, I dont think I could take that vulnerability again when I havent received that from her. Im afraid of ghosting her, but Im more afraid of putting myself out there again. As of now Ive just stopped responding to her snaps, but she hasnt reached out. What should I do? Is it ok to ghost? Or should I maybe wait for her to reach out so I can tell her how Ive been feeling? I feel crushed because I really dont want to hurt her, but it also seems like she doesnt care at the same time if I did ghost. Please be kind, I usually dont use Reddit to explain my thoughts but this time Ive been feeling very hopeless and drained "

I got out of a toxic relationship that was very short lived a year and a half ago and have not really been looking for anything. At this point, Ive been friends with Lilly for a good 7 months and she is such an amazing person. She is by far the most emotionally mature love interest Ive ever had, shes extremely sweet, entirely drama free, she has a strong self esteem (unlike other girls in the past that I seem to need constant affirmation which is totally exhausting!). Shes soooo easy to talk to, we just click so well with eachother. Whenever I open up to her about a vulnerability, shes always so accepting. I can literally tell her anything. And we click sooooo well as people. I can just talk to her for hours and Im always so happy to see her. I absolutely love spending time with her. And she gets along so well with all of my friends. Not just in the sense that my friends and lilly are cordial with eachother, but to the extent that shes become a permanent member of our friend group. Ive been a musician my entire life, playing many ma y instruments and many many genres. Ive explored a lot musically, and yet she literally has better music taste than I do. Shes always the one showing ME cool music which is something Ive never experienced before. Shes a very talented painter too, and gives the worlds best head scratches. Lilly is truly a gem of a human being But Ive felt so conflicted. I think shes cute but I keep feeling bothered by this feeling that Ive been with women I find way more physically attractive. I really care about Lilly, and I dont want to emotionally ruin her by dating her and then bailing. At this point we have messed around a handful of times and Have talked about how we feel for eachother. I dont want to tell her that I find other women more attractive physically, so Ive just been saying I feel apprehension because of how bad my last relationship was. Id say this is about 50% of the truth, so its not totally wrong. She feels attracted to me and is interested in a relationship, but shes been encouraging me to do what I think is best. She tells me she values our friendship very much and appreciates me being in her life in whatever way that is. Ugh, I just dont know what to do. On one hand Ive never ever clicked so hard with a girl, but on the other hand I cant help but feel that if I stay single maybe I could find a girl as cool but more physically attractive. I dont want to enter into a relationship with her unless I feel that it will be long lived. Again, I care about her deeply and dont want to hurt her. Shes talked to people in the past but has never been in an actual relationship. I keep thinking about other far more attractive women who have shown interest in me and then I feel like I am certain now I shouldnt date Lilly, I can do better or I want something sexier. But then I hang out with Lilly and Im so happy to see her. And I find her weird eccentricities endearing, like the way she dry heaves when she laughs. And then Im all what was I thinking earlier? I love spending time with her. Its weird, each time my opinion changes it feels so absolute. But it changes like 4 times a day. Lilly has thankfully been really patient with me because shes the empathetic kind and understands I feel apprehensive about dating in general What to do, what to do"

The only thing I got from the purgatory that is the dating game is _older_. I've heard every piece of dating advice anyone could ever give, and I've given everything I have just for a chance at finding the one. I've spent thousands on dating app subscriptions, new clothes, promising events and activities, and even took up ballroom dancing. Throw in the cost of therapy for coping with a solid decade of total and complete failure and a half dozen gym memberships, and you get an idea of how much of a financial, spiritual, mental and physical burden this little game is. I cling to the notion that it's going to happen eventually. Just right around the corner. Just a few hundred more swipes, just a few dozen more uncomfortable places and forced conversations... then I'll find somebody. It's the mentality of a gambler, an addict. What's the difference between clicking ""BUY NOW"" on yet another dating app feature, and pulling the arm of a crooked slot machine in the basement of some shady smoke-filled casino? I'm tired. I'm so very tired. I'm tired of being tired and bitter. At best I can pretend I'm not but I will never let go. And the greatest sign of being at the end of your rope? Getting in touch with your ex. You know the one who most certainly isn't the one. But it's a reminder that at some point a human being called you their significant other. It seems surreal to me these days. I'm sorry for the bitterness and the outbursts and the insecurity. Take this moment of clarity and vulnerability as my apology to everyone I was rude to unnecessarily."

Just as a disclaimer, I am not a guy, but I am human and will be subject to bias. That means there might be things that don't apply to you or you feel that I'm lacking in perspective, that's cool, I'm open to hearing different opinions! Although the title says letter, I often write letters in bullet points or 1-2-3, so hope you enjoy this slightly unconventional format! 1. Patriarchy and inequality are hard on guys too As a daughter to an incredibly hard-working father, I know (and have researched) the fact that men are more susceptible to working high-paying, but also extremely dangerous jobs. I'm talking industries like waste disposal, mining, construction, and more. Seeing my own father put his life at risk to give a good life to his family (especially right now during COVID19), I want you to know someone out there really appreciates the work you do. Also vulnerability and showing your emotions? We as a society need to be better at giving you space for that so that you aren't pushed to express things only in anger or silence. I also want to applaud you if you come from different cultural or family backgrounds that stigmatize mental health, yet something in you knows/wants to be vulnerable. I see your baby steps, you got this! 2. Initiating and rejecting is hard (for both sides) Though I don't know the full extent to which guys feel the rejection or fear of initiating, as someone who's had her fair share of being rejected and having to reject others (that also sucks), you're right...it is hard. That being said, you are putting yourself out there (or realizing that you want to put yourself out there more/less/in a better way/etc) and that counts for something. They are only mistakes and failures if you don't learn from them. So please pat yourself on the back for gaining these life lessons along the way. That being said, I live by this motto and I think it might be fitting here as well: please dont use shyness as a fixed personality trait that you cant change. Dont limit yourself to these boxes or make boxes to put others in as well. Men and women take these risks of rejection every day, you will be okay if someone rejects you if you make a move. The world does not revolve around you to make you comfortable, it only puts you in difficult situations to make you grow. 3. You're a good bean Save for some really atrocious acts of cruelty and some really atrocious guys, I really do believe a good majority of guys (and just people in general) are good. Whether it's asking dating questions or professing dating blunders, I've seen a lot of amazing personality traits and willingness to improve. Somebody is really going to like that about you one day, I can't wait until you meet them and grow together! That being said, a good personality won't be the golden ticket for you to get the relationship or girl/guy of your dreams. It's the constant effort to improve yourself and improving the relationship that does. Just like how I can't expect someone to give me a job just because I got a degree, nobody should expect to have a great relationship by just having a good personality or made some good moves. What I do appreciate when I say that I see a lot of great personality traits and attitudes toward dating (yes, I'm talking to you!) I mean that I see so many of you with great foundations to start off with. For the sake of the world, please keep going, build on that foundation because we want to see the best you've got! You are worth it to try and keep going. It's going to be hard, you might get cynical, have your heart broken by equally hurt people, really want to give up, get beaten down by insecurities, etc. I want to tell you that so many more people than you think have been in your shoes, even the people you think have got it all. That person you might compare yourself to (because I guarantee we're comparing ourselves to someone) very likely just put in more time than you did to improve themselves. Whether that's working on their weaknesses, building up their strengths, accepting themselves, being more vulnerable, being stronger, etc. Keep going, I'm a random internet stranger here rooting for you, you got this. Warmest Regards, SeaManager p.s. if y,all like my ramblings (or not, that's okay too), I hope to write an appreciation letter for the ladies out here too &lt;3"
47,vulnerability,dating_advice,Difference between being alone verse being lonely,1,grni31,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/grni31/difference_between_being_alone_verse_being_lonely/,2020-05-28 02:58:19,"My girlfriend broke up with me recently, and to say the least I was pretty heartbroken. I think though it really made me come to some realizations that I wanted to share. Id love to here your response to my thoughts, or maybe some of thoughts you have yourself. I realized after she broke up with me, theres a major difference with being alone and being lonely. Being alone is being independent, whereas lonely is a constant need for attention. Being alone is being able to do things by yourself without always needing another person. For example, doing something alone and independent can be like going to the movies by yourself. Some people refuse to go without the presence of another, but why? I dont think its weird at all to go the movies alone, its not like youre talking anyways. Or, being alone can be something like going on a vacation yourself. Lonely is so much different because In my opinion its a different world. Being lonely is always needing someone to do something. In essence, you cant function without that one person and their constant needs and approval of you. But I think what Ive learned about loneliness and being alone after my break up is that, if you realize that you depending on that one person so much maybe, its important that you two ended things. It shows that perhaps you are not independent enough and not individualized enough to live your own life the way you want it to, and not have it be controlled so much by others. In other words, you arent a man yet and you arent mature enough, and getting through this will only make you more stronger and mature in the end. It will put you one step closer to being that person you were put on this earth to be. However, like anything, you need a good balance between being alone and lonely. However, I think one first needs to become independent and be alone before they can open themselves up to loneliness and the emotional vulnerability. Relationships shouldnt be about heavily depending on each other like life or death. It should be about two independent people coming together, in order to form a bond much stronger than they would have otherwise if they came into the relationship being more lonely than alone. 19/M"
48,vulnerability,dating_advice,Is it ever okay to be friends with an ex while in a relationship with another person?,1,gsf3ch,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/gsf3ch/is_it_ever_okay_to_be_friends_with_an_ex_while_in/,2020-05-29 07:20:35,"I'm at an impasse with my s/o and unless we find some way to reconcile these differences we're not able to be in a relationship. I think there's truth on both sides of this issue, and I'm trying to see what ways he or I could look at this issue differently. I'm going to write both perspectives and I'd love to hear what people think about what common ground can be reached, or if a common understanding can even be reached where we both feel good moving forward. Background: I met my ex in 2016 and we had a 1.5 year relationship. About half way through that, I noticed that I wasn't really fulfilled romantically. We weren't clicking like I wanted to and I couldn't put my finger on why. We both tried very hard to make it work, but ultimately there was something that was making me un-attracted physically and romantically, and my ex (let's call them E) started feeling unhappy because I was so unhappy. Through this whole time, we had no resentment towards each other at all and had a very strong friendship bond. We had a hard time being separate not because of romantic love but because we felt emotionally close. Ultimately, after realizing there was nothing we could do and we were fundamentally incompatible for some reason, we decided to break up and take time to ourselves to reflect and become separate. But we couldn't do that unless we knew we could still be in each other's lives as friends. We had no reason to be angry at each other, and the chemistry just wasn't there anymore. Two months later E comes out as trans (MTF) and I can finally put my finger on one of the factors in my not feeling the initial chemistry. My ex had always been really girly and bubbly and ultimately it made me feel emotionally close to her but romantically wasn't what I was looking for! She realized that while she had loved me, I also mirrored some of how she felt inside and she hadn't realized that. We continued being gal pals and a year since I don't ever really think of our relationship at all, but as a more authentic close friend who knows me better than almost anyone. My side: I told my SO (lets call him I) that I was still friends with my ex going into the relationship and that we were completely platonic and he recognized that while it wasn't something he had heard of in the past he was okay with it. I believe that if there is full trust between us and we are secure in our own romantic bond, the history I have with my current friends shouldn't matter. He's the one I love and my relationship with him is completely different than anything I've ever had with anyone else so comparisons don't make sense. I sometimes bring up E in casual conversation, mentioning that she'd like something we were doing or watching, just like I mention other close friends I eventually wanted him to meet. Since talking to him a while ago I have become more sensitive to this, because I can see why me relating something my boyfriend is saying or doing or going through to her could be uncomfortable. I can also see why it would feel really bad when I say that E is one of the friends I have emotional conversations with, but I say that to illustrate that my friends value having honest, transparent conversations where his friends don't and that doesn't make me unrealistic when I say he could have that in friends too if he wants it. It's never to compare him to her, but to show that our dynamics with our friends are different. I told him I was happy to stop using that as an example. But I still think I should be able to be friends with her and not keep it a secret, because we shouldn't ever hide anything from each other and that doesn't take away from the sanctity of my romantic relationship with him. His side: My SO has no doubt that I am completely platonic with my friend and that those platonic feelings are mutual. He isn't worried I'm going to cheat or lie to him. He's actually glad that she's a woman because then when I do bring up similarities he doesn't feel like he's mentally comparing apples to apples as much (men to men). And he has nothing against her at all. But as the relationship has gone on, he's become more insecure because he never realized how emotionally close I am to my friends, including her. How often I have honest heart to hearts with them, and how I can be fully open with her and go to her for support and that support and empathy is given harmoniously. Right now, he realizes he's not able to give validation, emotional support, and vulnerability in the same way. He's working on it. But despite my reassurance that it's okay because our bond doesn't have to look the same as mine with my friends, he knows that emotional vulnerability is a huge part of a romantic relationship. So even if it's not romantic, I'm receiving ""benefits"" from my ex that he isn't able to provide for me at this time. No matter how things are between us now, this is a person I have a history with, someone who I devoted myself to and tried to make things work with. Someone I slept with. And I can't delete history. He doesn't want to make me choose between him and my friends or take me away from people who are close to me. And yet he acknowledges that is the place that I'm in, because he knows I don't want to make him feel miserable while we're still close friends. He can't shake the feeling that there are actually three people in the couple not two, despite all of my reassurances that our dynamics are completely different and that's not at all a bad thing."

He told me the big question he was asking himself was do I need to get all my needs met from my significant other or not? And my response was that you just have to listen to your feelings. I voiced my concerns too and a week later he decided he was having too high of expectations and wanted to let go of some stuff. For a month after that incident I was thinking about breaking up with him everyday, and it was really painful. Our love languages are mostly the same, but my third is verbal affirmations and He refuses to budge on it saying I wasnt raised that way, needing affirmation is attention seeking, I do way more through other forms of love (acts of service, quality time, physical touch). I just need occasional reassurance and would like to know what he loves about me. His response to reassurance is that hes given it to me/said the same thing after every fight and we go in circles. He hasnt said anything specific that makes me feel special though. So now hes asking why Im in this relationship if Im not getting what I need, and I dont know what to do. Like is he so unafraid of losing me? Im somewhat traumatized from the previous incident and fights where things have just felt so hopeless partly because his beliefs. Long story short he didnt get his emotional needs met by his parents, doesnt believe in unconditional love (I do to an extent), is jaded romantically and admits to struggling with vulnerability. In fights he is always very self protecting and believes in morals and right and wrong, way before the relationship. He is definitely an intellectualizer. Ive learned a lot from him in that respect but I still never feel that he fights for us, instead he is only defensive, reactive, and cares too much about the argument itself even when its something so little and stupid. In our most recent argument last week when I was extremely vulnerable to him about not being able to tell how sure he is about me, and wanting him to put more effort into making me feel loved and special (I HATE ASKING FOR STUFF) he responded very negatively, kinda making it about him how could you think that Ive reassured you before maybe I need to find someone who loves me for me why are you torturing yourself. I felt horrible, numb, and shut down during the argument. From the beginning he told me that hes abrasive, but I never would have thought that meant towards your partner. However, he is always willing to talk through hard things and have hard conversations. Hes a really good loyal and pure guy, but I know he has some deep emotional issues he needs to sort out. Im worried there is too much fear and anxiety in this relationship from both parties. I dont want to throw this away but his rigidity has brought me a lot of pain and I hate that he doesnt seem to want to do a few more small things to make me feel loved, that his focus is on the technicalities of the argument rather than like let me hear you out and see what I can do to fix this for us. He believes in setting aside emotions. I feel like Im not asking a lot, he feels that I am. Im pretty independent but the series of events in our relationship has made me need more affirmation and security, which I dont get how he doesnt understand that. It makes me feel like Im not worth the small changes that I feel like he forgets I want after we are done with every argument. I dont want to change him, I know thats wrong but I still feel like you should want to put in extra effort to make someone you love happy. I dont know how to proceed and dont know if Im being true to myself in this relationship. Maybe I am too sensitive for him or we have different philosophies on what love should look like. I need to feel like his #1, an amazing love, not just eh. Is this naive and should I let go? Any feedback is appreciated."

I made a post about this a few days ago and got some great advice, I talked to some friends about it too and have come to a conclusion. While my way too cautious mentality has been a big part of my romantic woes, she is seems incredibly closed off and seems to shy away from any sort of emotion I try to show her. Its a pattern Ive only recently noticed after going back through our texts. Ill give her a compliment, sarcasm then subject change. Ill tell her how much her opinion means to me on whatever it is we are talking about, end of conversation. Im terrible at this too, I know vulnerability is scary, but I would at least express to the other person that Im not comfortable with it yet. Ive recently tried to communicate how I feel to her and try to start a dialogue of communication and openness, only to be met with silence. Im currently waiting for her to respond. We text every day so this silence has been nerve wracking, but I know shes been having a rough week so Ive tried not to bother her. I feel like I fucked up for some reason, maybe I did? Maybe she was just on tinder looking for a friend? Maybe Ive misinterpreted our entire relationship and Im just really bad with jumping in too far. Idk. But if Im right, and she does want to be with me but is really closed off, how do I let her know how much she means to me without scaring her off?"
51,vulnerability,dating_advice,Do guys only want to hookup in their last year of university? Even if that means ending a committed relationship?,1,fvvsr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/fvvsr1/do_guys_only_want_to_hookup_in_their_last_year_of/,2020-04-06 19:37:44,"Tl;dr: Do guys go crazy in their last year of university and think that they need to squeeze in as much of their university experience as possible, including hookup culture that they may have ""missed out on""? My ex (21M) and I (21F) were together for 3 years and broke up exactly 5 months ago. We met each other in our first year of university, just one month in, starting hooking up, and started dating just about 6 weeks into university. He was my first love and my first relationship. For him, this wasn't his first relationship, but this was the first time he was truly in love as well. Our relationship had issues. Biggest one was communication and vulnerability--for the longest time, I didn't know how to effectively communicate and he was very emotional but terrible at telling me anything; often bottled his words and thoughts up but would cry. However, I learned how to communicate with both his help and situations that arose from my friends and other experiences. I learned how to address things head on while still being compassionate for the other person's feelings. But he never really learned that communication skill. He continued to bottle things up and burst everything out at one go rather than addressing things as they arose in our relationship. Additionally, I felt as though he always hid a part of him away from everyone in his life, including me. I would often get upset because I love knowing as much as possible about everyone in my life, not in the sense of gossip, but rather because I want to understand my friends as best as I can. After the end of our relationship, I learned that he had some childhood trauma issues related to why his communication wasn't the best and why he walled up a part of himself. Another huge issue we had was to do with mental health. Both him and I had mental health issues, except I acknowledged mine and actively received help, while he refused to acknowledge he had any issues (when he really clearly did, as we eventually found out with the trauma piece after the relationship). I understand he probably did not want to tackle and face the trauma, which is probably why he refused to acknowledge that he had his own mental health issues. He would help me to an extent but he really did not know how to handle my mental health issues. Twice, I told him about suicidal ideation with the intent of telling someone in order to get help, but he ghosted me for a few days because it was too much for him, I guess because he hadn't addressed his own mental health, so it was probably impossible for him to help anyone else. Last thing was that I think both of us were curious to see ""what else is out there"" in terms of relationships. We got together when we were barely 18 and stayed together until right after my 21st birthday. While we both had other friends, we were a huge part of each other's university experience. In our first couple of months of being together, he once texted me that he really likes me and was falling for me, but was surprised that he was because he entered university with the intent of being a single player/bachelor. The message was written cuter than I'm making it sound out to be, but essentially I thought it was really cute at the time because first, I was naive and this was the first time a guy I liked actually reciprocated my feelings; and second, I was so happy that someone who was trying to be a total f\*ckboi was falling for me. Now, I think that it may have been a red flag because he may not have actually been ready for a serious relationship but sort of fell into one anyway. After we became official, he never really brought up feelings of wanting to be with other people. However, he would often bring up when a girl would flirt or hit on him. Again, at the time I thought it was cute and I felt my ego boost because while all these girls could flirt with him all they wanted, I knew he was in love with me, and I felt amazing. Now, I don't know if this would be a red flag, but I didn't think so at the time and I don't really think it is right now. For me, on the other hand, I never really thought about what else is out there until during the second year of our relationship, especially because this was my first real relationship. We took a break for a few weeks at this point (not because of my feelings of ""what else is out there"", but because we felt we were too co-dependent on each other and needed to take some space to maintain a healthy balance). However, once we got back together, I was committed to him entirely. I was ready to take this relationship seriously and thought that this relationship was it and all I wanted. We got so serious that we talked about moving in together after graduating university and would have done so by June 2020. While he was excited at the time, I think talk about this may have scared him, even though we were approaching 3 years together, but then again we were (and are still) just 21 years old. When we were breaking up, I feel like all these issues culminated. For me, the breakup was sort of out of the blue because I was dealing with a lot of mental health issues at the time (which I can happily say is not the case and will hopefully never be the case again because of the steps I have taken to ensure happiness for myself). Because of this, I definitely was taking him for granted for a couple of months, but it was a time that I really needed someone to lean on. However, I think all of the above issues clicked together for him during this period. When we broke up, he really didn't specify the reasons for why we were breaking up, and even afterward when we tried to establish ourselves as friends (spoiler: that didn't work), I tried to ask him why we really broke up but he didn't want to get into it, which sucks because I never truly got the closure I needed, but I'm over this part. I know our relationship had issues for sure but I feel like everything was solvable. I was ready to work on things because I really thought this relationship was the one for me. Putting our issues aside, we clicked so well together, had amazing times together, cuddled lots, understood one another (to an extent this might be questionable because of his walled up aspect). I was excited to spend my life with him. **My question is: Do you think one of the reasons we broke up was because we were both in our last year of university / in our early 20s, and he may have wanted to experience the hookup culture or other people generally because that's what you are ""supposed to do"" during your college experience / in your early 20s? Do you feel like there is pressure to experience this hookup culture? Do you think guys want to live out their early 20s because they want to rack up their experiences before ""settling down""?** Sorry, this was so long. I wanted to give as much context as possible. Edit: 3 of his close friends broke up with their long-term girlfriends over the last 8 months. While I don't know if or think they probed him to break up with me as well, I feel like each of them felt too pressured in their relationships and maybe thought things were getting too serious for ""their age""."

Hope I could give a bit of information on dating from Pope John Paul II. Two topics he talks about modern problems with sexuality and dating. The problem he talks about are the transgressions of another person and their dignity and how this effects us for worse. He does so by dividing two attractions, sentimental and sensual. I heard a LGBTQ informed therapist say something similar in teasing out sexual attraction to romantic attraction, but I'll keep it consistent with catholic vocab even though they mean the same thing. Attraction comes from seeing a good in another, beauty, virtue, or personality. Sentimental attraction - like the romantic, is about feelings for the other that meet are deep needs for intimacy, vulnerability and deep connection. We are attracted to masculine or feminine qualities. Etc., Sensual, sexual attractions - cause us to want to unite to another person physically and to be in communion with them, and eventually create community, a reflection of God. Where we go overboard is when we use the other for our own benefits. When the other is used for our own sexual gratification, or for our own intimacy needs and deep callings to feel belonged. We become slaves to pleasure if we transgress on the other as a sensual, or sexual means for ourselves, as a result we fail to love the other person. Likewise, when we transgress upon another to meet our ""Disney"" version of happiness, or to meet our fulfillment, we no longer love them as they are, but pressure them into being that fulfillment for us. Both are forms of use and they taint love. We long for both, not just sensual friends with benefits, and not just sentimental caring, but both. In the absence of one or the other, or the transgressions of one or both of these are always going to leave us hungry and unable to love other people, especially in dating."

I've been goaded into accepting okay sex in the hopes it would get better, but I'm realizing I'm not wiling to do that anymore. Moreover, I don't like the hook up culture. It just seems to be about having bad sex with little to no connection because there's this idea you're supposed to gamble, try, not be too picky. None of that is for me. I'd prefer to talk about sex in a really philosophical debate way that can also be a connection and be about intimacy, and tastes. If the guy is willing to talk me into getting off, and he's good at it, that's even better - because then I know how he thinks sexually and wether or not he's comfortable expressing himself and if he cares about the details. I need to feel like I can tell the other person is thoughtful, considerate, caring, and CONFIDENT in a way that is about being connected to vulnerability and self improvement. A lot of guys just don't bring the vulnerability to a conversation, and/or they are uncomfortable with women feeling unsafe, judged, or emotionally raw and vulnerable. This makes it hard to talk about sex, and there seems to be two types of guys: nice guys that avoid getting too sexual, where it seems like the goal is to not talk about sex, and fall into it - which could make for a mediocre first time. Or, sexist, tacky, shitty dudes that come right at women with blatant distasteful invitations for sex that suck. Where are all the confident, emotionally connected, willing to be vulnerable, sexy dudes in dating culture? Why are they so hard to find? And instead of saying - well feminism killed it, as if women only have a choice to occasionally accept violence and being violated if we want confident men that turn us on, can we please live in the now times and figure out how/where confident sexy men are or how men can be that way while still respecting consent? I've come across it, it's just very rare."

Two weeks into dating I had to go into quarantine and it's been a month since we last met in person. A couple of days ago he called me to tell me he's not ready to be in a relationship and that he lost the ""spark"". I was taken aback because things were going really well and although social distancing from each other was difficult, I really thought that we were making things work for the time being; we were talking on the phone every night, sending each other jokes throughout the day while he was at work. The only change I noticed over the past week was that he stopped engaging into anything sexual over the phone (he said he was thinking about breaking the news, and it felt inappropriate, which I completely understood). What we had was from the very beginning a really emotionally invested friendship/relationship; he has always supported me when I felt down and even when I tried to hide it, he's almost sensed that I was upset and helped me through it. I have tried to be the same for him. We joked around and it felt really normal and okay, and we've had a couple of video calls. When I've had doubts enter my mind, I've dismissed them because I felt like it was going to be okay and that he had no reason to want to end things. (for reference, I have doubts because this sort of thing keeps happening and I haven't been in a relationship lasting over two months) When he said he wasn't feeling it, he couldn't explain why, and said that there was nothing absolutely wrong with me. He said he didn't want to keep carrying those feelings of uncertainty on until they got worse. He got really upset when he told me, and seems to be confused by his own feelings. He really doesn't want me to feel like there's something wrong with me. We are still talking, almost as if nothing happened, and agreed we care too much about each other to ghost each other. I'm very confused by the situation in general, and although I've experienced the ""I lost the spark, I don't know why"" stuff many a time before, it usually ends up in neither of us talking. This time, its like everything is the same. I embrace it, because despite the circumstance, there is no reason for us to argue or stop talking over it. However, I want to understand how likely it is that this happened because of self-isolation. I don't want to hope for all eternity that he will change his mind, but at the same time, I don't want to live in hopelessness either. I understand that it's difficult for new relationships to survive the pandemic, and we are so good together that I can't think of any reason as to why we shouldn't date. He is not great at communicating from a distance and its always been easier for him to just meet people, and he frequently accidentally leaves his friends on read. I wonder whether he just felt too much pressure from himself to be a certain way or constantly be in contact with me. He's also said how I was the first person he's dated in years, and the first time that he has tried to be as vulnerable as possible. This level of vulnerability is really scary for him and out of his comfort zone, and has frequently said how much it scares him. I am wondering how possible it is that he is just too overwhelmed by the whole situation, and whether his decline in mental health since self isolation is a huge factor in this decision. When we talked about it, he said it very well could be, but wasn't sure and didn't want to lead me on. I don't know what to do, or what to think. I would really appreciate any insight I could get into the situation. TL;DR Started dating right before going into self-isolation, everything was going great until he said that he's not ready to be in a relationship. We are still talking almost as if nothing happened, and I don't know whether this all came from his internal insecurities and fears, or coronavirus, or whether he's genuinely not interested anymore."

When I requested to communicate more he said he didnt want to force things. My thought was he pursued me so I know what its like for him to try! Maybe I was a tad dramatic but I felt like he didnt even want to try nor be bothered with me so I dropped the ball. We gradually stopped communicating altogether. When we would bump into each other in person I was very stand offish. Despite the lack of communication the feelings didnt stop. I dont know if Im infatuated or in love at this point. Ive never had anyone make me feel the way he did. Ive never had a bond with anyone both platonically and romantically as I did with him. Ive never met someone who understood me so well the way he did. In my eyes hes so perfect for me. Fast forward to now I reached out to him to figure out what went wrong. Hes very passive so I figured he wouldnt have done it. In that conversation we came to the conclusion that the silent treatment just made room for assumptions to be made by the two of us. [Something I wanted to avoid from the very beginning!] The other day in a random conversation I told him how much I really liked him in detail. It was a very vulnerable moment for me but I thought it was important for me to share. See! I am quite comfortable communicating with him. [Vulnerability isnt my strongest suit.] BUT he didnt reciprocate it not one bit. He just asked questions throughout to understand my feelings I guess. Is that weird? Does he not feel the same way? Why is he so closed off? Can he just be hiding his true feelings? Should I give him time to open up? Am I too assertive? Am I too sensitive? Am I moving too fast? Should I give up? How do we move forward?"

She even said that she deleted her tinder and was very comfortable with me and we texted and conversed on phone in length. She even shared her two most deepest secret with me after telling me that she is comfortable with me and is telling her vulnerability. She had a messed up past and was very hurt because of her ex (4 years ago) and this year in February a guy she went out for lunch one time touched her inappropriately and she was shocked because of that and she is not in contact with him. Just some days ago she even told me that SHE LIKED ME but is scared of future because of her family. She thinks that her family will not allow her to take things further in future. She is very uncertain about our future and is being so negative, i can sense it and feel the burden on her and i told her that the burden she is carrying is too heavy for her and let me carry it also because we are in this together. That day she cried a little bit but was very happy and feeling safe with me. I told her many times that its her and me vs the problem. But two days ago, suddenly she went cold and not initiating conversation and told me that she is not ready and is hesitant to meet me and I'm very scared because of this. Yesterday she told me that she is scared of meeting me because she is not strong enough to say no to me in person and will probably say yes to me for our relationship. After so many girls, i finally clicked with this great girl and I'm willing to do anything but due to this Covid-19 we can't meet before 3rd may and its not a guaranteed that in our area lockdown will ease or not. I'm feeling so helpless because i want to talk to her in person on this topic. On call or text, everything will be destroyed. She even said that we should not talk at night because mostly our late night conversation were so beautiful and meaningful and she is now being defensive. Please help what should i do, I know that she is overwhelmed and is over analyzing the future which is not even happening. How can i give her my support because right now i can only do so much. Thank you. P. S. - We are in India. P. P. S - Sorry for my English"

I am 20 years old and have never been in a serious relationship. I have never wanted to up until I met this person. I've always been a very guarded person with walls around my heart so it's really not easy to open up to people for me, especially guys. I wanted to for this person but inevitably held myself back and was not completely honest and open which is why we are taking a break now. Everything seemed wonderful until it wasn't as we realized we don't really trust each other. When I realized I was scared to talk to my friends or my mom about this and continued to bottle it all in, I realized I have some serious self work to do. My best friend is out of town but she is the one who always knows when I'm off and how to ask and get me to talk. I appreciate her more than anything, but I realize now that she is not here that this is something I need to be able to do on my own without coaxing. I realize now I need outside help because taking everything on your own is hard and it's exhausting and I'm ready to share that with someone finally. I'm finally starting my first therapy session on Monday. I want to work out my issues with vulnerability for myself, but mostly because I don't want to lose this person. Is it completely wishful thinking to think it could work out still? Does anyone have any advice on how to let your walls down and live from your heart? A lot of the time it's scary because it feels like maybe I just was not built for this, and that he deserves someone who is more emotionally established. I only want what is best for him."

This is only a 10 day long fling. We met once about 6 months ago and on an off chance decided to facetime the other week. Neither of us expected it but we talked for 6 hours. 2 days later, 6 hours. 2 days later 4 or 5 hours. They were long, deep, fun conversations. Attractions were shared, discussions about taking a trip to meet up happened. All that stuff. And in between sending constant video messages. The last conversation was the most intimate. But the next day it was like a switch went off. She hasnt ghosted but she isn't responding to questions about hanging out. She's not initiating contact. And you can just tell something is off. This was 2 days ago. We haven't talked at all today. Unfortunately this isn't the first time something like this has happened. Any idea why? Any suggestions on how to approach or not approach this. I know I should focus on myself and be happy on my own, etc. I'm doing all that though. I just care so much about the connection that comes from a close intimate relationship. It fills me with such joy. The truth is we *definitely* had a connection and she was interested. She stayed up till like 3am each time just talking to me because of the time zone difference. Even if I really like someone I wouldn't do that. I just was matching the interest she was showing me. Nothing more. Anyways, I got this yesterday: Hiiiii. Sorry for being MIA, have really been diving back into my self work and realizing that i am just not in the space for anything other than a friendship right now. Not assuming you were looking for more, or have insinuated that by any means, but i just wanted to be very upfront and honest about my own intentions, and where im at personally. Sorry if thats coming out of left field, just really value honesty. I have really enjoyed talking to you though and learning more about you, and overalll genuinely appreciate your honesty and vulnerability. Youuuu is a goooood human!:)"

I kind of dont know what to do, I kind of dont, but more than anything, feel like I should share this, it may help others, it may not, but I was so proud of myself for reading this out to a hall full of people, names and specifics removed for confidentiality etc ; ""*As we have just heard from (36F)s statistics, many people every day experience a bare minimum of sexual harassment, and too many more sexually assaulted. With the numbers of physical assaults and rape sitting so high, the odds are that if you are a person who is not a survivor yourself, that at some point in your life, you may well be romantically involved with someone who is.* *My name is (27F), and in the early summer of (a few years ago), I experienced serious sexual assault at the hands of my stalker of several years.* *Petty acts of following, and short trolling sessions, in the sixth year, escalated to an onslaught of death threats, calls to my family, theft and release of personal pictures, and mountains of cybercrime that I was clueless to understand. These culminated in a swift hit to the back of my head when I foolishly had my guard down, and waking up in a place very different from where I had fell.* *I had fought through a thick mire of abuse, friends failing around me, with those who stayed to support me suffering too, as we received a fair wall of doubt from a large proportion of police who fringed the incident reports, accusing me of wasting police time. Formerly defiant, I had become scared to even report the relent. So when my shadowy tormentor revealed himself as a background acquaintance, with whom I had had no quarrel, nor relationship beyond discussing the weather, I had no fight left. I felt trapped, and hopeless, and Im ashamed to say that I gave up and thoroughly believed that that was where I was going to die. He believed that a fitting punishment as I, had led him on, women like me deserved to be punished, and that I owed him.* *In the days following my sojourn, I was dosed up on morphine and treated for my physical injuries before the doubt continued. I remained scared to leave the house unaccompanied, and worked from my Grandparents living room, as my amazing Grandfather fed me hot cross buns. I waited for him to be caught, and punished, but my efforts were muted. One policeman actual looked me up and down and asked me why someone would stalk me. I lost weight rapidly, and then gained it even quicker, leaving me with silvery stretch marks to accompany the scars he had left as unavoidable, angry red reminders on my pale skin. I stopped looking at myself naked, showered standing up in the bath with the door open, as the cubicles and tub rendered me feeling claustrophobic. I avoided heathland, shared a bed with my mother for a number of nights on end, put off my smear like no-ones business, and slept with the light on.* *As I worked on healing my mental scars, I found a secure gym, spoke to counsellors and medical professionals, some of whom were far more sympathetic than others. I fit a dashcam to my car, and I carry a rape alarm wherever I go.* *I ventured out more, but struggled to talk to men in fear of how I could be unintentionally leading them on, and unlike an unpleasant experience in my teens that made me own my body, this experience ruled it instead. I suffered from vaginismus, but that didnt matter to me, as the thought of letting anyone near me again seemed impossible. A best friends failed drunken attempt at an abrupt kiss actually showed itself as comforting, rather than panic inducing, and I considered flirting again, but only with long distance past flames to hold a safe boundary. I purposely chose impossible people.* *Then, a pushy but lovely ex(36M), insisted on adding me to a dating site, telling me It was a waste and a damn shame that no one had the pleasure of my company. I humoured him, he set up the site, and I sat back knowing that I would refuse to actually go out with any of them. No way in hell was I going to chance meeting a stranger off the internet. Then, among the sea of dickpics, popped up this cute little handsome face(32M), that looked as adorably awkward as I felt about the whole situation. We talked, wether bravely or foolishly; I let my guard down, but this time I was right to, and we met. I kicked myself for opening up to him immediately, but there was no need. His empathy and understanding shocked me, and in time, I trusted him completely. It wasnt long at all until my washbag was perched in his bathroom. Part of me wondered if it was my vulnerability that made me fall for him so quickly, but I was the strongest I had ever been, and there was no doubt that we were a wonderful fit. And although I tell him, I dont think he understands just how happy and grateful I am for the way he has, not made me, but reinforced the way I feel. I had believed that neither sex nor love, and possibly not even that sheer amount of laughter would be on the table again and we have them all.* *I wrote this talk some time ago, getting it out of the way, but alas, the course of true love never did run smooth. Both suffering heavy family periods, we hit a wall as an ex(?F) re-appeared leaving him torn and confused, and myself, beyond heartbroken, and the Dolly Parton to her Jolene. He tells me I am the kindest, most beautiful, least selfish person he knows, but familiarity and comfort are, well exactly that, to, especially those of us in rough times. I wont lie, I have wondered if despite my progress and strength, that I remain damaged goods, but I am not, or if I have used up some of my strength to support him through a horrible, dark time to the lengthening days of spring, for her to grab him off in the easier patch- I dont even regret if that is the case. I now know, that its possible for me to love him, dabble in public displays of affection, gush to my friends about how I could have believed him my person, trust, laugh, be, seriously all in, and have amazing intimacy again. Maybe it was all stronger because it was a first for me once more, but that has made it all the harder. I feel the triggering high tide of trapped, and hopeless, not wanting to lose meaning on our fabulous love, and I have nightmares each night where he transforms in to my stalker. I cant promise you that you will always have the support that you crave when you have those hardest days, but you can do it on your own regardless. I am strong, but faltering, he has told me he already believes that maybe going to her will be the biggest mistake of his life, and I am so weak for that. Of course, I would love it to work out, not only as part of me wonders if it will take as long to trust again, but also just for the love of him- my friends tell me it will, but who can tell. Love is hard, and it is even harder after assault, but more than anything I can tell you that it is possible, and so, so worth it. I dont want to lose him, but I can sure as fuck handle it if I do.* *I will now answer any questions.""*"

I (29F) went through a devastating and toxic breakup about a month ago. We were together for 2 years. Broke up many times. This time, I started dating people almost immediately. It was the first time I took that approach. I want to be clear and state that I do not have feelings for this person. I started seeing this guy who is a few years my senior. We seem to really enjoy each other's company. There seems to be good chemistry. I do not think I am assuming too much in saying so. He doesn't seem to enjoy conversing much (phone or text) outside of spending time together. Initially I liked this. It felt unconventional; an effort to get to know one another organically. Now, we have seen each other a few times. Admittedly I am developing some feelings. But, this lack of communication is now making me sad. I believe it may be somewhat triggering, as my ex used to ignore me when he was angry or the silence was a prelude to the 1009th times that he dumped me. I haven't told this new dreamboat any of this. I didn't and do not want to spoil the bliss, especially if this is me inside my own head. But truthfully I am finding it depressing/feeling very depressed. Truthfully I have cried over it a shameful amount of times. Truthfully I cannot handle how quickly and easily I fall, or rather, tumble a flight of stairs for someone. I also suffer from anxiety and am medicated for it. Again, I have kept this part of me near and dear. I really am terrified of vulnerability after my last relationship. I am afraid of having it held against me, or of rejection upon someone's discovery of my condition. This new guy also seems the opposite of me (a bag of nerves). Thank you for your support and if you read this, I am forever grateful. Sincerely, I scare everyone."

In this world, with our individual hardships, and during these times, that isnt easy to do. I deal with a slew of mental health issues, and while its absolutely a work in progress, this whole quarantine has been an oof ooch owie whirlwind of dealing with myself - and you all have given me hope that there are folks out there who work hard to be Good and real humans, and who, in spite of (and perhaps in light of) their own efforts in looking for more specific forms of love, are so willing to show love to a complete stranger.

But I feel since I had fairly recently left a long term relationship, I owed it to myself to expand my palette, so to speak, on who I date. Overall, I think we're compatible, we vibe in silence, its playful, and healthy. We have fun conversations and can express our ideas without being hurtful. We genuinely enjoy each others company. I realized as time goes by his texting style is different, I dont mind the lack of going back and forth throughout the day. Because to me it can get monotonous, given that I can just go take a short 20 min drive to go see him and spend hours with him. What frustrates me is when I have a concern, or seeking some kind of validation - he's very short. I get that in person its different. But I feel like there's deflection purposely made as to not expose too much vulnerability. He doesnt like being complimented, he says recieving it from girlfriends makes him feel weird. If I communicate how much he means to me, or even the ways he makes me happy, he kinda just uses self deprecation, or lowers the compliment by lowering himself, saying things like ""Im alright"" , ""ehh, im not that great, youll see soon enough"", etc. Personally, I'll admit Im more sensitive. I do seek validation here and there from my partner. It lets me know that, theyre content with the relationship- that they are happy to be with me. To him he says his actions are what proves how he feels about me, and he knows I like him by my actions- which sure actions are important, but words can also be impressionable. He loves the arts, he paints, plays and writes music, enjoys books. So its not that he doesnt understand how to express himself. So, is it me? Does he just not feel ready to express himself in a vulnerable way? He doesnt like being kissed on the mouth much. He'll take my hand in public, he'll hold me in public. I expressed if he'd be willing to try and kiss me more, because thats one way I express my feelings, and I can tell he's been trying for me, and I appreciate his willingness. Should I give this more time? How can I feel like Im being a good partner and genuinely make him happy without overwhelming him?"

She sends me a real picture of herself - she's still kinda cute, but I probably wouldn't give her a pass.

He initially was the one showing signals of interest in me - it was as if he was pursuing me, he would turn up where I worked and literally just stand and stare into my eyes for periods of about 20 seconds, he would often seem nervous and go bright red, he would approach me and try making conversation and seem nervous and stumble on words. Sometimes he'd make gestures like sticking his tongue out once ? Me, being very guarded (which I am trying my hardest not to be) was slow to reciprocate, whereas he was very warm and came on strong, which he would often seem embarassed about. Over a period of time, we have talked a little, he has helped me out and I decided to take a risk and try to show him some of my vulnerability and he was calm and patient with me, seems like a really cool person... but I don't get it. Just recently I would catch him staring at me with what can't be mistaken for ravenous lust (and I felt the same). In recent days for example, I would catch him staring from floors above, and he would quickly jolt his body away and his face would go bright red. He came to where I work, when he has no reason to, and just hovered, without looking directly at me, then when he sees me looking, he quickly darted off like a rabbit running from predator. Another day I saw him walk towards me to approach me, then quickly change his direction as if he changed his mind. After this, it is hard to interact with him. After showing these strong signs of interest he suddenly becomes avoidant, today I had the opportunity to talk to him and I was going to be like LOOK, DO YOU WANT TO HANG OUT, but what actually happened was I caught him staring wide eyed at me, he quickly looked away ... and kept his gaze very controlled. It was so anti climactic. I am tired of all this weirdness - on a daily basis we don't interact through work itself, we just happen to work in the same building. I don't have his number at all, but we have these random strange encounters. There is definite chemistry between us. I have warmed to him increasingly, yesterday he waved from afar, I smiled warmly at him ... then today this bizarre coldness as he kept his gaze controlled"

I've been seeing one girl who must be pretty much into me. I kinda like her, but I tend to exercise caution. If I were younger, I would have already escalated this. Now that I have some negative experience and my urges are less...pressing than they used to be, I am not that thirsty, and I tend to take my time and to appraise the prospects of any potential relationship. I don't know that much about her, really. Feels like she has her stuff together in life. She's into some weird things that I also like. She has a decent job, and she kinda likes it. She's an adventurous type. There are some seemingly huge red flags that make me keep my distance, though. Lots of tattoos. A profound interest in new-wave feminism. Some subscriptions on public pages mentioning polyamory dating and stuff like that. I've slept with girl like that, and, hot though they were, they turned out to be narcissistic- or psychopathic-types and it never ended well. Who would've thought. It just dawned on me that I seem to have been consistently attracting women like that. I kinda like her. I can get by without her. I am not going to somehow contain her if we are going to start a relationship. I'll be more than ready to make some concessions. The thing is, I just want to take care of her. I feel quite comfortable around her. Yet, I seem not to feel some kind of chemistry yet. I also seem to be keeping postponing the sexual part due to my performance anxiety. I don't really have any problems in my nether region, but my mind has been quite botched up. I am tired of purely transactional or meaningless sex. So, I want to have it only when I am sure that she's the one I'd like to have it with. Trust issues, right. My gut feeling doesn't tell me anything. Perhaps, for the first time in my entire life. I am trying to embrace the concept of my own vulnerability. I am vulnerable. And I want to open up to this girl again. I want to trust her. After all, this time it won't be worse than it was in the past. I'm just trying to take things at the pace I am comfortable with. That said, she dropped a hint that I seem not to know what I want. I understand that she may feel confused. But, after all, so am I. I just recently bought a new apartment and moved in. There are so many things that I can occupy myself with. My job, some domestic chores, some refurbishments. You name it. I don't really think that I am ready to throw a woman into that mixture. Could it be that I am just overthinking? She's not throwing herself at me, but she is definitely into me. What's the best course of action for me to choose?"

I have feelings for her but not likewise. I told a colleague of about this but instead he use that against me. I have social anxiety and overthinking problems and so does she, but she got rid of her parasite a long time ago I do tell her my issues but then she advice me on stuff that I would never do, for example, be the one who starts the convo, dont think about this etc. I understands she is trying to pry me out of my shell but there is the feeling of vulnerability, like I dont want to get hurt and ignored which I had the pleasure of feeling from the past few week from her and a course mate of mine which I have been bugging on about my assignment. So the shitty habit I have developed since high school is that I can discern someone emotion via text. One liners or simple ya, yee, no could, idk, means that she is annoyed. Then being the stupid fucker I am, would ask her ""are you okay,mad etc"" cause you know, i want to keep the air clear. She would say yes but still be ""mad"" while irl act nice and chill and honestly that puts me off. I know there is a rule that states, ""if she is giving mix messages, she ain't into you"". Maybe that. Regardless, we have CG (Cell Group for Youth) tomorrow and the usual bs is I never will ever talk to anyone and thus be the outcast. Which fucking sucks cause I want someone to talk to. I know I will get the usual darts called ""try to be positive, have a positive outlook on things, look at things positively"". Yep been doing that, helped so far. I want to know how do you talk to someone without being intrusive and annoying but still not ignored. How do you not have this emotion discerning habit via text? Or suggest me stuff to think about when I am overthinking"

He said we should meet up that same night and I was like, okay, cool. He called me veryyy late in the evening (I think to meet up because I told him I was going to this party and hes welcome to stop by) but I was too drunk and didnt find out until the next morning so I texted him, we kept texting throughout the day, later that day I found out I was really close to where he was so my friends and I stopped by and said hi to him and finally met. It was brief. He then texted me the next night asking me where I was but I was already home. We texted more for a while and then he asked if I wanted to chill or hangout sometime and I was like sure I dont mind (keep in mind I had a huge crush on him) and told him that my friends are throwing this party this weekend and if hes into that he said hes totally down. Fast forward to the day of the party, he comes and we immediately detach from the rest of the crowd, we danced and drank a bit then found a dark corner and started talking for a while, chemistry and lowlights around us, we then start kissing and all that good stuff and after that we cuddled until we had to go home. He texted me he had a great time and everything. We kept texting the next day. I was busy for the next week and he didnt really talk so we werent really talking, he texted me out of the blue and said I went mia and I was like yeah I was busy and all of that. While were texting Im sure he said something really flirty and I flirted right back and it was a loop of flirting, then he started talking about personal stuff and I was like finally! Vulnerability! That must be a good sign. I texted him the next day while I was out with friends where he was and he immediately called me and told me hes coming to see me. We talked for an hour until he had to go home. He called me around the same time the next day just to check up and honestly I was over the moon, things seem to be going good and he seems interested, no? Except something I cant pinpoint happened and I felt he was talking less and less and wasnt texting me as much or initiating. So after our last text convo I decided to chill out and didnt text him first again, and its been like 2 weeks. I honestly dont know, did he all of a sudden lose interest? Did I say or do something wrong that turned him off? And as stupid it may seem was I too easy/available? Is he going off for personal reasons and should just give him his space? I dont want to talk to him about this since I barely know him and I dont wanna seem even more like the obsessed girl. Should I just forget about and move on or am I jumping to conclusions too soon? TL;DR: guy Ive seen a few times was super interested and now hes not apparently"

Ive known him casually since we went to the same school about 4 years ago, but we never really spoke at all. He now expresses I was his crush back then (which must have been pure infatuation since we never once talked?) in his 3rd message. The conversation continues normally, but some of his texts become too much too soon for me, but I still overlook them. I eventually agree to go on a date later this week to give him a chance because why not, and he proposes watching a film on a tv or laptop somewhere. I reacted at this because it easily implied him inviting himself over for a first date. He then says I misinterpreted completely and we have a little bicker. He tries to prove thats not what he meant by saying he wanted to meet me for real and not just use me, and thought about how hed hug me and cuddle while watching the film. Now that again makes me squirm and I find it OTT, because firstly, he doesnt even know me (first day of chatting!) and secondly, were talking about our first date. I personally see the first date as more of a meet and a public space encounter, and definitely not something like this! But again, I let it slip, and we had a great conversation about life values that I really enjoyed, and I thought again wow, I might actually go on that date after all. In the morning, he sends me another message that I find invading, and I again express that it makes me feel weird. He says hes sorry and that he understands. I overlook again. Two texts later, he asks if I feel like talking on the phone. This weirds me out coming from an almost stranger after one day of talking!! I feel very pressured at this point and quite uneasy, and like Im backed into a corner, like I owe him something because he admitted I was his crush or sth. I try to communicate again saying this is too fast for me, and at that point Im just sick of the whole situation because I dont think thats how it should work and it feels quite toxic. He first blames me for hating every other thing he says and acting hot and cold, and then after I explain myself further, says hes sorry again, that hell go as fast as I want, that he doesnt want it to end. As an introvert and a person who values her personal space a lot, this was way too much and too fast, and the whole thing suffocated me especially since he obviously has certain ideas of who I am that hes made up in his head long ago and I can never fulfill these fantasies. He is obviously head over heels in love with the image of me hes created himself, rather than me as a real person. It puts immense pressure on me and I told him that clearly, more than twice. I also told him openly that ott emotion and vulnerability make me uneasy in general, and especially this early on. One day of talking!! And I am very conflicted now because he ticks many of the boxes and I really reallyy enjoyed sharing our worldviews and interests. It just feels like either hes not experienced so doesnt know how to really talk to a girl, or has some self-esteem issues and is clingy, thinking that love will solve all problems, and that I (that is, his idea of me) am the magic potion. Or maybe something else, but I believe its just... not for me. Some girls might like the approach, idk but right now I just feel a bit sucky rejecting him since he does actually seem like a nice guy. I dont know. Please help."

Please forgive me if Im in the wrong place, and redirect me as appropriate. I (25f) have so little confidence in myself and I dont know how to behave around people Im attracted to, or who are attracted to me. Ive been single for quite a while, and Ive historically not been treated very well in relationships. Im only now starting to really stand up for myself a little more and think about how I deserve to be treated. I am a fairly curvy girl, and a natural redhead, so unfortunately I spent a lot of my younger years being bullied or teased. These days, Im being pursued quite a lot, for lack of a better term. However, as soon as I become aware of someones probable attraction to me, I suddenly become paralysed with fear. At the moment, there is someone (28M) I think I might be interested in. But Im so, so afraid that he doesnt feel the same way, that Im warping things that he says and does to convince myself that Im imagining it. When he compliments me, I convince myself hes just being friendly, or that hes joking, or that theres going to be some cruel reveal in the end that hes just doing this on a dare or something. Realistically I know thats not likely; to be deliberately cruel to me would ruin a number of friendships for him, so logically I have to assume hes honestly interested. Ive asked friends for input and to review messages and such, and they all agree that hes into me, but I am so afraid of letting myself be vulnerable that Im struggling to let myself believe it. So, do you have any advice on how I can build myself up more and let myself think Im deserving of love? How can I stop myself from being so afraid of being rejected all the time? I dont want this to become a self fulfilling prophecy. TL;DR &gt; I hold myself back from dating and interactions because Im so afraid of rejection, even when Ive been given no hint that any rejection is forthcoming.

I apologized and explained what happened was a result of miscommunication and expressed my strong interest in getting back together. He told me he needed to work on himself without any influence of anybody. Even though he said forgave me and that we're in a great place together, he expressed fear of me exploiting his vulnerability. He sounded almost scared of me touching him or babying him like I used to. He told me he doesn't want any women in his life at this point. I feel terrible and I want him back. To me, we're not in a great place if we can't be on the same terms we used to be. After learning enough about depression and anxiety, I feel guilty and I want to make it up to him. Any ideas?

76,vulnerability,dating_advice,The sinking feeling of when he doesn't engage or respond,1,f7y636,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/f7y636/the_sinking_feeling_of_when_he_doesnt_engage_or/,2020-02-23 07:20:40,"There are a good number of posts that share a similar theme of distance or ghosting behaviors. Perhaps I am reading too much into my current situation. I'll share as it may feel cathartic and to hear thoughts. Been seeing (if I can use that term) someone \[male\] sporadically over a span of months (perhaps a little over 5 months). No consistency (meaning, there was no weekly meet up because of life obligations between each other or simply poor timing). Recently we kissed, made out. There was a great, explosive connection there. We opened up about our feelings. We became more flirtatious over text almost on a daily basis. It started to feel comfortable. It's as if I've finally crossed the delicate bridge and into a realm where I, at least, can feel empowered to show a bit more of my vulnerability. All this within a week leading up to a special dinner I had planned for. There was a mistaken text sent to me the night previous to the dinner. It was meant for someone else. These were texts in response to some angry exchange with the other individual. It was clear this wasn't meant to be sent to me. However, some male friends chided this could be a test for me. From what I gather, out of context, that these angry texts were for another woman who had ghosted him and he was angry. For me, not knowing the context, left me completely dumbfounded and distressed until the following morning, where the whole mistaken text exchange was cleared up. He apologized for it. I couldn't shake off the text exchange. It would color the mood for the rest of the dinner. I tried hard to be a trooper and hold my head up high. My heart would sink once I held his hand. Limp. I felt a slight sense of discomfort from him. I can't tell what it is and he didn't seem he wanted to share as much. I said he shouldn't if it's too upsetting. We kissed goodbye. The mood didn't feel right to proceed with anything more intimate. He suggested we should meet up again and I would love to. The following day I wrote him a text to see how he was doing. He wrote he wasn't feeling great to meet again but to postpone. I was cool about it. I proposed a date (rather than waver in the open without a clear calendar date. It didn't warrant a response. I would check in the following day to see how he was and how I was thinking about him and his well being. I'd share a photo from my day. Days went by. Nothing. The following weekend would come upon me. I sent him a brief text to say hello and check-in. I would suggest an activity that would be considered a surprise for him, hopefully it would cheer him up. I would leave it open to him to pick a date (knowing this may be a bad idea on my part to leave it open-ended). I don't plan on writing again for a while. I think I'm just pestering someone who may be going through some trouble. But, does he know I have feelings too? My heart sinks as each day goes without a word. Anxiety and depression starts to weigh me down. The usual side effects of someone who begins to ignore you out of the blue. I want to give him some space. I generally don't like to ""date around"" while I feel connected to one person. This is just my style. I do however have an online profile up. I don't log into it much but friends advise me to do it. To me, that's simply a pure distraction from the issue. I don't feel anything for the people I chat with. It's funny how I've become blinded and numb now, falling for someone who suddenly is distancing themselves. I went ahead and logged into my dating profile and, by chance of the universe, come across his profile. Now, this could be an old profile or new. I don't know. I haven't been going through the pool for many months. I will never know. We are not exclusive by all means but I like to take the next steps with him. I just don't know when I should bring up this conversation. We've been in on/off communication since we've met (pre-kiss). This time, though, it seems to hurt a bit more. Thoughts?"

Just talking, hanging out in his car after work, staying late to leave together, eyes across the conference table, touching knees and hands when it's not necessary, flirtatious conversations. The short of it, it's all very fun and exciting especially because I haven't had anything like this in a long time. Anyway, things were going well to the point where he said something that amounted to ""I see us spending a lot of time together"" and we started sharing personal information and having more abstract conversations that made me feel like we were getting to know each other on a deeper level. I don't have a lot of dating experience but, c'mon, all together these are clear and obvious signs. So, I decided to make a gesture, he has a bunch of mix CDs from college so I thought it would be thoughtful/cute to make him one. I gave it to him last Monday and he really loved it! Truly, he was super excited, told me I was ""so sweet"" and that he wasn't sure what he could do that would be of equal meaning. The next day he even texted me on his own to tell me how much he loved it. He sent 3 heart emojis in this text, I know this is probably a stupid detail but modern relationships and texting culture, ya know. The next day he stopped by my desk to follow up on the text but, after that it's like water was thrown on the flame. He won't make eye contact with me and his body language has shut down. I think I might be in my own head since after the CD thing we haven't had an opportunity to talk but the vibe is just... Different. Again, maybe it's in my head, I mean I felt pretty vulnerable giving him this CD because CD burning was only a thing for a few years by the time I knew how to do it and I never made one with the intention of giving it to somebody I have romantic interest in- guess I'll bring attention to the 11 year age gap, which is why I mentioned he texted me on his own because that's not something he'd done previously. Point being, maybe this sense of vulnerability has prompted me to subconsciously look for rejection in his actions? However, in the last week I've really reviewed the circumstances under which we interact. It's generally because of opportunities I make. I would like to stress that he knows I'm making these opportunities so it's not like I'm just inserting myself without his knowledge. For example I ask him when he's leaving and say I'll wait for him if it's within a reasonable time frame but on days where I have to stay a few extra minutes he doesn't return the gesture. I truly believe it's not fair to impose my actions, which I take of my own accord, and impress them upon somebody else as an equal expectation but, really? Two months of this back and forth and there hasn't been an instance where he's made the opportunity for us to have a few minutes together. And the insecurity I'm now feeling has made me feel that trying to create another opportunity to talk would be received as... Overbearing? A little more on the texting situation, we don't really do it if only because he's not responsive which I am attributing to the fact he's older? If I text him it's usually following up on a conversation we already had. So there isn't a reason for him to respond necessarily in those instances, though there have been some brief conversations. I did text him Sunday to congratulate him on the load out of a very high profile event and he did respond to that thanking me and acknowledging the role I played in the event... Jesus this sounds so juvenile. I'm confused by the situation and frustrated by both myself and him. Specifically I'm confused about the lack of communication over the last week and am not really sure what to do. We hadn't said anything about what kind of relationship we have but, it had seemed like we were about ready to have that conversation. To continue with that thought, I don't know if it's appropriate to press this issue because we hadn't made any real promises to each other. I already touched base with him last week to ask if he was okay because I had initially thought that his shift in behavior was due to work stress. Anyway, he said he was fine and, really, what more am I supposed to do if he said he's fine? I don't want to look needy or pushy by asking again or saying what I'm really thinking which is ""hey, why are you acting differently towards me?,"" and I don't know that it's really my business because we hadn't defined our relationship in any way. All that being said, I'm starting to think it might be better to cut my losses. Office relationships are already risky but, I'm also ready for a relationship and it would be a huge let down to just drop something that was starting to take shape."
80,vulnerability,dating_advice,I (21M) am ruining my relationship with my (21F) fiance,1,fa1tc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/fa1tc1/i_21m_am_ruining_my_relationship_with_my_21f/,2020-02-27 09:42:20,"I (21M) need help/advice with my relationship with my (21F) fiance. I suppose Ill summarize the relationship thus far so anyone who takes the time to read this can have a better understanding of the dynamics and standing of our relationship. **TL/DR at the bottom.** It has had its ups and downs, as well as painful curveballs. I have had depression and anxiety disorders from a young age, and she was born with the same, but she also has bipolar 2 disorder. We met at work in the winter of 2018. We both were delivery drivers for a well known pizza chain. We started off as work friends, she approached me and started up a nice conversation. She is more socially outgoing than I am. We thought highly of each other and found each other attractive. After a few weeks to a month of being strictly friends with just a tad of flirting thrown in, she invited me over to her house to hang out. We sipped some wine and smoked some pot with her roommates, then went into her room to watch a movie. We got to cuddling and ended up hooking up. I left later in the night and went home. Things were going well, we had a friends with benefits type of relationship at that point and for the following months. Time passed and I had begun to fall for her. She was/is sweet, friendly, warm, beautiful and more. She definitely felt the female equivalents of these feelings for me, but due to her past and her current situation she didnt feel like she wanted a romantic relationship. I was disappointed but accepted this. We truly did/do have a great and deep connection. The people she interacted with from her town did her wrong more often than not and she didnt have any close friends, I was the only one. Thus, we got into a deep personal/sexual relationship. She had even told me she loved me on the phone one night. I felt I loved her too. When we werent hanging out after work, often times shed call me on the phone and we would have long talks about almost anything. We had gone on as friends with benefits for probably around half a year or so, maybe longer, until she hit the point where she felt I was trying too hard to get her into a concrete romantic relationship. I saw where she was coming from and backed off a bit. I didnt want her to feel smothered. For this next time period I need to briefly explain her family and living situation. Her mother is an alcoholic and an ex drug addict- not a model parent by any stretch of the imagination. She had verbally and physically abused my fiance as a child. Her father has been absent since she was around 5 years old, and was stuck with her mother. My fiance grew up in a shitty small town with a fair share of crime and drug use. She became somewhat of a hoodlum herself as shes told me and did some unsavory things. Her mother met a man named Bob and was involved with him for a time. They had a relationship of sorts, I dont really know the full extent of it, but my fiance looked to him as a father figure. He is a tax preparer and owned a few houses that he rented out in the same town. After my fiances mother and Bob ended things, Bob let my fiance stay in one of his houses when she was 17 or so. She paid the bills there and took care of herself. She had to stay afloat by working multiple jobs and tried to put herself through a local community college. This next part could very well belong in r/Cringetopia, hold onto your hats. She has almost always struggled to make ends meet. This all becomes relevant now when I say that she had a sugar daddy for a couple months. This was after I backed off when she felt I was trying too hard with her. I still liked her a lot, Id dare to say I still loved her. I still quite shamefully look back at this particular time because I kept holding onto feelings while she developed them for a 40 something year old man. I was disgusted. I thought I could have been a source of financial support if shed wanted to be romantically involved with me. It sounds so stupid I know, I wanted to omit this part but I figure it speaks something about the both of us. Her financial struggles and feeling somewhat hopeless, and for me the perhaps desperation of my situation with her. The worst moment of this chapter in our relationship has to be when I had spent the night at her house, woke up with her and hung out. She then told me that her sugar daddy Mike was going to be coming over. I should have gone home. I cant tell you why I stayed. Maybe I thought if I were there they wouldnt do anything sexual. I was sitting on her couch in the living room when he showed up. I remember thinking I could beat the shit out of this guy which made me feel like him and her couldnt possibly have hit it off that well, among other reasons. They went into her room together. I walked up to the door maybe 20 min or so later to tell her something and I see Mike laying on her bed on his back and she was straddling him. Both clothed, nothing sexual. But I felt like dirt. Like a brainless fool. I left at that point but it should have been the minute she told me hed be coming over. Anyways, their relationship fizzled out after a month or so. She began reaching out to me after that, and we slowly got closer. I was still feeling like an imbecile but I didnt want to be shitty and not still be her friend. Her life has been a lot harder than I have described previously. I get it. Around the skeevy sugar daddy period, I began to work on myself a lot more. I wish it didnt have to come to that for me to get some real motivation but there I was. I quit smoking pot, (I used to be a real pothead) I took steps to joining a union carpenters apprenticeship and more. I felt driven. She saw this and became more interested. We kept talking and hanging out and having sex and eventually we got into an actual romantic relationship. This was around July of 2019. It finally happened. At this point I was able to push the shame and guilt aside and try to make things work. During that fall of 2019 she proposed to me. Shes not very romantic or lovey dovey so thats how she felt comfortable bringing up spending our lives together. She got me a ring, nothing fancy but it was a sweet gesture. I got her one a couple months later.This brings us to our current standing. **Finally**, I know. We have an apartment together and have had it for about 3 months. Cohabitation has been interesting. Good and bad, but the bad is standing out. She has issues with my lack of proper communication, vulnerability, listening skills, etc. She feels I am not reciprocating her openness, vulnerability, etc. It makes her feel undervalued and depressed. I understand her on this. I had only one previous long term relationship, so Im pretty inexperienced. It was from 7th to 8th grade with a toxic, manipulative girl. I am 2000% over it, believe me, but I cant help but feel that some of the toxic effects of that relationship somehow still linger. I was nervous to properly communicate my feelings, I felt controlled, and feared her becoming angry with me. Its now late February of 2020 and I dont know what to do. I have written down, researched and studied these things that I need to improve for the sake of our relationship but somehow I have trouble implementing them. Its infuriating. We really love each other and we want us to last a lifetime. She says I am not on thin ice with her but I somehow have trouble believing her. This makes me anxious and screw things up. Not giving her my full attention because my mind feels jumbled, not communicating my feelings, not being vulnerable, etc. Now that Im writing this I feel like the underlying problem is my anxiety. In my research I have found that anxiety can wreak havoc on a relationship. This is not good. I am in the process of trying to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist, but I am more than likely starting a new job on Monday. I am a carpenters apprentice but the nature of that is you will be on and off different jobs. This one in particular is probably going to be the hardest one Ive ever worked if it goes as expected. It is an outage at the #7 Blast Furnace at US Steel in Gary. It is massive. Itll be a couple month job at least and well probably be working 7 days a week, 12 hours a day. Id hold off and wait for a different job but Ive been laid off since early this month and we need the money. She got a second job early this year so shes busy too. I will not be able to see a therapist if this job goes as expected, Ill have to wait till its finished. She has an appointment this Saturday to see one so Im happy for her about that, I just wish I wouldve seen one sooner, Ive been depressed and apathetic about it and didnt get around to this until this week. I am a master procrastinator. To summarize, I would appreciate any feedback, advice, tips, etc. about how I can maintain and fix the problems that I brought to this relationship. Thank you so much for even reading. **TL/DR:** I have weakened our relationship by not reciprocating my fiance's open communication, vulnerability, and honesty about feelings. I also need to be more present with her when she talks to me, and not let my anxiety jumble my thoughts. I am seeking therapy for my anxiety, it destroys relationships and how my mind functions. I need advice and feedback as to how I can implement the research I've done and things I've learned."

We had a one night stand on Saturday(time flies) last week. Had a great time with her but we were both drunk. I had slept with someone earlier that day but it didn't quite feel as good as it did with her. This one felt amazing. I fell asleep cuddled up with her. The best sleep I've had in ages. Her insistence on leaving with me, her pleading with me to please stay, her cuddling with me, all of it, has buttered me up so badly I've lost a grip of my own emotions. I guess you could just chalk it all up to lust and move on. But I just... would like more? I like her personality. She's funny, beautiful and womanly. And since we spent that Saturday night talking and walking around the street together, I think I got the vibe that she did like me. And on the morning after I guess my feelings solidified. But I don't know how much of this is just me. She likes having fun and all that so maybe it's done. She gave me her number and I texted her that evening and we were supposed to hook up again but she was 2 hours late and I didn't wanna seem desperate so I didn't press but said it's fine. Haven't seen her since. Now she's the first to view my posts. We texted and I guess I don't know what to say but I guess going by the emojis I wasn't being terrible? She said we'll meet soon when we're both free but I'm just taking that as rejection. Not holding my breath at all lol. I think I may have blown it because I sent a text twice on separate occasions saying hey, I never really got to know much more about you. She didn't reply to that but would reply to the other dumb filler stuff I was saying. I keep viewing her posts. I'm holding off on talking to her for now. I just don't know what to say. And moreover that, I'd just like to see her interest in me, or lack thereof. So far since Tuesday, no text saying hi or whatever. I'm not maniacal. I'm not some incelibate type. I guard myself against girls because it never ends well for me. But I'm fighting, in a way, for my vulnerability back. I got vulnerable when I least expected it. There are good girls who are into me and I just can't bring myself to be attracted to them in the way that they deserve but I guess maybe I understand it a bit better now, how it feels."

When we stopped doing it, we eventually became friends and hang out regularly without sex. I got feelings for him and I told him that. But hes leaving the city in a month and surely not coming back anytime soon. So we decided to keep it as just friends. After one time seeing me out on a date, he seems to be annoyed by that. And a day later when I asked if he want to hang out. He said that we shouldnt be in touch for now, just park our friendship and both move on from that. He said because I want more but hes leaving, there is no future for us, it doesnt make senses if we keep hanging out, meeting up or talking on WhatsApp. Its unfair on me and also hard for him to move on. And he believes its for the best. And he said hell be in touch again before he leaves the city then we can chat more. Until then, if we bump into each other, hed still love to have a chat to catch up. And he insisted that he didnt ignore or and he wasnt annoyed by me at all. Anyhow, I didnt react too nice to the message. I basically told him that Im humiliated because it feels like he want to say that it makes him uncomfortable when showed him my vulnerability and revealed my feeling toward him. I said that I wish Ill never bump into him anywhere and only want to see him before he leaves to get some of my stuff back! I told him dont even feel bad about it cos we are not even too important to each other, its what it is, just another meaningless connection on a dating app that went a bit too far. And I ended with Have a great life and good luck with finding some empathy out there. He read my message and replied very quickly, saying that please dont read too deeply into the messages cos you cant convey someones feeling and attitude through a text, thats why talking in person is so important. He said that i somehow created a false narrative and its on me not him, and insisted that he told me how his feelings when we talked in his room, just remember that and please stop reading too deeply into text messages. Anyhow, I think its what it is. Time to move on for me I guess. Just feeling really upset and hollow after that cos we get along really well. Also Its wasnt anyones fault, we both knew that there is no future for us anyway. And guess what, we just matched on Tinder... whats wrong with this man??? I swiped right because I know he always swipes left on me. TL;DR : Having a crush with my guy friend. He rejected and said we shouldnt be in touch for a while. A few days later, we matched on Tinder."

It's a long one so: (backstory) So back in March, I met this woman at a party. We hit it off really quickly and hooked up that night, exchanged numbers and decided to hangout afterwards. What should have been a one night stand and maybe shitty brunch turned into a decent time at the movies and burgers and beer after. We hung out a couple of times and everytime it'd seem like she was really into me. Besides being really open about some things from her past, she was a writer so she wrote about what she knew. Mainly her trauma- I didn't think her being forward with that was a red flag since she does that for a living. We'd talk and hold hands and make out in front of her building but she was always kinda hesitant about something. Like she was holding back on something she wanted to say. Anyway, I went to another party and she was there with some friends (I met them at the last party, they're her friends so they've seen us together outside of the party environment), after saying hey to me she started to act really distant. Like, she went from being so warm, responsive and interested to cold, and indifferent. A complete 180- dumbfounded of course I tried talking to her but she just said that she only wanted to be with friends. I respected her wishes and said good night and left. She texted me the next day apologizing for shutting down like that and blames her lack of emotional vulnerability and communication skills (anddd maybe a sprinkle of trauma) for her reaction. I told her I wasn't upset actually but I wanted to talk to her and maybe see if just trying to figure out what to do together- like I have a TON of issues and started going to therapy. While I'm not healed I'm on the right path. Seeing if she'd take a risk with me and trust me, and seeing if I could trust her as well. She explained to me that she was moving anyway to Wisconsin ( seriously, not joking) and besides a long distance relationship she didn't want me ""burden"" me with her troubles. She moved and didn't say bye which obviously hurt me so much. That was around the end of July. I stupidly still text her goodbye and wishing her the best, and I texted her for Thanksgiving. I never got an answer so I left it alone. She texted me back on the 3rd. She said: ""Hey, I wanted to tell you that Ive been thinking about you. I am sorry I havent responded sooner, Im just awful at almost everything, communication and emotional vulnerability being at the top of the list. How are you? How has your fall been?"" I didn't have the number saved. Honestly after all that time had passed and she never answered I figured she either didn't want to talk to me/blocked me/straight up ignoring me... Yeah in a moment of sadness I deleted her number. I overthink like fucking Sherlock so, I had every other answer down for what was stopping her from hitting me up. We exchanged messages briefly before she didn't answer for the night. She just answered back today with: ""A lot of people see a lot in me right away, and then get to know me and hate me. I am not a stable or good enough person to not disappoint. I am worried that you have expressed so much emotion towards me without knowing me very well, and Im afraid that if I try to get to know you more, I will ultimately disappoint you or fuck up or hurt you if Im not the person you see right now from a few interactions."" I'm still not over her in the least bit. I don't know what to say or do though... I feel like she wouldn't have hit me up unless she felt like she still cares. At no point has she ever shown any reason to lie or have any ulterior motives. I doubt any of this makes for a good read so I don't think it's for a book or inspiration. I don't know if she really believes that she's not good enough for me or if she thinks she's letting me easy but- again I haven't spoken to her in months so why would she hmu out of nowhere? What do I do y'all? TL;DR: We banged, We connected really quickly, She had a panic attack and shut down, She moved cross country, Now she's texting me again after 6 mo. and IDK what to say back"

For example Ill be reallly into someone, think/talk about them constantly, and like theyre personality a lot for how well I know them. Then we hang out or whatnot and they give me sappy compliments or it just becomes clear through their energy that they like me. As soon as that happens, I really dont want to be around them and usually tell them I dont like them/dont want a relationship and kinda stop talking to them. I always tell my friends something along the lines of they thought I was really great/liked me a lot without even knowing me that long, and thats really immature and annoying, but Ive realized thats kinda just how everyone is (including me). The only time this isnt the case is with the player/fuckboy type, who obv are kinda shitty people but for some reason I dont mind theyre attention as much cuz I know its not that special or that they dont really want me for my personality its just for sex or the fun of the game. Ive had a relationship with a girl for 2m, which was up until the day I moved away from the city we both lived in. She told me she loved me and I said it back but didnt really mean it at the time, and was always a little bit guarded with her even though she was amazing and caring and totally trustworthy. I also have been told I have vulnerability issues generally (with friends and stuff), although I do have a good amount of close and healthy friendships. Not sure if that could be related though. Sorry this got kinda long haha TL;DR I always loose interest in someone once the show they care about me (romantically) and otherwise have a bad habit of liking players who really arnt that great and dont care about me at all. What might this mean, or what can I do to work on it? Thanks :)"

Sometimes weeks can go by before we see each other in person. We met about a year ago at a new employee party and I was drawn to him, I was physically attracted to him but also really enjoyed having a conversation with him. Over the next few months, he would make plans for us to do things together such as brunch, movies, drinks, always just the two of us. He would always be the one to make the plans, including getting reservations if we needed them and even picking me up from my apartment, but we each paid for our own things. At first, our conversations were typical get to know you stuff, family, friends, but in reality mostly work since Ive been in the position he currently is in. As time passed though, our conversations started becoming much more intimate and vulnerable. My attraction towards him continued to grow. I found myself being confused at times about what was going on. He went through a difficult time some time ago and I was there to help him through it. I was happy to be there for him, but my feelings grew because even more openness and vulnerability came from it. I decided to tell him how I feel because I was feeling hurt and it was weighing on me. He told me he liked me as a friend, thanked me again for helping him, and was understanding when I said I needed some space. Before this, we were texting on a daily basis and its been hard to not think about him and fight the urge to continue to text him. I really do want to continue being his friend since I enjoy his company, but I dont know how. Did I make the right choice? Where should I go from here?"

Shes very attractive, but theres certain aspects of her personality that Im struggling to deal with/ understand. Mainly, it seems like every conversation involves her somehow trying to make herself seem better or more interesting than she is. Like when she tells a story or talks about something in her life, it always seems like theres like a backhanded brag that comes with it. As if shes always saying isnt my life so crazy/interesting/exciting. Im pretty sure she even goes as far as to partially lie sometimes, although I can never be bothered to fact check anything she says. I could give examples but not sure if I need to go into that much detail on here lol. I feel like Im in some sort of constant competition to make my life seem as interesting as hers. Idk how else to describe it, but the conversations often dont feel very genuine. Like she never wants to show any sort of vulnerability or dependence in the slightest. Not that I would prefer someone who is completely vulnerable/dependent, its just that every person is to some degree, and she literally refuses to show it at all. I guess my question is, what is this personality type? Whether its her intention or not, she makes me feel like she doesnt need me, like if I were to disappear from her life shed be just fine. I would assume she likes having me around, otherwise shed have stopped agreeing to hang out. So why cant she just communicate that? Were not in a serious committed relationship or anything so Im not upset, Im just curious if anyone else has experienced anyone like this before. Sorry if my description made no sense or was unclear, its hard to condense it all down lol."

We started out as friends she trying to console my heart that was really broken at the time; I was being a dead ass drunk every night with my pals and her older brother was one of them. Since she ""had nothing to do every night"" from her own words she kept us company she didn't drink much then but just enough to be participating with everyone, I showed her all my ugly sides, my drunk ass, my failures, my fears, my dreams, what i wanted in a person, what i wanted in a relationship, the stuff I went through my previous relationship as she told me hers too. Honestly we both weren't looking for a new relationship since I told her that from the start I couldn't lie to myself and to others since I was still in love with my ex at that time. Slowly my nights of drinking with her and our pals became just nights of bonding having fun eating/cooking stuff and watching shows. As I began to heal my heart and felt that I was moving on (finally after 5-6mos or so). Our circle of friends was beginning to tease us both that we should just start dating each other, that we both look good together and our personalities are really in sync with each other. And talking to her every night it was really like that. I never had to hide anything from her she quickly became my best friend she could tell me everything I should hear her words would hurt and sting my heart; attack my soul, beliefs and personality but it was always a wake up call she showed me my faults, she became my worst critic but my number 1 supporter. &amp;#x200B; After sometime we got into something like an unofficial relationship meaning we started out without any labels we were both still studying at the time she was in college she was delayed in her studies because she had to work part time to finance her own studies and I've just started my masters degree at that time and promised each other that we would become official when we both started working. After her graduation she quickly got work from where she interned at being a car sales agent. She was really good at it, despite having troubles at first, I would help her out whenever I can; she had real big ass bitchy boss that always blame everyone under her wing for her mistakes, and her boss doesn't really do work she's just there daily to gossip with other people and if you don't follow her or accept her ways she will make your life at work very miserable so I tried my best everyday and night to listen to her rants about her boss about the stress of her work, her quotas, her frustrating clients, and sometimes lend her money or ask some of my cousins to lend me money if my cash wasn't enough so she can give additional discounts to her clients so that they would go ahead with the deal. She would always gave my money back though 100%. She was very shy about it at first and didn't really want to ask me for help especially about money. About me I came from a pretty well off family and she comes from a very simple background. At first she was very hesitant to be with me because she was afraid that people might see our relationship and look at her as only being with me for money and that her father is an substance abuse addict and their family(uncles,aunts and some cousins) is quite known to be filled with addicts and gamblers more than enough that they've thrown away their enormous wealth due to it; but she wasn't like them at all she was a working student she paid for her education, she didn't ask for help he worked 2 part time jobs, she went to a state run university which help her meet the tuition fee but that state university is one of the top 10 of our country. Sadly before her graduation her mom died due to a heart attack she was really fit so it was really a surprise of us. I've yet to talk to her mom by then I was too scared of her mom back then, I've talked to her dad before and asked his permission to court his daughter he gave me his permission but I've yet to talked to her mom yet before I have had mustered my courage she passed on. One of my regrets in life that I wasn't a man enough to face her mom and ask for her permission and blessing. I was a coward no backbone at all. During those times I've stuck with my ex every day and night of her mom's wake tried my best to be her support, her shoulder to cry on. She was really angry at her father at the time since a few weeks before her mom's passing, her older brother caught their father with another woman. Then when their mom confronted their dad about it, he was trying to kick them all out of their home and choose the other woman. It took months for them to at least try to talk to their father and much more to forgive him but still blame him and the other woman for their moms death, we all think that their mom died due to the stress she was facing and while having said to her husband to take her to the doctor/hospital since her heart was aching and feeling very strange their dad said that their mom was only acting. And their mom had to ask one of their neighbors to accompany her to the hospital but while they were getting ready to leave she, fell down and had a heart attack and died right there and then. After their moms wake and burial I was invited into their house by their mom's siblings and finally got to introduce myself to them as their niece's suitor. After then I started visiting their place every night, &amp;#x200B; My ex's older brother, which is my childhood friend and one of my very best pals was really pissed off at me by then since he knew I've not have asked their mom's permission and only his father's but since they are mad at their dad. It made him fill that I have yet no right to go their house and much more stay at his younger sisters room every night till early morning. He was angry, he was trying to find acceptance of what has happened to their mom, their family, he was also trying to protect his younger sister he might see me as trying to take advantage of the vulnerability of her younger sister back then. I can totally understand him. Unbeknownst to anyone besides me and my ex we already had sex way before any of this happening. After like 6-8 mos of being in an unofficial relationship we've already have done the deed. Since we were old enough by then and both have came from long relationships that were also been sexually active by those times. Fast forward 2 years I was diagnosed with guttate psoriasis it was hell for me, I had it 90% all over my body, I had psoriatic arthritis, the medication was really expensive all of my savings nearly gone just to have myself be back to what I once was, I was taking biologics which were really really expensive. And the topical steroids that I would have need to put on my skin twice a day was really time consuming but she never complained, she still loved me for who I was flaky skin and all it was my most depressing time of my life and there she was my rock, my unmovable source of strength. My self-esteem nearly gone, went into depression and self-pity but aside all that she kept on loving me, the same or even more so than before. She would always help me with my meds day and night when ever she got the chance. I fell inlove with her more since then. Enough about our past let me tell you guys about her.... On her looks I say she is 8-9/10 and me a 6-7/10 at best. She is fierce, really goal oriented, she knows what she wants what her dreams are and make every rational assessment and plan to achieve her dreams. While other people try their best to not offend me in anyway since they know and respect me and especially my family's name and businesses in our city, she openly tells me what she thinks she isn't hiding her thoughts or her feelings she tells me what I need to hear and its really eye opening, really refreshing and really the main reasons why I've matured and wanted to improve on myself I just can't get over her feistyness, but she's super sweet and caring much much more on what I can ask for. She laugh loudly, she tries to keep some of our problems inside her until she can't no longer and just explodes and I try with all my might to pursue her and calm her down so we can be together again. Its early 2018 by this point we both went on a plane and visited their mom's hometown and siblings. We went to the beach but there was storm on hitting the country by that time and while traveling to a remote island to stay on for a day or two she got wet by the storm and had fever by the night. It was a remote island poor signal reception, a generator serving as the island main source of electricity which is only running for 6-8 hours a day. Luckily I always travel with medicines just in case. I tried my best to take care of her slept beside her in our little wooden hut like shelter where it still very cold due to the typhoon. When it came the day to leave the island we checked in at a really nice hotel let her rest there by the next morning her high fever had come down by a lot. And what do 25-26 years old do when their all alone in a really nice hotel suite. We had sex of course! but during that I've been feeling all too proud of myself then since I've taken care of her really really well and stayed beside her through that tough storm we live in the Philippines by the way and on that alone you know how strong our typhoons can be when they hit. During mid way having sex I asked her right then and there to be officially my GF in my head it was really romantic but in her head in registered differently as in do I all think about her and our relationship as just sex. &amp;#x200B; She would often wanted to talk to me about my plans for the future. I on the other had really no concrete plans whatsoever when I finished college, took up masters and culinary arts on the side finished my culinary arts and still doing my thesis for master but its been 4years already since then. I've just started my first real job in March 2019 wherein I've worked as a cook at an oil tanker leaving our country for 8 months. Before leaving the country for work everyone in my family and some of our friends kept on telling me that I should not even do that kind of work since I had the money and my family's multiple businesses are doing very well that I should just learn to handle those and not leave the country at all since looking at it financially there was no really need to. But I felt I was being pressured my parents and her to look for a job because we both know I'm still immature, too sheltered, played everything safe, not really fully independent since I was earning by doing some work for the family business and I could have totally live off of that and start a family from what I was earning there and it wouldn't be so bad either think of it as a high-middle class family since my gf at the time was really killing it with her job making more than enough for her to live comfortably alone and still saving some at the bank as well. She was looking at me trying to find some sense of security and stability. I think of it that she was really right as a man I should have my shit together at least by a bit by that time. She waited for me for 5 years we were still unofficial couple even though I have asked her to be my GF officially that one time at the hotel she didn't really liked the situation we were in while I asked it so she didn't really gave a straight answer but she did express and told me she loved me. Since we were both happy, both our families and friends have accepted us as a couple looking at us from the outsiders view we were almost perfect. In those 5 years we've been apart not more than 10-15 days. Every night I would go their place no matter the situation I would always try to be with her everyday as much as I can. We would live life like a lived in couple, we would, shop together, cook together even made repairs of her house together. It was really living the life though it was simple it wasn't grand or comfortable as I was in my own home it felt more than home. Every day and night I was with her I felt at was at home. We both did, we felt happy, though at the back of our minds there was always that problem we kept on avoiding to discuss with each other and that my plans for the future. Every time she would ask me this I tell her I would save all my earnings and start a business of my own or invest in another business of my family to earn more than what I was already earning at that time. I felt it was the right answer to her question. But slowly I realized after when I came back to the country this Nov 2019 from my 8 mos contract. That even then all I was giving were all playsafe answers, I didn't dare to risk, I would let other do the decisions for me and just give them money to start of the business or something along those lines. That isn't really me taking hold and being independent and standing up for my life. And all of those answers that I gave her was all about me and my plans for myself not one bit did I even try to put her with my plans. I just assumed that we would never break apart that we would always be together. I took her for granted, I was too selfish, I didn't gave her enough, I didn't tried my best to keep her to make her happy. That I came to realize, late Sept to late October 2019 a few weeks before I go back home and be with my then GF I've been seeings signs of her being unhappy, our video calls and chats are becoming less and less romantic the spark in her eyes and on the way she talks and chats are fading. I thought to myself it'll be all okay and we'll be okay when I get back. 2 weeks from coming back home she told me that she wasn't happy anymore that she wanted for both of us to grow and mature while apart since being together seems to make me not grow or not try to since she usually lets me be, she doesn't nag about our problems or her problems. She said above all else she wants me to come home safely then we should talk about our relationship in person. And that she might be feeling confused or down since she just really misses me and that being apart for so 8 mos made us comfortable with the spark in our relationship dimming a little and becoming monotonous we never have had LDR before maybe we were getting in on our last ends any longer maybe it'll really ruin our relationship apart. She just keeps them all in and finds time to tell me them when she just couldn't handle them anymore. I asked her jokingly if there is another guy that she likes now because she said she was confused(knowing her and what she experience and what her mom had went through) I had full confidence in her that she would never cheat on me. When I got back, I tried to surprise her she was at home having the stomach flu so she couldn't fetch me at the airport. She said that upon coming home I should just go and get some rest since it was almost midnight when I got back home. Still I went to their house luckily her brother saw me and lend me his keys to the house. I opened the door to her room she was there laying down with her flu she stood up quickly and gave me the tightest, longest and warmest hug I've received in my life. I tried to spend the night at her place but I was shocked that she wouldn't let me. Every time and day I tried to be with her it feels hollow, the love before really faded out, I thought we just got used to being apart for 8 mos that it feels natural now. She became more independent than what she was 8 mos ago. She was more amazing. But in the end after a 2 weeks talked about us and said she wanted to break up. She wanted space for the both of us to mature more since being together isn't helping me mature. I let her this time I gave her what she wanted. Whenever we fight about stuff its always about the same thing me having no work, still dependent on my family's business as a source of income. She was looking for security, stability, she loved me with all her heart no doubt about that, she gave me so many second chances I've wasted it all, never became much more mature. I couldn't catch up to her, where she is right now. While I was overseas we booked a flight to Thailand for a week just the two of us. We were still in very good terms and would usually chat, call or meet up sometime to say hi and catch up with each other. I felt that if this continues we would be back together again since the connection is still there. But when the time to leave for Thailand came she couldn't come with me saying that her work wouldn't let her go she had to much to do. So I left alone by mysef, tried to be a solo backpakcer made my own itinerary visited temples, markets and all sorts of things by myself. Along the way during the trip I've met with few new friends from different countries in the hostel I was staying at (i refunded the hotel we were supposed to be staying at since I was gonna be traveling solo and theres no point having a fancy hotel suite just for myself). It was different purely, unnatural for me but refreshing. During my week in Thailand my ex was always chatting with me, always wanting to know where I was, what I was doing, reminding me to be safe; I know the love was still there we both knew it. I've talked to several people in the hostel I stayed at shared experiences and met a French guy about the same age as me and we talk about whats been going through in our lives. I told him about my relationship with my ex. I was crying to a complete strange holding a beer at one hand and wiping my tears on my face with the other. Then he said something profound to me, why am I hurting? Does it hurt because I miss her, does it hurt because I felt that those 5 years were now gone and wasted? or does it hurt because of all the what could have beens in my and my ex's future. Then I realized what hurted more is that when he mentioned the pain of losing the future, those what ifs what could have been. And he said that to me we only have the present, the right now, that what we got, what we could change. the future isn't here yet it isn't set yet. Then why not go and try to win her back. Those words hit me deep, I got my determination back to win her back again. When I got back from Thailand we spend a couple of nights together as friends at her place I gave her some trinkets and foods from Thailand since she's quite the foodie. I told her about the French guy I've met and the realizations I've had. She was happy for me she told me I was sounding more and more mature much more sincere. After 3 days I finally got to sleep at her room again. Nothing happened since we are no longer a thing anymore and she doesn't want that to happen and I respect her decisions but we did sleep at each others arms. I woke up to the sound of her alarm around 5am she was gonna go get ready for work. Then I saw a face trying to video call her at the same time but it did not bother me since. Her job usually is to talk to clients on the phone at different times of the day since some of her clients are sea farers or OFWs from different time zones as well. But I tried to open her phone. Since before our phone are open for both of us to easily access we both have our fingerprints recorded on each of our devices. But upon me coming back she didn't want me to hold her phone at any point in time. But she was as sleep right now I tried to open it and saw her in box. There was a number upon opening their chat all I read was them talking with each other and calling each other ""love"". My heart sank my stomach felt cold I quickly locked her phone and left her room. I was angry, I was scared, I was thinking all sorts of things. Just when I had made the decision to try my best again and win her back I saw this. Was she lying to me? since when did it happen? all i know is that was the same guy who called earlier and was wearing the same uniform from her work. I don't even know his name since it wasn't recorded in her contacts but since it he was her friends on a social media platform his face can be linked through his mobile number and his social media account. I just saw his face, initials and work clothes. I was so angry, so full of self pity and anguish I didn't have anyone else to talk to. Since if I told one of my friends it might reach the ears of my family and or her brother I would rather keep it quiet than her be called out and be bullied and it would definitely put a wedge between our circle of friends since me and her older brother are really good friends. Looking back when I a few weeks before when our circle of friends knew that me and my gf had broke up; one of my pals tried to tell me something that he saw her and a guy one a date in a mall somewhere. I told myself it might be people from work or one of her clients since she usually meets them at public places to avoid being cornered with a stranger if their office is too far for the client to come to. I have total trust in her so I've just ignored it and told myself that was just the case and paid no bother to what my pal said. &amp;#x200B; I've change my profile picture and cover photo of what was Me and Her to another random stuff i found on my phone. Which might have had shocked her since I've had that picture of us set up for 2 years or more or so. She chatted with me and gave her a cold reply and somewhat is baiting her that I know something. She quickly knew something was off and asked me if I've opened my phone. I left her hanging not answering or replying her calls and messages for a whole day and went of doing my tasks for the day. When she got back from work at night I said to her that I wanted to come over she quickly replied and said yes. &amp;#x200B; In her room I confronted her with what i saw. I told her I could not even scrolled up and checked their other past conversations since I was too shaken to do so. I cried my heart out to her I told her, that don't I have at least the right to know, when did it start, who, and why.... she was crying she said that she was sorry and she didn't know when to tell me since she didn't want to hurt me. She told me everything that the guy was also from her office that when the guy told her that he wanted to pursue her she told him that she was in a relationship but she also told him that she was no longer happy with our relationship however she wants to a clean break up first before she can entertain her. I got back from abroad in 1st week of Nov we broke up around the last week of Nov. She said she the guy approached her around October and she kept him away not until December when we broke up. She said she still doesn't know the guy well enough and she has doubts still with him, as well as with me since my record with her was filled with broken promises and always took her for granted, I'm not much of a romantic type she kept on telling me she loved me for 5 years and waited for me to mature enough but I still am immature, still couldn't give her the little effort and appreciation she totally deserves I acknowledge my faults that why some other guy could enter and filled in my inadequacies. I let another took upon my role with as much putting it the proper effort to do so. Do I feel betrayed I'm not gonna lie and say that I don't, do I feel jealous? yes so much so that its crushing my soul. Do I still love her, yes I'm willing to try again to win her back. I know its gonna be difficult the other guy has pretty much has his life figured out. My ex gf doesn't care about money at all she can earn that shit by her self. She wanted from me a little bit of appreciation, a little bit of effort; I know that I've failed her I feel happy when I'm with her. At some nights we still go out together to eat or just hang out in her room talk about life, our plans, our past. Our plans mainly her plans are all about herself now. Before she would always adjust her life plans and goals to what I was planning on or deciding on. Now we live different lives. Last night she didn't come home and told me she'll come home tomorrow. She said she's with her friends from work, I asked her if the other guy is also with there but she dodges the question. whenever I ask about the other guy she usually dodges the question. I told her that she can tell the other guy that I'm trying to win her back also I don't know if she did or not. Right now I'm giving her space to enjoy her life and with her workmates whether the other guy is with her now or not regardless. When she comes home tomorrow I might ask her if he was with her but I don't know what I'll do with if she answered yes. I told her a few days ago to let her heart decide who she will love this time either me or not I'll be okay with it. &amp;#x200B; Because right now I feel like if I don't at least try my heart out, even if its gonna be painful even if it will be one hell of emotional ride for me I feel like she deserves my all this time around and I'll put her above everything this time around. I don't what to regret if I stop now maybe years down the line if she got married to someone else maybe the new guy or some other guy I don't want to live a life looking back and telling my self what ifs. I'm a fool, I'm a god damned idiot, but I do still love her I really don't know what to do. My mind is telling me no, enough is enough, the doubt, the jealousy in my mind is racing all the time. but my heart really really still loves her. &amp;#x200B; I know this has been quite long and there are many things I might have skipped out on or just completely forgot due to the rush of emotions I'm feeling right now. I'm confused I just have no one to tell this to, I want to protect her still my family is starting to tell me that she must have had other suitors by now since she isn't budging and were still not okay I'm just telling them that we're okay, cause we still talk and go out together and they can see the both of us sometimes when we ran into each other on malls, restaurants or just outside in our neighborhood since we live practically only a few blocks apart. You know family will always have your back but still if they knew about the other guy rumors will arise and I don't want to hurt her. If she did really choose someone else besides me as long as she's happy I'll be okay I keep on telling that to myself. The night when we broke up on the last week of November I asked her that and she said yes, a few night a go we were laying in bed in her rooms I asked her that once again she was hugging me and she said she was happy. She told me the love she feels for me will never go away but maybe now is not the right time. Or that maybe we really aren't meant for each other, or maybe down the line we'll be together again much more older, wiser and more mature about life. &amp;#x200B; Last week she asked me again what my plans are I told her, I wanted to win her back, I told her I wanted to go work in another 8 mos contract. She frowned and told me she will not stop me if that is my decision however. I'm just wasting my time, talent and resources by doing so; the pay is great don't get me wrong about it I'm earning at least 1700 USD a month, free food, accommodation and everything. But I can also earn as close as that or even more that if i stay in the country as well, if I just put it in the effort. I keep on telling myself that my psoriasis meds are expensive that I have to do this for that and for my future family since psoriasis is hereditary. But I think I'm also lying to myself that I'd rather do monotonous mundane stuff than be in charge. I doubt myself to be the boss of any business. I don't think I can but I've never tried yet, she really believes that I can that I'm just escaping again. She doesn't tell me that directly but I can feel it from her eyes, her actions, her look and attitude. &amp;#x200B; So for my fellow redditors I don't know what to ask really, a comment, advise, suggestion on what you guys think on what should do or what? Until now my heart and mind is torn apart but I'm ignoring logic and my mind for now and just following what my heart desires... thank you for taking your time to read my story. please do comment away on what you guys think."
90,vulnerability,dating_advice,I(28M) am trying to win her back (27F) I'm now lost and don't know what to do.,1,ex2u5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ex2u5b/i28m_am_trying_to_win_her_back_27f_im_now_lost/,2020-02-01 18:54:09,"This would be my first post here, forgive my grammar english isn't my first language and I'm not really of a story teller so my story telling might be ""jumpy"" but I plan on to write everything in detail as to what has happened so this will be a very long read but everything here will be all in truth and from my heart honestly while typing this my heart feels heavy and my hands are shaking all the emotions just keeps on seeping out. &amp;#x200B; Hi everyone I 28M have been in a relationship with my now exgf 28F since 2014 we both just got out of a long term relationship at that time; me from a 6yrs one and her from a 5yrs one. We started out as friends she trying to console my heart that was really broken at the time; I was being a dead ass drunk every night with my pals and her older brother was one of them. Since she ""had nothing to do every night"" from her own words she kept us company she didn't drink much then but just enough to be participating with everyone, I showed her all my ugly sides, my drunk ass, my failures, my fears, my dreams, what i wanted in a person, what i wanted in a relationship, the stuff I went through my previous relationship as she told me hers too. Honestly we both weren't looking for a new relationship since I told her that from the start I couldn't lie to myself and to others since I was still in love with my ex at that time. Slowly my nights of drinking with her and our pals became just nights of bonding having fun eating/cooking stuff and watching shows. As I began to heal my heart and felt that I was moving on (finally after 5-6mos or so). Our circle of friends was beginning to tease us both that we should just start dating each other, that we both look good together and our personalities are really in sync with each other. And talking to her every night it was really like that. I never had to hide anything from her she quickly became my best friend she could tell me everything I should hear her words would hurt and sting my heart; attack my soul, beliefs and personality but it was always a wake up call she showed me my faults, she became my worst critic but my number 1 supporter. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; After sometime we got into something like an unofficial relationship meaning we started out without any labels we were both still studying at the time she was in college she was delayed in her studies because she had to work part time to finance her own studies and I've just started my masters degree at that time and promised each other that we would become official when we both started working. After her graduation she quickly got work from where she interned at being a car sales agent. She was really good at it, despite having troubles at first, I would help her out whenever I can; she had real big ass btchy boss that always blame everyone under her wing for her mistakes, and her boss doesn't really do work she's just there daily to gossip with other people and if you don't follow her or accept her ways she will make your life at work very miserable so I tried my best everyday and night to listen to her rants about her boss about the stress of her work, her quotas, her frustrating clients, and sometimes lend her money or ask some of my cousins to lend me money if my cash wasn't enough so she can give additional discounts to her clients so that they would go ahead with the deal. She would always gave my money back though 100%. She was very shy about it at first and didn't really want to ask me for help especially about money. &amp;#x200B; About me I came from a pretty well off family and she comes from a very simple background. At first she was very hesitant to be with me because she was afraid that people might see our relationship and look at her as only being with me for money and that her father is an substance abuse addict and their family(uncles,aunts and some cousins) is quite known to be filled with addicts and gamblers more than enough that they've thrown away their enormous wealth due to it; but she wasn't like them at all she was a working student she paid for her education, she didn't ask for help he worked 2 part time jobs, she went to a state run university which help her meet the tuition fee but that state university is one of the top 10 of our country. Sadly before her graduation her mom died due to a heart attack she was really fit so it was really a surprise of us. I've yet to talk to her mom by then I was too scared of her mom back then, I've talked to her dad before and asked his permission to court his daughter he gave me his permission but I've yet to talked to her mom yet before I have had mustered my courage she passed on. One of my regrets in life that I wasn't a man enough to face her mom and ask for her permission and blessing. I was a coward no backbone at all. During those times I've stuck with my ex every day and night of her mom's wake tried my best to be her support, her shoulder to cry on. She was really angry at her father at the time since a few weeks before her mom's passing, her older brother caught their father with another woman. Then when their mom confronted their dad about it, he was trying to kick them all out of their home and choose the other woman. It took months for them to at least try to talk to their father and much more to forgive him but still blame him and the other woman for their moms death, we all think that their mom died due to the stress she was facing and while having said to her husband to take her to the doctor/hospital since her heart was aching and feeling very strange their dad said that their mom was only acting. And their mom had to ask one of their neighbors to accompany her to the hospital but while they were getting ready to leave she, fell down and had a heart attack and died right there and then. After their moms wake and burial I was invited into their house by their mom's siblings and finally got to introduce myself to them as their niece's suitor. After then I started visiting their place every night, &amp;#x200B; My ex's older brother, which is my childhood friend and one of my very best pals was really pissed off at me by then since he knew I've not have asked their mom's permission and only his father's but since they are mad at their dad. It made him fill that I have yet no right to go their house and much more stay at his younger sisters room every night till early morning. He was angry, he was trying to find acceptance of what has happened to their mom, their family, he was also trying to protect his younger sister he might see me as trying to take advantage of the vulnerability of her younger sister back then. I can totally understand him. Unbeknownst to anyone besides me and my ex we already had sex way before any of this happening. After like 6-8 mos of being in an unofficial relationship we've already have done the deed. Since we were old enough by then and both have came from long relationships that were also been sexually active by those times. &amp;#x200B; Fast forward 2 years I was diagnosed with guttate psoriasis it was hell for me, I had it 90% all over my body, I had psoriatic arthritis, the medication was really expensive all of my savings nearly gone just to have myself be back to what I once was, I was taking biologics which were really really expensive. And the topical steroids that I would have need to put on my skin twice a day was really time consuming but she never complained, she still loved me for who I was flaky skin and all it was my most depressing time of my life and there she was my rock, my unmovable source of strength. My self-esteem nearly gone, went into depression and self-pity but aside all that she kept on loving me, the same or even more so than before. She would always help me with my meds day and night when ever she got the chance. I fell inlove with her more since then. &amp;#x200B; Enough about our past let me tell you guys about her.... &amp;#x200B; On her looks I say she is 8-9/10 and me a 6-7/10 at best. She is fierce, really goal oriented, she knows what she wants what her dreams are and make every rational assessment and plan to achieve her dreams. While other people try their best to not offend me in anyway since they know and respect me and especially my family's name and businesses in our city, she openly tells me what she thinks she isn't hiding her thoughts or her feelings she tells me what I need to hear and its really eye opening, really refreshing and really the main reasons why I've matured and wanted to improve on myself I just can't get over her feistyness, but she's super sweet and caring much much more on what I can ask for. She laugh loudly, she tries to keep some of our problems inside her until she can't no longer and just explodes and I try with all my might to pursue her and calm her down so we can be together again. Its early 2018 by this point we both went on a plane and visited their mom's hometown and siblings. We went to the beach but there was storm on hitting the country by that time and while traveling to a remote island to stay on for a day or two she got wet by the storm and had fever by the night. It was a remote island poor signal reception, a generator serving as the island main source of electricity which is only running for 6-8 hours a day. Luckily I always travel with medicines just in case. I tried my best to take care of her slept beside her in our little wooden hut like shelter where it still very cold due to the typhoon. When it came the day to leave the island we checked in at a really nice hotel let her rest there by the next morning her high fever had come down by a lot. And what do 25-26 years old do when their all alone in a really nice hotel suite. We had sex of course! but during that I've been feeling all too proud of myself then since I've taken care of her really really well and stayed beside her through that tough storm we live in the Philippines by the way and on that alone you know how strong our typhoons can be when they hit. During mid way having sex I asked her right then and there to be officially my GF in my head it was really romantic but in her head in registered differently as in do I all think about her and our relationship as just sex. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; She would often wanted to talk to me about my plans for the future. I on the other had really no concrete plans whatsoever when I finished college, took up masters and culinary arts on the side finished my culinary arts and still doing my thesis for master but its been 4years already since then. I've just started my first real job in March 2019 wherein I've worked as a cook at an oil tanker leaving our country for 8 months. Before leaving the country for work everyone in my family and some of our friends kept on telling me that I should not even do that kind of work since I had the money and my family's multiple businesses are doing very well that I should just learn to handle those and not leave the country at all since looking at it financially there was no really need to. But I felt I was being pressured my parents and her to look for a job because we both know I'm still immature, too sheltered, played everything safe, not really fully independent since I was earning by doing some work for the family business and I could have totally live off of that and start a family from what I was earning there and it wouldn't be so bad either think of it as a high-middle class family since my gf at the time was really killing it with her job making more than enough for her to live comfortably alone and still saving some at the bank as well. She was looking at me trying to find some sense of security and stability. I think of it that she was really right as a man I should have my shit together at least by a bit by that time. She waited for me for 5 years we were still unofficial couple even though I have asked her to be my GF officially that one time at the hotel she didn't really liked the situation we were in while I asked it so she didn't really gave a straight answer but she did express and told me she loved me. Since we were both happy, both our families and friends have accepted us as a couple looking at us from the outsiders view we were almost perfect. In those 5 years we've been apart not more than 10-15 days. Every night I would go their place no matter the situation I would always try to be with her everyday as much as I can. We would live life like a lived in couple, we would, shop together, cook together even made repairs of her house together. It was really living the life though it was simple it wasn't grand or comfortable as I was in my own home it felt more than home. Every day and night I was with her I felt at was at home. We both did, we felt happy, though at the back of our minds there was always that problem we kept on avoiding to discuss with each other and that my plans for the future. Every time she would ask me this I tell her I would save all my earnings and start a business of my own or invest in another business of my family to earn more than what I was already earning at that time. I felt it was the right answer to her question. But slowly I realized after when I came back to the country this Nov 2019 from my 8 mos contract. That even then all I was giving were all playsafe answers, I didn't dare to risk, I would let other do the decisions for me and just give them money to start of the business or something along those lines. That isn't really me taking hold and being independent and standing up for my life. And all of those answers that I gave her was all about me and my plans for myself not one bit did I even try to put her with my plans. I just assumed that we would never break apart that we would always be together. &amp;#x200B; I took her for granted, I was too selfish, I didn't gave her enough, I didn't tried my best to keep her to make her happy. That I came to realize, late Sept to late October 2019 a few weeks before I go back home and be with my then GF I've been seeings signs of her being unhappy, our video calls and chats are becoming less and less romantic the spark in her eyes and on the way she talks and chats are fading. I thought to myself it'll be all okay and we'll be okay when I get back. 2 weeks from coming back home she told me that she wasn't happy anymore that she wanted for both of us to grow and mature while apart since being together seems to make me not grow or not try to since she usually lets me be, she doesn't nag about our problems or her problems. She said above all else she wants me to come home safely then we should talk about our relationship in person. And that she might be feeling confused or down since she just really misses me and that being apart for so 8 mos made us comfortable with the spark in our relationship dimming a little and becoming monotonous we never have had LDR before maybe we were getting in on our last ends any longer maybe it'll really ruin our relationship apart. She just keeps them all in and finds time to tell me them when she just couldn't handle them anymore. I asked her jokingly if there is another guy that she likes now because she said she was confused(knowing her and what she experience and what her mom had went through) I had full confidence in her that she would never cheat on me. &amp;#x200B; When I got back, I tried to surprise her she was at home having the stomach flu so she couldn't fetch me at the airport. She said that upon coming home I should just go and get some rest since it was almost midnight when I got back home. Still I went to their house luckily her brother saw me and lend me his keys to the house. I opened the door to her room she was there laying down with her flu she stood up quickly and gave me the tightest, longest and warmest hug I've received in my life. I tried to spend the night at her place but I was shocked that she wouldn't let me. Every time and day I tried to be with her it feels hollow, the love before really faded out, I thought we just got used to being apart for 8 mos that it feels natural now. She became more independent than what she was 8 mos ago. She was more amazing. But in the end after a 2 weeks talked about us and said she wanted to break up. She wanted space for the both of us to mature more since being together isn't helping me mature. I let her this time I gave her what she wanted. &amp;#x200B; Whenever we fight about stuff its always about the same thing me having no work, still dependent on my family's business as a source of income. She was looking for security, stability, she loved me with all her heart no doubt about that, she gave me so many second chances I've wasted it all, never became much more mature. I couldn't catch up to her, where she is right now. While I was overseas we booked a flight to Thailand for a week just the two of us. We were still in very good terms and would usually chat, call or meet up sometime to say hi and catch up with each other. I felt that if this continues we would be back together again since the connection is still there. But when the time to leave for Thailand came she couldn't come with me saying that her work wouldn't let her go she had to much to do. So I left alone by mysef, tried to be a solo backpakcer made my own itinerary visited temples, markets and all sorts of things by myself. Along the way during the trip I've met with few new friends from different countries in the hostel I was staying at (i refunded the hotel we were supposed to be staying at since I was gonna be traveling solo and theres no point having a fancy hotel suite just for myself). It was different purely, unnatural for me but refreshing. During my week in Thailand my ex was always chatting with me, always wanting to know where I was, what I was doing, reminding me to be safe; I know the love was still there we both knew it. I've talked to several people in the hostel I stayed at shared experiences and met a French guy about the same age as me and we talk about whats been going through in our lives. I told him about my relationship with my ex. I was crying to a complete strange holding a beer at one hand and wiping my tears on my face with the other. Then he said something profound to me, why am I hurting? Does it hurt because I miss her, does it hurt because I felt that those 5 years were now gone and wasted? or does it hurt because of all the what could have beens in my and my ex's future. Then I realized what hurted more is that when he mentioned the pain of losing the future, those what ifs what could have been. And he said that to me we only have the present, the right now, that what we got, what we could change. the future isn't here yet it isn't set yet. Then why not go and try to win her back. &amp;#x200B; Those words hit me deep, I got my determination back to win her back again. When I got back from Thailand we spend a couple of nights together as friends at her place I gave her some trinkets and foods from Thailand since she's quite the foodie. I told her about the French guy I've met and the realizations I've had. She was happy for me she told me I was sounding more and more mature much more sincere. After 3 days I finally got to sleep at her room again. Nothing happened since we are no longer a thing anymore and she doesn't want that to happen and I respect her decisions but we did sleep at each others arms. I woke up to the sound of her alarm around 5am she was gonna go get ready for work. Then I saw a face trying to video call her at the same time but it did not bother me since. Her job usually is to talk to clients on the phone at different times of the day since some of her clients are sea farers or OFWs from different time zones as well. But I tried to open her phone. Since before our phone are open for both of us to easily access we both have our fingerprints recorded on each of our devices. But upon me coming back she didn't want me to hold her phone at any point in time. But she was as sleep right now I tried to open it and saw her in box. There was a number upon opening their chat all I read was them talking with each other and calling each other ""love"". My heart sank my stomach felt cold I quickly locked her phone and left her room. I was angry, I was scared, I was thinking all sorts of things. Just when I had made the decision to try my best again and win her back I saw this. Was she lying to me? since when did it happen? all i know is that was the same guy who called earlier and was wearing the same uniform from her work. I don't even know his name since it wasn't recorded in her contacts but since it he was her friends on a social media platform his face can be linked through his mobile number and his social media account. I just saw his face, initials and work clothes. &amp;#x200B; I was so angry, so full of self pity and anguish I didn't have anyone else to talk to. Since if I told one of my friends it might reach the ears of my family and or her brother I would rather keep it quiet than her be called out and be bullied and it would definitely put a wedge between our circle of friends since me and her older brother are really good friends. &amp;#x200B; Looking back when I a few weeks before when our circle of friends knew that me and my gf had broke up; one of my pals tried to tell me something that he saw her and a guy one a date in a mall somewhere. I told myself it might be people from work or one of her clients since she usually meets them at public places to avoid being cornered with a stranger if their office is too far for the client to come to. I have total trust in her so I've just ignored it and told myself that was just the case and paid no bother to what my pal said. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I've change my profile picture and cover photo of what was Me and Her to another random stuff i found on my phone. Which might have had shocked her since I've had that picture of us set up for 2 years or more or so. She chatted with me and gave her a cold reply and somewhat is baiting her that I know something. She quickly knew something was off and asked me if I've opened my phone. I left her hanging not answering or replying her calls and messages for a whole day and went of doing my tasks for the day. When she got back from work at night I said to her that I wanted to come over she quickly replied and said yes. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; In her room I confronted her with what i saw. I told her I could not even scrolled up and checked their other past conversations since I was too shaken to do so. I cried my heart out to her I told her, that don't I have at least the right to know, when did it start, who, and why.... she was crying she said that she was sorry and she didn't know when to tell me since she didn't want to hurt me. She told me everything that the guy was also from her office that when the guy told her that he wanted to pursue her she told him that she was in a relationship but she also told him that she was no longer happy with our relationship however she wants to a clean break up first before she can entertain her. I got back from abroad in 1st week of Nov we broke up around the last week of Nov. She said she the guy approached her around October and she kept him away not until December when we broke up. She said she still doesn't know the guy well enough and she has doubts still with him, as well as with me since my record with her was filled with broken promises and always took her for granted, I'm not much of a romantic type she kept on telling me she loved me for 5 years and waited for me to mature enough but I still am immature, still couldn't give her the little effort and appreciation she totally deserves I acknowledge my faults that why some other guy could enter and filled in my inadequacies. I let another took upon my role with as much putting it the proper effort to do so. Do I feel betrayed I'm not gonna lie and say that I don't, do I feel jealous? yes so much so that its crushing my soul. Do I still love her, yes I'm willing to try again to win her back. I know its gonna be difficult the other guy has pretty much has his life figured out. My ex gf doesn't care about money at all she can earn that shit by her self. She wanted from me a little bit of appreciation, a little bit of effort; I know that I've failed her I feel happy when I'm with her. At some nights we still go out together to eat or just hang out in her room talk about life, our plans, our past. Our plans mainly her plans are all about herself now. Before she would always adjust her life plans and goals to what I was planning on or deciding on. Now we live different lives. Last night she didn't come home and told me she'll come home tomorrow. She said she's with her friends from work, I asked her if the other guy is also with there but she dodges the question. whenever I ask about the other guy she usually dodges the question. I told her that she can tell the other guy that I'm trying to win her back also I don't know if she did or not. Right now I'm giving her space to enjoy her life and with her workmates whether the other guy is with her now or not regardless. When she comes home tomorrow I might ask her if he was with her but I don't know what I'll do with if she answered yes. I told her a few days ago to let her heart decide who she will love this time either me or not I'll be okay with it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Because right now I feel like if I don't at least try my heart out, even if its gonna be painful even if it will be one hell of emotional ride for me I feel like she deserves my all this time around and I'll put her above everything this time around. I don't what to regret if I stop now maybe years down the line if she got married to someone else maybe the new guy or some other guy I don't want to live a life looking back and telling my self what ifs. I'm a fool, I'm a god damned idiot, but I do still love her I really don't know what to do. My mind is telling me no, enough is enough, the doubt, the jealousy in my mind is racing all the time. but my heart really really still loves her. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I know this has been quite long and there are many things I might have skipped out on or just completely forgot due to the rush of emotions I'm feeling right now. I'm confused I just have no one to tell this to, I want to protect her still my family is starting to tell me that she must have had other suitors by now since she isn't budging and were still not okay I'm just telling them that we're okay, cause we still talk and go out together and they can see the both of us sometimes when we ran into each other on malls, restaurants or just outside in our neighborhood since we live practically only a few blocks apart. You know family will always have your back but still if they knew about the other guy rumors will arise and I don't want to hurt her. If she did really choose someone else besides me as long as she's happy I'll be okay I keep on telling that to myself. The night when we broke up on the last week of November I asked her that and she said yes, a few night a go we were laying in bed in her rooms I asked her that once again she was hugging me and she said she was happy. She told me the love she feels for me will never go away but maybe now is not the right time. Or that maybe we really aren't meant for each other, or maybe down the line we'll be together again much more older, wiser and more mature about life. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Last week she asked me again what my plans are I told her, I wanted to win her back, I told her I wanted to go work in another 8 mos contract. She frowned and told me she will not stop me if that is my decision however. I'm just wasting my time, talent and resources by doing so; the pay is great don't get me wrong about it I'm earning at least 1700 USD a month, free food, accommodation and everything. But I can also earn as close as that or even more that if i stay in the country as well, if I just put it in the effort. I keep on telling myself that my psoriasis meds are expensive that I have to do this for that and for my future family since psoriasis is hereditary. But I think I'm also lying to myself that I'd rather do monotonous mundane stuff than be in charge. I doubt myself to be the boss of any business. I don't think I can but I've never tried yet, she really believes that I can that I'm just escaping again. She doesn't tell me that directly but I can feel it from her eyes, her actions, her look and attitude. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; So for my fellow redditors I don't know what to ask really, a comment, advise, suggestion on what you guys think on what should do or what? Until now my heart and mind is torn apart but I'm ignoring logic and my mind for now and just following what my heart desires... thank you for taking your time to read my story. please do comment away on what you guys think."

He is shy and reserved and that's one of the aspects I like the most about him. The problem is: I AM also shy and socially anxious. I was trying to convince myself that I only like him because I had an idealized image of him in my mind since we didn't really have the opportunity to talk that much, but I found him on insta and twitter and we have so many things in common. So, now I like him even more. After debating with myself about it, I followed him on instagram and he followed me back. That was in december. He used to watch every single one of my stories, and replied to two of them, I was so happy! I thought that that was the opportunity to start conversation. But he never followed through after I replied to him. Three weeks ago I replied to one of his stories, he said something funny in return, I said something back and that was it, he left me on read. After that, he would be the first person to watch ALL of my stories, then, he suddenly stopped. Or it seems like he goes through them fast, without really paying attention, I know that because in some stories he appears on the list and in others he doesn't. I don't know how to proceed from here. He is shy and I am too, plus I have social anxiety and now I'm convinced he thinks I'm a complete idiot even though it doesn't make any sense. I don't want my friends to know I like him. Why? Well, because of my fear of social humiliation. I know it doesn't make any sense, but that's just how anxiety works. I've only told one of my friends about him. She knows him because they go to the same places and she sometimes hangs out with one of his friends. She was very surprised when I told her how much I liked him. She said she'd never imagined I'd like someone like him and that I was out of his league. I'm afraid he might be thinking the same (? I mean, he doesn't seem to be insecure or anything. Quite the contrary, actually. I don't know how to connect with him right now. It's been more than one week since he hasn't posted something and I don't know how to start conversation otherwise. I'm not even sure if it's worth it pursuing something... I'm scared of ending up brokenhearted How do I overcome the fear of rejection and vulnerability? What if what I was thinking was correct and he really thinks I'm an idiot?"

Things always seem really great on the actual date, no awkward moments, we laugh a lot, talk about a lot of different things. From 4 out of 5 of these guys, I've gotten compliments from them basically being like, I can't believe you're single for how pretty you are and I can't believe I'm talking to someone like you- which I know could be a ""line"" but I also do know that I am physically above-average attractive. Problem is I am insecure and anxious at times and have been in a few very abusive relationships. I don't know. I feel like because I have so many emotional insecurities, for how attractive I am on the outside, I probably seem really down-to-earth and ""normal."" I know this sounds very braggy and egotistical but I swear I'm not, I just want to paint a complete picture of what I look like and how my personality is. On these dates, I feel like we talk about really deep things. Like one guy told me when he was 19, his girlfriend got an abortion and almost died. Another guy told me how he almost got married to his ex, but she cheated on him with 3 other men. I mean, we somehow always get into really deep shit and it's like this whirlwind of emotions and chemistry and attraction, and they're like, I don't want this night to end, holding onto me, kissing me, staying late. (No sex on the first dates though.) But I have never gotten a second date out of any of them, despite the fact that they were literally like, I don't want to go home, I want to keep being here with you. Like 3 of these guys have done that - saying, they don't want the night to end. So what am I doing wrong? Why are they so into me the first day and then not? We do tend to drink on the first dates... is it just drunken lust? Do I need to stop doing drinks? I've always tried to filter my dates so they are not in it for hookups, so I know our expectations are for relationships... but are they still just hoping for some action and when they don't get it, they just don't care anymore? And I do disclose to them that I am anxious sometimes because I feel like it's just being honest. It does tend to break the ice because most of them are like, yeah I'm nervous too! Or tell me something vulnerable. But is that vulnerability freaking them out the next day? Seriously, I want to know why I'm failing so hard... can anyone advise?"

Anyways I talk to her about it and tell her my feelings on how Ive lost trust in her and that I was hurt by her not mentioning these things. I found out through a friend of mine and on social media. We get to talking and she is apologetic but still acts very distant and says she feels sad that I lost my trust in her. I share my feelings with her but she seems be dismissive and tells me that she doesnt like sharing too many things about herself with others. I ask her for some empathy in this situation and I told her I get her point of view. She tells me that she cant feel vulnerable now with me. I tell her I respect her feelings and that we both have to communicate with each other more effectively and that we both still have a lot to learn about each others emotions and how we express them. She is understanding of this and agrees with me. Although I did feel like I blew it a little out of proportion because I let my emotions get to me(anger) . Tomorrow morning Im going to meet up with her and talk about this and need some advice on this situation. I still have deep feelings for her and love her and she does for me as well. I dont wish to end this relationship and just want to know how I can gain her vulnerability and patch this. Any thoughts and questions will help Thank you

Loving another person isnt about finding someone to be my world or even to make me happy i.e. to satisfy all my needs. Its my own love of life that comes first. When someone special comes along: I have my life, she has hers. I ask her if shed like to meet in that space in between. We share and celebrate our individual love of life, as well as respect our differences. There is magic lying in that space between us where we make the attempt. There are no guarantees whether it shall work out as wed each hope. But in that space, we love and desire - to have and to want. For longevity it takes trust, vulnerability, acceptance, communication and effort. I want to find someone to share that wonderous betwixt and between space with; to build a story with whilst we make that wondrous attempt."

Hes suddenly not into me?,1,ec3795,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ec3795/i_18m_was_flirting_with_this_guy_18m_and_we_were/,2019-12-18 09:31:54,"I was talking to this guy over social media. We both thought we were cute and we had this great back and forth chemistry. He was super sweet and seemed genuine with his flirting but one day he was like, I cant do this anymore, sorry. So I was like okay whats wrong? He said that the sexting we did was fun in the beginning but he suddenly made him feel dirty and sinful. So I was like okay, I wont send sexts anymore. And then he said no, I just want to be friends. And I was like why? He said that he doesnt feel emotions he feels like he should. Hes not sure whether hes felt actual love before or not. And he said that he feels like he plays with peoples emotions by pretending that he loves them. So I was like fine. Thing is, I think hes still into me, sexually and romantically, because when I asked him whether he was never attracted to me, he said (direct quote) no Im attracted, ugh, see thats the hard part, Im not sure. Quick info. Im really good at reading people. I have a high bullshit detector that has figured out multiple times without fail when guys are just pity-flirting with me . What I gather is, hes scared of emotional vulnerability because someone, whether it be boyfriend, friend or family member broke his trust, so he starts flirting with ppl online for the thrill of the kill thinking that this might be the one, but eventually his fight/flight instincts kick in and he blocks them. He said he was going to block me, but I was super genuine and hed feel bad doing that. As for the sex shame part I think its cause he grew up in Florida. According to him, his parents dont give a shit, but his grandma does. I mean, his brother is trans FTM. It might also be the emotional vulnerability thing, but he also mentioned giving a friend a blowjob once as a hiring mistake back in high school. Hes apparently only jacked off ever since, and as a guy whos fresh in college and also did some regrettable things with friends, the story lines up with me. After somethjng like that sexual fantasies are as far as you want to go and youre scared of feeling kike you owe someone something. So I told him to think on it, and Id be happy to be his friend, which isnt true, but Id be his friend rather than lose him completely. He updated me today and said he just wanted to be friends with no benefits, but Im pretty sure this Is just crashing into his own defense mechanisms. I really wanna date him because hes the first person Ive made a great conversation with! 5000 texts in under ten minutes! If it really doesnt work out, Im ready to hop back on Tinder, Grindr, Taimi, Bumble, etc, but I really like this cowboy dude and I feel like I shouldnt give up on him just because his repressed traumas wants to. Advice? Also Im pretty sure Im going to tell him how I feel because I think he might really like me still, whether hes conscious of it or not. If you want to give me advice on how to handle it go ahead! But Im really wondering, does he like me back? Please help!"

Today I was talking to my mom and she asked me if I've ever been in love. While I know I haven't, I didn't want to say it out loud  it feels sad and lonely to admit. I've never been in a relationship. I've casually dated a few guys for a month or two, but they always just seem to dwindle off or I find myself entirely uninterested so I sort of end it. I know guys like me, but I feel like the guys I like never like me back, and I never like the guys that like me. But my fear runs deeper than that. I'm sort of scared I don't have the capability to just love someone so much. I want to. So badly. I love my family and my friends more than anything and the thought of losing them absolutely wrecks me, but I've just never been that attached to someone romantically. I thought I was in love with one of my best guy friends earlier this year, I craved his touch and wanted to spend every waking moment with him. I almost told him how I felt (and vulnerability terrifies me), but then he got a girlfriend. I thought it would be hard for me, but I got over it extremely quickly, which makes me think I wasn't in love to begin with. Part of me thinks I just suppress my feelings and don't let myself get attached so I can't get hurt, but I don't really know why I would do that because I crave love. I create scenarios in my head about being in love and what that looks like. About showing someone my weaknesses and them loving me anyway. I watch my friends fall in love and get heartbroken by douches that hook up with them for a few weeks and then ghost them. I wonder why I can't bring myself to care when the same thing happens to me. I'm scared that it's never going to happen to me  that I'm never going to experience the helplessness that comes with falling so inevitably, deeply in love with somebody. I want the all-consuming passion. And I can't picture it ever happening to me."

I didnt like the vulnerability and i was almost scared of the intamacy, and im not sure if that could be part of the reason i have the issue i have.Fast forward to still current partner, and a few previous partners, they want to pleasure me till the point where i come, ( mainly female ejaculation) but i can not do that, and its always been an underlying issue. At fist it was just with my parter(s) but now its a problem for me. More TMI It's not that i dont come or I'm not coming at all, i do come, usually i dont think ever from sex. Oral, maybe usually, yes. Or when i want to touch myslef bc i know my bosy and make it happen, but still, still no female ejaculation Part of me feels like maybe yes, I'm just expecting whats in porn but i dont want all of that, just something, or anything ( related to f.e.) during sex. I would love to be able to do it with my current partner who i love and am comfortable with when I'm back home with him and for the holiday season and I feel like it would overall feel amazing etc etc but no matter how hard I've tried and research no female e :/ And tips, comments, or suggestions?"

I told her i was older (22) because i knew Id never have a shot with a girl like her. She was jaw dropping. It was one of those moments that it was love at first sight and thought Im gonna marry that girl one day. She came over the next day for super bowl Patriots vs Eagles and shes a huge eagles fan so we had fun watching the games and hung out every day since we met. We ended up wanting to go to the bar and i thought my game ID would work and it got rejected. I ended up telling her i was 20 and not my actual age which still pissed her off. We still hung out every day and ended up asking her to be my girlfriend on Valentines Day. The first 7 months were the best times of my life ever traveling adventures exploring and falling in love. My father was going through a nasty divorce with his wife of 12 years who was like my mom and the separation of them really broke my heart and put me into a deep depression and also the death of my grandmother from brain cancer and being kicked off my college football team put me into a deep depression. I started to not trust her or anyone started getting into heated arguments and fighting daily. I was always scared she was talking to someone else or cheating because my insecurities. We knew so much about eachother that we would attack eachothers weaknesses. She ended up moving back home out of state which was 3,000 miles away and knew it wouldnt last. I ended up in a psych for attempt of suicide from the break up with her to the death of my grandma the divorce and football and being kicked out. Her new Bf after we broke up got a restraining order on me because while in the hospital under heavy drugs i said i was going to kill him which made matters worse to wear i couldnt talk to her again. She would say nasty mean things to me and make me feel like shit about myself. 6 months later we come back into contact in June of 2019 and started dating again it was amazing again but i was in 110% and she was only in 50% it was really hard trying to make it work long distance and always felt like i was the only one trying. Shed get mad Bc i craved attention and affection for reassurance. I flew at there twice and she came and surprised me for one of my games since i came back to the team the next season and for my birthday. We got into another argument after she left seeing me back in October 2019. I decided to end it because i was not happy in the relationship. After we broke up i started dating around talking to other girls to fill the void but it was all just temporary. Went up north to visit family where she happened to have family as well and we were in the same state at the same time. We met up for a day talked and tried figuring things out. To make us work again because i truly do love this woman and i know she feels the same and wants to spend her life we me. She was upset with me that i didnt post her on social media and i need help replying to a message what do i say. So she can respect that i wanna take things slow not fight for more than a week and work back into trusting eachother and all the comes with being in a relationship So after we saw each other she had posted a video of us on her Snapchat story and had gotten upset with me that i didnt do the same and it really upset her. I tried explaining to her i dont wanna get hurt and build a foundation first but she isnt understanding where i come from. How do i reply back to her after these texts. Please help because i really do want to make this work with her. Her if thats the last piece of your heart i pray for you. because that shouldnt be how you place value on your heart. god forbid people see i make you happy. god forbid people know you were with the girl you supposedly love. nope. cant let them know because they would say shit. their words mean more. their views mean more. i shouldve never gotten my hopes up about this visit. or thought my feelings and heart or thoughts mattered to you. because i was considerate of yours. i listened and i even showed my world i didnt give a fuck what they thought. and you had hayden block me...thats not sketchy or anything... youre right im not sure this is going to work. im sorry but i cant handle the hiding after you mentioned marriage and you loving me so much and saying we have forever together. loving me should be enough of a reason to show people we are happy when were together. i cant go back to sleep because of this. and it makes me sick that i am second to anyone at the moment. i shouldve asked more questions i shouldve gotten proof that i was the only one. and if youre so terrified as to when youll see me again, how about you plan a trip where i come out there. where you can stop guessing and have an answer...make a plan where we can spend alone time together. and actually have the time to love me. because as i sit here crying and not being able to sleep, it seems like you just dont have the time to love me completely and fully and that is killing me. and thats all i fucking need is to me loved. the pain of being alone, you think only affects you. all i fucking want is to be fucking loved and cared for and told the god damn truth. why am i not enough to deserve that??? why am i not enough for you?? im fucking laying here and practically craving you. i wanted to connect with you again. i want to love you and have you in me and feel you and the passion we have. its killing me austin. how much more vulnerability do you want ?? Me Maddie... you know i love you with everything left in me. I wish you could open your eyes and see that my life right now is super stressful and its about to be the biggest change Ive had yet. Weve broken eachothers hearts more than enough we have hurt eachother more than enough. Im making sure this is something we both need and want. People around the world have seen how happy you make me. My family and my closest friends see how happy you make me. People that matter to me see how happy you make me. The only reason why i did not post you yet which Im going to do is because 1. If you or i leave or dont work out Ill be shamed at. 2. I wont hear the end of it from family or friends. 3. Our breakups and my past traumas w family are the reason why i am in therapy. What Im doing is protecting myself. I cant take any more heart breaks. I am so fragile right now Maddie. I feel like a scared deer whose lost its parents and left in the woods during hunting season. The fact that social media makes you think I dont love you is sickening what this world has come to. I know once we are set and have our feet down together wether its in a a few weeks month two or whatever or however long it takes that we will be good to go. I wanna go days and weeks without confrontation arguments or feeling attacked or put down and having you feel the same way about me. Your thoughts your feelings mean everything to me. I hate seeing you sad hurt and alone. Thats why i try giving you so much fucking love and so much time. My hopes are through the roof about this visit because i finally feel that youre in love with me again and you arent embarrassed of me. It makes me feel really confident. But you arent being hidden from the people that mean the most to me. Hayden and Rebeka both blocked you Bc it made them both very uncomfortable that you would watch their stories all the time. They both asked me to ask you to stop and i said do what you please and that Im not getting in the middle of it. I mention proposing getting engaged you being my fianc marrying you and being my wife and the father to my children because that all i ever wanted in life since i was born. Everyone knows the one person they will be with forever... thats you... and Ive told you that since day one and you still dont believe me. If you had wanted to elope yesterday i wouldve in a heart beat without hesitation. Im sorry you were up all night and couldnt sleep and felt sick and where crying thats not how i want you to feel. I will make more of an effort to give you even more attention affection and love if thats what you want. Ive just been used to our routine of you pushing away when i latch on. Of course after all these years Im finally getting it and now you want the attention and affection like cat and mouse which is so confusing to me. I promise Ill plan a month long week long weekend long or days long trip for you to come out here. You know thats what Ive always wanted is to spend time with you and love on you and adore you. You can get as much proof go through whatever you want when you get here. But lets plan you getting out here in February and get our life together and rolling by then. Ill give you all my time in the world you know i do that too. But Im on defense right now for the tome being to protect my heart. I need you to understand that. Its not forever its just for the time being. I cried my whole ride home yesterday and cried in my dads arms and in the hot tub Bc it hurt so bad saying goodbye to you. I wanted to love on you so much yesterday and was hanging on you. You know that when you said i was being annoying and too much just because i missed you so much missed your smell your touch your laugh your eyes kissing you everything. Youre more than enough in my life. Ive always felt since day one i was more in love with you more obsessed with you and all above. Still am. Still have your pictures the fair pictures everything all the letters. It breaks my heart the first voicemail you left me is gone and Ill never have it back and it shatters my heart because youve only ever left me just one voicemail. I wish i couldve held you all night and been intimate with you and made love with you to just hold you in my arms and be the closest weve ever been together and the most passionate sex with you. It killed me not even getting to have any really intimacy besides trying to kiss you in the car. Because who knows if Ill ever see you again or if youll ever see me again. You need to trust the processes and Know Im protecting myself and Im willing to take my walls back down again for you. Im not going to rush this or take it too slow. Im going to take it day by day and if you love me as much as you say you do youll be understanding and supportive and be by my side through the process together as i will be next to you. Her I understand youre protecting yourself but am i going to have to live with you not protecting me? a king always protects his queen. he stays strong for the both of them. ive told you id be by your side through the process but i want to be the only one. i dont need other girls being the comfort you need when youre lonely. i dont need to be spoken badly about by you or anyone else while going through this process. i want to feel that my heart is also being protected by you. you keep asking me to be understanding but i really dont think you yourself have been the most understanding either. Im trying to be hopeful, i really am. im trying to build you up again. im doing my absolute best here austin. but there are so many mixed signals in this whole situation that make it hard to trust that you actually want me and us to work out. you think its not confusing to me as well when you tell me you love me but yet cant let everyone know about it and see it. ive posted you for the world to see, i have told my family about you, i have opened up about my feelings and how i address them, i have given you the things i able to do at the moment that you need. I have been doing these things to prove that i love you and now that im doing them theyre not enough? you told me you wanted to see how much i showed i cared, yet somehow everyday im trying my best to show you and its not enough. What others say should not have value. It really says a lot when you allow other people to make comments and let it affect your decisions. If they cared that much, doing what makes you happy shouldnt be judged or criticized. Social media is the reality because it destroys people. it destroys relationships. And if you cant have the courage to post anything it shows that your more concerned about other peoples feelings more than mine. Sorry you dont want to lose the girls you flirted with and talk to by posting me again. Youve always mentioned how many people have unfollowed you because of me. My feelings about this are not being looked at fairly. Having H**** (name) block me makes me think youre hiding something or she is hiding something for you. Or you havent defended me and my reasoning. im sorry but i dont think you being friends with her is a good idea after what she expressed to you. If it made you feel that uncomfortable when she told you how she felt, that shouldve been a red flag and you shouldve gotten rid of it. Theres no reason for she or anyone else to feel uncomfortable. thats completely ridiculous and you should be defending me, not come at me a criticize my actions or telling them anything negative about me. and R**** (name) shouldnt even have contact with you. Mentioning a proposal or marriage is really fucking serious to me. it is not something anyone should be joking about or taken lightly. so when you say it so much it really starts to lose its value.eloping is and never will be an option. you of all people should know how valuable a marriage is and how serious it is when making sure its what is right. I am not willing to be another statistic or live out a life like your parents or mike. you sit there and youre telling me you want all of this. that im your person. that you want this forever but at the same time you cant even let anyone know how much you actually love me. are you living your life for yourself or for other people? because right now all i hear is l you caring about what OTHERS think. I am not begging for attention or affection. i simply want to be made known. i want to be present in your life. i want to be able to wake up in the morning and trust you arent fucking around or talking to others. Reassurance and love is what i need. Youre absolutely right that weve hurt each other many times but you act like me asking things of you to protect myself as well is so difficult and like its an attack. am i not worth enough to be given the reassurance to make sure we move on healthily? Ive been giving you all you need on my end and i would love for it to be reciprocated in the ways that i need to grow with you. I want to be enough to move forward. I am not your queen. I am not treated as if im a part of your life at all at the moment. Ive been more than understanding about every single thing in your life. Your trauma. your abuse. your depression. your doubts. your progress. Most other people would run for the hills if they knew the amount of work that needed to be done for a person like that. yet somehow i always end up back to you. I cannot move forward with someone who cannot move forward with me. I cant deal with the defensiveness all the time. it keeps everything at a stand still, no one is able to progress if youre so unwilling to. Why am i waiting until February to make a trip? I cant move forward having a life with you if we cannot have the time together to make that big decision. and saying youre never going to see me again is really depressing and so morbid. i dont want that idea to even be going through our minds. its sick. i want nights of loving you. not just one. i want to be there and feel every part of you around me and in me. i want to be one with you. i don't want to hold back anything. being passionate with you is what i need. i want to feel all the love we have in those moments Me I understand how you feel and respect it but its two people you and i. I really dont know how to reply to this its a lot can i please have some time to think about what i need to say and should say so its communicated correct Please help me reply in the best way possible i love this girl to death and wanna make it work How can i respond correct and let her know how i feel so she will respect it"

This is his first relationship and this is my second one, my first one lasted about a year and ended with him cheating on me, things ended about 7 months before I pursued my now boyfriend. We have been dating and I have no obvious complaints, red flags, and our personal goals are pretty lined up for long term commitment. He's a very simple guy, communication is straight forward, we don't make things romantic at school or in public, we will go a couple days without texting or seeing each other cause we both have our own lives and it's been working great. We both are very much practical and I have no worries he will cheat on me like my ex. The only problem is that I think I crave something more romantic and couple like as right now he feels far more like a fwb than a bf. We both are going to the same college next fall and each came to the decision completely independently, so there is no pressure on our relationship in anyway. But I don't want to start a completely new exciting part of my life with a relationship I'm not completely confident in. We both are very mature in how we make decisions and communicate honestly at all times. Only problem is, by knowing what I want, I fear coming off as the controlling girlfriend, which is not something I feel comfortable with at all. I want nothing more than to respect his growth as a person. Very soon I would like to talk with him about what it is he is looking for, because I want to feel more investment and vulnerability from both of us. I want to know if he sees us as more than a highschool convenience couple, that I'm someone he can depend on, and also provide support for. I'm not asking for a hand in marriage or anything, but I want to progress past ""go with the flow"" that we are at now. I haven't had much reason to be completely emotionally vulnerable with with him yet, but I will need either him or someone else in college to allow me to be. I know myself. I'm not here to directly ask for advice on this, more so to clarify my own thoughts into words, but I would love any insight, tips, or comments if you have them."

Sure, you can analyze all day, but the only way you'll really know is by asking, but the inherent vulnerability of doing that is pretty paralyzing especially if you get rejected or are scared of having to deal with it again. I know rejection isn't directly personal, but it feels like it anyways for some reason and I'd like to find a way to minimize that feeling. How do you get over this and come to terms with the fact that you don't know what's gonna happen?"

I met this guy 2 weeks ago and we had several dates. We hit it off. I thought it was just going to be flirty in the beginning and I made it clear to him that I didn't want a relationship and then I find myself wanting commitment which was pretty stupid of me. I told him I like him and he said he likes me too. I think I kind of fucked it up though by starting it the way we started it, which was extremely flirty. We hung out at a coffee shop on our first date and started holding hands there and being all couply. The second date he went to my house and he met some of my cousins, he kissed me that night. The third date, he took me to his cousins, and the fourth he brought me to his home where I got to meet his mom, had dinner with his family. I'm the first ever girl that he has ever brought home so that's something that I kind of hold on to,too. He's really great. We did have some kind of talk where he asked if I would want him to be his boyfriend someday. I said definitely someday because right now, we're both emotionally unavailable. He says things like ""I like you so much"" ""I miss you"" but my gut says he's just playing. I just feel like he's not as into me as I am into him, but it is also possible that I'm just overthinking. I also feel like he's avoiding vulnerability and that suckkkks. I want to ask him but it may be too early. He asked me if we were just friends and I said no,definitely not and he smiled at that. Lol like wtf &amp;#x200B; He also just was where I live for a couple weeks and moved back to where he's from for work so talking in person now is impossible dunno how to go about this. I have found myself so attached and I don't know anymore"

I'm in a college in Buttfuck, Nowhere, and I think I miss emotional intimacy with a man. I'm smart and pretty and so it's remarkably easy to get laid, but I kinda want a boyfriend: not the gross, cutesy, ""late capitalism"" part of a relationship, but just somebody I can feel close to emotionally and with whom I can consistently have sex. How do I do it? I'm too traditional and afraid of vulnerability to ask a man out to a meal, but even when I've straight up told a man that he's allowed to ask me out to a meal after our second hookup, he's just disappeared on me. Maybe I'm too aggressive. My girlfriends tell me that I'm too good for these fellas. How do I be the type of girl that men ask out? The last guy I hooked up with told me that I love the chase too much and that I don't seem like I want anyone around, anyway. I think I come off that way because I assume they want to leave, and I'd like for them to act interested in me... I'm tired of having to chase. Wow, now that I think about it, this sounds like a chicken and the egg situation..."

Lots of unanswered questions i dont know if im ready to hear the answer for. So i met this guy. He was probably the most charming person i have ever met. He made me laugh so hard and there was never a dull moment when im with him. Prior meeting him i was very guarded. I dont usually show to a lot of people my vulnerability, he made me feel so comfortable so ive let my guards down. Told him things ive never told to anyone, showed him a side of me i have never showed to anyone. 4 months into seeing each other he had to move overseas. He travels a lot for work and that has triggered the habit of me overthinking. Ive always asked are we still gonna be fine when he moves? He said yes and i dont have to worry and we started planning out how i will visit him in the country he's moving into. I tried to reject him a couple of times but he was so optimistic on what we have and so there, i gave it a shot thinking that there will be a slight chance of us working out. Its weird cause i had the a gut feeling that it wont work but the stupid side of me was hopeful. Then he moved and he changed. Started being cold,always grumpy, we were arguing a lot. Before he'd be so interested on how my day was. He was always eager to talk to me. And suddenly he just changed. Like i was talking to a different person. He always have this reason of being tired from work or whatever. He told me its the stress of being a ""travelling donut salesman"" (it's our inside joke of what his job is). Then we had a talk. And he said ""i like you but im not into this as you are"" and he also said ""i waited for days to kick in but nothing happened"". There. Thats his reason. One day he woke up and he realized that he doesn't like me anymore. Like how it is possible? Its weird, one day we cant get enough of each other. We talked everyday. Exchanged memes, talked to him whenever i have a bad day then came to a point of days not talking. Before he was the first person i talk to when im sad, now im sad and i cant talk to him anymore.  Now cause of that made me think, was everything he did and said was a lie? Was it all a lie? Maybe he was just caught up in the moment and said things that he really didn't mean. He knows what ive been through and yet he did the thing that i was so scared of. Im so hurt. I know ive only know him for a couple of months but still felt betrayed. Now im on self pity mode. Maybe i was not enough? the times we spent together was not enough? maybe i did not do enough? Should i have done more? Was it something that i said the turned him off? Was it because i have a temper? Am i not pretty enough? I know im gonna be fine. But now im not. Im hurting and he's not. Im not fine but he's ok. Sucks to be in this situation. I guess i will only be the girl he met while he was travelling for work. Thats it. Nothing more. Nothing less."

I have been single for about 6 months and recently installed tinder. I met a guy and we started talking and calling on the phone. We met up and he is absolutely amazing. He is sweet, cared about what I was feeling etc. After the date we went to his house we already knew we had some similar fantasies but eventually one thing led to another and I stayed the night. He woke me up the next day when leaving for work and I left with him. We said goodbye, kissed and that was that. We kept talking on the phone and everything was good, we were trying to plan another date. That's when after a rough shift (1st year of working as a nurse) I had a breakdown. I had a patient who is really who was going to die, and I did'nt know how to feel. I did my job as a nurse but then went home with all these feelings. Later that night we callled and for some reason of vulnerability I asked him what we were and if I should be worried about him seeing other people etc He got kinda freaked out and after a couple of minutes of rambling about stuff we decided to end the call. After that he still texted me the day after, and all was good. The day after we called him because he was'nt sure about a date on sunday, monday or tuesday and I wanted to ask if he had time for a drink. However he didn't respond. The next days I wouldn't hear from him i texted him but he never opened my messages. Yesterday I texted him again, a broader, more explanative type of text to his phone and not whatsapp. This time he replied but only hours later when I was already sleeping. It just said, ""want to call?"" We will be calling tonight and I am not sure what I should say, I feel very vulnerable and would not like losing him. What is something I could ask him, while not being to intrusive? Thanks for the help...."
105,vulnerability,dating_advice,My thoughts on my first date. What I have learned and still need to.,1,e06apc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/e06apc/my_thoughts_on_my_first_date_what_i_have_learned/,2019-11-23 06:54:24,"I am writing this to help myself coping with the sadness, void and regret I feel today, a week after the date. It is hard to really describe the date precisely because obviously there is body language and emotions missing but I try to describe it as complete as possible to you. First, I was excited to meet her on the Friday. Her boyfriend has broken up with her recently, so I didnt have much expectations. I just wanted to get out of my comfort zone, learn from my mistakes and get some experience with women. I was a little bit nervous in the few minutes before she came over. However, I began to relax and on our drive to the squash centre I relaxed more. I acted, I led and behaved like a man would do. I went to the reception in order to get our equipment. We started slowly, she was eager to take a picture with me. I hesitated but we did one because I dont like to pose on social media [ be more precise when she wants to post something like that on social media = like a story: tell her that I dont like to pose on social media because I subconsciously compare myself to others and thats bad for my mental health therefore I dont even have social media apps. That is something I should have done better.] We play for a while, have some casual talk in between, she initiates some physical contact like clapping when someone scored a nice point. The whole time I am aware of her signals, so I reciprocate them. I hit her on the ass with the bat when she said something offensive. She doesnt mind it, so it is safe for me to proceed with more sexual topics and physical interactions. Somehow, we stumble upon workouts. I explain what I am doing now, and casually pinpoint my huge glutes. I add some sexual element to the conversation, flirt a bit and she is receptive to my moves. [One thing I should have phrased better was when the topic of her ex-boyfriend came up. I should have shown more empathy towards her. As far as I can remember I told her something along the lines that I dont want to talk about, that I cant even give her a proper answer, that she must sort this herself out. She even asked me if it is okay if she tells me about it. Instead I should have gone with an answer like this: I appreciate it that you want to share problems with me, and that is very essential between two humans, to have someone to talk to, and I am glad to help. I am wondering how it came to that break up? Tell me a bit about it? And then after showing some empathy reply with, good that you are having some fun after the shitshow he did.] This goes on for the whole game. We finish, I plan to go back to my place in order to get something to eat. She agrees, we change clothes and drive home. After we arrived, we went to the grocery store and got something to eat. She forgot to get a coke, I had the idea in mind to test her attraction to me (in hindsight this probably wasnt necessary because she obviously showed huge interest in me). Nevertheless, I gave her a challenge she accepted. She had 30 secs to get her beverage or I would go home. Well I didnt wait more than 30 seconds and went home. [My intention behind this was that I wanted to show that I have my borders and clearly state that I dont wait longer than that because she said, as she agreed to the challenge, that I wouldnt go home = surprise I did. Now thinking back, the intention is good to display borders, however I think it was in the wrong situation. A better situation would have been something like calling her out for replying to someone or posting something on social media during our date. In case of the social media I should have said something along the lines of: Are you here to get known to me or do you just want to post something? It is not wrong to take a picture to have a memory of something, I myself take far too less pictures, so please lets just take one quick and move on with our date because at least for me thats the point of our meeting today. To get known to you more. We potentially have more chances to take pictures later.] I arrived at home and it took some time after she finally called me asking where I am. I answered a bit awkward, wont do that again, she told me not to lie [basically I acted like we havent met up today, dont know why I did that, but she didnt mind] Anyways I tell her to come up, she rings, and I greet her with: Is that the massage lady? We cook some food and talk a lot. I barely eat something because we connect that good. I check her values and believes out. We get along well. We are honest to each other, I confide some things to her, which signal vulnerability in order to build up trust. Shes honest herself, talks about some things she wouldnt tell someone else. I eventually steer to some sexual topics again and mention the butt massage she promised me earlier. I lay down on my bed she begins to massage me. I enjoy it, she does too. After a while she mentions that I have some love handles, I immediately jokingly physically confront her. [I should have escalated more there, like getting even more physical with her, locking her down and showing my dominance]. I went back to the massage. We switched and I began to work through her body. Now I need to mention that I have not much experience with women, even less getting this physical with one. It was my first massage and my first time with a woman in my bed. It was something so magical for me to have someone in my bed and feel another ones body. I lived in the moment, I focused on what I feel, what I see, my emotions and how this all came together. The thought of kissing her neck in this moment crossed my mind multiple times. It got replaced by thinking about her ex-boyfriend. This blocked the move I should have done, added by the fact that I didnt want to give her the kiss on the first date. I think a kiss would have been the right move here. Because we had that bonding established through our mutual values and ultimately with the massage. I just wanted to tease her with the kiss and make her more interested in me, leading to a second date. However, because I didnt, I lost that momentum with her. I finished the massage, made some more physical contact but didnt kiss her. I drove her home, she said that she enjoyed the evening and said that she wants to do it again some time. A few days later I called her, she didnt answer because she was busy. I wanted to check up on her, tell her that I want to meet her again later this week. The evening she wrote that she is working on the relationship with her ex-boyfriend. She is sorry that she sent the wrong signals towards me and shes willing for a friendship. It was damn crushing back then and still is. I question myself now, why wouldnt she just established her boundaries on the date night? Why didnt she tell me? She even went so far to reciprocate my advances the whole evening. And she was being honest with me (at least she told me so). I mean if I had behaved like a real man should have then I would have kissed her, and it would have led to some passionate sex. This could have changed her mind about her ex and really put the difference in perspective for her. Now, it is fucking frustrating to live with the thought of what could have been and that I was aware that I could have kissed her. How do you cope with that? I mean I realized many things I could have done better, even with this post. But it is so crushing to know that I could have done things better. It is also difficult to understand this whole situation at least from my perspective. Others may have some valuable input or experience I still lack. Thanks for any input. I really needed to get this off my chest and work through it with this post. I still have much to learn."

We laugh, we smile, we have good conversation, we kiss. It's great. But when we're not physically in the same place, she seems to have close to zero interest in me. Her work is busy before the holidays so we have only been on a handful of dates, and I don't fault her for that. I just wish she would be a little more affectionate in her communications, or just show any interest beyond the bare minimum, not leaving me to initiate every conversation. I don't want to beg for attention. I want her to want to talk to me sometimes. A few nights ago, I told her I like her and look forward to seeing her again more than anything. Her response? ""You are a really nice person and I enjoy talking with you."" That sounds like something I would say to my mail carrier. I feel like it's one step above ""I am aware that you exist."" I was a little hurt after that exchange, so I decided next time I'm going to let her text first. I won't beg for scraps anymore. It has been two days and nothing has come in. So I can't decide what her deal is. Is she emotionally available? Afraid to show vulnerability? Or should I just take her coldness at face value and realize that she would be trying harder if she had any real interest in me?"

Gotten better in the last few years by leaps and bounds as far as meeting new people and having conversations, small talk, etc. but I still struggle pretty heavily with confidence, putting myself out there, and making new connections that involve being vulnerable with someone new. I can banter and chat with random people and not have an anxiety overload like I used to, but actually connecting with people on a more than surface level is still a huge hurdle for me (although therapy is helping). Flash forward to now, I just moved to a new town and am bartending weekend nights. The other night a girl came in with some friends and had a few drinks at the bar. There was a bit of banter back and forth and some laughs, but Im pretty oblivious about signals of interest being sent my way, or I convince myself its not what I think it is and that theres no way theyre interested in me that way. It turns out this girl and her friends were friends with an old roommate of mine Id bumped into for the first time in years at my bar that same night, so when he came over to say bye and chat for a bit she noticed and asked how we new each other. I went to go do bar chores and saw her talking to him and him giving me a look that said they were definitely talking about me. After he left and I came back to her side of the bar she basically just said she wanted to be super blunt and asked me if I was seeing anyone. I said no and she left it hanging in the air so I asked if that was all she was curious about and essentially after saying she didnt want to be more forward than that I gave her my number and told her if she wanted to go out sometime she could text me but if not there was no pressure. We exchanged names and she left. This was last night and she just texted me today reminding me who it was and saying shed like to hangout. Weve gone back and forth a few times about wanting to hangout and trying to figure out a time. This is where things are at currently and honestly its been awhile since I was at this stage of a relationship with someone new that had clearly already expressed interest in me. I want to keep things casual and meet up for drinks or early appetizers or something to get to know each other better and see if we want the night to keep going or if we just arent vibing well off each other. My last serious girlfriend was in high school, a few casual flings in college but its been a long time since Ive been on a successful date where both people had clear understanding of being interested romantically in the other. I have no idea how to go about handling the amount of contact with this new girl before we go on our first date. If we cant meet for about a week a more schedule wise, once the date and time are set should I keep texting her? Should I just give it some space until the day of, then just text to confirm were still on for hanging out? I dont want her to think Im not interested by ignoring her after the dates set up but feel weird trying to get to know her over text when we havent hung out in person. She was really cute and seemed like a lot of fun, Im definitely interested in at least going out on a date and seeing if we both want things to progress from there. But its been so long since I was in this situation and Ive handled this same scenario wrong in the past. Just looking for some advice on I guess what proper etiquette is leading up to a date with someone new that youre interested in but have only met the one time. Im trying to leave a lot of the self doubt and fear of vulnerability with new people in the past, and I dont want to mess this opportunity up before I even have a chance to hangout with the girl by handling it wrong. Sorry for the novel and thanks in advance for any advice! TL;DR How should I handle communication in the time leading up to a date with a girl I met at work. Text before the date after its set up? Only text to iron out details and confirm? Pretty out of practice with this stuff"

I think there is. It might just be my friend group, but we are all scared of being ousted by a girl and her group of friends. There is a sense of reputation that a human needs in order to maintain social health, and pursuing a woman that will turn that against you to all her friends (both guy and girl friends) is a frightening thing. For example, I dated a girl 4 years ago when I was in highschool whom I really like and who was way over my league. Im a very traditional masculine man that likes sports, classic rock, old country music, and tend to hold on to gender roles (paying for dinner, driving when together, and choosing dates). I dont want to be this way but its the way I am. I am opened minded to relationships but I always lean towards traditionalist masculinity (minus the assault culture) I am still really respectful of women and their bodies. Anyways, the girl I was dating ended up resenting me and my strong willed nature (could not get me to kneel down and kiss the ground she walked on). She ousted my on her insta account and I didnt know it until some guy came up to me and said damn you got flamed on her instagram. That shit hurt. No one likes to get ousted socially. From then on, I havent dated anyone more than a date or two and feel like I tip toe around girls in fear of getting my reputation blasted. Say what you want about not caring what others think, your reputation is the only thing that advances you in this life unfortunately and I do believe a lot of men out there are scared to open up to women in fear of betrayal and social ousting. This could be unique to me and my social circle though..."

Like many of you out there, I was molested intermittently by my dad and grandmother. I've mostly worked through that stuff as most of it stopped by the time I was around eight or nine, and I saw my grandmother less and the stuff that happened with my dad seemed to be more and more unreal as I got older and our relationship settled into a pretty neutral -- if distant -- one (I lived mostly with my mom). I don't know if it was my mom threatening prosecution on abuse charges or what but he's a completely different person now that he's remarried and had another kid, etc, and we're cool. It almost feels like all of that never happened. Every now and then the reality comes back to me though as it did the last time I went to try losing my virginity and ended up shutting down, trying not to completely lose my shit as I dissociated and tried not to be too cold with the girl, and evasively watching Friends with her on her laptop for an hour before going home to bawl my eyes out. I consider myself a pretty tough -- if somewhat metrosexual (closeted bi) -- guy, so this was terribly out of character for me as I never cry/chow vulnerability (even when alone) as a rule. I'm honestly not trying to make this out as some tumblr-esque self-validating sob story; there are loads of people who have had to deal with far more trauma-related situations and who come from far less privileged backgrounds. I am just wondering what practical advice all of you have for a dude whose 20, has never more than pecked a girl on the lips/made out with a dude as a kid, acts really confident (only three friends know I'm a virgin, and are suspicious of my sexuality), and desperately wants to stop the cycle of girls/guys-who-got-away? I guess this post is both a dating and a sex question, but momentarily intimacy alone seems to be the primary hurdle. It's gotten a lot better since I've discovered I'm a descent flirt with drugs/alcohol to gas me up, but even then I doubt I can go much further. I've never talked to anyone about this (except who my mom, who thinks my attraction to dudes is just a product of molestation/confusion, and refuses to accept it) and never would have thought I would turn to reddit. I guess I'm more desperate for some sort of connection than I thought. Pretty f\*\*\*ing alone tbh. Thanks again if you read all that without cringing and moving on with your day."

I havent always handled this with dignity - Ive employed strategies like attention-seeking; nasty comments; begging; lowering my standards etc to try to change someones mind. But there have been a few times where I have had to end a connection. And I found that at those times, the men who accepted my decision with respect and kindness and maybe a little vulnerability, showed me the most attractive side of themselves right at the end. Right at the end I was able to think, what a shame I dont feel a spark for this person, because dont they conduct themselves well in the face of heartbreak and disappointment. Im grateful they are not making this hard decision too hard for me. So now when I am on the receiving end of a break up I keep this in mind. It wasnt enough to change my mind and nor will it change your exs mind when you do this but I always keep it in mind. During break ups we can see the best or worst side of people.

I met this girl (F26) on Tinder 5 weeks ago. We hit it off super well. She is a young mom and has had some really shitty relationships with assholes. She says of herself that she has daddy issues. I thought you know, let's just see what happens, because I can use more friends as well. We are both bi, but she's only ever had one experience with a woman before. I've been in a long term relationship with one. Our first date was a bit awkward, but really great. There was this instant connection and vulnerability there. We took it slow for a few dates. We kiss, hug, but I want to give her time and not pressure her into anything she isn't comfortable with. Then when I really didn't expect anything to happen (when I just visited her after work for a short time) she makes a move and we end up pretty naked, but she isn't very comfortable with me touching her. I am respectful of that. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable. The next dates are a bit less touchy. She kisses me less and stuff. I write her about it at some point and she tells me that she really doesn't know how she is feeling. She isn't ready for a relationship and I think it also freaks her out a bit that I am a woman. She wants to be friends. I am naive and say yeah sure, I want to keep you in my life. I am already head over heels. So we see each other again twice. First time was okay, I kept my distance, played with her baby a bit. We just chatted comfortably. Second time we get high (weed) together (baby is at her fathers), we listen to music, stare into each others eyes really deeply. She calls me babe. Sends me hearts and stuff online. To say the least I am getting very mixed signals. I try to talk to her about it. She tells me that her feelings for me are ""weird"". She really cares about me but we should probably not see each other for a while. Okay, I can respect that, while also being heartbroken. I am trying not to write her, even though I really want to over-process this shit. I am not the type to pursue anyone when I am not wanted, but she makes me feel very wanted. When I am with her it's amazing. I just feel like we aren't communicating well and that she is scared. I can't make her less scared really and maybe she just needs time, but I am just really worried that if I give her all of the time that she will just dump me out of her life. I know that I am not being my 100% rational self, because I am very much in love and hormones are real. What should I do wise people of r/dating_advice?"
116,vulnerability,dating_advice,Some pointers to get over a breakup/rejection,14,dnasbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/dnasbj/some_pointers_to_get_over_a_breakuprejection/,2019-10-26 18:44:54,"I posted this as a reply but thought I'd share it as a post too... (hope this fits here, otherwise I'll remove it) I'm going through the worst breakup I could've ever imagined right now and I just thought I'd share some things that help me get through it at the moment... And I think this all also fits if you get rejected. Doesn't really matter how long a relationship lasted or if you only dated that person and had high expectations. The most important thing I can advise you is: don't try to run away from it. Face your feelings. Don't push them away, it'll make it so much worse if you do. Surround yourself with friends. If you don't have friends to surround yourself with go to your family, if you have a bad relationship with them, try different things to connect with new people (in platonic ways), even if it's just through reddit. If you like to be alone that's also OK of course. Don't try to use rebounds to get over it, don't go and use OLD or whatever to get validation, that's not what you need right now. They say you should get under someone new to get over someone, that's bullshit. It'll just be a distraction and 9 out of 10 times make you feel like shit because you're just trying to fill that void someone else left with someone random. If it gets too heavy and you do need to distract yourself for awhile from all of it do it in a healthy way - get lost in your hobbies or find new ones if you don't have any. Netflix/tv is your best friend if you need to take your mind off of things and need some alone time without getting too lost in your thoughts. It's a good distraction. Listen to sad music that helps express your feelings, don't overdo it though, it can be productive but also trigger you to get deeper into that hole. Don't force yourself to act happy (except to keep your job or something), just let it all out wherever it's appropriate. If you've got the money maybe take a weekend trip to get away from everything. If you don't maybe try just taking long walks and just let your feet take you to new places. Don't go to places that remind you of your ex. I used to go to cafes, bars whatever, that held some meaning to me and my ex to wallow in self pity (I know, sad) and memories... Boy I thought it would help but it made it so much worse! Act as if those places contract some sort of deadly disease and just don't go there anymore until you've healed and moved on! And the most important thing: *go no contact!* Honestly, remove them from your social media! Cut them out of your life as thoroughly as possibly, at least for a while! Don't reach out to them... It just makes it harder to heal. Imagine a breakup like a big gaping wound. And everytime you contact your ex again (or stalk them on social media...) you basically rip that wound that just began forming a scab and starting to become a scar open again. Let it heal, don't touch it. And yes, time will help and heal your wounds blah blah... But only to a degree... You can't just wish this all away. If it's really bad look into therapy. The loss of a relationship can really break someone. I've seen people throw their lives away because they couldn't handle it and wouldn't face what they lost. They acted tough and weren't able to acknowledge how much it hurt them. Remember that it's OK. Every breakup hits different and every person has a different degree of vulnerability. If you can't handle it on your own look into getting therapy. It's OK if you can't do this on your own. I hope this helps a bit."

She said that she thought if I was really interested, I would come up and talk to her. But I did try to approach her and ask her to some lighthearted things, just to be chill and get to know her. It would just always turn out that she was busy and wouldn't be available. So now she flat out asked if I was interested in her and I paused for a moment. I didn't know if I should lie and say I wasn't to save myself some embarrassment or just take it on the forehead and tell the truth. I mean, if I tell the truth, that puts me in a lower position of vulnerability. But, against what might be my better judgement, I told the truth and just talked to her. She said she didn't know those earlier attempts were me try to get to know her better, so she felt really oblivious to how I felt. We had a long talk about what's been going on and she told me how she valued my friendship and thought of me as a brother. I chuckled when she said that because it was funny, this is the first time someone has said that to me. She felt a bit bad saying that, but I told her it was cool, I'm not close with a lot of people so it was cool of someone to say that about me. I assured her that I was cool with being friends with her and that there was no bad blood. I respected that she worked herself up to talk to me about this, because goodness knows I was okay with just letting these feelings just die out. Everything is, possibly to my detriment or not, out in the open and we left the conversation on good terms. \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now to talk about how I really feel on the inside. I really am cool with being friends with her. I don't hold any negative feelings towards her, but I do internalize some towards myself. Like, I do feel like a loser because I'm bashful, reserved, and overall not that guy that you would think of someone being interested in. I kinda hate the way I am because just like this situation, all I can be right now is a brother to someone, but not an interest. Being a brother is not bad, but I understandably had the spear pierce through my chest for a second on that one. But I put on a smile, I laughed. I made her laugh and she appreciated that I didn't make things awkward. I bit the bullet and tried to be better. I think I succeeded, now I just need to pick up the pieces and figure out what to do or become next. Cause goodness knows who I am right now, this ain't it. TL;DR A friend rejected me and told me she thought of me as a brother. I handled it in the best way I learned and now need to figure out how to get better."

We worked really well together, similar ambition, intellectual capacity to challenge each other, comfort, intimacy, friendship and he treated me with such care. By the end, we were both in love. And even spoke about getting married and with our ambition, creating our own world together. We had a similar vision of the future and so much we wanted to achieve. We decided to do long distance (different countries), but plan to meet up at least once every 2-3 months. He and I were to determined to make it last no matter how difficult it was. He said he could never ever lose me and wanted create a future together. I could sense that his feelings were genuine. Not just through his words, but his actions, and his eyes. And I loved him back. I could feel my heart literally burning, it felt like I found the person I belong with. Even if our time together only lasted about 4 months (short, I know). When we moved back to our respective countries, things were going fine for the first week or two until his phone crashed. He was offline whatsapp for about 4 days. But didn't bother to contact me on messenger and didn't reply to any other medium either. In 4 days, he is online again and tells me that he wants to break up. He said that he now only has focus on achieving his goals and no room for anything else. He also said that putting in the time and effort to continuously maintain that bond and trust and vulnerability is too emotionally exhausting for him. He probably realized that he is back in reality and that we were just playing house. He needs to focus on his goals and nothing else. There was no space for me in the world he wanted to create. So, he told me he did not love me anymore. In my mind, that means he committed to erasing me from his heart and chose to do what is best for him regardless of the pain it would cause either of us. It's been about 4 days since this happened. But, I love him. I love him I love him and I want to text him despite my final goodbye when he broke up with me and told me he no longer has feelings. I know that I should let it go, as it was the decision he made. And self respect for me. But, I love him. I want to text him I love you. Should I not? Should I? He is trying so hard to push my out of his world, he has that resolve seeing how straight forward he told me that he no longer loves me.... should I not? Also, has anyone had a similar experience?

Work got busy (and my feelings freaked me out) and I ended up ignoring his text for three days before asking him if I could call him when things calmed down at work, which ended up being about a week later. He seemed a bit annoyed but agreed. By then, Id had time to process everything he had told me, and my feelings had actually grown. Yes, we only met in person twice, but the emotional vulnerability we showed each other created an attachment. After a week of silence, I initiated a conversation over text, but he never responded. Another week has passed by now. Should I try reaching out again, or is this permanent damage? I thought the connection we had was real and rare and would like to pursue things further with him. Some other hypotheses I have: -He dared to open up to me and was hurt when I pulled away. -Hes turned off by my busy, unpredictable work schedule. -Hes not looking for anything serious, but our dynamic ended up being just that. TL;DR: Should I double text, or has the ship sailed? Would doing so make me seem desperate?"

I've had terrible luck with men over the past few years and suddenly I have this amazing date with an incredible man who is attractive, intelligent and just wonderful. Half way through the date he stopped to tell me he thought I was amazing and interesting and beautiful etc. He did it was such directness I was actually impressed as normally I date unsure/insecure non-committal types. Anyway, I leave the date glowing but then the messages start. ""This is the happiest I've felt in a long time"" I thank him for a lovely day. We start chatting. He's quick to talk about how he wants a family so hes bought a house with lots of rooms even though he has met anyone, his sexual preferences (he seems quite in to bdsm and I'm not (which I was direct with) and then started saying things like ""I'd love to write a chapter of life with you"" and how ""I blew him away and he can't believe the connection we have"" and how he admires how strong I am through both my vulnerability and strength and he wants to grow with me to share this. I don't know. He seemed totally normal on the date but this is really coming from no where. I'm a bit surprised. Should I be worried at this level of intensity after a first date?

125,vulnerability,dating_advice,Advice/Ramble about what I've Learned in the last few months,1,d4ue3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/d4ue3c/adviceramble_about_what_ive_learned_in_the_last/,2019-09-16 12:20:20,"Alright, so I gave up dating a few months ago after a girl broke my heart. I'm at the point where I think I'm ready to start dating. In the meantime, I've made a ton of friends who build me up, tell me what's on their minds, and give me solid advice. Today, I'm going to share some of what I've learned. A bit of backstory: since I was 19, girls have hit on me a lot, I go on more dates than most guys I know, and they rarely turn out well. Still a virgin, but to date, 3 girls have stripped for me and tried to take my pants off, and I have refused. I'm going to try to get better at choosing women to date I have learned 2 very important things: confidence and gentle masculinity make girls want to be around you. Some of those girls are bound to be interested in you. I'll explain gentle masculinity first. I've known for awhile that I can be very intense with, well, everything. Just force of habit, and it can turn more introverted people off. But what I learned recently is that masculinity isn't being built, or bring into cars or working with your hsnds. It's projecting power and strength. Moving as precisely, with as much intensity as I do, projects power. Therefore, despite wearing pink all the damn time, telling people my feelings, poledancing as a hobby, I'm a really masculine dude. Now, and this is important: I have a gentle masculinity. I don't seek to control or dominate anyone, I'm not spoiling for a fight, I'm not wanting or seeking sex from girls, I have a very friendly and open disposition. This, and the masculinity, is why girls want to be around me. I am into feminine women, and feminine women appreciate the contrasting energy I provide without the downsides of it. Some of those women are into me and want more than a friendship. Confidence is the other. I'm not a built dude. I don't have abs, I don't have a phat bank account, etc. However, I also don't have a bruisable ego, and I show both vulnerability and strength. That's a huge part of confidence, why I have a ton of friends, and why no one gives me shit. When you can tell anyone anything about yourself and make it quite clear they wield no power over you in a friendly or non-aggressive way, you've done it. You're free to be whoever you are. *** And what girls really like is a dude who is himself, completely. Not the self he thinks they like, but himself. I've dated and been friends with unconfident people, and they're really boring. They don't let themselves shine, they're too scared to be interesting, I can't trust that they don't have issues with me and won't tell me, etc. If you can project power despite your physical nature, show that you don't want to dominate people, and show that people have no power over you, girls will start hitting on you. Now you just have to pick good ones, and that's where I fail ***Does not necessarily apply to people dealing with systemic oppression. I'm a straight white cis dude, I have no idea what life is like for you people."
126,vulnerability,dating_advice,I'm convinced I'm falling in love with a friend and I desperately need some advice.,1,d4v9wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/d4v9wb/im_convinced_im_falling_in_love_with_a_friend_and/,2019-09-16 13:43:03,"I (24/F) have known this guy (25/M) for a year and a half now. We've always gotten along really well but in the past month and half we've become absolutely inseparable. We text back and forth, send memes on Instagram all day long, and meet up the second we're both free for the evening up until the wee hours of the morning. In the past month we've spent basically every single day together - for hours and hours at once. We've met each other's friends and family, have made tons of creative project plans together, and never seem to get sick of one another. I'll meet him at 5pm and we won't separate until 5am. Most of the time, we get into really personal conversations late at night. We've shared a lot with each other and seem to have a deep mutual understanding between us. I grew suspicious that I might be starting to have feelings for him and started looking for signs. He quadruple texts me, he makes flirty comments, he tells me how important our relationship is, he touches me (casually) a lot, we spend an absurd amount of time together, he remembers tiny details I mention in conversation, and he really values my judgment and recommendations. I decided that I needed to tell him that I was into him. He responded kindly by saying, among some other sappy shit, ""I really enjoy our friendship and that's where my feelings lie"" Honestly, I was kind of confused. At this point, I felt pretty fucking SURE that we must feel the same way. I mean, he spent way more time obsessing over me, initiating conversations, hosting hangouts, and sitting close to me than I ever did. I hung out with him later that night and we acted like nothing happened. There was so much electricity between us. He was even touching me more than normal. I went home feeling even more confused than before. I wasn't satisfied with our conversation so I started another one. This time instead of just saying ""I think I might be into you"" I said ""We have so much fun together. I was surprised when you said you wanted to just be friends. I could've sworn we had a vibe between us. If you don't feel that, please refrain from touching me so much."" He came back with ""I may be wrong. We/I may be missing out on something magic. The only way we'd know is by trying it out. However, I'm already trying that out with someone else. And I like what I'm trying out. My upbringing and morals won't allow me to change that because another opportunity arose. I love spending time with you and we do have a vibe. It's a vibe of understanding and vulnerability; of nakedness and authenticity; of natural purity and rawness; a lack of filters and personas. Just showing each other who we are, bit by bit. I think that's part of the magic of our relationship, that we're able to do that together. I respect you and I care for you. Seeing you every day is a blast. I take responsibility for the touching, I should've apologized for it earlier"" This was the FIRST TIME i had EVER heard of him being involved with someone else. I asked, ""To clarify - we both feel a teeny tiny bit of romantic feelings for each other and can recognize there could be a spark there if we were to pursue it - but we're going to consciously decide to ignore it?"" And he said ""Given my current life circumstances, yes."" I've tried my best to laugh it off and get over it. But I just KNOW there's something special there. and I know he knows it too. I don't understand why or how he expects me to spend all of this extremely intimate time together, constantly, and not feel anything. I've asked him for more details about the person he's seeing. He'll barely describe her. He claims that keeping his romantic life completelyyyyyy separate from his friends, family, and personal life is his way of doing things. She lives in another city, they rarely see each other. He couldn't tell me any hobbies or personality traits they have in common, and I know for a fact that she doesn't interact with him between the hours of 5pm and 5am on a daily basis. However, I'm sure she's wonderful.. In one final conversation about it, I told him that I thought he was wrong. I even said "" I firmly believe that one day you'll have a realization that I was right this whole time and when you do, I'm going to be SO sassy to you about it."" and he laughed and said ""DUH!"" Despite this extremely honest and easy conversation we had, I told him I needed a bit of space. I even tried to leave pretty early at one point, but he convinced me to stay longer. Knowing we weren't going to be interacting as much for a little bit, we stayed up all night long together and had a super fun time. I didn't talk to him at all today and I hated it. I spent a lot of the day replaying our conversations in my head and thinking about our past month of INTENSE friendship. Everything happened so fast. But it just felt so mutual and so magic. What am I not seeing here? I dont think I can be as close as we are now as just friends. In fact, if I'd known he had a significant other all this time I don't think we would've ever gotten this close. I don't want to let go of our magic connection - but I can't make my feelings go away. It feels like it's all or nothing. Help!"

A lot has happened over the last few weeks but am gonna try and make it short. Met this guy over an app. Talked to each for a month before we met each other. He was struggling thru his break up from his almost relationship at this time and I became somewhat his confidant. When we mer for the first time it was like meeting a friend I havent seen for a long time. It was easy and fun and this is what I liked about him. No pressure or anything. I can just be myself and enjoy his company . and I knew I like him though more than a friend. A week after we met again and he slept over at my place nothing happened. Told me he sees me as a friend and told him I dont feel that way and its better to move on forward now than make things complicated. Hes somewhat emotional, he cried durinf this time i dont know why and his vulnerability made me even like him more. The next day though (maybe he thougjt about it) said he wanted to give it a try - meaning dating each other to which I agreed. the dynamic changed. The texts had been more intimate and sweet. We lived quite far away from each other so when I visited him at this time, I slept over, and sex happened. Im not the type of person to sleep with someone unless i know them pretty well but I really liked him. After two days of spending time with him, he said he thought everything is happening a bit fast, we both got emotional again, asked hom whether it was his ex making him feel this way etc. He said he still has uncertainties and hesitations but we decided to give this thing a try and see how it goes. Fast forward to 2 days ago, I visited him again (he was too busy with uni) helped him move his stuff, hes been really sweet, i met his friends and colleagues, everything was going well until we headed to bed - he asked whether what hes gonna say is based on how fast things were happening- he said he enjoys spending time with me and hes happy when hes with me but when Im not around- he doesnt exactly long for me. ( Guys we texted everyday day to night. He always texted me first, update about his day and etc) so this came as a bit of surprise. And I stopped him there. I was hurt and saddened by this. So I told him its his feeling this way, better to end it. I was angry and disappointed in my self at this point. I know I couldve heard him out and talked bout it clearly but i couldnt. Thne he cried again. Fucks sake. But i let him. I didnt comfort him. I was too tired. He asked if i was gonna cut him off. I said did he expect me to stay after that? I left that mornign. We had a long conversation thru text after that. He said his feelings is not growing as of the moment. I asked if he wanted to give it a second chance, he said he couldnt go through snother emotional roller coaster ride (yes he is that emotional) He cna be confusing with his words ans actions. We both couldve handle it better I dont know how to deal with this. at one point he said he lost a friend and I lost a potential partner. tbh i didnt have the chance to explore that topic with. too much has been said Please give me your honest opinions. I dont have much dating experience. I want to work this out but i dont know how given he said its not workinf out for him :("

Can't be too specific but since he's not following this subreddit and I don't expect it to reach the front page I'll be truthful regarding the important stuff but some of the details might not be entirely true. So I met my now bf about a year ago when we both started working at the same company. I left before the summer and I kind of knew he liked me since I would sometimes catch him looking at me during meetings. He offered to grab some coffee with me after work and over the year nothing much came of it. I was really trying to do my job well so I was constantly working on that and I also fell head over heels into a relationship with someone else which luckily ended after about 2 months. When I didn't make the date happen he moved along while still being friendly at work and stuff so I just kind of forgot about it. I switched jobs before the summer and we kind of lost touch but a former (and his current) colleague invited us both to a party he was organising. We got to talking and I casually asked him out because I was single and had a really nice time talking to him again, he agreed. We had a great first date which ended with a kiss which gives me butterflies just thinking about it again. We were sitting on a bench at a park in our city and since it was about 10c I was just burying myself in his side (he's really tall and I'm relatively short). We were just talking while he held me close after about i guess 20 minutes he pulled my chin up looked deep into my eyes for about 5 seconds which felt like an eternity and really built that feeling of expectation and addrenaline, then he gave me the most passionate kiss I've ever had. Fast forward about two weeks later and we've spend 2 whole weekends with each other and I want to move the physicality a bit further and he confesses that he's very insecure about it and that he wants to take it slow. I was a bit stumped because I just thought that he was respecting my pace and didn't pressure anything for my sake. I let it go and later that night were talking and I out of the blue wanted to know how old he was when he had his first kiss. He then unloads this bomb on me. He says 32... he's very sarcastic so i say yeah right... and he looks at me with this look that was half a look of shame and the other half was pure vulnerability. He says that I was the first girl he ever kissed and that he hasn't done anything with a girl ever. I'm sure he wasn't lying. While I think he's really attractive now I will admit that at first I didn't think he was attractive, he's overweight, and I genrally don't go for guys who are overweight and to be brutally honest very few of my friends would go for overweight guys. But over the year working with him I kind of got to know him and I slowly saw some great qualities in him. He's one of those guys that has these brilliant ad libs at times which really cracked everyone up at the meetings. Anyway... as you can see I'm in love with this hunk of a man. So he unloaded this on me and I'm really confused because he has such confidence and he seems like a rock with everything. He didn't seem desperate or weird in any way throughout the year I've known him and when we stated dating he was really good with the kissing (which was all we did really and he put his hand on my butt once) it was always tender and he would only go further if I did it first. So he tells me he was learning from me and that he's kind of ashamed that he never did anything with anyone. He says it just never happened and thinks it's because he's ""fat"". I can somewhat get that... but he's really funny, and I don't mean stupid funny I mean clever funny, and he's really intelligent as well. It would be intimidating if it wasn't for the fact that he always breaks tension with a well timed (self-deprecating) joke. So the advice im looking for is how to approach this. How should I proceed without making him feel unequal or like I'm teaching him stuff and making him feel more insecure about this. What can I do to make him feel confident? Should I just let him lead and if I want him to be more physical make him touch me or something? I also notice that when I push to far he pulls back and this is just totally new to me. Most guys I've dated go 100% right at the start and I need to slow them down and now it feels like the roles are reversed."

I am completely ruled by my fear and anxiety. Im a 22 year old woman, have had only one drunken sloppy kiss ( was 19) but have never dated, and never had any sexual experience. The thought of being so inexperienced with somebody fills me with so much shame and embarrassment that I completely self sabotage and tear down any chance of being with anyone. But now time is passing me by and my walls are up so high Im terrified Ill never be with anyone. Im so scared Ill let my fear of being embarrassed and vulnerable ruin my life. Ive turned down anyone whos ever been interested in me as I just cant face being in a position where I have to let them know how inexperienced I am. How can I kiss them when I dont know how? And now Im getting older the more embarrassing that gets, I cant imagine ever being brave enough. I dont want to be with just anyone. I do have issues with sex. I know I need to feel safe and comfortable. I have a huge crush on this boy from my university, I have for years, he makes my head swirl. Hes a few years older than me. I cant imagine not being in his life. Sometimes I think he likes me too, but Im so full of mixed signals and closed doors Im scared Ive ruined any chance. However how can I be open, when Im far too afraid of what happens on the other side? But Im also far too afraid of letting this ruin me? But Im also far too afraid of not being in his future. Basically my fear of embarrassment, of vulnerability and change is caging me. Can anyone relate? Does anyone have advice? I cant actually say this out loud as I find it far too humiliating. I sometime joke with my friends about my lack of experience but would never admit how afraid I am of it, and of losing it. But you know the weird thing? I am so confident in pretty much every other aspect of life! My friends probably would never know how afraid I am inside. Most (if not all) just think Im just independent and strong (which I am) and dont really want a man (but I do :( ). Help! Lol, please Thanks!"
130,vulnerability,dating_advice,Thoughts on casual LDR?,0,d8u7yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/d8u7yi/thoughts_on_casual_ldr/,2019-09-25 08:03:56,"Just some context: So I have this officemate who Ive been dating since June. We work in completely different departments so no worries on mixing work and personal stuff. Hes currently on a paid study leave and will be back home in March next year. We met last June when he was here to work on some stuff for his career and ever since then weve gotten so close anyone would think were a couple. We also always Skyped and talked. There was even a time he told me he was already having intense feelings for me. It was also early on when we established we were exclusive (as in not dating others) but some stuff along the way had me reassess our relationship at various points (and these had him cry as we were Skyping as he really wanted to make things work between us). To be specific, these were the times I was doubting that he really did break up with his ex of 10 years. It was later on that I confirmed myself through official sources that they indeed have broken up. Anyway, we got back again but we never really talked about how we should proceed, just that we back into the rhythym of things. At that point, I wasnt sure if we were still exclusive though. Anyway, he came back this September and weve spent a lot of time since then. I discovered however (through his phone) that he has been chatting up this one girl who also works in our office at a different department. While they seem to mutually like each other with the girl even calling him babe, it seems they dont have the same dynamics we do. For instance, their frequency of texts and depth of intimacy and vulnerability, including how often they meet up and how often he initiates the convo. I didnt approach him about this though but then soon after he asked me if it was okay that we took things casual. While I was internally alarmed about this, I just stayed calm. He told me that our relationship had been rocky and it doesnt help that were not physically together (although this is just two hours apart in terms of time zone). I then told him I knew about him and the girl and asked him how they met and how they are. He didnt deny there were romantic undertones. He also told me the girl had a crush on him and that she also wanted to get advice from him as she would like to pursue the same postgraduate studies. She approached him this January because of it and since then theyve been talking. Mostly about school. Just wasnt able to ask though if he was still talking to the girl during the time we were exclusive or perhaps they were (just that we have different notions of what it means to cheat). I decided I wanted something else though. I wanted to be serious, even if it just means being exclusive (no BF/GF title yet). I also told him I wanted to hear him play the drums and meet his friends, which he did make happen. He invited me to this gig they have, which also happened to serve as a get-together of his college and close friends. Even met his boss there (a mutual friend) plus the girl hes dating. Some of his friends even added me on Facebook. While I wasnt introduced as the person hes dating, his friends seemed like they know and he didnt deny that we were when they asked. He also did plenty of stuff like drive me around as I did errands while I was here. Now while everything seems okay now and he agreed to us being exclusive, Im still not sure whether hes really okay with that. If you were in my shoes, what would you do? Immediate thoughts on my part would be to just enjoy the ride, invest but keep a safe distance."

Think about it: its like online shopping for sex. You browse profiles, find someone you like and start a conversation. With any luck they will like you back and you can look forward to a new life of love, romance and passionate lovemaking.** **In reality, its like that game at the fun fair where you have to shoot a row of ducks but nobody ever seems to be able to hit the target. Fixed or not, its frustrating, and unless youre a crack Marine Corps sniper, you will often go home empty handed. Online dating is a pain in the ass. As a veteran of over 60 internet dates and nearly 10 years of negotiating my way through the many, many websites out there, I know firsthand how arduous and frustrating it can be. Ive made countless errors, put up stupid pictures, sent even stupider messages and had sure things vanish into thin air.** **Its this experience, however, that has enabled me to figure out what the hell I am doing, and I wish to share some of my tips and tricks with you. The following tips are for both men and women and they will hopefully spare you some of the failures that I went through.** **So I began a month-long experiment, analysing the profiles of popular online daters and their behaviour on dating sites. What I discovered surprised me, to say the least. It also led me to my husband. Here are my top 10 tips for online dating based on my experience.** # Make a wishlist Develop a strategy before you begin. What, exactly, are you looking for? Create a shopping list and be as specific as possible. Rather than saying someone who wants kids, get granular. Say that you want someone who wants two kids, about three years apart and is willing to go through fertility treatments with you should pregnancy become a problem. Part of making your list is defining what you want. # Keep score Once youve thought of all the traits you want in a mate, prioritise them. Think about the characteristics in the context of previous relationships, your friends and your family. Develop a scoring system. Allocate points to your top 10, and fewer points to a second set of 1015 characteristics. Decide the lowest number of points youll accept in order to go out on a date with someone. This is basically developing a handcrafted algorithm, just for yourself. [Get online](URL Pick a few websites to use. [Match.com](URL is a more general environment with a lot of options. People who use Tinder tend not to be looking for long-term relationships. Its OK to use two or three sites at a time. Bear in mind that youll want most of the features activated, and that some sites can be expensive. #### Go shopping **For the most part, dating sites arent doing anything particularly mysterious. Sites mostly create taxonomies and match users based on their answers. In some cases, sites look at the gap between users answers and their behaviours. For example, you might say that you prefer a very tall man with dark hair who is religious, but mainly click on profiles for shorter atheists. The algorithm in that case would try to match you according to your behaviour. But maybe youre clicking on all of the profiles, even those that dont match your preferences, or sitting next to your sister, and shes also looking for a boyfriend  one whos short and blond. In that case, the algorithm wont work either. Its best to treat dating sites as giant databases for you to explore.** #### Keep your profile short **Long profiles typically didnt fare well in my experiment. I think that for thoughtful women, or women who are quite smart, theres a tendency to give more of a bio. Popular profiles were shorter and intriguing.** #### Create a curiosity gap **Ever wondered why Upworthy and Buzzfeed are so popular? Its because theyre masters of the curiosity gap. They offer just enough information to pique interest, which is exactly what youd do when meeting someone in person for the first time. This doesnt mean your profile should start out with 9 Out of 10 Londoners Are Completely Wrong About This Mind-Blowing Fact or Youll Never Believe Who This Banker from North Yorkshire Wants to Date  But it does mean describing yourself in about 97 fascinating words.** #### Dont try to be funny **Most people arent funny  at all  in print. What you say to your friends at the pub after a few pints may get a lot of laughs, but that doesnt necessarily mean itll translate on a dating site. The same goes for sarcasm. Often, people who think they sound clever instead come off as angry or mean. Heres a good tip: after youve written your profile, read it aloud to yourself.** #### Be selective **Its good to give examples of your likes and dislikes, but bear in mind that you may inadvertently discourage someone by getting too specific about things that arent ultimately that important. I love Curb Your Enthusiasm. As it turns out, my husband particularly dislikes that show. If Id have gone on and on about Larry David in my profile I wonder if hed have responded.** #### Use optimistic language **In my experiment, I found that certain words (fun, happy) made profiles more popular. Talk about what excites you, or paint a picture of a really great day that you would want to be a part of. Would you date you?** #### Market yourself **Dont just reuse old photos or copy your profile from dating site to dating site. There are a lot of parallels between online dating and marketing: you must know exactly who your audience is, who you want to attract and whats most likely to hook them.** #### Its all about your main profile picture **Many online dating articles and products will try to convince you that what you write for your first message is the most important skill you will ever learn. This is true to a certain extent. For sure, what you write in your opening message and in your profile will dictate a lot of your success with online dating, but the single biggest factor is how someone responds to your profile picture.** **It is the first thing they will ever see!** **While your opening messages content will determine if someone clicks through to your profile, its that little thumbnail image that will determine if they open the message at all. This isnt a universal rule but take women as an example**********the more messages a woman receives each day, the pickier she is going to be. Have you ever deleted an opening message based solely on the thumbnail image? I think everyone has at some point, and imagine how often you would do this if you received 20-50 a day instead of 1 or 2 a week.** **Most attractive women dont even open all of their messages simply because they cant be bothered to sift through them all. You have to assume that a quick glance at the thumbnails is all she is going to use to decide whether to open the message, so if your main image isnt the single best photo you own then you are doing yourself a disservice. No cheesy topless shots, no stuffy formal pictures and no Myspace style self-portraits eitheryou want a picture that shows you are a relaxed, fun person who has an active social life.** #### The key to writing an interesting profile **It almost doesnt matter what information you write in your profile as long as you are conveying sincerity and vulnerability. The best way to demonstrate sincerity is to write your main bio in a loose conversational manner without trying to big yourself up. This isnt a CV; you arent auditioning for anyone, so dont write it like you are trying to impress. It will come across as needy, and although you may have the sexiest picture imaginable, your chances of meeting someone are virtually zero if you sound like a douche.** **Vulnerability is the essence of opening yourself up without fearing rejection. Are you a geeky chess player? Are you passionate about computer programming? Do you have a fetish for licking stamps? Dont be afraid of telling people who you are and what you love doing. A truly attractive person is comfortable in their own skin and has the confidence to reveal their thoughts and feelings without caring what anyone else thinks. Ask your best friend or someone you trust to proofread your profile to check that what you have written is a fair and honest representation of your personality and you arent coming across like a crazy person.** **Unless you want to attract crazy people of course.** #### That all-important first message **Okay, youve sorted out your profile and taken some decent pictures, now youre ready to send your very first message. What do you do?** **First, dont just send messages out blindly: you have to tailor the message to your goals and the person you are writing to. You dont want to give a beautiful woman a physical compliment because it wont have a huge effect on her. Likewise you dont want to tease someone who comes across like they might not be the most confident person. With regards to messaging men, dont be overly flirtatious as that can immediately set off their BS detector. Instead, give a man a non-sexual compliment and show interest in something from his profile. Guys, read that last sentence tooit applies both ways.** **Common sense goes a long way here:** **Read their profile.** ***Read it again.*** **Try to find something that most people may have missed. Does she love an obscure movie that youve also seen? Has he been to a country that you love? Is she doing a degree in a subject that you have knowledge about? Find something that you can grab hold of and use, whether thats a specific piece of information or just a vibe youre getting. Tailor your message around that. Its hard to figure someone out based on just a few words and a picture or two, but you have to learn to go with your instincts. Unfortunately this will only come with practice, and the more messages you send, the better you will get.** **Online dating is exactly the same as meeting someone the conventional wayits purely a numbers game and the quicker you realise this, the better. The more messages you send out, the more replies you will receive. Research has also shown that the best time to send a message is on a Sunday afternoon. That is the time when people are generally bored and are at their computers searching for a bit of companionship after their failed attempts at meeting someone the previous night.** #### How to get away from the internet and on that first date **There are two main ways to transition away from whatever dating site you are using: the first way is a slower process but its probably the safest option, while the second is very high risk-high reward, but is the quickest method if done correctly.** #### Option number 1 **The slower method is about building trust and rapport. The best way to do this is to suggest moving away from the dating site to a more personal method of communication. Back in the day this was MSN Messenger, but nowadays you could use Facebook chat or WhatsApp. The advantage of Facebook is that you can get more insight into who they are, see more photos, find out the kind of circles they hang out in. Its slightly stalkerish, but remember; they will get to see everything on your profile too so its a fair swap.** **WhatsApp is basically an instant messaging service that is available on iPhone, Android and Windows and it involves trading each others phone number. From here you can send each other messages throughout the day and its a great way to have some fun. After you have built up a little more trust you can then transition to speaking on the phonehey, you have each others number anyway so it makes sense.** #### Option number 2 **You can skip all of this if you want and just go straight for the meet up. To do this effectively you have to use your common sense (Im sure you have some) and suggest this at the right time. In my experience I would do this after maybe 20-30 emails back and forth. This may seem a lot, but if you are trading several emails a day then this should only take a week to accomplish.** **The way that I bring this up is with a casual, you seem pretty cool, we should meet up soon comment. Its very vague amd doesnt pressure them into giving an immediate answer, yet it shows that your intention is to meet up, not to have a new pen pal. If the response is in any way positive, then go right ahead and suggest a provisional date, like saying Cool, I am free on Monday to Wednesday evenings and maybe Sunday afternoon; let me know what is best for you. Give a few options, such as different evenings, mix in a daytime option and sit back and wait. I would say 75% of the time you will get a definitive date set from this, but if not, then as long as you keep emailing each other, you can try again the following week.** **Remember: as long as you keep chatting to each other, the interest is still there. Dont feel discouraged by an initial no, as this could mean anything from feeling worried about meeting someone online to simply being busy with work. Keep building that rapport and dont moan about it under any circumstances. Accept every decision and show that you understand. Be patient and respectful.** **You can always revert back to option 1 at this point.** #### First date dos and donts * **Choose the location yourself; preferably some place where you feel comfortable and that offers the opportunity to sit/walk side by side. Dont go to dinner, the cinema or sit opposite each otherthose promote a sense of detachment.** * **Act like its the second date already. Dont start with an awkward hello and a million questionschat like you would to a good friend.** * **Dont offer to pay for a drink, just go ahead and do it. If they object, just tell them the next round is on them, (or next time if its only a quick meet).** * **The key to building rapport is to qualify and comfort. Listen intently and demonstrate an understanding or approval or what they are saying, then follow up with a similar story/example from your own life. For example: I cant believe you climbed Kilimanjaro, that is such a cool storyIve always wanted to do that but the closest Ive got to that is a hike up Ben Nevis, which was cool in its own way because** * **Go ahead and talk about your online dating experiencesyou can laugh about all of the crazy weird messages you each receive.** * **Dont reveal how many people you have met up with if its more than 5 in a 1-year period, or if the person you are meeting is inexperienced at this.** * **If there has been some flirting and you feel that you have both enjoyed the date, dont be afraid to go for the kiss. It is rare that you will receive a rejection and it demonstrates attractive qualities.** * **Use common sense, but dont use fear as an excuse not to make the move.** * **Remember that you are not trying to sell yourself. Go in with the mindset that you are trying to find out if this person meets YOUR standards, not the other way round. Be friendly, flirty, funny and conversational without being needy.** * **Dont ask for a second datejust state that you would like to see them again and youll be in touch soon to arrange something.** #### Finally, some important points to remember **You will have no doubt seen those tabloid internet dating horror stories, but they are so rare its not even worth worrying about. Meeting someone online is probably the safest method of dating. I say this because you have the option to check out everything about them before that first date, which is something you cant do if you meet someone in a bar or club. If employers can use the internet to check out potential employees then you can do the same.** **On a semi related note, make sure that the photos you have seen are genuine. If you cant see their Facebook page or if their dating profile only has 1 photo then it is okay to ask to see a few more. I personally will never meet up with anyone if I havent had a good look at their photos. This isnt being shallow at all, its simply reducing the chances of being conned into meeting someone who is 50 lbs heavier than their photo or is in any way trying to pass themselves off as better looking than they really are.** **You can spot a fake profile a mile off; its really easy. If there is just 1 photo of someone with above average looks, little in the way of profile information, mentions sex in any way whatsoever, or uses their first and last name together then move on. Its not worth the hassle. Similarly, guys: as you know, women dont usually send out that first message so if you receive a message from a really hot woman and you feel uneasy about it, feel free to reply but bewarecheck those trigger signs I just mentioned and use your instincts and intuition.** **Girls: you WILL receive messages from guys asking for sex. It happens, so its best that youre aware of it from the outset. The majority of these guys are harmless and just lack social skills. The best way to deal with these is not to reply at all, not even a polite no thanks. Only reply to the guys that have put a little thought into the opening message.** **So thats it. Online dating is a bit scary if you have never done it before, but hopefully this guide (whilst covering the basics) is enough to get you started, and providing that you follow my advice about using your common sense and instincts, youll have a great time. Enjoy yourself and stay safe!** [source...](URL"

I'm going to marry her one day, and there's nothing in the world I'm more sure of than that. I liked her a long time before we actually started dating. We were coworkers for a while, didn't see each other for several months after I changed professions, and then reconnected. I'm not exactly the most personable, emotional person, and tend to keep those feelings internally. One outlet I used to use when I was crushing super hard, and even when we were in the early stages of dating was to write a sort of diary. Laugh if you want, it helped me express my feelings. I wrote some pretty sappy stuff in there, much of which is extremely personal and gives a very in-depth understanding of my thought processes and the vulnerability I felt during that time. I've thought about giving it to her as a sort of gift. Keep in mind that some of this stuff was prior to us dating, and it contains thoughts and feelings typically more reserved for long term couples rather than people who aren't dating. Think Jim and Pam from the office where Jim literally said ""I love you"" before they even were dating, and buying a wedding ring 2 weeks after dating. Stuff on that sort of level for reference. Is this creepy and should I throw this away, or is this romantic and should I show this to her."

Weve been going on 1-2 dates a week regularly during this time. Slept together for the first time after about the 5th date. Both indicated we saw this developing into a relationship. Im a very texty person, hes not. After telling him this, he texted me more often and for longer periods of time, but that was short lived. When we had this conversation, he said you dont even check on me at wooorrkkkk (meaning text him during his shift). He doesnt really share his thoughts on where this situation is going until I bring it up, and doesnt share emotions/feelings very much. He is, however, extremely affectionate and has always seemed eager to spend time with me (including without sex lol). He works in law enforcement, so I sometimes attribute his lack of vulnerability to his job. One time, i jokingly told him that he plays hard to get, to which he replied I aaammm hard to get. Our last date was a week ago. Other than comment on my Snapchat story over the weekend, he hasnt reached out to me. Should I let him go or reach out?

137,vulnerability,dating_advice,I (26m) need advice on what do with this polyamorous girl (22f).,1,cxec6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/cxec6r/i_26m_need_advice_on_what_do_with_this/,2019-08-30 19:03:58,"Throw away for anonymity. Ok this is a complicated situation, for me at least. A few months back i started talking to this girl i met online through a popular videogame. lets call her.. Emily. (Not her real name). Before her, I have not shown interest in persuing a relationship with anybody for almost a decade. My self esteem is extreamly low and i don't feel like anybody could possibly ever be interested in me. Also online relationships where always against my ideals anyway as i always felt they where just a waste of time. In the beginning of the relationship we seemed to connect really fast. We where talking through text, and texting each other close to a hundred times a day, even while working. during the second week, At the end of a phone call she let it slip that ""i love you bye"" and hung up. I was absolutely blown away. My first thought was.. WHAT!? Its been 2 weeks, how could you possibly love me? This can't be normal. So a while later i called her and asked her about what she said. She responded that she was polyamorous and in her words, ""she had so much love to give, that she couldent feel fulfilled in life only sharing it with one person"" or something to that effect. I can't remember her exact words. Also she was currently engaged to her fiance. At first i didn't agree with her ideology and i asked to just remain friends, to which she agreed. But over time we continued talking and i found myself beginning to really be interested in her, more, and more as time went on. I began to really think about the whole polyamory way of life and wondered if it's something I could try. I knew I'd probobly have problems with jealousy and what not, I wasent sure, but i really liked her and was willing to give it a try. So one day, about a month into this whole thing, I decided to ask her if she was willing to give it a try. She said that it was a big descision and she'd have to speak to her fiance about it, I'd also have to talk to him about it and that she would have a descision in a few days. That day never came. But after that conversation i found myself really motivated to begin working on self improvement. I started exercising and going for jogs everyday. I started eating healthier and really really started feeling an improvement to my mental health and physical health. I was losing weight, i was more energetic. I felt mentally sharper, and it showed in certain areas too. But after this, things started getting a little wonky in regards to our relationship. We had our first real disagreement, It was over her buying a new monitor for her PC and us disagreeing on the right choice. Im a huge a computer nerd and.. she's.. not. But we got through it and she ended up being very satisfied with her purchase. From this point on i started noticing a new trend in our conversations. Almost every Conversations started becoming very one sided. And if it wasent about her than she didn't seem interested. I was putting in a lot of effort and thought behind my responses in conversations and she was clearly not in return. Regardless if what we spoke of was negative, or even positive. Almost every conversation regardless if topic was like this. I started to question weather or not she actually cared about me or not. Was she just seeking attention? And she really made me question her feelings when i wrote a poem that i shared with her. One night she shared that she was going to a poetry reading meetup later that night. I recently got into poetry and decided to write my first poem. I spent about 10-11 hours over the course of two days writing it I really, really put a lot of thought and effort into it. One night i shared it with her, and her response was simply ""it's cute"" than immediately followed up with a short poem she wrote of a girl she dreamt of. I was crushed. It wasn't cute... it was extremely deep, emotional, and really shared my vulnerability and true thoughts. I felt she either didn't read it, or didn't care about it. Im not saying she had too like it. But if she really read it she she would have definitely given me a bigger response on it, as there was a significantly sized part that was clearly aimed in her direction. She could atleast have given me more feedback on it, outside of a two word response. And the fact that she immediately followed up with her own poem made me feel she only cared about herself. After that i started thinking about our entire relationship. I realised a few things. one, she dosent seem to care about me. two, i realised i was only improving myself because of her which was unhealthy. And three, The best thing i could for myself was to ghost her and cut all ties, before it gets worse. But i didn't. I spoke to a mutual friend of ours and she said it's not fair for me to do that because than I'd also be ghosting her as well, which i would of, because of how close she is to Emily. And i need to also think of the impact that would have on the rest of our mutual friends. And i really valued her as a person. Shes extreamly intelligent, caring and inspiring. I agreed i didn't want that either. I decided i would bring all of these things up to Emily and decide what to do from there, maybe she could change. Or atleast try. I did not bring up the poem. I was extreamly confused and my head felt foggy when i talked to her but i think i was able to get my point across. For example one problem was just simply ""how long it took you to text back. when you don't text back for 3 hours after i ask something possibly controversial it makes me think i pissed you off and gives me anxiety."" I understand you can't always text back right away, because of work or w/e that's fine. But than when you do text back IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION! Alot of our conversations where always left open ended like that. It was driving me crazy. She acknowledged this and a few other points i braught up. And said she would try to work on it. So i accepted her response and continued on with the relationship. During the conversation i was so scared of losing her i regretted bringing any of this up. As time went on, things didn't change. I still felt like i was putting in way more effort than i was getting back. There are many examples but i will not go into them. I could write a book. I felt more and more like she didn't actually care about me. And she only cared about herself. We got into a few more arguments over the next few months. And one thing i always took away from them is never once in any argument did she acknowledge my pain. But she made damn sure to bring up how what i said hurt her or made her angry. I always apologized profusely and tried many things to cheer her up after. And despite me telling her i was also hurt She never once asked if i was was ok or asked about me. Just reinforcing the idea that she only cares about herself. There are many other minor things that make her appear very self centered that i don't feel like listing. But in one of them i btaught up the poem thing and she responded with that her lack of response was due too the fact that her ex used to write her poetry and that she didn't like when guess wrote her poetry because it reminded her of him and that i should NEVER WRITE HER POETRY, or talk about it again. A few nights ago we where playing video games and we where playing with another guy who was really seeming to hit it off with her. He was making her laugh a lot, he was very witty, funny and not afraid to be a little dirty. Hell, he even made me genuinely laugh out loud a few times. I started to feel jealousy, and physically weak. I could barely focus mentally on the match and my hands became heavy and coordination was declining. I decided that i should take a break and find something else to do. So i briefly said good night, and left. I was so ashamed my feelings. I knew it was wrong to feel the way i did, i liked the guy as a person. And that i should be happy that shes happy. But i started to wonder if she really did like me again.. i started asking myself a ton of questions and was spiraling down and decided to get drunk to numb my emotions. A while later, she said shes here for me if i needed (which was the first time she ever said that to me). I decided to let her know what i was feeling and her response was simply. ""I understand..."" that didn't help me. I decided to ask her, where do we stand in this relationship? Do i still stand a chance with you. I told her to be truthful. right now i need reassurance or reality. I can't go on feeling like I'm working so hard for nothing. I explained to her that i had a goal of one day meeting her and taking her on a real date and that it would be a long time before i felt confident enough in doing such a thing, but i need reassurance that I'm not just doing this for nothing. Or if i am, give me a reality check. Dont string me along for nothing. She told me not to expect a relationship. At this point i was feeling pretty numb and decided to ask her a BIG question. I asked her if she's really just using her polyamorism as an excuse to recieve attention, and affection from many people, and that her real interest is only her fiance. She said she was drunk and did not want to talk about it anymore. She will respond when she's sober. She has not talked to me in 2 days now, Outside of letting me know she was mad at me and that i shouldn't text her. An additional thing I'd like to add is The night i got drunk she shared that she posted a picture of herself to r/chubby and that it got a specific number of upvotes. She seemed ecstatic, but the conversation was cut short when a friend of ours joined the chat room. The morning after i decided to see if i could find her post and i did. Her profile reveals that over the course of the last 10 months she posted maybe.. 20 selfies. The titles of some of the post sounded like she was doing this for acceptance of herself and reassurance of her physical beauty. It was kind of heart breaking for me and makes me feel bad for her. (besides I've told her many times i really think she's beautiful). It makes me question her motives on seeking attention, And i wonder if i really hurt her by questioning her polyamory. I mean i feel I'm not exactly in the right here either. I blinded myself multiple times so i could keep feeling love for her to get what i wanted from the relationship too. Ex: for the motivation for self improvement. Is that not basically the same thing she may have been doing to me? tl;dr: after kinda being in a polyamorus relationship things seem really one sided and a lack of empathy and response makes me feel like I'm being used for her emotional needs. So finally here's my question to all of you. Do you think i was just being used for emotional support, or am i just a paranoid asshole who should apologize for what i said? what's the deal with this whole thing? Im so conflicted on so many things. I don't know how to feel. What do i do now?"

Sometimes I can deal with it just fine but on other days it's wearing me down a lot. he's not online a lot as far as I can tell, often we just get to exchange two or three messages before I go to bed, and sometimes he isn't awake/doesn't text back when I get up (which is at 7 am my time/22 pm his time). its hard looking forward to talking to him because I know I won't get much out of it (few messages, sometimes they're just one word messages too). we have had days where we talked a lot with paragraphs of text, but I feel like they've been getting rarer recently. I really like getting and giving affection when I'm with the right person, but that's been getting less too. I sometimes try to subtly get his attention by posting something on my Instagram story/similar, but I feel kinda stupid for doing so. I'm having a hard time expressing myself with him because I don't want to be selfish/make him turn away from me if I demand something he might not agree with, and I don't want to seem like a attention seeker, but due to the fact that we talk so little I notice how difficult it sometimes is for me to trust him. I feel vulnerable when I want to tell him I miss him or love him because I'm afraid of him not saying it back, so I often end up not doing it. I know that being vulnerable is part of a relationship but it would be really helpful if we kind of like, managed to open up together. I hate having to open up first if I truly care about a person because I don't want to be used for feeling strongly about them. Does anyone have advice of how to overcome this fear and maybe have an idea how I can prevent feeling too down of him not talking to me? I'm currently not extremely afraid of us breaking up because scenarios like this have happened already, but I'm tired of constantly feeling like I have to keep to myself because I don't know what to do to make him happy. Thank you! Also, I don't know if this is relevant but he cheated on his last gf. I am worried of it happening again but I have more of a ""what will happen happen"" view of it. he was the one asking me out and he said he has learned from his past mistakes. I guess it will turn out if he actually has or not."

For whatever reason, I've heard stories of women losing their attraction to men who reveal vulnerability like that. I've ALSO heard stories of men losing attraction to women who when they let their walls down. Perhaps the woman doesn't always feel like wearing make-up or doesn't always feel like laughing at your jokes. Or whatever. Maybe she isn't as sexy as you thought she was. It's like (gasp) she's an actual person. We put our best foot forward when it comes to dating, but goddamn...let's remember that we're people at the end of the day. Dating is super hard on our healths. Let's try to understand that and empathize with it. There are tons of men who feel like they can't be vulnerable with their girlfriends out of fear of looking 'less capable' in her eyes. Are they wrong? There are tons of women who feel like they have to be a certain way all the time or risk losing their partners. Obviously we need to always keep the other person in mind, but when it starts affecting our mental healths...it's time to question why the fuck we're doing what we're doing. The world's standards of manhood and womanhood are often impossible to fully live up to. Let men cry. Let women breathe. It's okay. Seriously."
141,vulnerability,dating_advice,My unbreakable dating commandments for men (regardless of age),421,czr5x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/czr5x0/my_unbreakable_dating_commandments_for_men/,2019-09-05 07:34:22,"Some of these may be common, some less so, some you may agree with, some you may not. Regardless, I've learnt a thing or two in my (29M) life up until now, both from personal experience, others taught by people whom I trust greatly. I'm sitting down to write these firstly because I believe that good advice should be shared and because it may inspire some to be better in their dating game or just better men in general. **Technology** \- Never, ever, write anything in a text, PM, e-mail, tweet or ""direct message"" that you wouldn't write in burning letters, 50 feet high in the sky. \- You can spare the mass of emojis if you are over 14. You can really speak in text without having to end in 10 heart eyes emojis in a row, ""lol"" or ""x"". \- Call instead of texting whenever possible. \- Follow up. Always follow up. It doesn't have to be long. Brief and concise is best. People forget to follow up these days. It will make so much of a difference. Write, if you can, a handwritten thank you note. \- Use technology in your favour. **Do:** Send her flowers at her office with the clicks of two buttons. It's so easy these days. **Do:** like her photo on social media. That's why she posted it. **Do:** send a lighthearted comment on her story. **Don't:** mass-like all of her social media postings, send friend requests to her friends, mom, dad, dog and aunt. \- Placing your phone on the table is the same as placing your penis on the table. Don't do it. **""How you look tells the world how you feel""** \- Dress well. Dress as well as you can afford, not only out of respect for yourself, but as a sign of respect for the ones around you. Being well dressed will open countless more doors for you not only in dating but also in other situations such as finding a table at a crowded restaurant, at the check in desk in the airport, being pulled over by the police or simply hailing a cab. \- Dress for the occasion. Black tie is not the dress code to get ""creative with"". \- Smell amazing. Not good, not great, amazing. Find your signature fragrance and stick to it forever. Smell amazing all the time. Invest in a real fragrance, and not something you will find in a duty free shop. It will work wonders for you. Our sense of smell is the most underrated of all, yet the most powerful. \- Women notice: your shoes, your teeth and your watch. \- Women also notice: how you speak to your family and how you treat people in the service industry. \- There is elegance in simplicity and subtlety. \- Have a skill, whatever it may be, but have one. Do not show it off, though. Let it be an extension of your personality. \- A style affectation can come in countless forms and it is also used as an extension of your personality. I've always used to carry a St Dupont lighter in my pocket even before I've started smoking because you never know when the situation arises when someone next to you is in need of a light. And it's a great conversation starter. \- You hair is the only thing you wear 24/7. Treat it well and have it cut at a real barber at least every 3 odd weeks. **On the date** \- Tell her how beautiful she looks in this dress. \- Help her with her coat or jacket. \- Always open/close the car or cab door for her. \- When she stands up to go to/return from the restroom you always stand up. \- You will not impress by ordering the most expensive thing on the menu. \- Always make eye contact when toasting your glasses. \- It is ok not to be familiar with the recommended wine. Pretending you know about it only worsens things. Instead, ask politely the waiter to tell you more about it. \- If the conversation goes stale at one point, ask her about her family. \- Flirt but don't be inappropriate, tease but don't be rude, have fun but don't take it as a joke. \- Watch your alcohol intake. Really. **Breaking up** \- Never ghost. It has been said before many times but I cannot stress this enough. It is probably the no. 1 most immature gesture you can pull off. If you are not interested in seeing anyone anymore, sit down together and explain sincerely why it is that you do not wish to continue. Never use ""you did / you didn't do"". Instead, say ""I felt &lt;insert here&gt; when...."". \- Unless it is long distance, you have no excuse not to meet up face to face with her. \- Also on this matter: choose a place that bares no memories of you two together there. The easiest way to break the news to her is to imagine in a way that you are reading a news article. Do not start with an explanation, but with a statement resembling a title. It is bad enough that you are breaking up, make it easier for her by being as brief as possible. Something like: ""I think we should break up. (let her absorb the information now for a few seconds) I believe that the fights we've had recently took a toll on our relationship and it will be better if we do not waste our time anymore and look for someone else"". \- When you are feeling nostalgic over an ex, remember that the girl you used to know no longer exists. With time, she has had experiences that you know nothing of that have changed her into someone else. **In the long run** \- Don't sleep with a married woman unless she is your wife. \- Love as if you've never been hurt \- Never blame alcohol for a bad decision you took. Learn to take responsibility for your actions. \- The man who strays eventually gets caught. The woman who strays eventually falls in love. \- ""Marry your second wife first"" - my father \- Contrary to popular belief, opening up to someone and showing vulnerability is a sign of strength and not weakness. \- Trust your instinct. It will never fail you, even though you decide to go against it at times. \- On this matter: never cheat. Cheating is the way out of the cowards. Break up before you cheat. \- It is ok to be dumped. If Paul Newman could get dumped, so can you. \- People will disappoint. Many times. People will disappoint in the most hurtful ways you can begin to bare and at the times you expect them the least. Allowing yourself to heal and learn a lesson from this is the true sign of maturity and emotional stability. And no, the lesson learned is not to build impenetrable walls around yourself in order to prevent yourself from getting hurt again. The lesson you learn is just to continue doing what you're doing because someone out there deserves your love and attention, and in return they will make you the happiest man alive. Remember, all the feelings you have, great or worse, those are the ones that make you feel alive the most. Be grateful for every day above ground and for any experiences you go through. \- Never say ""I love you"" unless you really mean it. \- Time is the greatest gift you can give. You don't spend 500$ on that return ticket. You spend 500$ on that two short days you have with her, case in which that becomes priceless. \- Practice moderation in everything. It is one of the greatest virtues. \- This can can well be the day you meet the love of your life. I guarantee she is out there. You just haven't met her yet. Still the chances are, you never will. But there are millions of fabulous women in the world who you could love. Even if they will never be her. **You are not in the right relationship** \- If cheating only crosses your mind for merely a second \- If she is not the first thing you think about the moment you wake up in the morning or the last before you fall asleep at night \- If arguments are the norm \- If in those special moments you don't feel as though there wouldn't be another place in the world where you would rather be or do than where you are right here, right now, with her by your side \- If your bed becomes cold \- If you truly wish you had never met her, and you truly hope that you will never meet her again, then whatever it was, it was never love \- If you expect something in return"

I have a problem with dealing with the consequences of asking someone out. I'm at college and I'm afraid of asking women out because I don't want to have to see them around if they reject me. The issue is that once you ask someone out and they reject you, it will always be a part of their memory (to some extent). Everytime they see you they will think of how you asked them out and how they rejected you (Of course they probably won't think about alone). They will know of your embarrassment and put that on your character. They might even use your embarrassment against you. For example, the last girl that rejected me told her friends that knew me and now they know about my embarrassments. I don't want people to know of my embarrassments. They said ""you can't unsay something."" (I wish you could). How do I deal with the consequences of asking someone out that I have to see around? How do I avoid people knowing about my embarrassments and vulnerability?"

Didn't want to have to give himself to just one person. He says and does enough just to keep me close for his benefit but far enough where I'm not too attached and setting expectations. But still... I set them! Because somewhere I feel he does love me but his ego and fear of vulnerability won't let him admit he sees a life with me. So I choose to be patient and loving, submissive at times. But I feel it's unnoticed or dismissed , or wont even pay off. I thinking I need to walk away from this one .. when I try to he tells me ""you're running away"". But when I try to stay he tells me ""I dont want this"" while, in the same breathe tells me ""I love you.. youve made this place feel like home"" . Like wth??? So if I leave this, it'll be me choosing myself instead of this guessing and waiting game. I truly feel I would KNOW if I was wanted by him.. And so far that hasn't been what it is... I need to know if Im missing something here?? I'm so damn confused. He puts me down when he can't get thru to me , he doesn't know how to communicate the affection he feels. He rather me act a mess with my emotions in front of him than reveal his own. I truly think he gets off on it.. me being so stressed and crazed with love for him . If it matters to anyone... He's a capricorn man and, I'm a libra woman. The odds are against us when you look at the astrological relation. Aside from it , he's a great individual so am I. There's just no type of thrill between us. Only friction and confusion and indecisiveness.. Haha what a shit show this has been."

I am 30 years old, male, just started a real career, and finally have my life together. Ready to find a nice lady. Last weekend I went to a party at my friends place. I talked to this incredibly beautiful girl in the hot tub and we shared some common interests. I was very attracted to her. When i saw she was going home for the night, I decided to approach her and ask her out. I told her i thought she was beautiful and asked if she was single. She said ""Im seeing someone but its not serious"" and proceeded to give me her number. I contact her a few days later, and she tells me that she told the guy she's dating and he ""wasn't happy"" that she gave her number to me, blah blah not fair to him blah blah, and she shouldn't see me. &amp;#x200B; Well, I said no problem and left it at that. But man, I feel used. Dating is hard because so rarely do people attract and interest me like that. I get such a rush from it, I don't even want to bother with people that don't make me feel like that. Is that wrong? I'm worried that my loneliness and vulnerability will lead to me settling for a nice girl that shows interest in me but one that I'm not attracted to on the same level I've experienced.

148,vulnerability,dating_advice,After dating a manipulative narcissist I [29M] find myself almost frustrated at the tempo a healthy relationship with a mentally stable woman progresses.,3,ch8qqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/ch8qqd/after_dating_a_manipulative_narcissist_i_29m_find/,2019-07-25 00:16:48,"So for those who dont know narcissists live in an endless cycle of abuse. It starts with love bombing the shit out of you, they make you feel so important and special, they convince you that youre star-crossed lovers very quickly to create vulnerability for them to soon start antagonizing you in hopes of eliciting a reaction from you that they can use to play the victim and then discard you (dump you) without taking any responsibility for why you were mad or reacting the way you did. Only to see how youll gravel and beg for their forgiveness so theyll take you back, thus giving them 100% control in the relationship. Example : my ex girlfriend would treat me like a king, compliments, showering me with affection and nice gestures from Monday - Thursday. maybe shed make me a very nice dinner one Thursday night, and while Im eating the dinner I lick ketchup off my thumb. Suddenly everything changes and Im accused of having no table manners and being an unsophisticated brute. I try to defend myself in confusion, (as to me, I was just eating and dont know what the big deal is) she then begins to insult my family insisting that I was raised by unsophisticated trash who never instilled manners in me, to which I defend my family, she then starts to attack me personally by devaluing me, it moves in circles so fast eventually Im being accused of not loving her enough and being told to get the f*ck out. I would attempt to reconcile for a few days of continued devaluation and abuse until she would (usually by Sunday night) invite me to talk about the situation but in order to agree to speak to me I would have to demonstrate some grand gesture of how sorry I was for my actions (like getting on my knees and cleaning her shoes with my shirt in her apartment parking lot, just so she would grant me an audience as she smugly barks you missed a spot) thus giving her 100% control and making me an emotional slave in order to keep the relationship going. Then its like a light switch back to love bombing and being built up (until the weekend) when it all starts again - But theres no progression its literally a circle. That was all preface for those who might have needed a better idea of the type of person Im coming from. They make you believe youre falling in love very quickly but cant keep it up for long before tension builds, they attack you with devaluation and insults, wait for you to defend yourself then play the victim and accuse you of never loving them because a person who loves them would never retaliate, then makes you beg for forgiveness. The tempo at which the relationship moved was so very fast that now I feel frustrated almost at how slow a healthy relationship moves. I started dating a gorgeous woman recently, who is very sweet and caring towards me. Incredibly understanding and treats me with respect. She is amazing and Ive grown so accustomed to abuse I spent the beginning of this waiting on her to fly off the handle at me over breathing too loudly (actual fight topic with my narc ex) but it never happened. Shes just sweet and genuinely cares about me. But the relationship moves at what my brain knows is a healthy pace but coming from what I was in its frustrating how slow it is. For instance if youre driving on the freeway at 80mph for 4 hours or so and then take an exit and have to go 25 for the next 2hr thats how it feels. This woman is great and I dont want to screw things up by being impatient, I know this is how fast normal healthy relationships progress but theres a part of me thats expecting or hoping shell just love bomb me profess her undying love for me and move in with me and start planning a wedding - which is unrealistic and I know it is but its honestly what Im used to but then again Im also used to being in trouble for existing every weekend so - what are some things I can do to keep my patience and a clear head as this wonderful relationship accelerates at a healthy pace? Thanks TL:DR - ex GF was a manipulative narcissist and the relationship moved very fast in cycles of abuse. Now Im in a healthy relationship with a great gal that moves considerably slower but also moves forward and not in a circle that leads back to me being abused, looking for tips or advice on remaining patient as I realize this is the tempo NORMAL relationships move at but struggle resisting the urge to just dive head first into big life decisions."

I've been finding that people my age, especially men have been boring me. I want to care more about peoples feelings and men interested in me but every time men (potential bfs) contact me it feels like a chore, or it feels like so much energy (I work 40+ hours and school). I'm not saying I need to be in a relationship, but I definitely want to be more receptive to peoples feelings. I have realized that I quickly become bored with people, especially potential BF's. what can I do to improve on that without coming off too strong? I know this sounds cliche, but I feel as a 20 year old I have a fairly good head on my shoulders and I'm fairly mature, while everyone around me his hyper emotional and clingy. Excessive vulnerability makes me very uncomfortable and that goes for any emotion (I'm adopted for context). I guess that is my overall question; how can I be more emotionally vulnerable, and emotionally receptive? and just receptive as a person in general?"

Not even a date, I picked up the tickets because it was more convenient and she got the concessions to be fair. When I started working there I originally had a crush on her but quickly found out she was dating someone. Totally fine, no sweat. We still had a lot in common and she became a good work friend and I had nothing but platonic feelings for her. A few months ago she broke up with her now ex. So while I just saw the movies as us going to a movie we both wanted to see, she was a little anxious of it being date-like (and looking back, yeah, I get it.) At the movies, she threw popcorn at me that was pretty much the start of it. It was flirty, we goofed, she grabbed my arm during a funny scene, it definitely grew some date energy. A few days later we talked about how there were some likey vibes and how it probably wouldn't be a good time to start anything because it was so soon since her and her ex broke up and she plans on going back to school across the country in a few months, totally respect that. I had zero romantic intentions. I had a lot of romantic wants, but I wasn't going to act on them. We start hanging out more and the flirting doesn't cool it, it's very mutual, it escalates. We have a few talks about what's happening, what can't happen but what we want to happen. Over the last month or so has felt like the most potential for a truly great relationship I've had in probably my adult life. I could list off all the great things that happened, but it'd be pretty pointless and just hurt. We got to the point of openly admitting falling for each other hard and fast and while knowing how shitty of timing it is, truly feeling like everything else was perfect kept spurring the fire on. Yesterday we finally talked. She told me that while she loves every second of being with me, she still feels these pains that she *needs* to be single for a while - the reason she left her ex was for space. The reason she's going cross-country for school is for space and focus. She needs to find herself and again, totally respect and understand it logically. But emotionally I'm just fucking torn up. I know this is what's best for her. I know she's doing what's best for her personal growth. I love that she's caring for herself. But fuck does it make me feel alone again. I just had a month of borderline bliss with someone that I now doubt I'll ever get to hold that way again. It's just the hurt right now. I feel lucky, like I experienced such a high high that this low low is tearing me apart and hopefully eventually I'll find a woman who can give me that permanently. The romance, the vulnerability, the nerding out, the stupid jokes, sending literally the same meme at the same time on different messengers. The next month or however long is going to be hard seeing her at work, it'll take me a while to get over her. I just feel like such an idiot for letting myself think there was a future when we knew there wasn't. I just sorta feel unwanted or like no woman is going to measure up and let me feel the way she did, take care of my heart the way she did, reciprocate the emotions the way she did. I'm beyond envious of whoever she ends up with and I don't even know who that is. I just miss her."
151,vulnerability,dating_advice,"If two people want to date each other, they wont let the details get in the way. If one of them doesnt want to, any detail will get in the way..",430,c2c8xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/c2c8xc/if_two_people_want_to_date_each_other_they_wont/,2019-06-19 13:59:48,"The key when a guy approaches a girl, he doesnt approach to win her over. It is to see if she is willing to..invest time to go out on a date to get to know him more intimately. In other words, she says yes. So you approach to show true intent, vulnerability right there and then. You need to have a frame of mindset to see things at face value. Most guys just find themselves frustrated because they are needy, desperate by looking for signals, and trying to confirm their own theories that a girl likes them without asking her out. Some even go so far to not walk away when a girl says leave me alone. AND they dont ask questions for advice but to confirm their own theories. What do I do if she loves me but is afraid of me? When I talk to her, she says to leave her alone but then she stares at me and gives signs. Last time I talked to her, she shouted to leave her alone irritatingly. See the neediness, the desperation and all rationality out of the window. Approaching to show true intent, instead of looking for signals, helps guys to avoid this unattractive, needy and desperate behavior. This helps you to make sure any girl who is just doing things like flirting isnt doing so out of boredom, for fun, showing off, to just feel good but really is into you. Desires you as you desire her. You find out by how? You ask her out and thats when you know the truth. Thats when she shows her intent. If she says Im so busy with studies. I dont know. I dont how I should feel. Then this is her intent right there, in the moment and you need to avoid looking for any meaning. Thats neediness. Youre not there to win her over. She should be interested in you to say yes. Now some might say but she might be nervous. You might say but she does love me but scared. I understand but such is life - and - such is people who want something to happen badly. Its a fantasy. If someone is not ready to say yes, move on. Ready or not, you dont read anything into it. You move on. Many miss the opportunity due to their own fears, insecurities, some want to but say no, and some dont really want to. So what do you do? Guess? Wait? Assume? Wonder? Be their therapist? You move on. This is called having boundaries, standards. That doesnt mean she hasnt got standards and boundaries of her own. It just means you got your own values. For example, one of my values is I am attracted to women who are decisive. So when I approach a woman what gets me to invest is she knows who she is, what she wants, and says yes immediately. So if she has this culture, mindset, behavior, perception that a guy who chases, waits, is some guy who is showing hes serious or shows hes relationship materialthats her values but minewill get me to move on. Im not interested. Good luck to her. Im happy for her. If she finds someone doing it that way, go ahead but Im not interested in games, manipulation, waiting, but rather seek maturity, living in the moment. If she cannot be clear and shows she is indecisive then Im not going to wait and nor do I believe in the one and shes so special. Special and unique to me means, the person shown interest, willing to invest and this differentiates her from all the rest of the girls. That gives it meaning, that there is more to her than all the girls I know who are just friends, or the hundreds that walk by me and treat me like everyone else they know. Thats why I will invest more time, willing to nurture a meaningful relationship and see her different. So if it has no meaning, if there is no clear yes, which creates this distinction between her and all the girls I see..I move on. Thats my standards. I want a Yes immediately when I ask. Nothing ambiguous, no signs, no hints, no playing hard to get. Yes or No. My boundaries then is when I asked her out and she didnt answer clearly, then Im not going wait around. My boundaries is I respect my time and Im sure she does to, but Im not going to orbit and waiting around for her. Im sure plenty of guys will do that but Im not one of them. My boundaries is - when any girl plays hard to get because she learnt this from other women, magazines, her mum or dad, on how this is how you know a guy is serioushe chases youthen I move on. Mixed with standardsI want an intelligent, educated woman, mature, see life the way I see it.who doesnt fall for that crap that comes from social conditioning. My boundaries is when someone flakes out twice, its over. Even once is enough sometimes if I feel a girl is taking the piss. My boundaries, is if she tries to belittle me, puts me down in front of people, her friends and anyone else, Ill will pull her aside and say Im not having that crap. Sure, we can be friends but dont expect that entitles any woman my time. Dont expect Im not going to flirt and take interest in other girls. And if she thinks Im a player, wanting just sex, because of that, shes entitled to think that. As Im entitled to think shes an insecure and full of shit. I dont apologize for being a man who knows what he wants, has standards and boundaries. Many will be passive. I wont be. Im going to be busy approaching others, building my business, career and all sorts. Also, the flirting stops with her as I dont want any mixed signals. I want to know where we stand. Ill call it as it is. Thats some of my boundaries and standards. Im not going to try and figure out what she means or what I should do. I am not going to worry what world thinks of me. Im not bothered what the social norm is and the traditions. I know what to do. I got my answer and it wasnt clear enough, so I move on. Whats your standards? Whats your boundaries? These will tell you what you should do. Everyone will tell you different. Some will try and break it down to share what it all means. Some will say wait and others say move on. Same like me. Im saying how it goes but thats how it is for me. The question is What is your standards and boundaries? Figure yourself out and forget figuring the girl and anyone else out. Its hard enough to think for ourselves and having to also try and think what someone else means and thinks. Life is too short. There are far too many guys who wasted so much time waiting for this one girl because Oh shes special, so unique, so perfect.. Or fall into this pick up artist space with figuring out what she means, and why she does it and how to increase value to get her attention. Meh, move on. If she wasnt sure now, after knowing you, after flirting then take it that her interest in you is not big enough to let details get in the way. It is better to be with someone who really wants to be with you. source: URL"

Now what?",1,c32eyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/c32eyt/she_reaches_out_to_call_me_5_months_after_she/,2019-06-21 08:12:53,"I matched with this girl (25F) on Tinder last November, and after exchanging some texts for a week, we agreed to meet for coffee. I guess the very first red flag appeared, when she cancelled on our date not once, but twice, before we finally managed to meet. It was quite clear to me from that we clicked very quickly and there was mutual attraction between us from this date onwards. After two dates at Winter Wonderland and the Aquarium we built up chemistry together, with plans to even travel to Italy together. It was at the Aquarium when she told me that we should take things a bit more seriously. Then by the fourth date, we went to watch a movie, by which we had our first proper kiss after the movie, when we sitting at a bench outside. It should be noted that we discussed about having sex soon, bearing in mind that I'm still a virgin and she was aware of it. It was at this point, she talked about the possibility of us being in a relationship, and I was thinking about it too. During our dates, she did talk about her exes in some detail, telling me how her first bf used to hit her, and how her second bf was obsessive, describing how he had turned up at her place in the early hours after a breakup (I can't really remember more than that). It should be noted that every time we saw each other, I had some mixed feelings about her. The next time we saw each other we went to her place to watch Netflix, and after that we made out again, this time longer and more intense. We saw each other a few more times after that when we went out for dinner together, and kissed each time. Everything was going very well, there were no problems, and I was very happy up to this point. Fast forward a week or two later, the cracks started to appear. She starts making excuses about being ill and being in hospital and having family issues. A month passed without us seeing each other. We still texted daily, and exchanged some calls and left voice messages for each other. It was reassuring. She promised that all was well, and that she missed me and that we were going to see each other again. I maintained my patience. I waited patiently, making sure that I wasn't being needy and trying to keep cool with this situation she told me. But then things got a bit worse. She would send me a text every few days rather than daily. She stopped replying to some of my messages. It was at this point, I can say that I started to worry more slightly, and became a bit more obsessive. Her texts became more brief and hurried. She told me that something was wrong, that she would never do this to me, and that she couldn't explain, which in hindsight is a really bad excuse. A couple more months pass by, and this carries on, we somehow still keep in contact despite me knowing something is clearly going wrong, its at this point when I start trying to date other girls in the realisation that this could potentially not go anywhere. It's not long before she says its over. I'm crushed and in disbelief. We have the odd phone call here and there. After a week of no contact, she reaches out to me and tells me she'd like to be friends still, and tells me that given time, who knows what could happen in the future. After more texting I get more obsessive and worried to the point where she finally has no other option and then she finally tells me that she is seeing someone. My heart drops and I couldn't really believe it was happening. She tells me that they recently formed a relationship. I think there's no way of going back here. I see a WhatsApp photo of the two of them together. It makes things worse for me. I feel very hurt and still have feelings for her, despite whats happened. Throughout the last month she cycles between blocking and unblocking me on WhatsApp. Presumably because our situation is affecting her relationship. Fast forward today, the unexpected happens. She initiates a call with me, telling how sorry she was for blocking me. She apologises a lot and talks about our history together. The reason why she kind of went with this guy over me was because he was alot more confident than me, and whereas I was being too nice and sweet, she tells me, and not showing or taking lead of affection as much. She tells me issues about her current relationship, detailing problems with her ex's lack of vulnerability and emotions, and says that she really misses me. She met his parents and they supposedly don't seem to keen on her. She says she doesn't want to lose me as a friend, and would like us to meet for coffee soon. She says she doesn't know how the future will pan out. I really like this girl and have been obsessing over her for the last month or so. I know that there is alot of reason to be guarded, cautious and careful about the situation and that if she left me for someone else before then whats to say that she won't do it again and that I deserve someone better than her. &amp;#x200B; How do I give myself the best possible chance of winning her over? I know it sounds bad to give this girl who has treated me badly before and unfairly, but I'd like to give her a chance especially considering how much I think about her and how well the dates went. What should I do or say that will potentially change her mind, what are her true intentions for reaching out to me so unexpectedly?"

Do people find they sometimes try hard not to develop feelings when they first start dating someone? Maybe because of the feeling of vulnerability? Ive been thinking about the pros/ cons of just letting your mind get carried away and enjoying the emotional rollercoaster VS trying to hold your mind back but being more closed when first dating someone. Does it change with time/ experiences? Is one a more naive way of thinking? Does it affect the dates themselves (overly keen vs cold)?

I felt during the ending of the relationship i didnt have a say, i was shocked, surprised and he was to decided and defense about ending us, so i never pushed him to get my questions answered to have my closure, only the closure he laying out for me to accept. And that didnt feel right afterwards, so i sent him everything my vulnerability, feelings everything thats been on my mind and what bothered me during everything after of our relationship ended (a big paragraph) he replied with: him: Hey, Im glad youre moving on Ive honestly been worried bout you I honestly dont regret all the good parts just the bad cuz I hurt you when I never wanted to me: i dont even know anymore is this even genuine? him: Well idk what to say you send me something outta nowhere and I respond honestly and all you do is question it I honestly dont know what you need from me SO, honestly i really dont even know if it was genuine or not, the way i feel is that for everything i just said, expressed he only sent those few words, with nothing more of details or understanding where im coming from I DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO FEEL BOUT THIS ANYMORE"

Now let me explain, what I mean. I often hear from my male friends (late 20s - early 30s) story, that has following formula: 1) Met a woman 2) Invited her on social media (IG/FB/Whatever) or got her number 3) Texted with her for couple of weeks 4) Is confused, whether she wants to date, so keeps texting, until she ghosts him 5) GOTO 1; There are many justifications for such behaviour, but most of them boil down to 3 categories: * fear of being labelled creepy * fear of making somebody uncomfortable * and biggest of them all - fear of rejection First two are really easy to overcome - no woman will call you creep, if you respect her boundaries. Example: *Male: Hey, I would like to invite you for {activity} on {date}.* *Female: Um... Thanks, but... I'm not interested...* *M: I understand. Have a nice day then!* *F: Thanks, you too!* In example above, that (probably handsome or just well dressed, but definitely with stellar personal hygiene) gentleman asked women out, but for whatever reason, she politely declined. However that wasn't a big deal for our protagonist, because (like any adult person, regardless of gender and sexual orientation should) he can respect boundaries, and deal with rejection. Which nicely leads us to final fear. Hell, I understand being afraid of rejection, and delaying showing vulnerability as long as possible. And ""texting"" works like charm, because we can lie to ourselves, that we are ""getting to know them"", while in fact we are putting ourselves in the damned friendzone (keep in mind, there is nothing wrong with being friend with woman). But what I've learned, is the longer you hesitate, the harder it is to open up. So next time, you met somebody attractive, follow that algorithm: 1) Met a woman 2) Invited her on social media (IG/FB/Whatever) or got her number 3) Invite her on a date 4) Discover her personality, and show her your own. And that's it!"

""I miss you"" etc. For the first week or so it was ""I miss year"" nearly daily and other weird things that I frankly won't put here.

I have repeatedly asked why he wants to talk to me and he continually says ""it's selfish but I don't want to just NOT talk to you ever again."" He texts every day or every other day at the least and yesterday when I did not answer at all, I could tell by the end of the day the messages seemed frantic on his part. But I need space.

I know the anxiety. I hate it and I hate creating it for others. But when we talk and go back down that same road of ""I'm sorry you're hurting, I wish I could fix it."" I get all torn up again. &amp;#x200B; Don't get me wrong, it is nice to be missed and it is reaffirming to get messages but...at the end of the day, he's just gonna ghost me eventually and then I'll be hurt further. &amp;#x200B; Any advice or support?

157,vulnerability,dating_advice,Texting Expectations,1,bwk8zq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/bwk8zq/texting_expectations/,2019-06-04 13:53:27,"I am not sure if this is the best place to post this or not. If theres a better /r/ please let me know. If you need more info feel free to ask. I apologize for the novel, just not sure what info is all relevant or not. TL;DR: how can I avoid feelings of anxiety related to long response time in between text messages? Background: I (27m) have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder by mental health professionals in relatively recent history. It is something that I have prevailed from and it no longer controls my life. I tell you this as it pertains to my inability to deviate my thinking from the following scenario. Background: This girl (28f) and I basically just met. Weve been in two dates with a tentative third this week. We met online. Weve been talking for a week or two prior to meeting. Texting women really stresses me out. While I (no longer) hold the expectation that responses are warranted quickly, when hours (2+) start to pass, I get really anxious. Did I say something wrong? Is she no longer interested? Maybe she just accidentally missed the message. Maybe shes just busy. I can brush it off for a little bit but the thoughts always come rushing back and grow in intensity. So here I sit, writing to you while I am unable to shake these thoughts from a good morning message and a simple question about music. Its been 13 hours. Again, I dont expect a response right away but thats a crazy amount of time. I dont over message and I never send back to back messages - I always wait for a response. This particular girl is especially horrible at texting back in a timely manner in general but this is next level. I dont want to sit and text every minute of every day either, that would annoy to me too. Whats odd is I feel like I set the right expectations for myself with this one. In the past, these thoughts would consume me if I didnt get a response within 20 minutes and similarly, intensity from there. So I feel like Im doing well even with hours passing and these thoughts dont even begin to manifest until much later. Also, I have been protecting my vulnerability. In the past, I would wear my heart on my sleeve with girls I hardly know. Ive learned from that and keep my guard up a lot more now. I try not to prioritize them in anyway and yet it still drives me mad. Girls I have met up with only a handful of times can effect me like this, whether they know it or not. This is really starting to take a toll. I dont have any sort of expectation to be a priority in these girls lives while in the initial dating phases. Texting someone back hardly feels like making them a priority. I dont know if its just bad luck or what but most women I encounter are terrible at texting me back in a timely fashion, I just dont get it. All this to say... how can I avoid this? Do I need to be upfront about this with women when we introduce texting into our connection? Is there something I can do that will truly prevent me from making essentially strangers in my life from becoming priorities? I actively tried this time to kind of ignore her and play hard to get (not my style but thought Id try). Maybe its because I dont understand why people do this. If its intentional or not, I have no understanding as to why you would not respond for a given time. Sometimes I go hours without responding too but its because Im busy and unable to text back. But otherwise, its hardly ever hours and hours in between. I really just dont know. Any advice or thoughts would be helpful, thanks."

I havent dated anyone of significance in a while and I dont often go looking for it either. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I kinda liked the idea of becoming romantically involved with someone I already had a closeness with. Maybe thats the element that had been missing all along. Although, I must admit, the thought of acting on this presents a monumental risk. One that demands significant consideration before leaping ahead. So when I unwittingly developed feelings for a close friend, I had exhausted myself debating if it was worth it or not. In the end, I realized that if the greatest risks yield the greatest rewards, then the only way I could know if it was worth it would be to take the risk. The other half of this equation is the other person. The decision to act on things depended on whether or not I felt a mutual attraction, which I did...to a degree. Unfortunately, when presented with my raw honesty and vulnerability, the other half was not open to it. At all. Devastating, right? To have taken a huge, emotional risk after intense consideration only to be met with rejection (albeit not flat-out, mean-spirited rejection, it was rejection nonetheless), was something I was underprepared for. They claimed, I have the same feelings for you, but I am not open to a relationship right now. Ive been burned so many times, I dont ever want to risk feeling that pain again. We are already feisty with each other, I can only imagine how bad it could get, and I dont ever want to risk losing you in my life. Youre my favorite person. Ouch. That might actually sting even more. To know they feel the same but are unwilling to act on it is nothing short of torture. The least passionate thing that could happen: using logic to rationalize away emotions. My thoughts are: you only have to get it right the one time. Living in a repressed bubble, trying not to feel too deeply, remaining in a comfort zone, is that really living or just surviving? Why bother? Isnt it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all? So sayeth Shakespeare anyway... So in an effort to move on (how exactly? An insurmountable task, to be sure), I began the aftermath of contemplating where I had gone wrong in my considerations. When I said I had felt they reciprocated my attraction only ...to a degree, I had dissuaded that uncertainty by thinking the other half was likely struggling with the same concerns that I had been. It couldnt be that they werent attracted to me, because you cant feel that kind of electricity with someone if the feelings are only one-sided...or can you? They claimed to feel it too. One-sided feelings of this distinction had never happened in my experience. If you feel a spark for someone, you can usually tell if they feel it back. Vibes dont lie. And then, amidst my depression over this hard-felt rejection, I questioned why I had thought that dating (or whatever bullshit word) a friend would be so enticing. I thought about how a person that already knows and loves you for you, well that might actually stand a chance of success. If other dating approaches Id used in the past had always failed, maybe this is why. The love in a friendship had been missing and was replaced with the excitement of getting to know someone new. That feeling of newness fades though, and then we have to decide if we love this person as a friend. It seems like double the work, doesnt it? In movies, arent we taught that friendships-turned-lovers make the best relationships, and the friend love always wins out over the new, seemingly more exciting person? But life doesnt always imitate art. However, I cant help but wonder: arent the the major factors in a successful relationship linked to attraction in soul, mind, and body? Like, in that order? Physical attraction is easy, low-hanging fruit...but a soul and mind connection? Thats far more rare. This must mean that one or more of these elements were missing in my equation, regardless of what I thought I felt or heard from the other half. Somebody was being less than truthful. The logical conclusion was that the other half did not feel physical attraction for me - or at least they didnt want to own their truth if they did. I say this because I am the opposite of what Ive seen the other half date or become attracted to. And I already know we have the soul-mind connection. So then the destructive, debilitating, self-loathing cycle begins. If someone who already knows and loves me cant find me, (soul, mind, AND body) attractive enough to appreciate everything that I am, why would a stranger? If only I were more (insert every insecurity under a magnifying glass), then they would want me. But if thats what it would take, would I still even want them? Our world seems to set unrealistic standards of perfection upon ordinary people. We are not physically perfect like movie stars, or as smart as Nobel prize winners, or as zen as Tibetan monks, but maybe we have hearts of gold and some of these other attributes? Why shouldnt that be enough? You know, I said the risk was monumental with a friend, and it is, but isnt it even more with a stranger? Maybe thats why so many relationships fail. Many people get together for shallow reasons and after getting to know the person, they find out that all they really had in common was physical attraction. Fleeting, subjective, ye of little depth, physical attraction. Weve been inundated with an idealistic aesthetic, taught that all you need to know about a person is what they look like and a few words that they write on Tinder, Bumble, or whatever app, and then we swipe right if were DTF - which is all that really matters, amiright? I shake my head in disappointment in this practice. Dont get me wrong, Ive been there and done that, but it might have been the emptiest, least satisfying, hollow times in my life. Fun for sure, but like beauty, fleeting. Bottom line: that life may be gratifying for a moment, but its lacking in real human connection and taking the value out of searching for that connection...but in the end, what we all really want (read: crave) is that real, meaningful connection. Whether or not we know it or acknowledge it, its our basic human urge. Connection. How can we find it?"

We have a lot in common as far as tastes in music and pop culture, and we send memes back and forth also. Its getting to the point where i cant tell if something is happening, or if its in my head. We talk about feelings often, checking in with each other, and getting artistic critiques. I know this is a common scenario, but when is it wise to take the leap of expressing feelings? Theres a lot that could go wrong, since our circle is small. When does shared vulnerability stop with friendship and topple over into romance? I guess my main question is, do you think spending every free moment with a friend and talking about feelings is more platonic or romantic? Talking about every feeling except the ones that apply to each other."

Naturally, I wanted to know more and researched on it. There was this one article written by the lover (M) of an avoidant (F). Despite the fact that they've been together for a long time, he said she never really opens up to him, she pushes him away, and it always leaves him wondering what he's doing wrong. I've realised that I don't want to do that to someone I love. Leave them wondering what's wrong with *them* when really it's me who has problems that need to be resolved. I know that I love them, but I don't know how to show it because I'm scared of being vulnerable and giving someone a piece of me I've never shown anyone else. &amp;#x200B; I guess another inspiration to change would be myself. My first ""boyfriend"" (If you could even consider him one) lasted 4 days. We spent many nights laughing about jokes that only he and I found funny, we talked about our fears, our past, what we want for our future and everything was good. until i started feeling trapped and uncomfortable because it was going too fast. He knew things about me that not even my closest friends knew and he listened to me cry on my kitchen floor in the middle of the night. In the morning I was scared, not because he was a bad boyfriend, but because he quite was the opposite. I called him and I told him that I can't be his girlfriend anymore, and that I need to be a ""free bird"". He got pretty upset, but texted me later saying it's only because he thought we were going so well. In the end we stopped talking. &amp;#x200B; In my next relationship, I want to preserve myself and set boundaries so I don't have to pull away from how deep everything is getting and make the other person feel like it's their fault.

Since then, Ive very rarely felt anything akin to a crush. In high school and college, Ive met like maybe 10 girls max whom I rationally reasoned I could be compatible with, mainly if I share their values and a bit about looks too, but Ive been told by multiple friends that doesnt count. Honestly, Im even doubting if my gr.5 crush was really anything beyond this girl is pretty. Everyone tells me that, yes you need to get to know the girl first, but once you like them, you will know for sure. Im not a ladys man, but I have my fair share of female friends, and I havent hit any sort of revelation as such. Lovers of Reddit, help me out, should I just keep doing what Im doing (just meeting people regularly in college and chatting)? Should I try mixers and online dating? Is this abnormal or have I already had crushes that I didnt realize were crushes? "
163,vulnerability,dating_advice,At what stage during the dating process do you begin to show your vulnerability?,1,b5wqhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/b5wqhg/at_what_stage_during_the_dating_process_do_you/,2019-03-27 10:07:25,"So, I've just realised that for someone who believes they live their life in as honest a fashion as possible, I'm actually not very good about opening up with my own issues. Let's look at the standard dating scenario I have: **1st date**: always goes well (I'm a salesman), there's bags to talk about, I listen and apply, I tell them interesting things about me. **2nd date:** almost becomes an extension of the first date. By the end, generic 'getting to know you' conversation is wearing thin, you plan for a third date that isn't sitting at a table talking, and maybe get a kiss. **3rd date:** my house or their house. Films that you invariably talk through. Maybe sex, whatever. By the end, left wondering where the emotional connection is, even if I really like them and want to see them again. **My question**: Is it me? As a male, should you be opening up more (showing your vulnerabilies at this stage) almost to show your deeper layers? Or is this seen as weak in the modern dating game? Bit of an open-ended question, but it's based around the fact that I want to get to know someone better before fully opening up. Whilst I feel girls see that I'm not fully opening up and therefore we're missing that 'emotional connection'. I want to see them again, they think we're incompatible, they jump back on Tinder and find another guy. Should I go balls out and echo her vulnerability at this stage, or keep to my instincts and hope she wants to see me again?"
164,vulnerability,dating_advice,I got an anonymous call about the guy I am currently seeing! Help!,0,b65j8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/b65j8e/i_got_an_anonymous_call_about_the_guy_i_am/,2019-03-28 02:12:45,"Hello everyone! So I have been talking to this guy for about 6 months and we really like each other. We haven't made it official yet but we do know that we like each other. The problem is we are kind of in a long distance dating scenario. He lives in a different country but in a country where my close family is present, so I travel there quite frequently. At least once in 3 months. So the only person I hang out with over there is this guy I am seeing. I love his friends too. He has an amazing set and I am glad I found him and a bunch of guys who really are an amazing gang. I am currently at work in Ireland. I have met him like around 12 times but we always text each other and talk on the phone. He kind of came into my life at a difficult time and was very supportive. I don't mean to sound cocky but I consider myself a very attractive person and I have been told so. You'll understand why I am mentioning this. &amp;#x200B; Problem started 2 weeks back when I received a call from a woman. She called me from a number that is from the same city I live in (Dublin, Ireland). As soon as I picked up the call, she said that she wants her identity to remain anonymous and that she called to give me an important information about this guy I am seeing. Let's just say the name of the guy I am seeing is Arun. She said Arun and his friend (Let's call him Sandeep) had schemed a plan to make me feel scared. The whole conversation went somewhat in these lines: &amp;#x200B; Anonymous Caller: ""Hi Sakshi, I cannot give you my name but I want to warn you about something. Do you know this guy called Arun?"" Me: ""Yes"" Anonymous Caller:""Do you know his best friend Sandeep?"" Me:""Yes"" Anonymous Caller:""Ok so recently my friend received a call from Arun and Sandeep. I was there and since the phone was connected to the music system, we were able to hear the entire conversation and my friend didn't bother to remove the phone and have a personal conversation"" Me:""Ok! What are you trying to tell me?"" Anonymous Caller:""Sandeep was asking my friend to note down a number and my friend asked me to note down the number. This happened to be your number and that's how I got a hold of your number. When my friend asked Sandeep why he had to note down this number, Sandeep responded by saying he needed a favour. Sandeep was asking my friend, if he can contact you anonymously and prank call you everyday for the next two weeks. He was literally asking my friend to call you and scare you for weeks. Trying to make it seem like someone is stalking you. He literally used the word stalking"" Me:""Ok? But why would Sandeep do that?"" Anonymous Caller:"" That's exactly what the people present in the room (including me) were thinking. I mean it started as a playful conversation. My friend was laughing and asking Sandeep why he would want to do something like that and why he couldn't do the prank himself. To this Sandeep responded by saying that the phone number that was needed to make these calls had to be a number from Dublin."" Me:""Ok again! Why would Sandeep want your friend to do something like that to me?"" Anonymous Caller:""Sandeep is very close to my friend. Apparently the guy you're seeing, Arun, has asked Sandeep to ask my friend to call you and scare you for a week. Then Arun took over the phone call and spoke brutally to my friend. He said that you're a lot of work and that he really wanted to get you in bed. Since he was going to meet you in a week, he thought if someone can scare you and make you feel scared, you would constantly talk to him and he would support you and console you. Then eventually when you meet him, he can use your vulnerability, console you and see if something intimate can happen between the two of you. End of the day you will end up trusting him more than anyone else. This was his stupid plan."" Me:""Ok first off! I don't believe you. Second off, why would you even care"" Anonymous Caller:""Look I don't give a rat's ass about whose partner is doing what to whom. I just thought what this Arun guy was trying to pull off with you was really shady and downright creepy. Why would someone try to scare a woman who is already alone in a country she is just getting used to? Just so that he can have an intimate moment with you? First off it sounded like a stupid plan but more than that like I said, it was downright shady."" Me:""Ok but why do you bother to let me know?"" Anonymous Caller:""I don't care and it's none of my business. My friend obviously refused to do this favour and Arun was kind of mad about it in the end. Then Sandeep and my friend spoke for sometime about how stupid this plan was and Sandeep agreed too. Sandeep said that Arun was adamant. Said Arun believed that this plan would help him get close and intimate with you. Personally, I don't give a fuck but I was thinking what if they got someone else to do it and you're actually getting freaked out after receiving anonymous calls everyday. End of the day you're a fellow woman. If you're getting these calls, know that it's your friend Arun who is behind it and don't panic thinking someone is following you or stalking you"" Me:""I still don't believe you. Why would you care?"" Anonymous Caller:""First off I care cuz this is not normal behaviour towards any woman. Second of all I was wondering if you were actually receiving these anonymous calls and freaking out thinking if you were being stalked. As a woman, how can I not warn you?"" Me:""Why are you anonymous then?"" Anonymous Caller:""If I give you my name, it would take a split second for you to take this issue to Arun and Sandeep and they would inturn contact my friend and find out who I am. I don't want that exposure. Just take care of yourself. I just wanted to warn and let you know that these fools are trying to scare you and that you have nothing to be afraid of. Me:""I haven't received any calls"" Anonymous Caller:""good for you. Anyways, I warned you and now you know. If you don't believe me, confronting them won't help either. They will deny it to the core. You can try talking to Sandeep however. But I doubt if he would rat on his friend"" Me:""I won't believe you unless you give me your name"" Anonymous Caller:""I wish, but it is already easy for you to take this matter to Arun and Sandeep and find out who I am. The last thing I would do is to give you my name directly. Believe or don't believe Just take care. I gotta go, bye"" &amp;#x200B; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ So what do you guys think about this? I really like this guy and I am indeed meeting him in a week. Some information: Sandeep did work in Ireland until last year. So he obviously has friends here. I have met Sandeep through Arun. But if this woman's claims are true, isn't what Arun did or tried to do to me a big red flag? Help people :/ &amp;#x200B;"
165,vulnerability,dating_advice,"Never dated before, thinking about trying it; advice? [29 M]",1,b7iuv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/b7iuv5/never_dated_before_thinking_about_trying_it/,2019-03-31 13:15:17," So, I've never been on a date. Never even tried; the lack of experience in related pursuits is implicit. Im going to be 30 in a couple of months, and Im starting to think that I should try this stuff out before Im past my prime. I kind of feel like Im at a crossroads, because if I continue along the same path, it seems like Ill never have time for dating. I didnt get into dating as a teenager because I was overweight and had poor hygiene, and I spent all my time and money on gaming. In my mid-twenties, I got in shape, slowly got out of gaming, and started taking better care of myself. The amount of attention I suddenly started receiving from women was astonishing, but I wasn't sure what to do about it. This is partly because I am somewhat neurodivergent, and I struggle with anxiety and body image problems. I have attention deficit disorder, and I might be on the lower end of ASD. I dont pick up on certain social cues very well, especially flirting (although I cant tell if this is lack of practice or ASD). The anxiety/body image problems stem from being bullied a lot over my weight when I was younger, and now Ive developed intense anxiety over any situation where I perceive myself as physically vulnerable. Girls and guys both made fun of me for staying away from dating, and I ended up assuming that I wasnt allowed to be interested in girls, because I was fat and ugly. Despite the fact that Im physically healthy and Im probably physically attractive enough to get a date, my poor self-esteem and lack of confidence in my appearance make me feel like Im never going to be good enough. So I have a really hard time opening up to anybody, and Im very critical of my appearance, even though the criticism is probably unfounded. At the same time, Im also trying to finish my undergrad degree, and I'm spending my summer in Borneo for an internship. So Im finally considering giving dating a chance, but I'm so busy these days that Im not sure Id be able to invest enough time in dating, and I absolutely cant let it get in the way of school. Ive dabbled in Tinder and OkCupid over the last year, but Im lost about how to interpret interactions with other people in this context; the two instances where I was close to getting a date both fizzled. Its probably worth mentioning that I don't like bars or parties, and I don't drink much, so ideas involving parties/drinking arent going to work. Id try Bumble, except it seems a bit pointless to do that when Im about to be out of the country for three months. So, with that information out of the way, I have some more specific questions: \- Should I avoid getting into this stuff until I get back from Borneo? I dont know if Id have time to get started before I leave, and then I dont know if the fact that Id be gone for months would be a deal breaker that early on. \- Is there anyone else here who is more emotionally independent who has been in a serious relationship? Was it worthwhile, or did you feel bogged down? \- What if Im more direct about my lack of experience? Is this a bad idea? I do much better with direct, honest communication. \- How should I communicate that I might need to take things slow? My problems with vulnerability definitely extend to physical intimacy, so Id probably not be looking to jump into sex as quickly as other guys."
166,vulnerability,dating_advice,Is it me or is this overwhelmingly artificial? [Rant] [22M],8,b7yozw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/b7yozw/is_it_me_or_is_this_overwhelmingly_artificial/,2019-04-01 17:56:38,"Context: I am an undergraduate in university right now. &amp;#x200B; I don't always hold this disposition, but sometimes I feel like dating is so surface level and meaningless. Any time I have an interaction with a girl or I see a friend have one there are all of these ""rules"" and behaviors that we have to watch out for. Don't say this, don't do that, watch your body language, watch your tone, dress like this, don't mention that until this point in time, etc. And it's so easy for people to get ghosted and ignored now that the slightest mishap seems to result in an immediate irreversible annihilation of potential connection. This gives the overall sensation of a dark and heavy blanket of oppressive judgment. I've got to be careful not to be myself or I'll break some arbitrary rule or convention because screw authenticity or genuine spontaneity. Oh no, let's replace all that with a rote and monotonous repetition of the same acceptable ways of going about initiating human connection like blind marionettes. Same profiles, same memes, same self-deprecating humor to break the ice. In terms of motivation, it feels like soulless conformity has taken priority over genuine feeling. Where is the acceptance of people? Why are we so insistent on putting up all of these hurdles for other people to jump over? &amp;#x200B; People are weird bags of cells and there is a beauty in that. None of it however shows in this culture and it seems like it doesn't want anything to do with that kind of vulnerability. That seems sad to me. There is so much potential for human connection and for minds (and bodies) to meet but we're so, so quick to resist until things are juuuuuust ""right"". &amp;#x200B; Maybe it's because we have so many options now due to the internet that our standards have risen to the point where we're only concerned with secondary qualities that don't even track the true function of dating? &amp;#x200B; Sorry for the conjectural rant.

My flat mate invited me to join him at sorta like an after work drinks thing near his office. I met him at the bar. He introduced me to a few colleagues of his. A lot of women either came to him to tell him how attractive I am. Or they said it straight to my face. I got a bit uncomfortable from the attention, so we decided to leave, while leaving the bar we meet another colleague of his, to whom he introduces me. She is quite hot like probably the hottest one there. This is how the conversation goes Her: ""Ooh I don't think we have met?"" Her: ""But you are too young"" Her: ""I am much older than you, but you know with age comes experience"" Her: ""I would love to show you a good time one of these evenings"" Me: ""it was nice meeting you, I have to leave now"" Her: ""You are scared of me"" I start to leave but hug her, she kisses my cheek then starts kissing me properly. She is already quite drunk, she is all over me. I realise she is quite drunk and there are creepy guys lurking around. I take her home and drop her, we make out on her sofa, she strips and asks me to bang her. I tell her after she has some food and water in her i will have sex with her, I get her some food, and water and she asks me not leave her tonight, I make sure she is alseep and leave (my flatmate didn't have keys to our flat). We didn't have sex. She was way too drunk. I get her number from my friend text her asking her to cancel her cards as soon as she wakes up since she lost her wallet in her hurry to get me back to her place and she was unwilling to look for it. She just wanted me back at her place. Next week we plan to get dinner this weekend, we have an extremely fun night. She constantly keeps telling me how much she likes me. How she wants to meet me again etc. We get to her place we make out, she says she hasn't had sex in a long long time ever since she broke up with her ex last year. She says it's like losing her virginity all over again. She says she breaks people she is a bit scared to have sex with me. I wasn't feeling like having sex (that is my problem, I rarely want to have sex). I tell her that. We just strip and go to sleep, she keeps grinding her ass to my dick (I was in my underwear, and she was naked). I leave in the morning. I ask her after one day if she wants to meet up. She says she can't. I ask whether she is busy or not interested. She says she is busy. Then I ask her if she is free on Tuesday. She then sends me a long message saying I am really really great guy and we had an insanely fun date. But I am way too young for her and she likes older men. I tell her I prefer older women and I would like to meet her again if she is into it. She said she is sorry but she thought we didn't click. She and I want different things and are at different stages of life. I mean a rational headed me can understand that. But right now I am hurting so bad. I made my self vulnerable by telling her I like her, and showing interest to meet again. Usually I just wait for the girl to text me and arrange subsequent meetups. This time I texted to make plans, showed interest. And like many times before everytime I have asked anyone out or shown interest or any slight bit of vulnerability I have been rejected. I thought that is how I am supposed to form real connections. But it has been the exact opposite for me. "

We have been together for 4 years now, but honestly the first year of our relationship wasnt good. We started dating when we were in high school and I was 15 (sophomore year). Things went well until he graduated. My parents were very strict about who I hung out with especially if it was a guy, and the fact that he was a few years older than me didnt help. This made it hard for us to hangout in person, and when we did we were being watched all the time. So a majority of our relationship was texting based after him graduating. I used to be emotionally abusive and always putting me down for things that werent my fault. Making me feel guilty for wanting to do things and have friends. Eventually I had cut off all of my friends because I wanted to make him happy and was hoping that would solve our arguing problems. It didnt. My junior and senior year of high school was some of the worst times of my life because of this. I would try to talk to him and tell him how I was feeling but he would always turn it on me somehow and blame me for the things that were happening. Fast forward to the beginning of my first year of college. I decided to move in with him. During this time the abuse slowly decreased and eventually became a rare thing. We lived in his parents house that whole school year and things were okay. A bulk of our arguments were stemmed from his family and the pressure they were putting on him (he was working in a family business) but it still didnt make his actions okay. I was never physically abused. The end of my first year of college we decided to move out and get our own place. He quit the family business and we moved into our own apartment. Things now are way better than they used to be. We communicate so much better and I feel like we are finally on the same page. It has been at least one year since the emotional abuse has stopped completely. I love this man but I am still having a hard time letting go of how he made me feel back then. It was the lowest point of my life. In all honesty it was a point of my life I wish I could forget. I have so much more confidence and certainty now and we have both grown so much since then. I Express how I feel and am open about my emotions as is he. We work together to try and solve issues instead of arguing which gets us nowhere. I try not to hold these things against him and i never bring them up during an argument, he has shown me that he is sorry for how he acted towards me and he has improved so much. I hope one day I can get to the point of maybe marrying him, but I know I wont ever be able to have that sense of vulnerability unless I let it go. I now feel we are finally partners. How do i forgive him / let it go?"

I mean, hes super educated, worldly, amazingly hot yet seemingly humble, great taste in music, can cook, an intellectual... Like I'm trying not to fall in love here. The date was going so well. Eventually, we moved into the sexy portion of the date.. again, going well and far exceeding my expectations. And then... He says he forgot condoms. The casual way he said it suggested that he didn't forget and this is something he habitually does. I'm already hyper aware of STD's +pregnancy risks...so unprotected sex is way out of the question regardless how hot I am for somebody. He kept insisting we do it raw. Btw, at this point I had already asked him when he had sex last and covertly ""hand-inspected"" his penis for any weirdness. He had sex 2 weeks prior so it's possible he regularly has unprotected sex for hook Ups (he's super hot &amp; could probably coerce some women to do this). I said I don't take contraception to which he respondents with a hearty laugh &amp; reassured me he would never cum inside me. Neither of us have kids... He's doing his masters in uni... I would think he knows better than to believe pulling out is an effective method of birth control. This was such a turn off. We cooled off, slept and he tried to sneak out without saying goodbye and was polite yet dry towards me. I will say I was a bit of a messy drunk so I could understand him being annoyed but I have a feeling it has much more to do with his ""blue balls"" :( Sadly enough, the last time I met a guy off a dating site a year and a half ago, we fell hard for each other and started dating. I waited a month to fuck him &amp; then he too was over the top pressuring me to have sex without condom. Another educated, ambitious, successful man who also had a child yet was so frivolous about having unprotected sex with me (also aware I didnt take contraception.) I just wanna know, am I right to view this as a huge red flag? Sure sex feels great without condom but it's not worth the risks. I can't comprehend how tinder guy wouldn't bring condoms with him or keep in his car. Is it possible for him to be this amazing guy with all these great qualities I've been looking for AND also be a disgusting pig raw dogging girls all over the city without even the slightest concern? Is this understandably a huge red flag and a dealbreaker or am I overexaggerating? Simple solution of course, if he actually did want to see me again, is to have condoms ready so that issue doesnt even arise but the point would still remain - like how are you cool with risking catching an std or an unplanned baby with a random tinder hook up. I'm not sure whether to be flattered or offended that he's so eager to take those risks with me. Or maybe this is just how dating is now with 29 year olds and it has nothing to do with the guy's view of you or how good your p*s$y is. Please help me understand the male point of view. I will note that I'm half black and both guys mentioned are black. Maybe that shouldn't make a difference but I've only ever dated black men and although I'm used to having the no-condom discussion with a long term bf, I'm just so out of the loop with what's normal in the dating world now and the harsh reality of a what could've potentially blossomed into an ongoing fwb or casual companionship just do a 180 &amp; try to make a clean run for it. Just hours before he was telling me all the activities we could do together here and in the next city. Sigh *face palm*. Just to be clear, I don't regret having him over it was fun, we didn't fuck thank goodness but I didn't think it would be a one time thing and that sux. I sent him a message a few hours after he left this morning so I could leaving the door open for us to see each other again.. No surprise that he didnt respond (I'm pretty sure in my drunken state I bitched him out a little bit for encouraging us to raw dogg it). But I still want to resolve my feelings or at least get input.. if it's worth it I am willing to show my vulnerability and hit him up later down the road to see if hes willing to chill again without the extra booze and obviously condoms nearby. I haven't felt this way about anyone in a long time but just cuz it feels good this red flag could mean hes so wrong for me anyway I'm ok with frank straightforward painful comments as long as it's genuine &amp; constructive feedback.. No jokes please. Please don't make me feel bad about the hook up cuz I've literally had sex once since November "

If I do that, I've lost my own moral compass. I've met colorful stories, and to be fair, also some amazing women who truly made an effort and lifted up my shattered confidence. For the life of me, I cannot secure a third date. Getting to second date is like a roll of the dice, a weighted one at best. Half the dates respond back and say they had an amazing time. A full third say it was the best first date they have ever had. I plan great first dates, low key, but interesting, and it shows from their smiles and laughs. Yet I can't seem to get someone interested in me longer than one or two dates, despite any and all efforts. Today was the third girl in a row (few weeks apart) where I thought things were going well, I dare to get my hopes up, think there could be potential here, lots of common ground, both sides are making an effort, looking for similar things. Only to get home and get that long text detailing how it's not me, it's her. I suppose I should be thankful that she engaged me in conversation telling me exactly how she wasn't ready, rather than the usual ghost.

For what it's worth, I believe her Three times in a row this pattern has repeated where I like the girl, I think it's going well, see a glimmer of hope, only to find out SPLAT. I'm honestly beginning to question myself and my confidence, what little I've managed to rebuild. I'm sticking to my workout and training routine. Can't let this get to me. But it hurts.

I think vulnerability and trust are integral to a LTR Im looking for, but do these kinds of deep conversations/topics early on seem like theyd kill LTR potential? Thanks for any insight.. "

He occasionally sends me dick pics, sometimes through Snapchat and sometimes through text. I noticed that one of the pictures he sent dates back almost a year ago and Im honestly kinda hurt, even though I feel like I shouldnt worry about it. For me at least, the entire point of nudes is that theyre taken with a specific person in mind, and its a shared vulnerability between two people. Seeing a dick pic dating back 9 months obviously means it wasnt for me, so at that point it might as well be anyones dick and I dont care to see it. I feel silly for being upset, but its kind of insulting and it feels like he doesnt care enough/like me enough to send me a dick pic meant for me with me in mind. Am I overreacting? "

I know that she isnt intending to trigger me on purpose, you live and you learn, i just have a really hard time speaking up due to my past abuse. i love her sense of humor, but now that im becoming vulnerable around someone again my triggers get tripped unannounced, and sometimes in an overreacting manner due to my mental illness at times. normally i can tell when im becoming triggered and can use mindfulness to control what i can within my environment. but trying to play it cool while being vulnerable, im realizing the extent of some of my abuse and how that is hindering my comfortability within vulnerability. we had a conversation once. she asked before she asked me to be her partner what i thought of her. i told her she was awesome , asked her what she thought. she said the same of me and said she can tell that i get super extra anxious, and that sometimes she just wish she knew how to calm me down to help me not worry so much, but acknowledged that it is something we have to work on, on our own. so now that im realizing this, ive been getting help again, but im wondering is my trauma something i should bring up to my partner? she knows of some of the things ive been through to lead to my ptsd, but i had a conversation with a good friend who told me i have a huge tendency to overshare things with people as if theyre my therapist and i dont want to give off that vibe to my partner. Is this something i should bring up? or should i just mention my triggers? TL; DR - My partner is very supportive of me, but i think im becoming insecure about my mental illness. she sometimes unintentionally triggers me, and i feel i might need to explain to her my triggers/past trauma to give context to when i am triggered. how would i go about this? should explain these triggers and past abuse to her?"

Never had that before, and I guess that's how I caught feelings. Maybe it was how open and accepting he was. Or how he spoke so fondly of his grandparents. Or the way he knew exactly when to be serious and when to have a good laugh. Or how his voice got really gentle when he touched sensitive topics. I don't know tbh. It was all too strange for my brain to process. First guy I ever confessed to. It was strange and I still can't understand it/us/him.

I'm not unattractive, I get good grades in university, am fairly independent and have friends. I've been backpacking independently in youth hostels Asia and Europe, have gone back to males' houses after nights out etc but the only intimate relations I've had have been with people I don't know and under the influence of alcohol. I'm not particularly bothered about having a special experience for losing my virginity as it hasn't happened by this point and it feels as if I have never had a very enjoyable time with the people I've been with anyway. When attempting to date I last one or two dates before freaking out before the third date and ghosting the person because I am so scared of getting hurt and letting someone in. I have just done this again to a really lovely boy who has been nothing but kind to me. I feel so horrible about treating people this way and causing pain but I don't know how to stop it. I want to have a relationship as I think at 20 years old it becomes odd if you have not had sex/long term relationships however if I am going to hurt people like this it's not far for me to try and date anyone. My theory is it has something to do with a fear of vulnerability/men/turning people away when they find out things about me. My father committed suicide when I was a teenager and I was the only one in my family who wasn't speaking to him at the time, he also told me that if anything was to happen to him it would be my fault. Since then I have not had any significant male figures in my life however I do have guy friends. I also don't know if this is to do with low self esteem but I just was wondering if anyone knew what to do to overcome sabotaging relationships? I had therapy for 3 years after my father's death and am reluctant to go back. Thank you so much in advance and sorry for the ramble. "

Your thoughts?,1,af8kfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/af8kfy/against_conventional_dating_wisdom_your_thoughts/,2019-01-13 02:54:08,"There are a lot of sources online, and even a lot of comments on Reddit, which have described a relationship as a friendship with a spark, or a sexual interest. Ive read that the reason someone rejects you as a relationship partner and offers you friendship is because they werent sexually attracted to you. There are some people who claim to know tricks to make others sexually attracted to you. I dont know why, but I dont agree with any of this. When one of my friends comes up to me and tells me that they have feelings for me, I feel extremely honoured, especially if I really enjoy their company. I always consider it a gift, that someone has placed me in a very high regard. Even if I didnt immediately feel a spark (and a lot of times, I have!), I have always given them a chance. I have gone out on dates with them. It has happened twice till now, and sure it didnt work out both times for different reasons. In one of them, we actually had a couple of really fun days together (even though I had not felt a spark initially), but I had to go on an exchange semester the next day, so we didnt really continue with it. When I came back, she had a boyfriend who she really liked (good for her!). In the long run, the spark is going to fade. For sure. The kind of sex you want to have where you rip each others clothes off will fade. And if your partner becomes less physically attractive at the time, will you end it? Not me. Ive realised that were extremely good at fantasising. We do it for the people were in love with. Why not for the ones who are in love with us? Thats what the spark is in my head, and it can be built. It just takes some mental effort. I dont think of it as friendship with sex, I think of it as vulnerability and intimacy. Comfort and safety. Thats what I see in my parents relationship. Had an arranged marriage - but they couldnt be more in love 25 years into it. I know Im 21, but thats just the way it is in my head. I know a lot of you disagree with me. Im very very open to changing my opinion, and Id love to hear what every one of you think of it. "

The dates have all been pretty long too which I think makes a difference and I wasn't planning to sleep over but it was the best for the situation and felt right. But, I've met one of his flat mates and if I say things about the future he see's himself there I think, eg I said I was having an injection and I get people to come with me incase I faint and he said he would if he was free, this is in a few months. I said to him to not plan for longer than you've been together. We stayed up till 6am talking and cuddling quite romantically and I feel like maybe we both overshared a bit?

This is fine if you have experience and you get good feedback and all that. But for those who are new to it all, maybe you just got into shape, or you're young, or you had a rough time recently, whatever it is... don't ""fake it 'til you make it"" I understand that the pressure is uncomfortable and you want to fit in with what seems to be in demand. But don't. Please. It's so beautiful when you meet someone new and they don't know what to do or how to act in the bedroom. And the journey to opening them up and teaching them and exploring their sexuality with them... it's one of the greatest bonding experiences two people can go through, in my opinion. And it's so hot. Cause it's so slow and tense and intimate. I'm saying this as a woman, that I value men and women who have little experience. I enjoy reliving all my firsts and sharing yours with you. If you pretend to be experienced when you are not, and you speed through a fling just to get it out of the way, or to get back into practice, not only is it disrespectful and painful for the other person, it's also robbing yourself of a gentle and caring relationship that can have so many deep and emotionally nourishing levels. And you're robbing the other person too. They're dating you because they like you and they want to get to know you (in most cases). By faking it you hide yourself and your vulnerability Sex is about being vulnerable to someone. That's what makes it exciting. The trust. And that's what makes you special if you're inexperienced. That vulnerability is so much more intense, and that trust means so much more. So trust the people you date. (And if you can't trust them then don't date them) Tell them you don't really know what you're doing and you'd like them to teach you. Be humble and receptive and learn. Put your cards on the table and be yourself. It's not pathetic, it's honestly very sexy. It doesn't make you less of a man or woman, if anything it makes you more of one Peace out and good luck on the field"

Got it tattooed on our arms. We would talk all the time and I think that what made our relationship so real was that we were so vulnerable with each other. We trusted each other. It felt too natural for it to be fake. One thing to notice is that she has always been a loner. She has always been alone, so me coming was almost like a breathe of fresh air, like something she hadnt had but knew she wanted you know? And vice verse with her. We had our ups and downs, highs and lows, but we both knew we loved each other. We both knew we wanted to be together and we both knew we would end up together. But the one day I messed up. She broke up with me. That wasnt the part thats hurting because she can do that. We can work on being better. We can fight and get back together, but this time was different. We broke up, and she didnt speak to me. She didnt call me, she didnt text me, she didnt anything. Then she told me she was with another guy. We went out on two dates and she said she feels nothing now. Nothing at all. I tried to convince her theyre still there and shes repressing them, but shes convinced. She says she doesnt love me anymore. I want to take time from her but I know shes not happy (about something) from texting her yesterday. I was going to meet up with her later today to talk to her about it, and hope that she remembers that this is what made her fall for me in the first place. The vulnerability we both have never been able to feel before. I honestly want to know if this is a bad idea. Should I just forget her? Is it time?

Ive been rated as average , very average especially since Ive become *skinny fat* , this doesnt seem to be a problem if I want to get laid , which I never do because I only fuck people I love and that love me back (aka Im celibate) The problem is these dudes will state that they are also looking for something monogamous , buy me gifts , say sweet cute things to me and tell me about their deepest personal things very early on ... they fake vulnerability or so it seems .... but end up pushing me away within one or two weeks conveniently around the time they realize Im serious about not fucking someone Im not sure is reciprocating feelings ! One time I was lead on for 2 years so I learned my lesson. Im not easily manipulated , but I am very hurt nonetheless . The last guy I dated , took a while to get the truth out but he basically said he needed to stop seeing me because he was *falling for me* and that he wasnt expecting that ... then said he thought I was cute but my  *beauty didnt necessarily move him *  , that he wanted to explore and learn to be on his own . This hurt me because he first presented himself as someone not looking for a fuck friend , yet was essentially fuck zoning me .

I leave sex for later but it is palpable that Im just as pervy as anyone else , so I dont give off asexual boring vibes ! I like to make my men feel special and am a good conversationalist , Im getting back in shape because Im naturally supposed to be quite skinny . I guess my question is what could be the issue here ? Is this completely in my control ? Is the tinder / ok Cupid / pof dating pool a terrible micro society full of the wrong people for me ? Am I too self deprecating? Too needy? Is this just a societal issue rather than a personal thing with me ? I think if men are playing a game where they have a script they use to try and make me have sex with them , its only fair that I should also learn some specific guidelines as to what not to do , what not to be or what do do and be so I can put all the chance on my side !

I sincerely apologize for how long this is, but I wanted to get everything out as its been weighing on me. I matched with this guy on Tinder roughly two weeks ago. Although our first date had to be rescheduled, we eventually met up a week after matching and had pizza, and then progressed to coffee and drinks. I had a wonderful time with him. Despite him being somewhat reserved and quite at times, the conversation flowed fairly well. He asked really great questions, but one that stuck with me that first night was, Where do you see yourself in five to ten years?. Ive been on countless dates before, and Ive never had a man ask me that kind of long-ended question so to speak, so that was a nice sign for me. Towards the end of the night he asked me if I wanted to kiss and I enthusiastically said yes, to which we kissed, both smiling, only for him to smirk and say, one more. We left, scheduling our original plans for the upcoming weekend. The day after our first date, I was itching to see him again so asked if he would like to get drinks after work. He said Sure, what time? and we scheduled it for the next day. On the day of our second proposed date, I told him I wasnt feeling well yet still wanted to see him. I offered going to his place to simply relax and get to know each other over tea and he was completely okay with it. Before leaving I let him know of my intentions of not having sex until Im in a committed relationship and that I move slow physically and he was completely receptive of that fact and respected it, saying, We can move at a pace thats comfortable for you. Im in no hurry. I get to his place that night, we drink tea, have another nice conversation, and then relaxed for a bit, played some video games, and then laid on his bed and just talked. He told me bits and pieces of his past, and I told him mine. I then asked him, What are you looking for? and he responded with, I dont know, truthfully. Immediately, that would send red flags off in my mind, but that changed once he started explaining. He explained how he doesnt like setting up expectations for things, relationships, friendships, whatever it may be, because, to him it feels forced and unorganic. He said he didnt like going into something or someone having an expectation of what it should be knowing that the person maynt be right for him, etc. And although he didnt say this, looking back knowing how our third date went (which Ill mention in a moment), I feel it possibly is also tied to a fear of rejection/being vulnerable and emotional with someone. After explaining further, he then asked me, How do you see a relationship working in your future? What do you see it becoming? What are you expecting out of someone?... etc. It was then after that, that I came to understand his reasoning and was okay with it. We finished our second date with a kiss and kept our tentative weekend plans. The weekend comes around, and we find ourselves getting coffee, quietly walking through art museums, and getting food to-go to relax back at his apartment. This is then when things began to surface. After eating food, talking, and eventually cuddling and taking a short nap together, we wake up and start making out, which obviously led to more physical things but he was completely respectful of my boundaries and of us not having sex. It honestly a lot of fun and, atleast to me, the physical/sexual chemistry we had was electric and easy. Once we took a pause, I asked him if he liked me, and he told me he did. I then asked him (which Im now realizing was a niave and immature move on my part), if he saw this going anywhere and he replied, Its too early to tell. We laid in silence for a bit next to each other. Our pinky fingers intertwined. And, I began to cry. For some reason I couldnt help but be emotional because being physical with someone is difficult for me due to past physical/sexual abuse and he knew that. He asked me what was wrong, held me, comforted me, and kissed me. Eventually I told him. I told him it was difficult for me, and that its scary to me how Im feeling something for him, how Im opening myself up to be vulnerable, and how Im afraid of being hurt. He held me and told me to not worry and that he understood it was difficult. He told me that I shouldnt worry, that I shouldnt worry about being strung along or lead on and he apologized if he made me feel that way. I then noticed that as we laid silent next to each other after that, he experienced a tremor, brief, but several after the fact. I was worried about him and asked if he was okay, and he said, This just happens to me when feel emotional or helpless in a situation, I havent experienced this in a long time. I gave him some space, let him breathe and he eventually felt better and apologized that I had to see that. I told him it was all right, and we eventually moved forward and became physical again that night. If anything, it felt a bit more intense after that moment. We held hands at moments, kissed, etc. Yet, later, during all of the physicality of it all, he told me he liked me again, he put his hand on my chest and said he could feel my heartbeat, which only made me melt a bit and so in return I laid down with my head against his chest to hear his. We laid there silent for a bit, only for him to say, Youre very emotional and intimate when your physical with someone. I agreed, which lead to yet another intimate conversation that night. He told me how hes afraid of being vulnerable and intimate with someone, and how hes afraid of being hurt again knowing his past, how hes always cautious about things like these. He told me hes afraid of being in a, or putting himself in that position of being a relationship because hes worried of what could happen if it goes wrong. He has a guard up. He then said, I mean, if we were to be in a relationship, how would that work if/when you had to move away knowing your future plans? And we talked more concerning that. He told me he felt sad often, and that he works towards not feeling that way, but, being emotional forces him to feel that, which is why he often tries to keep a neutral temper. I told him a bit about how things would work if we were to ever be in that situation, but simply stated, time will tell and left it at that. Once we lingered back to how, at times, he feels sad around me, I asked him, despite not wanting to, So do you want me to not be around anymore? Would that help? Should I just not be in the picture? And he simply said, I dont know. We then laid quietly next to each other, and he began to experience the tremors again, and I simply just held his hands, his holding mine tighter and we laid there till I had to leave. Before leaving, he took me to my car, gave me a hug, with his hand on my head and left rather quietly, saying, Drive safe. On the way home, I was emotionally shaken. It used to take me weeks, months, to even get to the point of admitting anything I had to him, even longer just to be physically intimate with someone. And, for me, being physical is intertwined with an emotional connection with someone. I couldnt help but be stuck with this heavy, sickening feeling as I drove home, thinking, This might be it. This might be the last time I see him. I drove to the side of the highway and texted him. I said, You don't need to answer this tonight, but as much as I would love to not have to say this because of what I feel about you, I have to say it. If you don't want me to be around anymore, please let me know. Otherwise, if you'd like to keep seeing each other, let me know the next time your free and we can figure something out. I'm sorry for making you sad. A moment later, I recieved a text back saying, I want to see you again. Ill let you know when. I dont know why I spent this time typing this out tonight, but, Im new to this, and I want to handle this right, and I need some sincere advice on the situation on possibly whats going through his head through all of this. Has anyone here ever experienced problems with intimacy, vulnerability, etc. ? Can anyone shed any light on the situation and whether if he actually sees a possibility with me? Because unfortunately, Im all ready somewhat emotionally invested, and Im trying hard to not become more attatched and would love some advice. Thank you. TL;DR : Ive been seeing this guy for about three dates so far. The most recent two became emotional quickly in a way I wasnt anticipating. He revealed he has difficulty being emotionally vulnerable and having his guard down. I want to keep seeing him because I see a potential in this, but, Im afraid. Any advice?"

Im sincerely sorry for this being a long read, I just wanted to have everything laid out. I matched with this guy on Tinder roughly two weeks ago. Although our first date had to be rescheduled, we eventually met up a week after matching and had pizza, and then progressed to coffee and drinks. I had a wonderful time with him. Despite him being somewhat reserved and quite at times, the conversation flowed fairly well. He asked really great questions, but one that stuck with me that first night was, Where do you see yourself in five to ten years?. Ive been on countless dates before, and Ive never had a man ask me that kind of long-ended question so to speak, so that was a nice sign for me. Towards the end of the night he asked me if I wanted to kiss and I enthusiastically said yes, to which we kissed, both smiling, only for him to smirk and say, one more. We left, scheduling our original plans for the upcoming weekend. The day after our first date, I was itching to see him again so asked if he would like to get drinks after work. He said Sure, what time? and we scheduled it for the next day. On the day of our second proposed date, I told him I wasnt feeling well yet still wanted to see him. I offered going to his place to simply relax and get to know each other over tea and he was completely okay with it. Before leaving I let him know of my intentions of not having sex until Im in a committed relationship and that I move slow physically and he was completely receptive of that fact and respected it, saying, We can move at a pace thats comfortable for you. Im in no hurry. I get to his place that night, we drink tea, have another nice conversation, and then relaxed for a bit, played some video games, and then laid on his bed and just talked. He told me bits and pieces of his past, and I told him mine. I then asked him, What are you looking for? and he responded with, I dont know, truthfully. Immediately, that would send red flags off in my mind, but that changed once he started explaining. He explained how he doesnt like setting up expectations for things, relationships, friendships, whatever it may be, because, to him it feels forced and unorganic. He said he didnt like going into something or someone having an expectation of what it should be knowing that the person maynt be right for him, etc. And although he didnt say this, looking back knowing how our third date went (which Ill mention in a moment), I feel it possibly is also tied to a fear of rejection/being vulnerable and emotional with someone. After explaining further, he then asked me, How do you see a relationship working in your future? What do you see it becoming? What are you expecting out of someone?... etc. It was then after that, that I came to understand his reasoning and was okay with it. We finished our second date with a kiss and kept our tentative weekend plans. The weekend comes around, and we find ourselves getting coffee, quietly walking through art museums, and getting food to-go to relax back at his apartment. This is then when things began to surface. After eating food, talking, and eventually cuddling and taking a short nap together, we wake up and start making out, which obviously led to more physical things but he was completely respectful of my boundaries and of us not having sex. It honestly was a lot of fun and, atleast to me, the physical/sexual chemistry we had was electric and easy. Once we took a pause, I asked him if he liked me, and he told me he did. I then asked him (which Im now realizing was a niave and immature move on my part), if he saw this going anywhere and he replied, Its too early to tell. We laid in silence for a bit next to each other. Our pinky fingers intertwined. And, I began to cry. For some reason I couldnt help but be emotional because being physical with someone is difficult for me due to past physical/sexual abuse and he knew that. He asked me what was wrong, held me, comforted me, and kissed me. Eventually I told him. I told him it was difficult for me, and that its scary to me how Im feeling something for him, how Im opening myself up to be vulnerable, and how Im afraid of being hurt. He held me and told me to not worry and that he understood it was difficult. He told me that I shouldnt worry, that I shouldnt worry about being strung along or lead on and he apologized if he made me feel that way. I then noticed that as we laid silent next to each other after that, he experienced a tremor, brief, but several after the fact. I was worried about him and asked if he was okay, and he said, This just happens to me when feel emotional or helpless in a situation, I havent experienced this in a long time. I gave him some space, let him breathe and he eventually felt better and apologized that I had to see that. I told him it was all right, and we eventually moved forward and became physical again that night. If anything, it felt a bit more intense after that moment. We held hands at moments, kissed, etc. Yet, later, during all of the physicality of it all, he told me he liked me again, he put his hand on my chest and said he could feel my heartbeat, which only made me melt a bit and so in return I laid down with my head against his chest to hear his.

190,vulnerability,dating_advice,What kind of situation is this?!,1,9yesph,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9yesph/what_kind_of_situation_is_this/,2018-11-19 19:03:01," Bare with me but this is a bizarre story time that I want to get opinions on: I (19) matched with a pretty charming med student last month through Bumble. After bantering a bit, he simply just sends a message of his # on the same night we matched. I didnt bother texting him til the next evening. Through this first text exchange, I was so upfront about what I wanted, to hookup. He was quite receptive and probably surprised bc not many girls know exactly what they want. We met up for coffee over the weekend, nothing intimate happened at all. It just wasnt the right mood/situation. I didnt have much of an expectation for him, but after meeting, I was immensely infatuated. In fact, I was already hooked seeing the way he texts. I dont know how to explain this but it could make any girl swoon. Hed use actual letter instead of emojis to express a face which I found endearing. It could be that he was the oldest guy(25) Id ever encounter . He had brains, looks, and ambitionsmy sexual attraction towards him was off the roof. I learned that he was new to town, that my message was the most unique hed gotten, that I was the first to meet up with him, and that he would be starting clinical rotations the following weekday. For the next two weeks or so we continue texting normally, said some sexual things, I was quite feeling it once and sent a tease photo. The level of interest still felt equal. As a reminder, I have no desire to pursue a romantic relationship. I simply wanted to hook up with him, he was aware; and if I liked it, I would have attempted to keep in touch. I know too well what medical school is like. We established that we are both busy on weekdays. He mentioned he is often on call. Wed only be able to plan on a weekend. Also, it was hard to be spontaneous and see e/o at our places bc we have roommates. By week 3+4, the infatuation starts to fade. He had started to ignore some of my replies. It began: he messaged asking what plans I had for the evening, Id let him know I wasnt available that day and ask what his Friday looks like, and he never bothers to respond. Exactly a week later (on Tuesday), he sends a text, completely disregarding my last response and says hey! At this point, Id gotten irritated, my reply to that was why do you seem to message when I am on the verge of forgetting who you are Again, he never responds. It doesnt bother me a bit, bc I have no emotional attachment. I found it hilarious. Friday comes and I see a text from him at 12am saying, you up? Yes I know thats a booty call. As much as I had been wanting to do it, what girl in their right mind would succumb to that when shes already in bed. I never bothered to respond, and I had no plans on ever responding until I see him text again in the morning, lmk if you want to come through today At this point, again, Im not even taking this to heart. This entire situation is laughable bc I have shown him my vulnerability by sending a photo and weve even said very sexual things. Youd think some action would have happened by the second week, but the relationship between us has dragged on for quite a while to my surprise. So after seeing his double text, I had a thoughtI have a very straightforward, strong personality so I decided to let him know my thoughts. I responded to the text asking if hed mind giving me a call when he leaves the hospital. He does, I call him out on his actions and said I didnt like how he disregarded my messages. He acted surprised and proceeds to ask what messages? That hed never gotten any of the text I mentioned being ignored.. 99% of me believes he was bullshitting and with that 1% left, I gave him the benefit of the doubt. As were ending the call, he mentions that if I wanted to come through, I could. I reply Id be free later at night and Ill text him to let him know exactly the time. I went about my day, debated whether I should just block him alas; but, no, I fooled myself and sent a text at 7pm to send me his location (Side note: he has given me his address once, but I deleted our text thread after he ignored my text once) His reply to that was he was out at dinner with friends. I responded, oh enjoy. Lmk before midnight And to that, he decided to not reply; it has been a day. I actually have a good feeling he will text again and act unaware. This entire situation has drained me. For the entire time, wed been trying to find a mutual time to meet again. I kept building expectations only give him a window to ignore me. Im not mad at him, but I am disappointed in myself. I was so infatuated by who he is and is going to become that I acted a fool and made myself look easy. Ladies, what would you do in my situation if he texts again? I think I'm going to have a laugh and click the block button. Another opinion: on a certain day as we were texting, he sends his address out of the blue saying, keep this in case of emergency. Let me know when you need to stop by, To that I responded with an innuendo, Oh? Looks like Ill be calling 911 often. And it turned quite heated from there. My question is: why did he just randomly give his address when he has told me he has a roommate? Did he honestly expect me to show up technically uninvited.."

I went through a really rough divorce over the summer and have been struggling ever since. Ive lost parts of myself that are things Ive always liked and felt they defined me as a man. One of them being my confidence in myself which Ive always had since I was young. The rejection from someone you care deeply about that divorce makes you feel shatters that and I havent been able to get it back. Its caused me to not even attempt to rejoin the dating world even though I feel incredibly lonely on a nightly basis. Its a struggle that I cant see a way out of and Im embarrassed to talk about it with anyone I know. Id love to chat with someone who doesnt know me since the vulnerability of talking about this is already hard enough and harder with someone who doesnt know this side of me. Hoping that some of you have some advice on how to get my confidence back and feel like myself again. Thanks for reading my unorganized rambling thoughts and any feedback from you all is appreciated.

Shes incredible , smart, beautiful , sweet and caring and we always have a good time together and so much to talk about. shes told me that shes been hurt a lot by guys and that so far , no one has ever treated her as well as i do and shes often in awe and very appreciative of things i deem normal of doing in a relationship. However, ive noticed she ca be a bit distant sometimes , she has some trouble opening up and being vulnerable and talking about her feelings , and instead just brushes things off . She is very sexual and seems to like having sex more than me , sometimes shell just stop int he middle of a conversation and start to come on to me. when she asked me where i saw this going , i said i wanted a relationship with her ,but dont want this to be all about sex, and we should get to know each other well,bc sometimes i feel shes very focused on the sex. She admitted its her way of showing vulnerability and shes had other guys bring this issue up in the past, that it just takes her a while to open up,but she does really like me and wants a relationship. The other day after some drinks, I told her i liked her so much, like i usually do and she said youre just saying that because youre drunk  i told her i was drunk , bht i do like her . she agreed . Then she said im going to be very honest with you and tell you something i havent told any guy before . From a young age , ive experienced emotionally , physical and sexual abuse at the hands of men and i cant take it anymore . Im strong , but i have my limits and ive been knocked down too many times . Im so used to expecting bad treatment and its becoming heavy. Men always say the same, that they wont hurt me , that they wish they could hurt the guys who have caused me pain, but then they do still hurt me . Im not a victim , but theres only so much i can take and to be honest i dont fully trust men .So please , if your intentions are not good, leave now . please dont make me go through of this  I was taken aback, i dont know if this is a red flag and i should proceed with caution . Was it weird of her to say this? She is almost assuming im going to do her wrong and that is a lot for me to carry . I dont know how to proceed She is in therapy , has a job, graduated from university and is studying for law school so she does seem to be holding it together "

I found myself sort've talking heaps to fill the gap and I think that out them off. They asked me if I'd told people we were dating and I said no as it was still early days, but this seems to have upset them and theyve now called it all off saying it didn't feel right. I was really open - I always am - but I don't think he appreciated my vulnerability... Why do people avoid opening up? It makes me sad because I do want to know about them and their experiences but they get so closed and don't ask me many questions either. Most people open to me easily and I hateto say it but the fact someone won't makes me even more curious!"

Daily and quite a lot daily, it was going well I admitted to her that I was developing romantic feelings for her, as far as I can tell she didn't reciprocate my feelings. It was still going well, till it hit around March, there were some major stresses in her life that seemed to cause a rift between us. I bring an anxious and depressed person took so much to heart.. eventually it ended with my sending some apologies and that was that. She contacted me last week asking me if I'd like come stay with her as my housemate was planning on do the same as he was going to a convention, I had mo obligation to do it as it's a 9 and a half hour drive but decided to go along. So.. I'm here. It's been 4 days and things are going well, we're chatting like we used to, lots of laughs etc I was supposed to leave today with my housemate but was given the option to stay longer, I choose to stay longer and I'm unsure what I should do... I thought my emotions for her had subsided in the months of absence but it would seem not. I'd like things to progress further but I both an terrified of the vulnerability of it all and of course rejection. Any and all advice is welcome."

Ive been out of the dating game for a while. I was in a relationship for about a year, which I didnt realize at the time was very emotionally abusive and manipulative. Ive gotten a lot of support from friends and family, but sometimes its nice to hear a third party. I want to get back into the dating scene, but Im not good at being emotionally vulnerable first. I am interested in one of my coworkers and some of our friends think wed be cute together. However, he is the same way in regards to vulnerability. I would be down to making the first move if I knew I wouldnt get shut down. How do I figure out if hes interested?"

This is simply coming from a place of my knowledge of being let down and left so many times that I need to speak about it to someone who you might be doing it to and not realising. Please do not take this as a sign of me critising anyone, I just aim to shed some light on the person that is recieving little to no effort in hope that it may inspire you to change your actions before it is too late. ) You left them on read, you didnt call them back, you stopped laughing, you stopped trying, you stopped communicating, you stopped remembering, you stopped putting effort in, you should probably start apologising. There is no worse feeling then being in a relationship that is only 20/80. Sometimes it will feel like this, sometimes I garentee it wont always be 50/50. Some days a person will struggle, that is when you suck it up and pick up that 80/20 cause they need you. That is love. But if it is you again and again trying too hard to put all the effort in to keep that relationship going, that it not love. It will only keep causing you pain. Maybe people do not realise that effort doesnt take a lot if they really want to be there. Its as simple as organising the next date, picking flowers on your way home from work to give to them, messaging them in the morning wishing them in hope that they have a good day, letting them know when you are thinking of them, that tiny squeeze that you give to their hand when you hold it, that out of nowhere kiss when they are crying, effort doesnt require money it requires you being there and them knowing that. It never should be about the money, a date will be a date that you will both remember even if it is just sitting in your car with the radio on watching the sunset go down that is a date or laying in bed next to each other that is a date. $0 or $100 thank you for spending time with me. Dont let that love that you have slip away so easily, that friendship that you are suppose to hold so close to your heart, if you do stop trying and putting in effort then stop holding them down, someone will appreciate them better and someone will always be there to put effort in if you are not. But if youre afraid, if something in your life is stopping you from giving them everything you have towards blossoming this relationship then dont let your love go unspoke, tell peopple how you feel why you still can. Hug your bestfriend and let them know how much they mean to you. Look that person that you love so much in the eye and tell them that their smile runs through your veins and their touch consumes your body and soul. Say everything you feel in the pit of your heart, every little damn thing. Because if they mean something to you and they are trying hard to show you what you mean to them there is no vulnerability there. They are waiting for you at the bottom with the safety net and your cutting it up. Please, because if Ive learned anything its this: Youre biggest regres wont be what you did say, but everything that you didnt. No call, no text, no effort and you know what... one day theyll stop waiting for something that wont happen. You might be busy, but they might be seeing it as theyre not the priority anymore. So before they realise that they could be loved better somewhere else dont let go until you know that you have tried everything to show just how important they are to you. Dont let those feelings be lost because you become lazy. Learn to love before its too late. Now if you are the person that is being let down so many times by this person that needs to put more effort in, please listen carefully: Dont be held back by someone when there are stars that you are yet to see. There are lovers that you havent been able to love just yet. There is light that you havent felt when you reach your hand up and catch it on the tips of your fingers. There are sunrises yet to dawn that you will stay up all night to see. There are so many dreams still yet to be deamt by that flourishing mind you have that you call home. There are still many days that you havent lived and nights you will never forget. There are still flowers yet to be plunked by your hands and swirled in the palm of you hand until the yellow pollen soaks into your skin that leave that evergrowing after glow. There is more to yo that you have yet to know. So someone constantly giving less doesnt mean try harder, it means distance yorself and see if they care. Choose the person who chooses you, because sometimes people have no clue how rare you are. But if you want better, you deserve better so go get better. GBx "

I think I messed up with this guy. We met at the end of august and have been having sex/hanging out since the first night at least 2 or 3 times a week. There are 3 weeks of that where we were out of town but talked every day all day. We went on a date a week after meeting but haven't gone on a second one so essentially our hangouts are him coming over and watching a movie (him bringing wine and stuff) or me going over there. Last Tues. we hung out when he got back from a week of traveling and it was me going to his house after a night out and having sex. &amp;#x200B; Basically I have always had issues with intimacy/vulnerability and connecting emotions to sex and tend to want to run at first sign of trouble or rejection but got caught up with a narcissist for a little over year which messed with my, well everything. I finally got away from that and met this dude who has picked up on my aloofness and high guards but I have told him I liked him and he said it back. But last week I got a feeling he was pulling back, he'd just drop off mid-texting convo and asked to hang out once after we saw each other but nothing else besides that. Idk you know that feeling when there is a shift. Admittedly he does put in most of the contact effort but I was anxious due to him not asking for a 2nd date as well as the fact that he hasn't made me orgasm in bed yet. At first he was all about talking to find a solution but he has only gone down on me once even though I give him blowjobs almost every time. The last time I saw him, he came from the 3 times we had sex in an hour, two PIV and one rough blowjob and I found myself wanting it to be over and feeling like a fleshlight aka how I felt the whole time with the narc. This followed by a lessening of contact that week, my guards were on high alert. &amp;#x200B; I decided that he seemed to be over it and on Mon. stopped by to grab something I left there which ended up being super awkward as I didnt kiss or hug him or really know what to say then left as I had plans. He immediately texted me: ""thanks for stop by it was nice seeing you again as always..."", I said thanks for my shirt and sorry i couldnt talk bc people were waiting for me, Him ""Yeah whatever"" then I said ""are you mad or something? we've barely talked this week anyway so I figured that was it"" and he never responded but has watch my stories on social media. &amp;#x200B; I dont know if I jumped the gun here. Obviously we needed to talk but I am terrible at it in person. Part of me doesnt blame him if he's just done with me as I know im difficult but another part of me feels like he couldve said something plus we've only been on one date a month ago despite texting a lot and we arent exclusive so I have had a ons with someone else (protected) but he isnt aware of that. It doesn't help that the narc texts me for a bootycall twice a week, I dont answer but it messes with my head. &amp;#x200B; I'm not sure what to think about it all. I know i'm a mess but please help a girl out."
201,vulnerability,dating_advice,Having a bittersweet crush and how to move on? (Somewhat of a vent but feedback would be appreciated),1,9bhmpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9bhmpj/having_a_bittersweet_crush_and_how_to_move_on/,2018-08-30 17:47:10,"I dont know really how to start with this, there has been a lot going through my mind the past few of months and normally Id write it down in a private journal as a coping mechanism, but Im at that point where I kinda need human feedback. I apologize in advance for the word vomit, im pretty terrible at exporting my thoughts and its gonna be a long one (and bless anyone who actually wants to read this whole mess), there will be a TL;DR at the bottom Lets start of with a little preface about myself: I (18F) have always had a little bit (a lot) of trouble opening up to others about my romantic feelings. Im pretty damn open about everything else, as well as Im always willing to help others with their romantic feelings its just my own Ive always kept off limits.I think it has something to do with me being a tomboy and having a somewhat rigid way of thinking toward love , idk, its almost like a point of sharp vulnerability that Ive always avoided. Even just thinking about it makes me feel like a sappy 13 year old teenage romantic, and I dont like it very much lol. But I do realize I need to grow the fuck up eventually and develop a much more relaxed mindset to that kinda stuff. Anyways another point I should make is that Im also an introvert, and a. That doesnt help with me not being able to open up romantically but also b. I just suck at talking to people in general. a little background about the situation: so theres this kid I know (18M) who Ive Ive fallen for. Well call him D. Ive had crushes in the past as normal and have been asked out before (Ive always said no out of lack of interest). But with D its been a bit different, I think its the first time Ive ever actually loved someone. In the past although the feeling has been some what intense, Ive always passed off my past crushes as being hormonal or infatuation and suppressed those feeling so I wouldnt really do anything about it. With D its more of been a process and a journey. As of last year, D and I have started hanging more frequently. In the past, although we shared a good amount of friends (Ive known his best friend as well as his cousin who also went to our school for more than a decade) we never really had much interaction. But we started seeing each other regularly as we joined a D&amp;D campaign together. Through that we became somewhat friends. Wed talk, he had his license before me and hed drive me home after D&amp;D, it was always me and him going on McNuggets runs for everyone, and so one. However since he is also very introverted, we wouldnt really talk much outside of D&amp;D. At first I didnt think much of it at all, I just saw him as another friend, but as the months went on I started paying more attention. It started out with me acknowledging his physical attributes, then his quirks, then evolved into me wanting to know more and more about himself, and eventually his personality grabbed me in. At first I denied it completely, but then it formed into me just passing the feelings off as hormonal. (Enter sappiness) But with him it was different because instead of having an inconsistent intense feeling of passion as previously with crushes, its been more of a slow, subtle, steady ache Id feel in my heart. Because of that I went back and forth for months trying to figure out if I actually liked him or not. I came to the conclusion that I did because it wasnt just one thing I liked about him, I liked almost everything about him. (Shits about to get cheesy but) Although he still has some flaws, I love how gentle he is, how he has a very quirky sense, of humor that never ceases to make me laugh, we share a lot of the same interests but hes different enough to keep things refreshing. On top of that hes a very handsome man if I do say so myself. Also unlike previous crushes, I have a strong desire to make him feel happy and to support him, meanwhile I liked my past crushes for more selfish reasons. And just being around him for the littlest amount of time makes me feel so happy. He was also the first person I could see myself in a lasting relationship with. Now here comes the issues (in order from least to most concerning): First one, mixed signals. Normally I am very receptive to other peoples emotions (like expressive and verbal cues and all that stuff), and because of that normally I can tell almost right away if someone likes me. But with him since hes such a introvert its been hard to determined . On top of that idk if he even sees me as a girl or if Im just one of the guys as most of my other friends view me. Next one: Ill be off to college in a couple days, and I wont be able to see him for a long time and we both suck at keeping connection, and I dont even know if Ill be able to maintain the friendship. And lastly, he would be my first. And if theres one thing I know about first relationships is that they very rarely last. Its almost inevitable that the relationship will end, and those who survive I feel like most likely live a somewhat dissatisfactory/boring life. I dont want to waste him on something I know will end. Hes such a genuine and kind person, and I also care about him deeply as a friend, and I wouldnt wanna risk ruining that friendship as well as go into a relationship with him knowing that its gonna end no matter what. Because if these things, I tried suppressing these feeling for him for a while. I gave myself the excuse that Ill inevitably find someone better in college and move on (which is most likely true). It worked for the most part for a while but it eventually it they would slither back into my life. Like recently we were both hanging with at one of our friends, sitting next to to each other on the couch. Everyone was talking and I caught myself miring at him. (Shits bout to get real corny now but) I noticed the subtleties is his facial features. From his gentle expression, to his freckles, to his nice eyelashes (I know its kinda weird) but it really reminded me how much I like him and how much more difficult its gonna be to move on than I thought. I like him a lot and I can really see myself with him, but I dont want to ruin my connection, Id much rather just stay friends than go into a relationship that will inevitably fail, but moving on is gonna be a lot tougher than I thought. Its messing me up and i dont really know what to do at this point TL;DR: I (18F) met a really genuine guy (18M) a while back that I ended up falling for. I like him a lot and he is somewhat special to me but Ive had conflicting feelings over the past couple of month and Ive run into some dilemmas: -I get mixed signals from him and since Im a tomboy Im afraid he just thinks as me as one of the guys -me and him are both introverts and suck at keeping connections, Im leaving for college soon and Im afraid Ill loose all connection to him (i also care a lot about him as a friend) -he would be my first and I wouldnt want to waste such a good person and risk ruining my friendship for a relationship that would inevitably end (because firsts never last) -I keep telling myself that Ill find better people in college and that none of this will matter in a couple of years, but feelings just keep coming back in my life and moving on has been a bit more tough than I thought (liking him has almost become bittersweet at this point) -I dont really know what to do at this point"
202,vulnerability,dating_advice,"I'm shy, she's shy, will we be in ""do they like me"" limbo forever?",0,9cdi08,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9cdi08/im_shy_shes_shy_will_we_be_in_do_they_like_me/,2018-09-03 02:48:33,"Hi. I met my friend, who I'll call... Shania? So I met Shania around three years ago, when I moved into a house she lived in. We took up smoking weed together, eventually she invited me to a concert she had an extra ticket for, and after we both moved out of town we maintained contact. After this point, some dark stuff happened in her life and we ended up having a lot of text conversations about it. As you'd expect, that sort of vulnerability strengthened the relationship. It's now been two years since we saw each other regularly, but we live in the same state and I've had growing but not inextinguishable feelings about her. To avoid writing a novel, I'll condense the remaining relevant info into bullet points: - she seems to be very, very shy and not inclined towards displays of affection. We're similar in this regard, though not to the same extent--I'll gladly hug my guy friends so hard they're lifted off the ground (I'm tall), but I've never shown a woman any sort of affection or indication I was interested in her. As for her, if not for her opening up to me about her sexual history (which is only very slightly bigger than mine), I'd assume she had no interest in romance with anyone. She may make that very assumption about me for all I know. - in the past year, I noticed a few uncharacteristically forward gestures--very small ones, but so out of the ordinary for someone so reserved. For example, a couple times when she was drunk texting me, on one occasion she mentioned she almost let something slip (which is exactly what I would do if I was drunk and wanted to make someone suspicious that liked them without actually saying it). On another, she said she missed me. Again, it's something that feels at once both small and exceptional. - this all came to a sorta head a few months ago, when she was saying a lot of bleak stuff, we'd probably never see each other again (this was following a few fallen through meetups), that's just the way the world works. So, I said hey, you're staying in Portland right now, I've got tomorrow off, I can be there in 3 hours. She went for it. Now, I had a hell of a time figuring out if this was a romantic gesture on the way there. I wanted to be there for my friend, and I definitely wasn't going to do anything to suggest ulterior motives under these circumstances. When i got there, there was absolutely nothing to suggest as much--she had prepared the pullout couch for me in the hotel living room, and had to immediately get to bed once I arrived because she had to be up really early for her work function. The next day we went out drinking with her sister, had a good time, and I know what they say about liquid courage, but the time was never right to say anything too forward. I had to get up before dawn to head back to Seattle in time for work the next morning, so the visit ended with her drunkenly stumbling into her bedroom and shutting the door as I tried to figure out how the hell i was getting to work in the morning. Now, I can't figure out if those were all the exact signs that this is purely a friendship and to not screw that up, or that we're two people who will absolutely not put themselves out there in an irresistible force/immovable object scenario. Because now, she seems to be indicating she'd be up to go camping after I mentioned an interest in exploring the Washington nature. Given the dynamics of the relationship, you couldn't pick a more comically on the nose way to go about it--the two of us, isolated in the wilderness, presumably sharing a tent (I expressed that I do not own a tent). If there's anything there you'd think this would guarantee it'd come out, but with us, in the moment, we'd both be thinking about how horribly uncomfortable it would be to make an unwanted move while on a damn camping trip. I bring this here because I don't trust my friends. If I tell them this, they'll tell me to just go for it before I ever finish giving them the important details--male or female, that's most of their approach to dating. It's yielded much better results for them than mine of ""never go for it"" has for me, but I trust this forum to exist in a happy middle ground. "

Simple as that, and that emotionally available people are open to the idea of being in a relationship. However, i have recently realized it is not as cut n dry as this. I crave intimacy and closeness, but i also fear it. I get bored if a relationship doesnt move fast i enjoy when guys obsess over me and give me a lot of attention. However, these are the ones who usually end up dipping fast , despite saying they want a relationship or even asking to be exclusive. When someone moves slowly, i get bored and lose interest. While i like to be chased, when it comes to forming deeper intimacy, i get scared. Talking about my feelings and being vulnerable is terrifying to me and i try to avoid it. Ive had multiple guys ask me to be more open, or that i am hard to read / gauge . I just end up getting annoyed and agitated and anxious when someone tries to get me to open up. I even had guys think im more into sex than emotional intimacy and i can be a very sexual / affectionate person, but thats my way of showing vulnerability and connecting to someone. I think that it is easier for me than being emotionally vulnerable bc with sexual intimacy i will never be rejected and if i get rejected after being vulnerable it would be very painful. . i also have a fear of abandonment so when someone tries to leave me , it causes me deep depression and i spiral and blame myself, even if i have done nothing wrong . i also ignore red flags despite them being blatantly obvious. ive had a lot of short term flings but never a serious relationship. Sometimes i think i like the idea of it more than actually being in one . I dont know!! i dont know what i want , but i am tired of being hurt and ive hurt other people . What does it mean to be emotionally available? How do i become emotionally available ? "
205,vulnerability,dating_advice,Trust Issues. How do I get over them?,1,8yqin7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8yqin7/trust_issues_how_do_i_get_over_them/,2018-07-14 13:56:01,"32F I realized I have major trust issues. I've been single for almost three years now. (Not counting the on/off again relationship I had with what I realized was a f-boy.) My last relationship was for four years. Guys since then have come and gone. I would love to find someone I can trust again, but I noticed maybe I have a hard time opening up. Even if I'm friendly, put together, the whole bit that maybe I'm giving off a vibe that I'm stand-offish. I know guys are attracted to me, but for some reason I find myself getting scared when a guy is affectionate and opens up to me a bit. It just takes time for me to open up. I can't open up on a first date. Oddly though, I have no problem having sex on a first date. I'm usually not like this, but I notice I tend to rush into the sex even if deep down I know it will potentially ruin things with me and a guy. I don't know why I can get physical with a guy fast but yet opening up about my feelings is harder? When it doesn't work out with me and a guy I get mad at myself even if I felt it coming. I start thinking about all my past relationships (short and long term) but the one I think about the most is my ex. The one I was with for four years. Its been almost three years since we broke up, and yet I find myself still feeling somewhat hurt from that relationship. It's weird because I know I don't love him anymore yet I feel so hurt when I look back on our relationship. Ultimately it was my fault for staying, but it was difficult. He had substance abuse issues (drugs and alcohol) and was verbally abusive to me/emotionally distant. He was also manipulative and would make me think every reason I had for feeling angry was in my head. He also kept talking to his ex (whom was going through a divorce) behind my back. He would constantly hide it from me and when I'd catch him he'd dismiss my feelings like I was jealous or crazy when I had every right to feel the way I felt esp when it was obvious she wanted him back. He was just never there for me physically, mentally, and emotionally yet I stayed for so long. Either because he convinced me to stay after numerous attempts to leave him, but also because I loved him so much and wanted to help him get clean. He was in denial though. We would get into blood-curdling arguments. It never got physical, but just the emotional stress the relationship put me through was a lot. After so long I finally got the courage to walk away for good. After realizing he wasn't going to change, and I needed to focus on myself. I've gone through so much growth since then but it's been a really difficult few years, both for the good and bad. After him, I got into a very sexual relationship. I mistook it for love, and that guy just took advantage of my vulnerability and used me for sex. He tried to suggest a few sexual things to me (like a threesome) but I never did it. I didn't feel comfortable. I found out that guy was a player and I walked away from him after two years. I dated a few guys in between here and there but most of them I could tell had issues which helped me to walk away sooner like if I noticed they were abusing drugs or were dating multiple women. Basically just anyone who I didn't feel I could trust. There was one guy I met about eight months ago. I really liked him a lot, BUT he had gotten out of a seven year relationship and he told me he wasn't looking for anything serious. Still, I found myself falling for him even though I knew he was dating other women. We hung out a few times, but after that I decided to walk away and spare myself getting hurt. Recently, I met a guy at a concert. We hit it off, and met up for drinks. He had a very positive energy about him, funny, traveler, humanitarian. I didn't expect much when I met him and just chalked it up to ""having fun"" but as I got to know him I could see there was more to him. He even mentioned that he was relieved I wasn't under 25 as he put it, ""He wouldn't be able to take me seriously."" That made me question what he was looking for, but I didn't ask. Instead, I just chose to sleep with him right away, and I don't know why I did? I regretted it after because I felt it ruined our chances. I talked to him a week later but I could tell he didn't want to pursue it further. I know I have a lot of depth to me. I've guys tell me they really like me, and think I'm fascinating yet I push them away. I crave love and affection but every time a guy even remotely puts his arm around me, or says something that implies he is interested in me on a serious level, I choke up a little inside. It's like, I like hearing it, but it makes me scared, and I put up a slight barrier or hesitation when really I just need more time to open up. Then I use sex as a way of easing the tension. Is that weird? Because that's not what I really want. Then when it doesn't work out which I half expect I get upset at myself. Then I think about my ex (from three years ago) and all the pain and anger come up again. Last I talked to him was a year ago. He wanted to get back with me, but I knew he hadn't changed. He was mad when he realized I didn't want to get back with him and he called me some mean names, hung up on me, and never talked to me again. Oh, and he still hangs out with his ex (the one who sabotaged our relationship.) I have been seeing the same therapist on/off four years, but only recently am I trying to really get to the bottom of my problems. I just feel like something is wrong with me, and I feel this block. I just feel so much pain and trust issues, and I don't know how to let my guard down with anyone anymore. I'm just very fearful of being vulnerable around anyone. If anyone can help and take the time to read this and give me some sound advice that would really help. I really want to forget my past, and move on completely so I can be happy. I'm slowly getting there, but there's still a bit of a struggle. Kind words please."

Im scared of being vulnerable, whether by talking about how I feel or simply showing interest in someone. People often say men find it hard to talk about how they feel, but Im a woman. And I feel like Im even more-so broken because I find it so hard. Does that feeling ever go away? That inadequacy, the fear of vulnerability. Or is Is it normal? Im meeting good people in my life and I dont want to miss out on any opportunities anymore. Any advice welcome."

I have struggled with anxiety, and feeling like I am not good enough for love for as long as I can remember. I have pushed myself so far and hated my body so much that I have starved myself, and refused to believe that ""I looked good"". I refused to believe it because I didn't look like Ryan Gosling yet, or I didn't have a six pack abs yet. I think the issue a lot of people have (including me) is they convince themselves that they aren't worthy of love. Not hers, not his, and DEFINITELY not hers. We worry that the mole on our forehead, or the little bit of extra weight on our thighs is a valid reason for people not to love us. After watching this TED talk I realized how f\*cking flawed that way of thinking is. You have to embrace vulnerability. You can't let that voice in your head convince you that you aren't good enough. **You ARE!** And if one person doesn't believe it then that is their loss. Someone out there will take you as you are so don't put on a front. Brene gave this wonderful metaphor that really hit me hard: ""And I know it is seductive to stand outside the arena because I think I did it my whole life... and think to myself I'm gonna go in there and kick some ass when I am bulletproof and when I am perfect... and that is seductive but the truth is, **that never happens**... and even if you got as perfect as you could, and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster, and you got in there, that's not what we wanna see. We want you to go in, we want to be with you and across from you, and we just want for ourselves and the people we care about... and the people we work with to **dare greatly**."" Take a chance, you are good enough! If anyone wants to talk, I am here. Link: [URL"

He hasnt gone to college, so far hes lived at home with his mom who is a hoarder and does not clean anything. He has been the same way for the most part, but sometimes hell have moments where he cleans his car. They live with a bunch of trash, and I hate coming over. For some reason, he has decided to move out and get an online tech degree. But he is very impulsive and does things on a whim quite often, so I doubt this will amount to anything. Hes been pretty good about being motivated lately, except when he doesnt show up at work which he says is because hes depressed and wants a new start. He wants to do better in every way he can, like figure out what clothes he likes, do something with his hair, eat well and go to the gym. He says its all for me. I stoped nagging him and started being more encouraging last week and he started brushing his teeth and coming to church with me, but I hurt him the other night and I wasnt surprised to hear that the following day he had not shown up at work. A few days ago he was over helping me with some paperwork, when my dad started grilling him about his future plans and wouldnt even let him explain himself much, but my bf was afraid of him and didnt stand up for himself. My dad hates him. He doesnt respect him bc he doesnt have a career or a house. My bf loves me, Im the first person to ever stick around in his life. Hes invested in me, been there for me like no one else, is determined to give me the life I deserve. But so far its all talk, as far as working in the real world. Emotionally and relationally, he has proven to me over and over that he is committed and I am everything. He loves me in the most powerful way, with grace and forgiveness, vulnerability and love. My parents dont see that as a priority I guess. Hes signed a lease with an apartment and is going to the inspection tomorrow. But I have this gut feeling that I am making a mistake. And my parents hating him doesnt help me have peace. Maybe Im a hypocrite because I live with my parents too and I havent made a career for myself either, but Im about to travel for half a year. The space between us will be good. But I am having doubts Ill be coming home to the person he says hell become. TL;DR: Im not convinced my bf is going to be successful in life according to how hes lived, and my parents hate him bc he hasnt shown them he can be a man so I am having trouble being happy with my choice to be with him at the moment "

Ive been really stressed about this issue with my partner so please give me any constructive advice! My partner and I are in love. We have had a mutual atraction for one another with incredible chemistry and friendship. We both want to end up in marriage and have kids together one day. We know one anothers families and kinda have that honeymoon vibe all the time. We have known each other 8 months and have been officially dating 3-4 months after much self growth and trust. Recently while on a trip out to Boston, my boyfriend used my computer and reddit to find a post about my past that I had been debating about telling him about. Its a complicated story, one Im not afraid of sharing but basically he found out that I had once tried sugar dating out of curiosity and failed as I didnt want to exhibit that lifestlye, as well as maintained contact with an older man that I met during that time. We had a fling but then decided to be platonic friends and he encouraged me to be independent and not get involved in sugaring. He also realized he did not want to be a quote sugar dad and we had a lovely friendship building one another to live holistic and healthier lifestyles. He became an older figure that I lacked in my life that treated me with respect and friendship. This was before I met my boyfriend and afterwards I told my boyfriend about my mentor when he came to town and wished to chat. We spent the day at a garden and at a church and I dropped him off at the airport. I told all of this to my boyfriend and he was fine with it. What he didnt know however was my past with this man as well as my past attempts of sugaring. He felt extremely betrayed and hurt that I had lied about my relationship with the man. He felt only a little bothered about my past but he felt most bothered by the whole thing with the older man. I continously explained to him that I had not intentionally hid my past but I had not been ready to talk about such personal matters. I also apologized that I had not told him such things. I really hadnt been ready to face my past. Let me also elaborate by saying that I met my mentor before I was sexually assaulted by an ex boyfriend. After this I was a complete mess and was afraid of men in general. My mentke helped me through my christian faith and prayed for me so I truly saw him as a platonic friend. I also did not want to recount my dark past when I met my boyfriend and slowly gained trust in him until ai felt comfortable dating him. I now trust my boyfriend a lot but our recent fight made me feel severely terrible. My boyfriend felt disgusted and terrible that I had accepted gifts of books/ chocolates and a monetary gift as a graduation present from my mentor. I confirmed with my mentor that they had all been out of friendship and good will. I told my boyfriend each time my mentor wanted to send me a new book to read about spirituality as well as whenever he texted ne. I rarely spoke to him otherwise. I told my boyfriend I would cut off contact with my mentor and I did. I also cut out all of my past flings and blocked them. My boyfriend asked for past texts and I showed him our conversation but he felt more distrustful that I wasnt showing him the full picture*. I felt hurt because I was trying to show him evidence to trust me and we continued to have a figt about how we perceived honesty and full vulnerability. He understood later that it was hard for me to be so vulnerable with someone but still felt these were good reasons to distrust me. This aside, I know I should have been more transparent about my past, and should have been more upfront about my behavior. I have learned a lot and know that boundaries should be kept better when in a relationship, and I know I could have been more clear. I fully apologized for my actions and feel horrible for hurting him as much as I have. However, my boyfriend also with his past of his ex cheating on him feels almost traumatized by hurt at this action. It is taking him a while to get past it. I dont see it as large of a deal as I specifically didnt cheat on him, but I recognize that my actions were not honest or good for him. I feel terrible for hurting him and after much discussion he told me he wishes to pursue the relationship and still loves and wishes to forgive me. Its been a few weeks and our relationship has changed a bit. We are still romantic but I feel a key component of trust is lost. I also feel a bit hurt by being so severely distrusted when I truly was building my trust and chracter while dating him. I know I dont have it all together, but I also felt that my reasons for not talking about my past were pretty significantly linked to my past traumas and depression. This I wished for him to understand a bit, as well as trust my core values. However he didnt really seem to understand about what I had been through but felt more hurt about my actions. I dont really know what else to do now, other than show him through future actions that I am trustable and loving. I want to be understanding and completely honest and have been more and more. He appreciates this honesty but I feel so nervous and stressed by our relationship due to the fact that the key component of trust is just so gone. I also feel like this huge fight caused us to just feel defeated. I felt so stressed during these fights that I had several panic attacks and couldnt eat or sleep. I just felt like I was seen as an enemy. He and I are working on it, but I have a hard time feeling optomistic. He told me he is not over it and is working on it, but feels if we talk about it he prioritizes his emotions above mine. This causes me to deel misunderstood and a bit hurt and its just a cycle of me waiting to be forgiven. He apologized for focusing so much on his hurt, but also wanted me to know hes trying to move past it and trying to prioritize me in a way that makes me feel loved. He said he just hopes if he talks about it that he feels understood. Ironically I also want to feel understood but have been trying to humble myself to accept this mistake. What are your guys thoughts? Is this a large trust issue out of his past ex cheating trauma or something that cant be eventually overcome? I also know I did wrong but do I also deserve to be a bit understood? I know everyone has different expectations and boundaries and I am now learning them as well. What can I do to feel hopeful about our relationship and also trust my boyfriend to understand future misunderstandings/ fights? And to also be more on the same page with him? I felt so scared about his reaction and just want us to work out. TLDR; Boyfriend found out about past and lies and feels hurt by the lies caused by depression and trauma, and relationship is different. I feel hurt for being distrusted when I didnt cheat nor intentionally hide, but the fight has caused an imbalance."

[25F] I've been single for almost a year now. I was heartbroken last year, but appreciate that I am not in a dead end relationship anymore. I put in so much effort for my former partner and compromised over and over again without any reciprocation. Obviously, that relationship left me with a lot of trust and vulnerability issues. I have and am continuing to work on these things. I've been in therapy and group therapy for my self esteem and depression. I have been on medications for awhile and incredibly content with my life! I am at a good place with myself. I've been in dating apps for awhile, but never really had any intentions. For the most part, I would match with people and never felt interested enough to move past casual banter. I am enjoying getting to know myself more and what I'm looking for. I am moving in a month to my PhD program so I told myself to just have fun for the summer. However, I met someone who intrigued me enough to go on a first date [29M]. They are super nerdy and I am SO into it. The date went great! Then we went back to their place, chatted, and one thing led to another. I asked them if they were going to stop talking to me afterwards. I should have clarified more if it was just a hook-up or something with potential. They told me they weren't that kind of person to just stop talking to someone. I have told this person that their interests are very similar to my ideal person. And we've discussed in person seeing each other again. It's been almost a week, but we haven't talked much as he is busy with being a best man for a wedding this weekend. I keep telling myself to keep it casual because I'm moving. I'm known to jump right in when I like somebody. I really believe in exploring connections because I don't want to wonder what-if. Something to know about him: He has been out of a very long term relationship for a couple of years. He opened up to me that they were married for a bit and it ended because of emotional abuse from her. From my general impression, he doesn't seem to have a lot of dating experience. I mean he was with one person for a third of his life! I'm probably going to be hit by a lot of truths. I am open to advice for this situation or dating in a new city while a graduate student!

This might end up being quite long but I'd really appreciate any advice from anyone, women in particular. A couple of months ago I met this girl, she seemed really cool and had just gotten out of a relationship 2 months before \(just like me in fact, only her relationship was longer\). The thing I liked the most about her was how direct she was the next time I saw her, just saying ""I like you, you're so cute"" straight up. I met her at a bar a couple of weeks after that but she said that after a therapy session she'd realized she just wasn't ready after her breakup. I think I was understandably disappointed but tried to be cool about it, gave her a hug and went home. About three weeks later she texted me, I told her I was glad to hear from her and she seemed to want to try again. We went on one date and had one kiss. I thought we really connected on that date, we talked about our lives and problems, we shared a lot. We both liked the books of Dr. Brene Brown, where she talks about the power of vulnerability. We texted for a couple of weeks and set a second date. I was all dressed up and ready for the date. When I went to pick her up and texted her, it became clear I had gotten the day of the date wrong. She wasn't even there. I wasn't sure about telling her the whole story but I did and we laughed about it. She thought it was sweet but I did feel a little pathetic, to be honest. On the actual day of the date she texted me and said she was really busy with work and wasn't sure she was gonna make it. She said she'd text me around 7:00pm to let me know. She never texted me. I thought it would probably come off as too needy if I texted her asking what happened so I didn't. I figured she finished late and was too tired so she forgot. Still, a text saying ""Sorry, not gonna make it"" would've been nice. Its been two days so I sent her a text around 8:00pm that said ""hey, how are you?"". It didn't show up as read but I saw she was online \(I hate that I sound like a total stalker here\). What's going on? Is she angry that I didn't text her that day? If so, what can I do now? Is she just busy with her life and I'm being overly obsessive here? Is she playing hard to get? Did I come off as too needy or did she lose interest? If so, should I stop texting her altogether?

If I play my cards right...,2,8mdwi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8mdwi7/i_think_i_could_be_one_lucky_son_of_a_bitch_if_i/,2018-05-27 09:15:53,"Let my start off by saying that I am 27 years old and for a few years now I set myself the rule that I wouldn't have sex with 18year-olds. Not that I had a choice most of the time, as I'm more of an awkward kind of guy around girls... But it would feel weird getting involved with girls this young. I feel that I would be taking advantage of their juvenile vulnerability. I know there are probably a few 18 year old girls that are way more mature than me, but I think generally that my rule is a good rule to live by. That being said, a week ago I was almost shamelessly hit on by a young girl. I could tell she was young but I was sort of hoping she would be 20-ish. She wasn't. She's 18. We met at a big festival kind of thing and spent the whole day together. She was talking most of the time, partly because I'm awkward around girls, and I like to think partly because I was holding myself back because she was 18, too. She started talking about how she didn't want a relationship, and what kind of stuff she likes in bed. Later in the evening we were sitting on a bench and she was laying down with her head on my lap. Those were just a few of her many attempts of wooing me. She even hinted that she wanted to sleep at my place. I didn't really react to that so eventually she went home to a friend of hers for the night, not before insisting multiple times that we exchange phone numbers. And so we did. And so we started texting a lot. Then the texts went to phone calls, and the phone calls got dirty. She was basically bragging how good she was at giving head. I was making it very clear that I really wanna sleep with her but that I wasn't looking for a relationship. And she repeated that she wasn't either. Then we got back to the dirty talk. We masturbated together over the phone twice already. Mind you, that I met her a week ago - not even, it was last sunday. Six days ago... I think so far everyone would agree with me that she wants me. Right? But every time I suggest we meet up, she comes up with some excuse, or she doesn't answer my texts until she's at home and can be fairly sure that I'm home too. And since we live a few miles apart she probably knows that I won't just come over spontaneously. Also, she lives with her parents, and neither her nor me want these two worlds to meet. After last night's phone mischief and her not really wanting to commit to a date for us to meet up, I thought today I'd play it cool. Don't text her, just wait what she does. And she texted me. Asking where I was, telling me where she was. When I replied that I could come over to chill, again she didn't answer. I'm still waiting for her reply. But it's 1am now, I'm at home, it's not gonna happen today. Again. I'm starting to suspect that she's playing some kind of game. But when I'm talking to her on the phone she seems very sincere. I think I can rule out the possibility that she says all these things to make me like her. She was hitting on me first, in a crowded and loud place. And when we hung out I was giving her nothing. Really, she had to talk and talk and ask questions to get anything out of me. She can't be interested in my personality. I think she wants to fuck just as much as I do. Why isn't it happening then? One not so minor detail: She told me she's a virgin but that she had done everything else except actual penetration. Like I said, she was bragging about her head-skills. I totally get it when she wants to wait. But we can still meet up and have fun. I don't have to be inside her for that... Sorry for the long post. This kind of thing has never happened to me. I spent the last few days frantically trying to remember if I saved someones life before, or where all these karma points could have come from. I got to terms with the fact that I would be having sex with an 18 year old because, well, she came up to me. If she wants it, why stand in her way? But I can't seem to overcome that last hurdle... Maybe someone out there has an idea on how to progress from here? Thankful for all your thoughts! "

I'm a 22 year old guy and I've come to realise that I need to step out of my comfort zone and get over my intimacy issues. Most of these issues stem from the fact that my parents were demanding and hypercritical of everything I did. As a teenager, I had low-self esteem and was afraid of getting close to people due to trust issues. That said, I don't like to blame anyone other than myself for this anymore. As I matured, and the longer I was away from home, I grew a spine. I'm ambitious and assertive. I'm in medical school and will have things sorted professionally for myself. When it comes to my goals, I'm confident and at my best. I like the way I look, dress well, and can be charming and funny if necessary. My problem is that my trust issues and fear of intimacy have stunted me socially. I have great friends, but I've always kept everyone I knew, including my own siblings, at arms length. I feel safe and at ease that way. As a result, I've never been in a relationship. The vulnerability agitates me. But I know I need this, because I feel lonely. Everyone I know is or has been in a relationship and I've only been a bystander. I'm tired of being alone. How do I meet people? How do I ask someone out? I'm in a new town now, and I feel like I'm rushing to meet a deadline before my 23rd birthday."

I know it's not healthy or fair of me, but the idea of missing out on being a girl's first fills me with a bitterness as I feel that with people today having less sexual hangups I'll be more likely to meet girls (or guys, even) who are way more experienced than I am by this point in my life. I feel as if this will lead to a sort of one-sided vulnerability which makes uncomfortable as I'm more of a switch. I also don't like the idea of a girl taking control to teach me as I feel I'm intuitive enough to figure out basic tasks by myself even if I'm totally green and my only knowledge admittedly comes form amateur pornography and sex ed that was mostly designed to teach medical facts and abstinence propaganda. And while I fully respect that being sexually open minded and having ons is totally healthy, fun, and harmless (if done responsibly), I can't help but feel that the thought of a girl essentially being immensely aroused by someone else would make me extremely uncomfortable especially since I've never had this experience myself, even they haven't done anything wrong. I understand this attitude is toxic and this post may or may not be TMI but I was hoping for a women's perspective in order to better process all of this as I know this thinking helps no one. tl;dr I'm a bitter virgin and I find this most unamusing. On a totally unrelated note, is there a subreddit for relationship stories? (dating, meeting people, cute shit couples do, etc) I really enjoy reading through these sorts of posts."
221,vulnerability,dating_advice,Choose to live in Possibility,1,8coolq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8coolq/choose_to_live_in_possibility/,2018-04-17 02:10:16,"Presumably this isn't overly unsolicited advice since I am posting it on a dating advice sub and also after reviewing many different comments within various posts. I wanted to give a shout out to late bloomers and people who think they are unlovable because they are over 25 and haven't held down a ""successful"" relationship yet. I'd like to encourage people to reframe that thinking, because we have all most likely had very successful relationships that weren't sexual and that is no minor thing. Additionally, if someone has had say, multiple romantic relationships a year that ended with someone's heart broken, how does that convey relational competency more than yourself? Our society often implies that being partnered - no matter how healthy that partnership may or may not be -- makes someone better than those who are single. That's patently false, so go easier on yourself because beneficially meeting someone is hard. I was 29 before I met my partner, now I am 31 and we are (somehow magically) still together. I had crippling body issues in my teens and early twenties that kept me from being intimate with someone, and directly discouraged anyone who pursued me or showed interest. I was a bartender, and I was considered ""traditionally attractive"" by most people, but I'm also friendly asf, so I'm sure a lot of men and women who asked me out, or I went on a couple dates with but eventually turned down, felt personally rejected. That's saddening to me and I wish I could have done a Vulcan mind meld so they understood how much I wanted to open up but couldn't. I share this so that you will realize that individual psychology is extremely complicated. Simply because someone doesn't return your interest, or even if someone ghosts on you (I never did that but it seems to be an ever increasing phenom), it doesn't mean it has anything to do with you! Don't demonize entire collective groups or even the individual. Everyone is a mess thru their past experiences, (and hopefully) trying to merge this with a useful future horizon. Ghosting is unethical, but it still doesn't mean there is anything wrong with who you are. Finding a good partner, and not just any ""body"" to be next to us, that requires many things in harmony. It takes mutual vulnerability, a sincere willingness to compromise, but it also means reflecting on what your needs are and your boundaries. To top it all off, even if we find someone who all of those things could occur with -- there's also timing. Equally as important in both dating and comedy!!! Maybe a certain person seems perfect for you but they are presently healing from rape, childhood trauma, a divorce or in the process of moving away. Maybe they are asexual but don't want to share that with you! There are innumerable reasons that someone may decline your advances, and if you constantly take it personally and think you aren't good enough - I promise you that will become a self fulfilling prophecy. Instead, remember that your duty is to honour yourself and to ensure you do your best not to leave another person scarred and less capable of healthy relationships. So what to do? Hang in there and find healthy outlets for loneliness. Continue to really reflect on the kind of partner you want to be with, and the kind of partner you want to be. Be open, but don't simply start dating anyone so you have someone. When I finally felt ready to share my life with someone I ended up dating some really awful people, because I weirdly assumed that's just what I was supposed to do. Some of these men were abusive, some were racist, and some cheated on me. Now that I have a super beautiful spirit who loves me, I have unfortunate baggage that I actually brought on myself by trying to make relationships work that felt really wrong in my heart from the get-go. I am attempting to work at correcting the false views of myself etc because I let the wrong people in, but sometimes my personal pain and distorted views end up inadvertently placing challenges on my happy relationship. So - always remember your personal worth &amp; value - be choosy, but kind - and work at being the best possible version of You. This is the highest gift you can give yourself. That way, when you bump into the person who will share your life, he or she or whomever will be excited to, and you will be able to support each other meaningfully. That isn't to say you need to be on the go all the time, but do get out there and volunteer, or take a fitness class. It is pretty hard to meet someone if we only work and then come home for tv. Television is escapism: we watch other people leading lives - but we ourselves are just sitting. It is a fun activity for sure but it shouldn't be the focus of your life. You might think, but I'm tired. Yet the more energy we spend invigorating ourselves the more energy we will discover we actually have. Take a free class from Coursera and enrich your mind. If you're shy consider an introductory Toastmasters or improv class. There's nothing wrong with being shy of course, but people deserve to feel empowered enough to share who they are when they want to. Lastly, unpopular opinion: stop using tinder, especially if you are looking for something meaningful. The fastest way to devalue yourself and another human being is to use apps like that. Say what you want about consensual hookups, the populace who feel their self efficacy improve by using that app is small. Protect yourself from predators and protect yourself from false narratives that say we should be pursuing something (shallowness), when really happiness lies far away from that. If you truly want to love someone because of who they are, what they do, how they make you feel, how they think through an issue, and of course, because of attraction, most dating apps are a hindrance that create more gaps than connections. Best wishes while each of us embark upon our own journey. At the end of the day, focus on finding ways you can give love and be loved in a healthy, nontoxic, maybe even creative way. When you become you, and I mean fully you - the whole world falls in love. What you hopefully discover along the way is that you love yourself enough, and your life, that waiting for the right person isn't so bad. "

Then I finally had the courage to talk to her, but we didn't talk much, and it didn't really happen again after that. I also had asked her out twice, the first time she said she would like to but she was going on holiday. The second time she didn't have the time, but gave no explanation.That time I got the impression she wasn't interested, but I could understand that, given that we weren't talking in school at all, and I was literally ignoring her (no eye contact ,nothing) out of pure fear. I also got the impression she was shy about it like me (she blushed on the rare ocasions that we exchanged words and was avoiding eye contact). So fast forward a month and I thought I had forgoten about her, but then see her posting stuff on social media related to our really good text convos back in January and my mind fucking races and I think she's still thinking about me(I know it's a massiv stretch...wtf brain). Anyway, now everytime I see her, I'm back to crushing on her and being nervous around her, and something tells me that I should try harder than I did, that I didn't give it my best shot and we somehow have the same energy going on so I should really give it another shot. But I'm so damn scared of showing that I'm attracted and interested in her that I can't even make eye contact. What do I do? How can I be more comfortable with vulnerability and showing attraction, starting with eye contact, then going over to real life conversations? I feel like I owe it to myself and the shimmer of chemistry that does exist between us to make an effort and talk to her, or show her I'm still interested and see how she takes it, but I need practice with eye contact etc. Thank you guys, great weather where I live today, it's fucking lovely, hope you guys are also having a great day!

223,vulnerability,dating_advice,Are people just idiots? [25/m],0,8exu0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8exu0j/are_people_just_idiots_25m/,2018-04-26 08:44:04,"What I've noticed about adult relationships that is distinguished largely from relationships at a younger age is how the concept of vulnerability is handled. At a young age, a person can be oblivious or have some sort of faults, and that makes them cute and gives the potential for an outsider to see potential in that person that they do not see in themselves - it is a door to join someone in their life and feel validated and needed. A young person who expresses their needs or desires openly is often supported. Adults, on the other hand, after a certain age seem to be conditioned to hide faults or needs (an adult with vulnerabilities, especially males, invoke cringe, however, the Beatles would say that only a fool keeps things cool by making this world a little colder). This can also be a paradoxical expectation, because on one hand an adult (esp males) who are open and also have some vulnerabilities are childish and can invoke cringe, yet at the same time a male without ""feelings"" is also criticized for being too dense, egotistical, logical, or so forth. There is a paradoxical expectation for confidence that is not based in reality and also to be vulnerable. The fact is that without vulnerability or need of any kind nobody else can contribute to anybody's lives! A contribution would imply a relative deficiency. An adult who expresses a strong passion or desire is ""needy,"" yet without a need, and without expressed passion, what distinguishes a relationship from any other casual interaction? There seems to be a strong cultural expectation to be distant. Maybe I'm wrong, but my conspiracy theory is that it is political forces at work who have mainly brainwashed the public into foregoing relationships and keeping things casual to reduce fertility and double the GDP by having both genders (biological sexes) in the workforce independently where they won't be distracted by one another. For example, I walked into a shop the other day and overheard a college girl talking about how her roommate was hooking up with this guy, but she says they both are afraid to admit they like each other for fear of being needy. In my view, this would seem to be ridiculous, yet it seems to be out of my control that this is the standard, and if you question it, it is almost as if you are questioning some unspoken rule about being too entitled/needy/not independent enough/not happy enough being by yourself. Furthermore I also find that advice to ""just be yourself"" or alternatively to ""just be okay being by yourself"" to be largely antithetical and somewhat ridiculous. Without social behavioral feedback, people literally do drift into insanity (for example, I understand this is an extreme case, but recovery rates in schizophrenics are much higher if they are properly integrated into a role in society, and babies who do not receive contact and love literally die). I think that maybe most people would be fine being by themself if they had a chemical castration but that is not something really I think most people if they were honest with themselves would be comfortable with. Attraction is a biological fact and millions of years of evolutionary biology embedded deep in the limbic system have provided ample existential anxiety and intrusive thoughts that compel people to date each other, love each other, and screw each other. Sorry to be blunt, but this is so obvious sometimes I really do question what is going through people's heads when they give this advice. A person should be fine being by themself so that when they are by themself people don't have to deal with it, that's what I think that common advice is really about, which, I'm sorry, you can have as many cool hobbies as you want, but there is something that distinguishes a romantic relationship, otherwise our species (and all of the previous species before us) would not have made it. Finally, if a person is honest with themself that they definitely want to screw and get to know personally an attractive person, and are doing well in their job and career and enjoy it as well as other hobbies, wouldn't it be the exact opposite of themself to modify their behavior to be different at the advice of someone else to ""be themself?"" Isn't everybody already always themself (aka operating in the world to maximize what they want to pursue with the limited information they have)? In my opinion it isn't on the person to be more ""like themself"" but it's on someone from the outside to notice. And also what's all this about things being so casual? Where the hell is the passion? People have taken the casual thing way too far in my opinion, it sort of makes things boring. Like okay maybe having a ton of partners can be fun but without any genuine interest or depth or built shared experience/companionship/understanding over time it's about as satisfying as whacking it to something on the internet, and I'm sorry, that isn't very dynamic. One friend of mine was having an ""open relationship."" Am I just crazy for thinking people are idiots? Also why would I reinforce an obsession/passion for someone while anticipating it will end on my own volition? I was reading an article and that is exactly the same feeling as coming off of a drug high, which my understanding sucks - which is to say inasmuch as it is satisfying it is reinforcing, and inasmuch as it is reinforcing and it falls through, there is a crash - that is how the dopaminergic system works. And why don't people put some effort into persevering? Isn't part of a relationship persevering through the good and bad times? If not what's the point? How can people have a relationship without having common life goals and doing life together? Might as well just pay off a hooker. Also shared experience * time = potentiated reward, so in theory it should be good to take things seriously sooner rather than later rather than the cultural brainwashing advice to screw around a bunch to ""explore"" and ""learn what you like"" and ""get it out of your system."" Studies I've read show that with more partners the likelihood of future dissatisfaction in sequential relationships is higher, and actually couples in arranged marriages report highest relationship satisfaction. Finally I sometimes hear about how it is liberating and empowering women. What, to be treated as disposable, especially while they are considered to be the most attractive? I have met more than a few older women who slept around a bunch and are now past 30 lonely alcoholics and all the guys with good paying jobs were going after younger women. Not only that, but I have met a few younger women who want to not have to work and have the guy pay the bills (who wouldn't)? So what's the deal? I think that women are told this until their 30s then they wake up and realize it would have been better to find a suitable guy earlier on, but by that time their initial attraction value has decreased significantly. Plus as a guy I'd rather be with one good partner than a thousand ones who are annoying and don't care about me (including my needs or vulnerabilities) even if they were fun to screw. Why not have someone who is good to screw and a good partner? Seems self explanatory, but it seems like I'm not writing the rules around here. I'm not making this up, males on average have an increased proclivity to find neonatonous features like youthful appearance more attractive in initial attraction, while women prefer social status (on average). What else do I have to go based off of initially if I don't know a person, how do I distinguish them otherwise if I'm not given the time? Also, I don't want to share someone's psyche and be judged through the context of past lovers. This leads to the dynamic I mentioned above, and has been verified across cultures and demographic groups, and is modulated largely by testosterone and it's subsequent effect on dopamine receptor densities in the brain. It seems so obvious, but again, it's like some unspoken rule that acknowledging or expressing all this is some sort of taboo. "

It's not serious at all, I've been talking to and seeing other people. However, I am confounded. This guy is extremely vulnerable when we are messaging online, he'll send me blocks and blocks of paragraphs about what he's going through or his fears in life, and we'll talk about them and I'll give him advice and be there for him. He's also been there for me that way when I was going through hard times. We have a great balance of super insightful conversations and then laughing at memes. However, on the rare occasion that I do bump into him in real life, he is a grade A ASSHOLE. I think he has deeply rooted insecurities and a fear of showing vulnerability, and that comes out in extreme douchebag form. In front of our mutual acquaintances he will be incredibly rude to me, make fun of things he knows get under my skin. I've called him out about it in public before but I struggle with confrontation and prefer to just ignore it. Even when it's just me and him talking face\-to\-face, he tries to exude this aura of ""coolness"" and ""I don't care about anything and anyone."" \(I think he's getting better though.\) I've considered blocking and just completely moving on before, but then he'll message me with something and I'll see that good and vulnerable side of him and so I reconsider. I love seeing the good in everyone, but sometimes I fear that it prevents me from letting go of toxic people. I want to be a good influence and help him grow as a person, because I don't think there are people like this in his life who care enough to do this. What would you do in this situation?"

Not charisma, confidence, kindness, etc. because those are all qualities subject to the eye of the beholder. In my early 20s I didn't really know how to talk to people. There was a work party at a bar and I went to get a drink and made eye contact with a girl. Lets call her Jane. She was the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, in an conventional but also unconventional 'your exactly my type' way. Her personality was the opposite of mine - she was social, confident, experienced, in high demand and she knew it. Fast forward to a future party and man I tried my best to talk to her and it was wholly awkward. I think fortunately there was initial attraction so Jane saw past the awkward small talk. As we got to get to know each other the poor socialising never went away, but she would constantly make moves. She'd hold my hand between her boobs; rest her head on my shoulder; stick her face in front of my face during one on one time etc. Making a move on me was a nightmare because my self-esteem said: 'she's very affectionate, maybe she's being friendly' and I never reciprocated. After making every mistake possible for two to three months everything worked out in the end somehow when she just went for it one night. We didn't really know each other yet she invested the time, effort and vulnerability (compounded by my stupidity) into me. Now current me is better at expressing my feelings and yet I'm unsuccessful. I have the confidence to pay more attention to other people; to reciprocate more vigilantly; to lead more etc. And my love life has gone down the shitter. Compare Jane's efforts despite me making every mistake to x,y,z ghosters despite me being more adequate. Attraction doesn't really make sense. My theory is that current me isn't very relatable. Everything is presented in a socially correct way. People find it easier to ghost me because I'm not really a person to them, I'm just 'a guy'. Old me was very relatable to Jane - old me was very self-destructive and broken due to his self-esteem and it turns out that Jane was extremely self-destructive and broken as well due to her lack of direction in life.

I had only hooked up with a guy three times. That was all I had done. Anyway, I often feel uncomfortable or not safe to share my feelings with many people especially with men. I didn't realize that my childhood affected me. In the past, when I shared my feelings, I got shamed by my peers and teachers. They taught me to suck it up and be tough. I was told that I was no longer little so I was a big kid now so I have to stop crying. I felt ashamed, and I wanted to ""grow up"" and stop crying. It wasn't easy because I am a sensitive person in general, but I ended up sucking it up. It doesn't mean I no longer cry. It is hard not to cry sometimes. When I feel like wanting to cry, I just go somewhere private. I still don't like to cry in the front of anyone otherwise they would view me as a ""crybaby"" or ""weak person."" Today, I don't really know how to express my feelings in a statement or in a healthy way so much, but I tried my best. There was few times I shared my feelings. It did not turn out well, so I rather continued to bottle up my feelings and sweep them under the rug. I find it a lot easier to share my opinions than my feelings. There are some emotions I do not know what they are. If I had to share my feelings, I wouldn't know what those emotions are. There is another reason why I am afraid of exposing my vulnerability to men because I did not want to appear ""clingy"" and ""needy."" However, I recently learned that exposing your vulnerability to men can strengthen your relationship. It can help men opening up because if you show vulnerability so it shows that you trust him and let him know it is okay to be vulnerable with you. Even if I know the fact, it is still easier said than done. I'd still not feel ready to open up, and I'd wait until a guy becomes vulnerable first. Sure, it is good to use this masculine energy for work and etc, but it is not good for a relationship so I'd have to use feminine energy... I have to stop being afraid of being vulnerable, but I don't know how to start or when it is the right time to be vulnerable. To me, being vulnerable with men is very scary. Anyone who knows now would be so surprised by my childhood self. I used to be sensitive and vulnerable. Today, I can be distant sometimes. I am a ""cool and chill"" person on the outside, but I'm opposite on the inside. With men, I'd appear I am bored like I hang out with them because I got nothing better to do. Sometimes, I rather keep my feelings to myself because I did not want to hurt anyone and I was concerned. Basically, I just sweep my feelings under the rug so nobody will be hurt. A guy I slept with and I are also friends. I noticed that sex made me more vulnerable with him. I realized that I've become vulnerable with him so I made myself less vulnerable. One time, I got too comfortable and told him something. I got embarrassed, and I apologized to him. He told me that is fine and I can tell that he didn't care. I wanted to talk to him more and I wanted to see him, but I didn't want to appear ""needy"" and ""clingy"" so I acted cool around him. Perhaps, he is not interested in me so I drifted away from him. He'll text me eventually. I feel like I'm hopeless because I am unable to tell any guy how I feel or expose my vulnerability. I'm afraid of showing my interest in them. That's why I never had a boyfriend because they don't know I was interested in them. I just act cool or bored around them. Any advice?"
228,vulnerability,dating_advice,What are you even supposed to talk to her about? Advice for the introverted gentlemen,18,7yof9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7yof9k/what_are_you_even_supposed_to_talk_to_her_about/,2018-02-20 04:41:12,"A long time ago, I used to have a crush on a woman that I saw every day on my bus ride home. I wanted to just go up and talk to her but I was always afraid to. Mostly because I had no idea what I was even supposed to talk to her about. One day I decided to just go for it. I remember it going something like this: Hi, I sputtered nervously. Hi, she replied. I felt my heart racing at a million miles per hour. Oh jeez, what do I say next? Ummwhat time is it? I muttered. Really, Tomato91? The time?! You couldnt think of anything better?!? Its 3:25 she replied. Oh, ok I responded. A few minutes passed. We arrived at her stop. She got up and walked off the bus. Well, crap. I slunk down into my seat, buried my face in my hands, let out a long sigh, and started hoping that nobody witnessed my dismal attempt at talking to her. What are you supposed to talk about when youre talking to someone youre interested in? **The Conversational Totem Pole** When it comes to talking to women, theres a framework that I like to use. Its called the Conversational Totem Pole, and it goes like this: Less Personal * Arms-length rituals (avoid) * Contextual subject matter * Opinions * Backstories * Feelings More Personal At the top of the Totem Pole, you have topics that are more impersonal. And as you progress down the Totem Pole, the topics get more and more intimate. In order to build a meaningful connection with her, you want to start at the top of the Totem Pole and move your way down. The very top of the Totem Pole is comprised of what I call Arms-length rituals and they involve tired old clichs you use when talking to someone that you dont really care about, such as a cashier at Wal-Mart or that super talkative person that you got stuck in the elevator with. For example, if youre buying goods at Wal-Mart the cashier might ask, How are you? You might reply, Good. And you? And shell probably say, Good. Its a clockwork ritual you do to fill the silence, and the truth is that neither of you really care that much about how the other person is doing. These rituals are the most impersonal level of the Totem Pole and you generally want to avoid these when talking to women. **Beginning the Conversation** A lot of men obsess over trying to find the perfect line to begin the conversation, but it really does not matter as much as you might think. Theres no need to be too flashy or to try and impress her right off the bat with a clever line. The most important thing is that you talk to her in a way thats authentic to your personality. One way to begin talking to her is to say something contextual. For example, you could give her a genuine compliment. I really like your hair/bag/bracelet/etc If shes reading something, you can ask her what shes reading. Another great way to start the conversation is to just say Hi, Im Tomato91. This has worked for me many times. Sometimes, simple and straightforward is all you need to win the day. **Building a connection** Contextual subject matter is good for beginning the conversation. To build a genuine connection, youll want to make the conversation more personal by moving down the Conversational Totem Pole to opinions, backstories, and feelings. Backstories involve any experiences youve had up until the present moment, such as stories from your childhood. Feelings include emotional subject matter, such as the things that make you feel happy or angry. A great way to do this is to approach her with a mindset of curiosity. Try to find something that she would be interested in telling you about herself. As Dale Carnegie writes in *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, becoming a good conversationalist involves talking in terms of the other persons interests and listening to them when they talk about themselves. Show that youre interested in her opinions, her backstories, and her feelingsthat youre interested in who she is as a person. **The What/Why Technique** One of my favorite ways to do this is through what I call the What/Why Technique. Its a simple, two-step technique that goes like this: Ask her about what she likes, and then ask her about why she likes it In practice, it might look like this: What is your favorite movie/book/music/etc? And then follow up with What do you like about [her answer?] By asking her what she likes, youre inviting her to share an opinion. And then by asking her why she likes it, you can often get her to share her backstories and feelings. Maybe her favorite music is Taylor Swift because her mom would play that on the car radio all the time when she was little and it grew on her. (Wait, no. Thats my favorite music and a story from my childhood. Just dont tell anyone that because its kind of embarrassing!) **Wrapping up the conversation** As you start to go out and talk to women, youll find that a lot of this is organic. Depending on when and where you talk to her, you may find yourself getting lost in a conversation with her for an hour. Julian Reisinger from Love Life Solved calls this an instant date, where a serendipitous meeting with a stranger immediately turns into a date. On the other hand, sometimes youre only able to talk to her for a few minutes before one of you has to take off. It happens. In that case, you do what you can. You don't have anything to lose. As the conversation comes to a close, be sure to get her number if you enjoyed talking with her. Heres a script I like to use. Hey [her name], I really enjoyed talking to you and I wouldnt mind seeing you again. Could I have your number? I like this script because it take the conversation all the way to the feelings level at the bottom of the Totem Pole. Its sincere and displays a little bit of vulnerability, which shows that youre interested in her romantically and not just looking for a hookup. Well, I had a lot of fun putting this together and I hope you found it useful. If you're an introverted gentleman (like me) then feel free to check out my own website URL for more advice like this including how to talk to women, how to be confident, and where to go to meet women. Happy dating! Ciao!"

Im a black guy. And before you mob me with ""well maybe its you"" Id like to provide a big fat ""no shit"" which is why ive done every self improvement pill under the sun. Dress better Adopt a better attitude Be honest about your intentions Show vulnerability Keep asking people out Treat women like people Smile Make friends Do fun things Learn to dance Go to the gym L2 conversation The only thing I seem to be missing is a leadership position. (Which im becoming more and more cognizant of the idea that nearly every college girl wants to date a guy with status.) Its like this. . . Im beginning to think my lack of success comes from my skin color. Im buff. Good looking. Well groomed. Good grades. I get around and not ONLY do I find out that im not successful at dating but im also getting talked about behind my back. A friend of mine told me about how people are talking about how im approaching groups of people and hitting on girls. They dont know my name or face but they agreed that its me. But that's so effing bizarre because I dont ""hit on girls"" I go up to them and say : ""Hi I wanted to meet you, im matt."" Or ""Hi i thought u were cute and wanted to meet you. Im matt."" If she gives me bad vibes then i end the convo quick and back out. If she doesn't then I ask for her number. I don't approach groups with that though. So im not even sure that if they are talking about me then fucking why? Then I remember this one girl who worked at the front desk of my gym. I asked her if she wanted to get coffee. She said sure, but im busy. Which was fine. Then I asked her another day. She looked down in a manner which I can describe as patting ones self on the back and dismissing the person in front of them by averting their gaze. And said ""tsk im busy. . ."" I smiled and jokingly said "" you suck"" she said ""im sorry"" in a high pitched tone and i told her it was cool. Every time I walked by her since then I heard f bombs getting dropped in whispers ""that mother fucker"" I was honestly baffled. If a guy asks you out in a way that's respectful why do you need to talk shit about him? Are you really that little on the inside ? At this point im not even sure what to do. If Mark Manson can't help me then Im at a loss. The only girls who show interest in me are ugly and overweight or just have shitty behavior. And every time I let myself drop my standards for either of those 3? I end up with pain and regret. Overweight is a red flag for me. Not body shaming anyone but rather problem solving shaming them. Because EVERY time I let myself be attracted to an OW girl, their cure for the challenges that life offers them is narcissistic attitudes and shitty behavior which is always justified for 1 reason or another. Besides? I go to the gym every day and watch what I put into my body. Why should I date somebody whose lifestyle will only poison mine? "
230,vulnerability,dating_advice,Male loneliness epidemic: Men need to look out for one another,206,8019up,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/8019up/male_loneliness_epidemic_men_need_to_look_out_for/,2018-02-25 12:40:41," Most men don't have anyone to talk to after a breakup, a job loss or some other setback in life. It's mostly our own fault and also society's expectations. I don't know about you but I've had only have a few guy friends throughout my life who I can really speak to how I'm feeling. With most people, I feel forced to adopt this ""no problem ill deal with it"" front when in fact, I often feel terrified inside and sometimes just at a loss at what to do. Even with the few guy friends who I feel like I can show my vulnerability, you can only do it a few times or their patience will wear thin, particularly if they are in a better circumstance than you are. Nobody wants to keep hearing about your breakup when they are busy maintaining a relationship. Nobody wants to hear about your struggles to find a job when they are experiencing a high in their own careers. Men are used to competing with each other but I think we should also learn to have some compassion for one another too. Even if you're doing well in life now, you got a good job, wife/girlfriend and things are looking good, you don't know what's gonna happen in the future so maybe have some compassion and make some time for that friend who isn't doing so well. Men hate being felt left out. Society has a very peculiar way of making men in particular feel like a loser. And once you're in this situation, it's very hard to get out. Life is a pretty rocky road. Just because a man has trouble finding a girlfriend doesn't necessarily mean he's a loser. Just because he's struggling with his career doesn't mean he's necessarily a loser. Do loser guys exist? Yes but I feel that a lot of ordinary guys are just having some tough times now with the fast-changing world. It doesn't mean they're flawed in any way. This is particularly important because I think a lot of guys in a rut look to the internet for advice. But the internet is full of self-professed life coaches or dating coaches eager to cash in on your loneliness in order to make a buck. Also, the advice they give is unhelpful and too generic. There's just no way it can help a specific person's individual situation. Not to mention, a lot of that advice is harmful. For example, the whole anti-nice guy thing going, the whole thing is designed to make you feel worse about yourself and to tear you down when right now, you need to be built up. I don't know why we men feel such a tendency to compete with one another and to tear down each other, even for guys who we call friends. You can even see it on this reddit where some guy who isn't good with girls is seeking some comfort and you get other guys who just enjoy tearing him down and making him feel worse. You don't think he already knows some of the stuff you're telling him? That's just an example but this goes on in with guys in real life too. Society is only gonna get more lonely and more technological. We're dealing with rapid technological change, rising gender equality, racial equality, etc. which are all great things in the long run but they DO make men more lonely than ever. We can't expect women to look out for us. So we're gonna just have to have more compassion for each other. "

I literally act like a guy in a relationship in an attempt to get them to break up with me, become turned off and leave. I almost do this subconsciously or I just cant seem to help it. I will either run from the guy or do this to sabotage any chance I have with the guy Id be dating or potentially dating. When the relationship is starting to get more serious, Ill go to the point of wearing guy clothes (I did this when I was little to). Wearing anything too feminine makes me feel inferior, and targeted as weak. I feel like playing the feminine role in a relationship makes me feel so vulnerable. Like to let a guy treat me like a lady or a female makes me feel so inferior. I dont really know how to explain this behavior I do it very subtly. Like Ill open doors for a guy so they wont be able to hold it open for me. Idk its as if my body language and how I talk or act towards a potential guy or bf might be come off in more of a masculine, dominant fashion. I wont exactly do these things too in the beginning but more as the relationship progresses. I might feel the need to protect a guy relationship. I also have always felt EXTREMELY protective over my family as well, such as fighting for my little bro (or attempting to because I hate the fact I dont actually have the physical strength to fight a guy), my mother, grandmother, or dad. Maybe Im more of a dominant female, but down to the core I really dont think I am. I think it could also be me testing their trust and boundaries to see if theyll stay (which I know is wrong). Maybe Im afraid of vulnerability. Is his a form of self sabotage? A defense mechanism? If so what would there be a name for this defense mechanism? How can I stop? "

The chemistry is amazing. We get each others details and start to hang out all the time. It becomes extremely passionate very quickly. The conversations are based around vulnerability, and she says to me that things do not usually move this quick with her and that she trusts me more than most. We have conversations about what we want in relationships, how honesty is important and how we are happy with the way things are going. I am sort of guarded because I do not want to give away too much quickly, I do not want to fall in ""love"", but I do. Fast forward a few weeks and she seems to be acting very distant. Messages lack the usual flirting, and when we are together, conversation seems fine, but she is no longer touching me, kissing is one sided, or wanting to be intimate. I continue to do what I always do for lovers, cook, make them feel comfortable, be easy going and patient with whatever they may be going through. I understand how silly the laws of attraction are, but I do not want to play the game and reciprocate distance to facilitate a craving in absence. The intimacy goes down, and every time we kiss, there is just not the same passion from her end as their previously was. Every now again it will come back briefly. It became somewhat strange to me, because after we had amazing passionate sex for a very long time, thats when everything seemed to shift. I kept telling myself to be cool and calm, and that I was overthinking things. That sometimes people can get cold feet. She tells me several times, ""I may be acting weird, but this is just my female brain"", and another time, ""sorry about the lack of intimacy"" to which I respond its ok and you do not need to explain yourself. I find out after she decided not to text me for a few days that she is seeing a guy from another state. A friend of hers told me, and when I confronted her about it, she denied it at first, than said, ""oh yeah but thats been going on for a year"" as if it was nothing. I asked her what she wanted, and she said to me, ""I want to be with him, but I cant because I do not want to do long distance"", she continues with, ""dont worry, its only because I have known him longer than you"" She goes away for two weeks, and before she leaves, she says to me, ""lets see how this goes when I get back"" I was left feeling miserable and quite used. I was warned by her many friends not to fall in love with her. Several times. I was also told that she is the type of person that wants her cake and to eat it too. I took this all as a ""you do not know her like I do"", even though she had been with more than 5 guys since her relationship 12 months ago. I saw so many red flags, but decided to pursue because of the initial chemistry. The elevations were worth the valleys. The guy she was seeing would call her and text her quite frequently whilst we were together. She would say he was just a friend. I had my suspicions, from the way he would leave her voices messages. She constantly was dishonest with me, and very secretive, yet I took this as another sign of being cautious. I am not sure how my actions indicated that I would be bothered by it as we were dating and it really didnt bother me if she was dating multiple people. Its the lack of transparency that bothered me. And if I was told at the start, I would have approached it with a different attitude. About a week ago, she sends me a message saying she feels really bad about our conversation, the one where we spoke about her seeing the other guy, and that she does not want to hurt me and really cares about me as a person. She continues to say, dont hate me as this would break my heart, and please be patient with me during this time. I have no idea what to make of it. Wether to leave it completely, as in not see her when she gets back, not as for cloruse. Is she using me as back up if things fail with this other guy? Any advice would be great. I know deep down it will never workout because of the lack of transparency, but this is cathartic for me, and I appreciate the responses that take an objective view of my situation."
234,vulnerability,dating_advice,Is she ghosting me or is she actually busy?,1,7dhzce,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/7dhzce/is_she_ghosting_me_or_is_she_actually_busy/,2017-11-17 14:26:16,"I already made a post about this a couple days ago but it was literally my first post ever on reddit and was poorly done lol. I'll try and be more concise this time. I (m27) matched with this woman (f23) on Bumble around the end of August. We seemed to hit it off, and soon after matching and chatting for a bit I asked if she'd like to meet up. She said she'd like to keep talking first before a face to face meet up. She also asked me for my number so I figured I was doing something right so I didn't take her declining a face to face hard at all. She also warned me she's horrible at texting people back, so I make a mental note of that. We continue texting, and she tells me she's got anxiety problems and that its hard for her to meet new people and make new friends. I find that hard to believe since she's drop dead gorgeous, so I figure that's her way of cluing me into she likes to take things slow. I don't mind because there seems to be a genuine connection, and I found her vulnerability refreshing in the online dating world that's all about appearances. She also says her family is a big part of her life, and that she doesn't date people they haven't met, and how that's scared off a lot of guys for her in the past. We start face timing each other and things seem to be progressing nicely. Then I don't hear from her for a while. I figure she's lost interest, but when I do finally hear back from her she tells me her nephew passed away in a tragic accident. Well, that explains it. I figure that I shouldn't ask her out for a first date anytime soon because it wouldn't be a good time for her to bring home a guy for her family to meet with them in mourning and all. We continue face timing, and surprisingly with more frequency than before her nephew's passing, and each face time session lasts close to 2 hours with the shortest one being just over an hour. She seems to be taking comfort in our talks with all that's happened in her family, and I'm thinking I'm really making progress with her. The conversations never hit a lull and we seem to make each other laugh a lot. Then I notice in our conversations what I perceive to be her dropping subtle hints that she wants me to make my move. I remember in conversation her saying something to the effect of ""If a guy doesn't take the initiative then I'm not going to bother with him"". So I wait about two more weeks - just to be sure I'm not rushing it with the recent death in the family and all- all the while we're face-timing every evening almost daily. I finally ask her out on a date during one of our face time chats one evening. At this point we've been talking for two months, and face timing each other regularly for a month and a half, and been about a month and a half since her nephew died. I even made it a point to say I'd come over to her place to introduce myself to her family so they know I'm not some weirdo, and after that we could go for a bite to eat. She says ""I'd really like that"" but to text her tomorrow to remind her to check her work schedule so we can work out a day that works for both of us. I text her the next day reminding her to check her work schedule, and that's when I start getting the feeling she's becoming distant. I don't hear back from her for a week. On the 7th day of not hearing back from her, I text her that I realized its still probably not a good time for her to bring guys over to meet her family, and that I'd like to continue to get to know her at whatever pace she's comfortable with. She responds with something to the effect ""Hahaha omg don't be ""that"" guy. I'm just really busy with work to be honest. I'll probably be working like this for the next few weeks"". I'm relieved to hear this and holiday season is right around the corner, so I take her for her word on it. But ever since I asked her out on facetime it hasn't been the same. She takes much longer to respond to my texts than before, like a day or longer, and last Saturday she didn't even respond at all. We obviously haven't face timed since I asked her out. Though she has watched my stories on snapchat and insta, and liked one of my posts on insta the day after I asked her out which has been almost two weeks ago now (haven't posted anything since). Holiday season is around the corner and she is in school and the end of the semester is coming up. I also remember her saying that her and her family go all out on Black Friday so its very well possible she could be working like crazy since its just around the corner. However I also feel if she was serious about dating me she wouldn't leave me twisting in the wind like this. I really like this girl, and I thought I was making progress with her, so this sudden cold shoulder has got me feeling some type of way. I gave the rundown to my good friend's gf and she's confused by the whole situation as well. So I figured I'd ask you guys what you make of this situation: is she ghosting me or is she really busy? A few other notes: -She's a devout Christian; I'm Sikh. She did say that when she has kids she's going to teach them about all religions -She's African American; I'm Punjabi- though judging from dudes she's dated before it seems she's got a thing for brown guys -She wants to stay close to home; I'm in medical school and have no idea where I might end up for residency (fingers crossed that I get one *knocks on wood*). However after I brought this up she said she wouldn't mind living in another place for a few years but definitely would want to come back to stay close to family, so I took that as a good sign."

Recently, I meta man in a similar situation, and we hit it off. I enjoyed his company, could talk openly with him about the hurt I experienced this year, and was very attracted to him. Admittedly, we had sex too fast (on the second date). After weeks of talking, five dates, lots of emotional vulnerability, and plenty of sex, he told me last night that his ex (who is bipolar and has a criminal record) came to his house a night or two after we last slept together, et herself in, and got into bed with him. He had sex with her (he had previously told me she was just a friend). I understand that we were not yet exclusive and that he was within his rights to see other people. I don't really want to debate was ""exclusivity"" means. Despite understanding this, I am horribly hurt. I opened up to him about some deeply personal things. He knew I am in a vulnerable place. I can't help but feel, especially because we had become a source of emotional support for each other, that he disrespected me, disregarded my feelings, and put my health at risk. I'm not angry or villainizing hime: I just can't help but feel very hurt. Why would he become so emotional connected with me (he says he felt it too), and then let his ex crawl into bed with him. The question for me is not whether he had the right to do this in a non-exclusive relationship. The question is whether it was morally correct under the circumstances. My question is: am I irrational in feeling so hurt by this, and wouldn't man who is genuinely interested in a new woman not want to jeopardize a blossoming relationship for some ex sex? He says he ""believes"" that he will not have any more interactions with this woman but won't completely commit to cutting her off. I am leaning towards breaking it off because I feel he was reckless with my heart and health. Thank you so much for reading and responding. I'm in a lot of pain, and I would appreciate any help or advice. Blessings to all of you as we head into the holidays!

I always thought I was a very sexual and loving person. Previously, in my first and only serious relationship, I was. After that back fired I began to try to fill his void with new lovers. Just messing around and trying to feel complete. A year or two of this and I still felt empty and didnt meet anyone to change that. Recently, I havent been hooking up or dating. But I went on a date with a guy and he met everything on my checklist. Though, at the end of the night I just wasnt feeling it. I dont know why. I liked everything about him. He was good sexually, but just something wasnt there. I had decided that I didnt want to have sexual relations on a first date. So I did not. It only went passed first base. I didnt want it to go further.... Anyway, he left and even during this I felt broken and not comfortable. It had nothing to do with my confidence sexually. I know Im sexy....more with the fact that Im scared of being serious with someone. I dont like vulnerability after everything that has happened in the past. Im scared though. I dont think this guy was the one and of course hes super into me and does everything hes supposed to. I just dont like it. I cant give in. I cant love. Im so heartless. Maybe because I associate sex with someone who always leaves me and uses me. I do not know. I know theres some underlying reason as to why I cant commit. I just feel broken and like Ill never love. I wouldnt even care. I have everything I need. Am I just being fearful? What do I do?? Or when its the right person will this change?? "

(Im 27F &amp; him 35M) We were chatting across all social media and texts soon all day &amp; night from good morning to good night. He lived in my area in FL but dealing with the hurricane kept postponing plans because he evacuated and I had to work around the clock right after. The first time we did hang out we had just planned for a quiet night after work watching a tv show and having a beer. We ended up talking until 3am about everything under the sun. Over the next few months we talked nonstop daily, and every time we hung out I laughed harder than I felt I had in ages. He was very clearly smitten early on but I noticed his flirting fading about 2 months in, but I was still more and more into him daily. One night in October hanging out at a street fair we got drunk and by the end of the night he kissed me and we couldnt stop kissing and making out. I was over the moon. But we were very drunk. After that I saw him again and wed hug but that was it. Then we went out another night, went back to his place and again stayed up late talking and drinking and it got physical. Again we were very drunk. I also told him before clothes could come off that I was HSV+, which I had been building up the courage to do pretty much since we met. But he was absolutely great about it and 100% on board with being safe. But the next time I saw him after that, he wasnt physical at all. Didnt initiate any physical contact. But we continued to talk every day, though the conversation was waning very much to small talk or very short answers. Every time I tried to initiate a conversation I kept feeling more and more like I was burdening him. Finally last week I texted him (mistake #1- texting it): Hey, Ive been meaning to ask, and Im hoping you can be straight up honest and just blunt with me- do you see this as being anything romantic or other than platonic? But my insecurity and fast typing got the better of me and I also added And its okay if not, honestly, I just need to hear it from you. I think I know the answer but I just hope you can tell me. Radio silence. Understand, the last few years Ive had a reputation with my friends as a cold and unemotional fuckgirl. Ive not done anything bad like cheat or lie to guys, but Ive chosen to play the dating app game and limit myself to casual encounters with the otherwise emotionally unavailable. The two guys I did date I dumped pretty much by surprise 3-4 months in because I didnt see a future with them. But with the particular guy I was way more into him than normal. I honestly dont think Ive wanted someone that badly since 2014. So the silence drove me fucking nuts. Seriously that day my emotions ranged from pissed as fuck to crying in the bathroom at work to feeling utterly worthless. I got home and was in full fuck him, that bastard mode. Got back into bumble matching with guys and striking up random conversations to see if I could find someone else with that great conversation again. And I did. The guy was nice, liked some of the same nerdy interests with a lot of depth, worked in an area I was passionate about, and was about my age. We talked for a day or so. Then Tuesday Guy 2 said he was fishing with his best friend. Meanwhile I was e-stalking Guy 1s IG still obsessing and hurt over the rejection. I got to his tagged photos and to my horror I see Guy 2. His best friend I had never met before. Fuck. My. Life. Just about that time the conversation with Guy 2 went quiet. I figured if he texted again Id explain that I realized who he was and didnt feel comfortable talking anymore. But Im going to guess the two of them mustve compared notes and figured out they were dealing with the same girl because after that Guy 1 blocked me on everything. Completely deleted. That was on Tuesday. My emotions since then have been off the fucking charts. I genuinely feel pain in my chest I miss the guy so much. I had two good days in there where I felt like I could accepting things and be okay. But once I got back to my usual work environment I was wrecked again. I texted my best friend more this week about my vulnerability and emotions than I have in 5 years. She pretty well psycho-analyzed why this hurt (because he was the first guy I really saw a future with and Ive reached a comfortable point of success in my life where Im subconsciously wanting to share my life with a companion instead of continuing my casual ways but my actions of jumping into alcohol and physicality didnt display this.) Her words hit me so hard in the gut I actually had to go to the bathroom at work and throw up. Ive felt twisted up in knots ever since. I have this overwhelming guilt like I need to apologize. I want to apologize so badly for putting pressure on him, acting like a crazy person, putting him through a lot of stress, talking to his best friend not realizing who it was... Hes genuinely a good person. And I feel like such an ass. Ive tried to get advice from 3 level headed friends who all say I shouldnt say anything yet. But not saying anything is driving me crazy. They also are quick to dismiss his character because of the lack of a response, but Ive seen firsthand over the last ~4-5 months this is a really good guy who is great to his friends, usually handles unexpected situations well, and can be very rational. Ive typed up this big long note on my iPhone of all the things I want to say/apologize for. I guess the big question isdo I send it? Am I harassing him not respecting his wish to not hear from me? Or could I make amends for this god awful situation and maybe salvage some kind of friendship? Am I being selfishly minded here thinking of my feelings/guilty as a justification for what a dick I was? "

Everyone wants to feel like they're being listened to, but girls care very deeply about being listened to. It's a validation for them, but it's also a sign that you want them more than just physically. Ask questions about the things she says. If you can follow her conversation, you should be able to ask questions. Show her youre listening actively, not passively. Don't interrupt her. Interrupting a girl tells her that what you have to say is more important than what she has to say, which isn't always the case. Let her finish talking before you speak. 2.Whenever you get something, give back a little. It doesn't have to be clockwork, but the idea is important. If she gives you a massage, give her a foot rub the next day. If she writes you a romantic letter on vacation, write her a romantic note and give it to her when she gets back. You want her to see how much work you're putting into the relationship. Remember, you're a reciprocator, not a parasite. 3.Earn her trust. Be worthy of her trust. Guys may not care about it that much, but for girls, it's a really important issue: Trust helps them fend off guys until they've proven themselves. She won't truly let you inside until you show her you can be trusted. Do not show romantic interest in her friends. Not even a single one of them. Stay steady as an arrow and clean as a whistle. Always tell the truth, even if it hurts. Getting caught in a lie is much, much worse than fessing up to something unpleasant. 4.Include her with your friends. Let's face it  she may never be mistaken for ""one of the guys."" But you can make an effort to include her into the gang every once in a while. Girls like feeling included, especially with other guys. It tells her that you're comfortable with her at your side  even with your boys  and that you're not embarrassed to her around the people you care most about. 5.Share things about yourself that define you. Open up. Self-disclosure is essential to bonding and has been shown to promote happy relationships. Talk with her about your hopes, dreams and fears. Make sure the depth of these discussions is appropriate for the level of your relationship. Don't be an open book, but don't be afraid of showing her some vulnerability. Contrary to what you might think, vulnerability is sexy in her book, Talk about your favorite songs, movies, books, and memories. These seemingly little things play a big role in forming an emotional connection. Don't be put off if she doesn't like every single one of your interests. If she likes you, she'll put up with your Metallica even if she's a Miley kind of girl. 6.Ask her directly. Don't be afraid to ask her if there's anything you can do to make her happier, or make the relationship better. Sometimes, honesty is just what the doctor ordered. Instead of playing games and trying to figure out what's wrong by fitting together all the tiny puzzle pieces, be blunt and ask her what she needs and what she wants. If something's wrong or could be better, she'll tell you. Be prepared to at least think about what she'd have you do. 7.Show her verbal affection from time to time. Tell her how much she means to you, what she's good at, or even what you like about her. Say something like ""Remember the first time we met? I fell head over heels for you when I saw you standing there. It's like everything else seemed to disappear, kind of like tunnel-vision. You still do that to me."" A nicely placed compliment or endearment can make her heart melt. Don't overdo it. A nice compliment or ""I love you"" goes a long way every once in a while. But the more you use them, the cheaper they get. Remember, a diamond is valuable because it's so rare. 8.Make your enthusiasm contagious. Everyone loves to be around a positive person. Your demeanor and how you carry yourself can affect how happy she is both with and without you. Show that you're genuinely glad to see her. If your usual first reaction isn't a smile, there may be something wrong with the relationship. Consider hugging her or kissing her when you see her after a long day. If you're just having a bad day, put it aside and grin. Make a self-deprecating joke about how you always seem to attract trouble. Put a smile on your face and be done with it. 9.Don't treat her like she's an object. She's not a maid or a cleaning service; she's not your personal cook; she's not there to simply to satisfy all your carnal desires. Don't do things that might make her feel any of these things. Don't smack her on the butt. Look at her when you're talking to her. If she feels like a person instead of a thing that exists solely for your pleasure, she'll be much more likely to be happy with you. 10.Dont pressure her romantically. Theres nothing sexy about reluctant sex. Honestly, you'll get a lot more sex, and better sex, if she's just as ready as you are. If she seems hesitant, back off  even if she doesn't say anything. She may need more time to feel comfortable. Dont put out the wrong vibes. If she senses that youre impatient, she may grow distant  or worse yet, do something she regrets. Remember that no means no. Even if youve been together for years, its her body and shes under no obligation to share it with you. 11.Stay in shape and pay attention to your grooming. If you expect your girl to look like a Victoria's Secret model, how do you think she expects you to look? It's a double standard to expect girls to look great but to let your own grooming, hygiene, and exercise regimes to slip. Shave every day, unless your girl likes a man with a beard. If you happen to have a beard, trim it regularly and keep it looking under, not out of, control. Buy some semi-expensive gym clothes. If you buy gym clothes, you'll feel obligated to work out. If you feel obligated to work out, you won't skip out on your gym membership after school or at work. 12.Know when to give her space. Women are just as turned off by neediness as men. Learn to give her a little space once in a while, even if it means letting her hang out with other guys. Trust in her and she'll want to live up to your trust. Have a life of your own. A confident, independent person will never lack admirers. Don't force-feed a budding relationship with too much affection. This is unhealthy and will raise red flags. So, how to please a woman is a great knowledge.

239,vulnerability,dating_advice,I think a girl at work is giving me mixed signals,1,721q41,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/721q41/i_think_a_girl_at_work_is_giving_me_mixed_signals/,2017-09-24 09:31:40,"There's a girl at work I'm interested in and I think she feels the same way about me but I'm not quite sure. A while ago she asked me to get a drink with her after work and we went out and had a good time. Then a week or two later I asked her out and she declined and even seemed to be annoyed with me, so I didn't ask her again. Then a few weeks or so passed and she asked me out again, I accepted and once again we had a great time. Since then I've asked her out like two or three times and she always says no, I don't get it. I think she's physically attracted to me because she has made comments in the past that I'm a ""lady slayer"" etc. She is also receptive to flirting, like I can tell her I like her hair or I think she's sweet and she never seems to think it's creepy. But she does other weird stuff like never answering my texts or even looking at them, though I know she communicates by text because she does it a lot at work. To provide some more context, we are pretty culturally different: she's kind of Christian/conservative/rich, I'm not any of those. There's another guy who started working there and he fits that mold a little better than I do and she's seems to be a little nicer to him. Although, we've gone out since he started working there, so I don't think she's exclusively interested in him. Also, When I first started working there I showed interest in another girl, who rejected me, instead of her. Maybe she's holding a grudge over that, I don't know. Finally, I've been having trouble getting over a very long term relationship and I am still very raw. It makes me wonder if I am reading into this too much because of that, or if she is exploiting my vulnerability for her own personal reasons. So, what the hell is going on here? Is she negging me, is she using me to satisfy some need for male attention, is she just an asshole, should I just give up on her?"
240,vulnerability,dating_advice,The 5 Most useful resources for learning success with women,1,6zbvic,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6zbvic/the_5_most_useful_resources_for_learning_success/,2017-09-11 10:01:34,"**Theres more dating advice content available now then anyone could ever need. Unfortunately, a lot of that content is garbage. In fact, even some of the most popular Youtube channels and writers on the subject dont have any clue what theyre talking about. (check out pickup decoded for an example of this)** &amp;nbsp; Ive been actively involved in the community for five years now. Ive read all the books, watched all the videos, and bought all the products. When thinking about what content I came across that really made an impact, theres a few things that stand out. I want to share with you those nuggets of gold buried beneath the mountain of bullshit so that you can accelerate your results. &amp;nbsp; **Books** &amp;nbsp; **Models by Mark Manson** URL &amp;nbsp; Probably the most talked about seduction book on Reddit, and for good reason. This book isnt about techniques to trick a girl into sleeping with you, its about becoming a man of value who women will want to sleep with. I disagree with a few the points in the book, but for the most part its a lot of very solid mindset advice. After reading this book you will think differently about women and sexuality, in a way that will open a lot of doors for you (the sections about vulnerability and womens desire to be desired are particularly interesting). Highly recommended. &amp;nbsp; **The Trial: transform your dating life in eight weeks by Avery Hayden** URL &amp;nbsp; This is a shorter book, what I particularly like about it, is that its 100% action based. It teaches concepts about attraction, mindsets, etc. But this book is like a p90x for dating more than anything. Its a step-by-step process you can follow to get your dating life handled. &amp;nbsp; What stands out is that the challenges are well thought out, and the book teaches you how to learn from your pickup sessions effectively. In fact, it gives examples of a student going through the process, and its kind of like youre going through the challenges with them. Very cool idea, and I recommend this book because its very important to have structure around this, otherwise its very easy to go months or even years without making real progress (as Ive seen happen to many, many guys). &amp;nbsp; The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene URL &amp;nbsp; This book is incredibly well written, and it is fascinating. Its not so much about how to sleep with someone, as it is a book about how to make people fall in love. It uses powerful historical examples to illustrate how to really get people to invest in you. &amp;nbsp; Ive read this book at least 6 times, and I have to say of all the books Ive read this is the one book thats challenged my assumptions about how people tick more than any other. &amp;nbsp; The Videos &amp;nbsp; Frankly, a lot of the pickup channels on YouTube are cringey, theres only a few channels that are really worth diving into. &amp;nbsp; However, there are a few videos that are not only mind blowing, but capable of making a real difference in how you approach game. &amp;nbsp; The first one is: URL &amp;nbsp; This video is by the infamous Julien Blanc, and although its relatively short, it makes a very important point. Essentially, Julien explains that pickup is largely a self-fulfilling prophecy: if you believe you are attractive, women will feel that off you, and theres a much higher chance they will be attracted to you. If you believe youre unattractive, girls will feel that off of you, and run for the hills. &amp;nbsp; This video gives you a very practical strategy for intentionally mindfucking yourself into believe you are more attractive, so that- by extension- girls find you more attractive. &amp;nbsp; Tylers six steps to a consistently killer night: URL &amp;nbsp; This video lays out a very specific process you can follow when you go out so that you are not only very likely to have success with women, but also to have a great time in the process. &amp;nbsp; The video basically teaches you how to get in what psychologists call a flow state, and having used these steps for years now, I can say with confidence that there is real merit to these steps. &amp;nbsp; FIND WINGS &amp;nbsp; Its hypothetically possible to learn pickup on your own, but its not something Ive ever seen happen. Having wings is really helpful, especially when youre new. Even if youve never approached a girl, when you start hanging out with guys who do approach girls, youll start to feel pressured to do so because the people around you are doing it: peer pressure at its finest. Surrounding yourself with people with similar goals and motivations is extremely powerful, and theres really no excuse to not have some wings you know to go out with. With the internet its not hard to find wings, theres an inner circle group for every major city that you can join. Then you message people on the group or post to the page to start going out with people. Some of them will be weirdos, some will suck, but others will be genuinely cool dudes who are really trying to get this area of their life handled. TO find these groups on facebook, just look up: RSD Inner circle  Your city. Personally, I tried to learn this on my own, but I failed pretty hard until I met some wings. Those are, in my opinion, some of the best resources for learning game, check them out, let me know what you think. (And if theres something you think that needs to be on the list that Ive omitted feel free to suggest it) "
241,vulnerability,dating_advice,Would it be weird to start using pet names with him?,1,6zkki0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6zkki0/would_it_be_weird_to_start_using_pet_names_with/,2017-09-12 13:49:49,"I've been seeing this guy for 5 months now -- we've never had the exclusivity talk, but it's very obvious that we're only seeing each other. I tried to DTR with him about 2 months in, and back then he'd said he wasn't looking for anything serious, but it feels like things have gotten rather serious lately, so I'm unsure what the deal is. Anyways, he's used pet names on me like, 3 times now, but they were all during instances in which I was vulnerable. 1) I once woke up in the middle of the night, and he thought something was wrong, so he said ""are you okay, honey?"" 2) we got in a fight and I started crying, and he called me ""babe."" 3) he called me ""babe"" again over the weekend when I was throwing up from drinking too much and he was helping me out in the bathroom. I want to start using pet names with him too, but I'm very shy about it since we're technically not a real couple. Since he's only ever used these names on me when I've been in a state of vulnerability, would it be weird if I wanted to use them on him in our regular day-to-day speak? Should I start by waiting until he's also in a vulnerable state to call him a pet name, or should I just throw one in there during casual conversation one of these days? It's just hard, since I don't exactly what we are and I don't want to DTR again anytime soon. "
242,vulnerability,dating_advice,How To Develop God Tier Eye Contact | The real reason why you can't maintain strong eye contact with a woman.,11,6st2vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6st2vu/how_to_develop_god_tier_eye_contact_the_real/,2017-08-10 22:49:27,"##**The Eye Contact Problem**## I was on YouTube the other day when I stumbled across a video titled Video For Practicing Eye Contact. Surprisingly these types of video generate millions of views These videos usually have a beautiful girl looking at the camera, your challenge being to maintain eye contact? Wtf [**TLDR: Video Post**](URL Enough bullshit, its time for people to really understand the truth about eye contact. Failure to hold eye contact is a deep-seated issue; its not a technical one. The reason people cant maintain eye contact isnt due to the fact that they dont know how its because of the beliefs they hold that lead them to feel uncomfortable. Social Conditioning: Dont show attraction! Men have been emasculated by society. Many men feel ashamed of their own masculinity. They somehow feel that showing interest in a woman is wrong or taboo. They will go to great lengths to avoid eye contact with women. I partly blame these new age Feminazis for fucking up the biological male and female sexual chemistry (nothing against proper feminists). ##**The Deeper Issue**## More often than not, a failure to hold eye contact with a woman derives from an issue within. They say that the eyes are the gates to the soul, so when someone looks deep into our eyes a part of us feel vulnerable. This vulnerability is amplified if there are some unresolved issues within **yourself**! If you have a hint of self-loathing or low self-esteem, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. If you are not living your life in accordance with higher ideals, if you are not aligned with your personal values and ethics, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. Most potent of all, if you are ashamed of yourself, it will manifest itself in bad eye contact. Geeks that masturbate to their favourite anime character in their mum's basements at 3 AM will almost certainly never have good eye contact with a woman. People that engage in fraudulent activities (unless sociopaths) never have good eye contact. The issue isnt technical, as you can see its deeper than that. Confident Eye contact Having you shit together entails:  Having a clear mission in life  Having set values  Having personal ethics  Embracing your masculine energy  Having set boundaries A confident man with his shit together will never have an issue with eye contact. He will be comfortable with himself and feel at ease during a conversation. Why would you feel scared or vulnerable when youre at peace with yourself? How could a woman threaten you with her sexual essence? It cant happen for the confident man. ##**Steps to Building Eye-Contact**## Here are some real practical steps to help you build your eye contact. **1.** Dont watch fucking practice eye contact videos on YouTube **2.** Find out what deeper issue is causing the eye contact problem and promise yourself to resolve it. **3.** Start practising eye contact on **REAL** people, if you are nervous look at the spot between their eyebrows. You should, however, move onto their eyes. **4.** Dont stare; use appropriate breaks during the conversation (usually every 5-10 seconds but depends on the person you are talking to). **5.** Focus on one eye, you cant focus on both at the same time (try it). **6.** When talking to a group, spread your eye contact evenly amongst each person. Dont block anyone out and focus too intensely on one person. **7.** Dont open your eyes too wide like a fish, you can blink this isnt a staring competition. **8.** If you are feeling awkward, thats good. You are getting out of your comfort zone; soon this shit will be a breeze. **9.** Prosper ##**Game changer**## Once you improve your eye contact you will notice more women being attracted to you. Eye-contact is one of the best non-verbal cues for confidence. When you can talk to a girl while looking her dead in the eyes you stand out. You stand out because most emasculated men are ashamed to do it. They cant do it. Now I want you to go out there and experiment with this. If it helped you, come back to this thread and share your success story. "

I feared getting an erection so I removed hugging from my life. * When I was younger, I would always have a girl friend to hang out with. I had a sister too. I knew girls early on through interaction but when puberty started I felt my personality shifting and I tried to hold on for an extremely long time to my old self. * I purged my sexual thoughts with masturbation, online sexual rps, and later hypnosis. My actions were still being controlled but at least in-person (and in my perspective the most dangerous to be controlled) was somewhat nullified. * Masturbating without intimacy was indirectly making me treat them like a never ending loop of sexual objects. * At the age of 15, I believed the only way to date was to have a job, a house, a car, a good personality, and skills. The only thing I knew how to do then was video games and school work. So I did that to the point of obsession, ignoring my physical fitness. * All my life I have either been flirted by girls or teased. The teasing stuck the hardest, but the flirting made me question my reality. I would freeze up. My sister would point out all of the girls look at me yet that concept was just completely foreign.

I nervously refused. * During college, I used okcupid and omegle for my primary interaction with women. When I met, I just felt so cold. When I searched, I felt so alone and not a human.

246,vulnerability,dating_advice,How to Overcome The Insecurities You Don't Know You Have,1,6djctl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6djctl/how_to_overcome_the_insecurities_you_dont_know/,2017-05-27 06:09:20,"Acting like you dont care what people think is a symptom of caring way too much. Listening to criticism and emotional feedback, and thinking about it objectively, on the other hand, is a symptom of deep self-confidence. This kind of honest scrutiny is difficult because its when we feel the most fragile parts of our self-image are under attack that we get emotionally reactive. Those points of vulnerability are the parts of our identity we defend most vigorously. The flaws you need to become aware of most are those that are the hardest to accept because they dont fit into your self-concept. Accomplishing this is fundamentally challenging, but extremely powerful. Not too long ago, my friends started to call me overly competitive. Instead of saying, What makes you think that? I would reply with an offhanded (and intentionally cocky) response like, A god does not compete with mortals. I was sarcastic so I could avoid confronting the issue. I didnt respond with an open mind when I got called out on a bad social habit, that deep down, I knew I needed to change. I dealt with my exposed insecurity by brushing it under the rug with sarcasm. Addressing this issue with an open mind was the only way to overcome my biggest insecurities, but I blinded myself to the possibility that it was even an issue. Months after I had begun getting called out on my hyper-competitiveness, I finally saw my insecurities rear their ugly head. I was in a small college writing class, and one student was answering most of the discussion questions. His answers were well-thought-out and added substantial value to the discussion. But I got frustrated, I told myself he was an attention whore and that he should let other people contribute more. In reality, he wasnt an attention whore, most of the other students didnt even have something to contribute. I wasnt frustrated because he was hungry for attention, I was frustrated because I was hungry for attention. I saw the class as a social competition, and he was winning. I had an emotional need to be the main guy in the class. I was jealous that someone else was charismatic, engaging, and intelligent. I was butthurt by the fact that he was offering more to the discussion than I was. Until I realized what I was doing in that class, all the emotions I felt and decisions I made because of my machismo-infused competitiveness went completely unnoticed by me. Beforehand, when people complained that I was too competitive, I consciously assumed they were jealous of me in some way (the irony is that even my thinking about my competitiveness was competitive without my awareness). Resistance is a Compass That Point to True North Blindspots to our own flaws are completely natural, and you cant expect to be so perfectly aware that you have a totally accurate self-image. However, it is possible to become more aware of your flaws and bad social habits, but it requires a counterintuitive approach. Remember that when you feel uncomfortable, the dialogue you tell yourself cannot be trusted because criticism and self-doubt put your ego on defense. Unfortunately, the voice in your head prioritizes the protection of your current self-image over open-minded self-reflection. Instead, listen to your emotions. Whatever makes you emotionally reactive can become a goldmine for personal growth. When an interaction makes you angry, anxious, jealous, etc., Thats where you can be sure you have insecure self-beliefs that you are not consciously aware of. Listen to your emotions much more closely than to the voice in your head. Admit to yourself that the fact you are upset is telling you something that you probably dont want to hear. Once you come from this vulnerable, open-minded starting point, then and only then, you can start to accurately analyze what is causing you to feel emotional discomfort. This process is difficult in a culture that teaches people to place blame on everyone but themselves. However, when you start assuming responsibility for your emotional reactions to people, situations, and criticism, you can accurately root out the instance when you are (at least partially) at fault. There are instances in which your emotional reactivity is warranted, but usually, emotional discomfort is indicative of something you should be working on internally. Slip Into Your Shadow What frustrates us about others tends to be what were afraid of in ourselves. If you hate men who regularly sleep with girls on the first date, most likely youre either secretly jealous and unable to admit this to yourself, or you think that what hes doing is disrespectful and youre afraid that youre capable of acting the same way if youre not careful. Either way, this is saying a lot about your values and your insecurities, and very little about the other person. I have a friend who is extremely uncomfortable around anyone whos a bit socially awkward. He will complain about how weird some guys are and treat them like shit. In his mind, this treatment is fair; these socially awkward people deserve to be treated poorly because theyre awkward. But what he doesnt admit to himself is that he is terrified of being socially awkward himself. These people trigger him not because theyre socially awkward, but because hes afraid of the possibility that he might be socially awkward too. This is an example of what famed psychologist Carl Jung calls the shadow. The shadow is all of the pieces of our identity/ego that we keep hidden from ourselves. My friend is so terrified of being awkward, that he will not do anything that makes him feel vulnerable. In fact, he will regularly dare me to pull unusual stunts in public when we go out, like approaching a girl with an awkward pickup line (Is it hot in here? Or is that just the holy spirit burning inside of you?) Numerous times after completing his challenge, I gave him a similar task and he always became visibly nervous and refuses to do it. To this day, he hasnt done a single thing that he thought was socially uncalibrated, even when offered money to do so as a bet. His fear of being socially awkward is understandable (yet irrational), but what makes it so powerful is that he wont admit to himself that he has this fear. The only way he can come to terms with his own insecurities is by assuming that his emotional discomfort is reflective of his own flaws instead of placing the blame on others. Realizations likes this catalyze significant change, yet this is always emotionally challenging. It requires a mindset shift towards your own negative emotions. You must realize that emotional resistance isnt something to avoid, but something to lean into and learn from. Negative emotions arent bad, theyre revealing a point of vulnerability in your own self-concept. Negative emotions are signposts for your own neurotic and insecure beliefs, and theyre screaming at you to become aware of this to make a change. As soon as you see these emotions as signals, as opportunities for growth, they transform from something to be avoided, to something to be sought out purposefully.

At the same time she's very observant and it feels like she can see through me since I'm a very open and laid-back person. I'm uncomfortable about this imbalance. Last time we met she said she didn't think we could be platonic friends to begin with. So that means she's cool with me being her lover right? Either way I'm unsure whether I should continue this physical relationship and hope that she'll develop feelings or if I should cut my losses as soon as possible to avoid further heartbreak. Maybe if I continue having sex on the regular with her I'm able to see her flaws and her true character? "

I met her over Tinder. She hit all the right buttons for me: Shes intelligent, funny, kind and physically attractive. I took the plunge after bantering for a week and invited her out two weeks ago for drinks. We had a good time and she enjoyed it, so I texted her after if shed like dinner sometime last week. The restaurant we wanted was over-booked, so we settled somewhere else. Again, it just seems we never run out of topics to talk about. I asked her out again yesterday for dinner at the overbooked restaurant earlier and we opened up on our backgrounds. I learned her parents are separated. Curiously she said, When youre from a divorced family, I view all relationships with a lot of cynicism. I dont think Id ever love anyone. Question 1: Im mostly confused. Is she directing it at all relationships shes going to have (including with me) or just voicing out her vulnerability? I was honestly a bit stunned, but I told her something to the effect like We accept the love we think we deserve or some regrettable shit-grin talk I could muster. Is she on to me? Question 2: How do I keep things interesting or progress from here on? We had drinks first date, dinner (but not where we really wanted to go) on the second, dinner and drinks at her choice for the third and Im totally at a lost of what to do next. Any interesting suggestions?"
249,vulnerability,dating_advice,Why guys won't make the first move?,1,69wzjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/69wzjm/why_guys_wont_make_the_first_move/,2017-05-08 19:06:20," I recently met up with a guy I met 2.5 years ago. 2.5 years ago- he ended up being a jerk to me for no reason on the phone and kind of cut ties suddenly. We had been on a few dates, did some photo shoots. Maybe we had fooled around I can't really remember. i'm a really attractive female, sexy, hot and I know i give off some crazy sexual vibe. In the past I had experiences where males would purposely not make a move on me, and some did it in a sadistic way- wanting me to make the move and there was this tension. B/c I can read the game I don't make that move b/c for these kinda jerk guys its some kind of power trip or game and they want me to be asking 'them' for sex rather than the other way around. My crazy ex who was a sociopath played this game with me. They want to project their desire for me onto me, and make themselves be the ones in power. This guy I met again- told me about how he met some crazy female and married her, and in 6 months, she used him, abused him and took half his money and divorced him. She was awful and bad. But he seemed to let her do it and was almost happy about it it seems i duno. You'd think he learned his lesson? He abused and mistreated a beautiful awesome female, ditched her then ended up marrying some psychopath from hell and got used badly. So he meets me again- you think he'd be nice to me. He was acting passive aggressive it seems. We went to 'dinner' but it seems he wanted to 'stay in' which meant 'something sexual."" At dinner it seems he didn't want to spend much money, though he claims to make over six figures. I had to force ordering a burger though in fear. I drank 3 drinks, and was buzzed. During dinner he did some rude things that made me almost want to leave. He started acting weird and jerkish and also kept talking about his ex so much I had to ask him to stop. So he's already being a jerk to me in some way. We went back to my place. I'm buzzed and I think my vibe was showing i was interested. He def was but he didn't make a move on me and played the thing where he wanted me to make the move. But it wasn't out of fear- like i said ive dealt with guys like this and its a power game- they want to force you to make the first move and they play this poker face game but project all their sexual desire onto you. It's awful- the tension is absurd and you have to sit there feeling them repress all their desire for you waiting for you make a move. But again its a power thing. its a sadistic passive aggressive thing- its in no way any form of respect, fear- its just them being jerks. My ex who was a psycho did it. In no WAY will they make any move when theyre playing this game. He did say something like ""well i found u attractive, but of course just b/c i do doesn't mean I can misbehave."" So to him making a move on a woman is misbehaving? wtf? Most normal males always say something like ""well why don't you come sit here"" or ""can i sit next to you"" or they start talking about something such as trying to gear towards something sexual. What I mean is- normal males will easily show that 'vulnerability' or desire for a woman and try to make something happen. Even shy guys might be 'shy' but still give off lots of body language signals heck even they make moves. But when people play this kind of game they want you badly but try to get u to make the first move. It's a power thing- they want to show no desire or vulnerability and wait until you show it. It turns into a weird awful situation. Can some male further elaborate on this game- and why some guys do it in this sadistic way to make a woman suffer and to not let anything happen? "
250,vulnerability,dating_advice,A Guide to Authentic Online Dating,1,6aagl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/6aagl9/a_guide_to_authentic_online_dating/,2017-05-10 13:44:46,"Online dating is high on my vulnerability list. I havent dated in just over a year and the last time I did it was with a guy who was passive aggressive and scared me enough to recluse back into the hole Id crawled out of. Now Im venturing out into the new territory of online dating, and my my, what a minefield it is. From a womans point of view we get inundated with messages, some creepy, some lovely but lots of them, often. From a guys point of view Ive heard they get ghosted, preyed upon (hello cougars) and viscously demonised from women whove been hurt in the past (ouch, sorry dudes). Some of the online dating world seems to be a full on fight until the death. But some of us are ducking the bullets and waving the white flag as we search for authentic beings who are acting from their heart and not their ego. #1  Slow things down In the world of instant gratification that we now live in, it can be difficult to take things slow. Especially when we have that buzz of excitement when we find out someone who we like, is also interested in us. Suddenly we can race away with thoughts of our first date, and what theyre like and before we know it weve created a whole world based on a few pictures and some black and white text. An imaginary illusion created by our own expectations of someone who weve never even met before. Even when we do meet them, we can continue to race into the fantasy of what weve created without even knowing whether theyre on board. When we find out theyre not, our hopes crash and burn leaving us feeling dropped from heaven in a sad little mess. And over what? Someone who dont actually know that well, but who we heavily invested in the illusion of. To escape the rollercoaster of these intense ups and downs the trick is to slow things down. This allows us to see the reality and take every message and meeting for what it is  an opportunity to get to know someone. It takes quite a while to get to know who someone really is and when it comes to dating it more important than ever to take the time to get to know a person, especially if we are looking for someone to share marriage and having children with. These big life decisions take a lot of time and energy investment so doesnt it make sense to spend time collecting the knowledge to make an educated decision? Keep checking in with your feelings regularly to figure out if you genuinely like the person or if you genuinely like the idea of them. You will only truly know someone if you take the time to get to know them truly. #2  Dont present an image of yourself, let them find out who you are This is a tricky one because all the dating sites have an about me section and this can leave a lot of temptation to describe who we think we are. Try to avoid presenting an image of who you think you are and instead let that person find out who you are. You know, like back in the day when we all used to meet up a few times over a long period and let each others personality unravel naturally. There was none of this Im this kind of person, and I do x, y and z. Instead we just used to have conversations about stuff and hope that we had something common to chat about (given that wed probably like the look of each other if wed already been drawn to conversing). Stick to talking about the things you do in your life and what you like. The person on the other end will start to figure out who you are based on your attitude and your actions. If they like what they hear/see theyll stay, if not let them go and move on to the next. If anything thats the beauty of online dating  lots of variety right at your finger tips. #3  Focus on the experience, not the results Online dating is not a transaction. Its not like were at a cattle market measuring up the animals against our never ending check list of what were looking for. As a western society we need to step away from this idea that there is this perfect result at the end of the game for us, whether that is the house, car and 2.4 children or any result in fact. Online dating, like all of lifes lessons is about enjoying the experience regardless of the result. Have a laugh with it and take it for what it is  a place to meet, converse and potentially find a person to enjoy new experiences with. If someone doesnt message you back, try not to get upset over it. If someone messages you who youre not into, tell them thanks but Im not interested. Yes its a shame when we hope to find love instantaneously and it seems like were not getting anywhere fast but focus on enjoying the experience and the journey will seem shorter. #4  Have fun and show your playful side Imagine this, youre in a bar and there are some sexy people who you like the look of at the opposite end of the room. Some have stern faces and seem to make snide comments at people who approach them. Some are smiling and laughing, generally having fun and looking approachable. Some are staring right at you with needy looks on their faces, longing for you to approach them. Who would you go and speak to first? Personally Im going to approach the smiling, laughing fun group, because they look like fun to hangout with. Well, online dating works on the same principles  people will approach you based on how approachable you seem to be. Obviously this is subjective to each person but for me this starts with a smile, because to me that shows that the person is enjoying life, because if Im going to spend my time with someone then I want to do it with someone who would add to my life not take away from it. I also like messages from people who sound fun and approachable too because it makes me want to converse with them, rather than questions that make me feel like Im being measured up against a check list. I think like this with my own profile too, fun pics of me doing things I enjoy and light hearted conversations that are usually full of banter. Youll always attract what you put out, so if youre not getting the type of responses you want, start with looking at what youre sending. #5  Dont take things personally People will always bring their own shit and most of the time they wont be aware of it. We all have our own shit. Them, you and me too. The trick is to try and be aware of it so we dont bring it to the dating table and to also not take it personally when it heads our way. Thats not to say that we should accept maltreatment or not call people out when they treat us bad (if youve read any of my other blogs youll know that Im the first to call out low moral standards). What Im saying is that it doesnt do us justice to attach our own self worth on the opinion of others, especially someone who we barely know. We live in a culture that judges quickly based on little information and on the battlefield of online dating there are some twisty daggers at play. Negativity and resentment can build up pretty quickly if we take every little thing personally, so dont take it on board and move on to someone who sends you the kind of messages you do want. Eventually youll attract the person you want with the positivity you shine out. To really step into authentic online dating, it helps to take it out of online realm as soon as possible because you will only start to really know someone when you know how you feel about them. You know when you get that subconscious inkling of it just feels right or something is a bit off here. This doesnt mean violating rule number one and running into a dating scenario fast. It means gathering more information in a face to face situation so that your subconscious can pick up on things that your conscious might not, then you can be more true to yourself. This isnt the easiest guide to follow in the world, and as with all my blogs it requires a great deal of self awareness and mindfulness. It is achievable though and there are authentic and conscious people using online dating platforms,with this guide I hope you find them. Happy searching. Some great appsURL URL URL"

Since then, I've been on many, many dates. At times it was a coping mechanism to distract me, or to not have to deal with being alone. For a period, I was actively looking for something serious. In all that time, I met no one who I ""connected"" with. Then, this past winter I realized I couldn't expect someone else to like me until I liked me. I quit dating. I haven't been on a date this calendar year. I've spent the past few months entirely self focused and improving, and now that I'm doing better, I'm lonely. I want to date, I want to ultimately meet someone. Now with the intention of finding a connection, rather than finding ""the one."" However, I'm finding the process more emotionally taxing than ever. I have a much harder time even finding a date (attributing this to being more selective and less tolerant of BS.) I often find myself struggling with the thoughts of ""Why aren't I good enough? Why does no one want me?"" I'm at a point where I feel like I'm ready to meet someone and see where it goes, but the entire dating process devastates me. I'm independent, and I'm so happy with the progress I've made, but I am extremely lonely. I want a companion, and I recognize that I have no choice but to put myself out there if I want to change the situation. However, the vulnerability is having such a negative effect on me emotionally. Is there anyone who can relate to this? Anyone who can offer words of encouragement or advice?"

It's a very good read, but here is the part that spoke to me the most: ""The important thing to remember is that when someone ghosts you, it says nothing about you or your worthiness for love and everything about the person doing the ghosting. It shows he/she doesnt have the courage to deal with the discomfort of their emotions or yours, and they either don't understand the impact of their behavior or worse dont care. In any case they have sent you an extremely loud message that says: I dont have what it takes to have a mature healthy relationship with you. Be the better person, retain your dignity, and let him/her go peacefully. Dont allow someone elses bad behavior to rob you of a better future by losing your vulnerability and shutting yourself off from another relationship. Keep your energy focused on doing what makes you happy. Know that if you are someone who treats people with respect and integrity then the ghoster simply wasnt on your wavelength and someone better is coming your way, as long as you keep your heart open and your focus forward.""

If I'm not, well I think the title says it all. I'm a sophomore in college, proud active member of an SEC college Greek scene, and it's the first time I felt the desire to date again. Don't get me wrong, I've dated in the past but it happened in a more natural manner rather than actually 'looking' for someone to matchmake myself in particular mediums like Tinder, frat parties and etc. Mostly, I hooked up with women we party with. Obviously enough, women from our frat parties were either not interested to date or either taken. For tinder, I went out to several dates with this chick from another college and it was great each time. At the end of our 2nd date, we ended up sleeping together every after date until our 5th date. So after having sex, I asked if we're going with the labels already, then she said, ""I think you're great, sweet, funny and an attractive guy. The sex is great too but I just don't think you're somewhat open and I don't feel any vulnerability"" So after that, I was confused. What am I doing wrong? Am I too hung up on ""hook up mentality"" from being surrounded by a lot of different women at our parties? Did I not reveal enough information about myself? All answers will be appreciated."

In a world where you can get tips and perspectives from anyone or anywhere on the Internet, theres no shortage of advice. And a lot of it flat out justdoesntwork. Theres good intentions in the advice but when it comes to real-world practicality, men are still having to try hard to get the connection they want Which personally I believe should be easy and effortless, not confusing and difficult. When I was younger I really wanted to understand women and relationships. I was a computer programmer, web designer, avid video game player. But I felt clueless when it came to women. Like most guys connected to the Internet, I went searching for help. Unlike most guys, I invested over $20,000 into different bootcamps, seminars, products, and coaches into learning this stuff. Not to mention the thousands of hours I put into applying the advice I got. I first started off 7 years ago with an e-book on how to date girls in college. Its been a journey since then  Ive had one-night stands, polyamorous relationships, monogamous relationships, and everything in-between. Ive battle-tested all the different techniques, perspectives, and paradigms that I could possibly find when it comes to dating and relationships. And at the end of it all, heres what I realized What actually works is completely counter-intuitive and contrary to the advice I had been given. Even from the professionals, the gurus, and the best of the best. And so my intention with this post is to share with you the wisdom Ive learned through my own personal experiences, to the best of my ability, in the hopes that it will simplify your dating life completely so that you can move on towards growth in other areas of your life. I spent countless nights suffering in confusion about this stuff, when deep down I just wanted to have a stable sense of how attraction, connection, and relationships worked. I hope this post can save you the time I spent and offer some perspective that can lead to an amazing relationship in your life. Heres what youll learn in this post: * How to develop attractiveness towards women on a fundamental level, beyond the need for pickup lines, trying-hard, or approaching * How to get to a place where women approach you and pick you up, not the other way around * One widely-applicable exercise that you can do anywhere, any place, that will improve your connection to women over and over again. **About The Anti-Method** My approach with dating can be summed up as follows: The Anti-Method. Its basically the complete opposite of what guys are taught. Here are some real-world examples, of my own experience, of how the dating game using this way of operating has worked for me. **How I Met Jenny** I was eating dinner by myself at one of my favorite restaurants. It was a casual night where I spent time chatting it up with the people next to me and enjoying my time. I walked out of the restaurant, and while I was half-way down the sidewalk, a woman comes out of the restaurant and runs after me shouting. Hey, hey! I turn around. Havent we met before? she says. I didnt talk to her in the restaurant, nor had I met her before, nor did she look familiar. But she was cute, and I was intrigued that she came running after me, so I continued chatting with her. She went on to tell me that she didnt know what came over her and that she just felt compelled to leave the restaurant and come talk to me. I asked why and she said I dont know, there was just something about you. We went back inside for a drink, hit it off, and started dating seriously a few weeks later. Turns out she was an artist and was in a feature film that was released in theaters. Not only was she a badass with her work, but she had an incredible heart and dating her was healing on so many different levels. This wasnt the only time I experienced this. **Getting picked up at the bar** I went to a bar with a friend, and about an hour later, a woman bumped into me. She looked at me and said excuse me, but had a coy look on her face that told me that it really wasnt an accident. She scurried off, and 10 or so minutes later I walked to go to the bathroom. She came and found me, asked me if I was single, and told me I was cute and that she wanted my number. We went on a date a couple days later, with only one text-exchanged, which was Bitter bar at 8pm? (a local bar here in Boulder, Colorado). Super simple, no pickup lines, no trying, super simple. And this pattern wasnt just happening to me **The time I took a friend to a bar** I took a close friend to a bar to show him how he could apply my viewpoint on dating, and also to see if it was just me that women were responding to. I was wondering if it was just me or if this is something that could be taught. I rarely go to bars, and my friend doesnt go to bars either. Especially not just to see how women responded to him. This was a first-time experience for him. After a couple of hours, a cute hippie chick approached him and wanted to dance with him. They danced for a little, and as far as I could tell, didnt really exchange many words. They stopped dancing and he came to join me, saying that that was an interesting experience. (He later told me that she whispered in his ear I dont know why but I feel like I can trust you.) A few minutes later the girl came back up to him, asked him to hold out his arm, and then she wrote her number on his arm with a sharpie she had in her purse. She said she was having a party later and to text her for the address. We both went to the party later that evening and had a great time. **How I Met Alex** When I moved to Boulder, Colorado a few years ago I hardly knew anyone outside of a few friends that I had when I moved. So I took the opportunity to go to as many events as possible, and when I was invited to something, Id attend. One of my friends threw a barbecue every week during one of the Summers. There were always new people there and so I went regularly to get to know them and tap into the community around me. I had one conversation with one woman about some hobbies, for a couple minutes or so, and didnt really think of it that much. A week later I get a message from the woman that said that I came up a few times in conversation with other people and asked if we could get together. We got together to grab a tea and instantly felt chemistry that went on to form the longest relationships Ive ever had. **Ive been thinking about you** Im going to throw this story in here because it makes me laugh every time I think about it. I met this woman over 7 years ago when I was deathly afraid of women. She was super cute, and I at the time thought I wanted to marry herbut regardless, I was too nervous to ask her out and didnt have the confidence that the pick-up stuff I was reading told me I needed to have. So I let it go and beat myself up for it. A year after I met her, I ran into her again through a mutual friend. I was still crushing on her, but with (still) no confidence, and the fact that she had a boyfriend, I let it go and forgot about it. A few year after that and a text exchanges during that time period, I get a random message from her that said something along the likes of Hey, my little secret but I just masturbated to the thought of you and it was fantastic. We met up a few months later when we were in the same city and had a fun time in the backseat of my car. **Holiday shenanigans** Over the holidays, I went to a bar in a local town with a few friends. I dont know anyone in the town, but I wanted to spend some time with my friends so I went. At the bar, a couple of girls approached us and sparked up a conversation. We talked for 10 minutes or so, and because they were with some guy friends, they left to go to another bar. A few minutes later, both of the girls come back, and one of them tells me I really wanted to give you my number so I came back. Can I put my number in your phone? I gave her my phone and she put her name followed by Cute chick you met at the bar whos super cool. I couldnt help but laugh because that was the same technique I was taught in some pick-up book years ago, and now the woman was using it on me. **Notes on the experiences** The aim of sharing these experiences is to show you the range of experiences that can happen when you apply the principles that Im going to teach you in this post. You could end up meeting a woman you date seriously for a few years, have a one-night stand, or meet some pretty cool women that youre friends with for the rest of your life. Now, its important to note that while I spent 7 years studying the whole pickup stuff, it wasnt until I started applying the anti-method that all of these experiences happened. It was like a light-switch turned on, where seemingly random and amazing connections happened consistently, over and over again. And its not just me. Ive had friends and clients tell me similar stories where before theyd never had any real consistent success before with the other things that theyve tried. Its been proven to me that when a man has a full understanding of the anti-method, he doesnt have to spend years learning pickup, approach 1000 girls to get their confidence up, or learn to say the right thing or anything like that. By the end of this post, youll be able to apply this methodology as well to have an effortless dating life and begin to create the relationships that you want without trying hard at all. Ready to dive in? **How It Works** The common element in what caused all of the experiences I previously mentioned to happen is that I fully understood and applied the energetic dynamics of how attraction works. Its a myth that attraction happens externally with the things that you say and the things that you do. Attraction happens underneath the surface, at a subconscious level, when a mans energy and a womans energy are correctly polarized. Ill get into that in a minute. First, I want to make it clear that this isnt about quick fixes or temporary solutions to the dating game. Once fully understood and put into practice, these energetic dynamics will be embedded into your body and will improve your level of attractiveness in permanent way, without you having to think about it. At this point you may be askinghow does it work? Lets get to it. **Dating Energetics Explained: The Gravity Metaphor** To increase your level of attractiveness in a permanent way, the first thing to understand is how your energy works. The best way I can explain how this works is with an analogy. Think of yourself like the Sun. You are the center of your solar system. There are planets orbiting you, like Mars, Jupiter, etc. These planets represent the people in your life  friends, family, women, etc  all orbiting to various degrees of depth in relation to you. How people interact with you is much like how planets interact with the Sun. The Suns gravitational pull affects each planet differently and how they orbit the Sun. Its why certain planets are closer than others and why some arent in its orbit and reside in other solar systems. Their magnetic fields either line up, or dont. Theyre either polarized or not. This video by NASA does a good job of explaining how this works: [NASA Video: Understanding the Magnetic Sun](URL To make this happen, the Sun isnt really doing anything. Its just burning, doing its thing. Its not saying I need to attract these planets into my orbit or asking how do I bring them closer. Its simply being. The process of planets orbiting the Sun is naturally-occurring process of life. Relationships with women work the same way. The only big difference is that people have an ego. The ego is an attraction destroyer. It serves its purpose, and theres nothing wrong with it, however when it comes to attraction the ego gets in the way of the natural attraction process between men and women. Its de-polarizing. With the ego, the dating game feels like an uphill battle where you can never seem to go on a date with someone, or they always flake, or they want to be just friends. A romantic relationship is always out of reach, or at least the one that youre truly wanting is always one step away. With less and less of it, women in your life operate like planets to the Sun  they start to orbit you. Theyll orbit in your physical space, through social media, through friends-of-friends, through work, etc. They could be close or in a different solar system, but they are in fact there. How close they are in your orbit is dictated by the gravitational field that you have. Your energy. The stronger your energy is  the stronger your gravitational field is  the more naturally attractive you are. Meaning that as your gravitational field becomes stronger, you have to work less in order to connect with women in your life. Less effort. Less trying-hard. Less games. But how do you upgrade your energy? How do you upgrade your gravitational field? **How To Upgrade Your Energy and Improve Your Gravitational Field** **Principle #1  Releasing Expectations and Agendas** The first thing that any man needs to do to upgrade his gravitational field and improve his natural polarity with women is to learn to relate to women without expectations and agendas. What are expectations and agendas? An expectation is any place in which you are attempting to force your external reality to get a specific result. With an expectation/agenda, theres a concrete notion of I want things to happen this way and only this way or This is what I want so I have to go get it. This is the ego talking. For instance, most men are trying to figure out what to say to ask a girl on a date How to get her to be his girlfriend How to attract THAT girl And to fulfill that expectation, most guys go and do something about it  like approach multiple women at the bar. Again, expectations can show up as: this is the result I want + what do I need to go do externally in order to get it. When actions are rooted from that type of mindset of expecting a certain result, which often happens subconsciously, it destroys the natural attraction process and reduces the mans energy field dramatically . Has a woman ever flaked on you and you got pissed or down on yourself? Has a woman ever told you one thing and then did another and it upset you? Has a woman you thought was attractive flirt with some other guy and you got jealous or even depressed? If so, these are prime examples of your expectations getting broken. Heres the thing about women. In the dating game, they will continue to break your expectations over and over again until you can learn to let go of them. If you go to bar trying to pickup women, two things will either happen: 1) you wont pick up a woman because she can feel like youre trying to pick her up, or 2) you get REALLY good at saying the right thing to disarm her natural defenses, and manipulate her into sleeping with youbut not only does this feel shitty for you (and her) at the end of the night, but its a LOT of work! But as you let go of your expectations of trying to pick-up women or get them to respond in a certain way to you through external means, you become MORE attractiveANDyou become MORE attracted to women. Your ability to FEEL becomes heightened, you become more sensitive to your environment, and the amount of connection that you can have with women becomes exponentially higher. This is because as you let go of expectations, you give yourself an opportunity to need nothing from women and live in a state of unconditional love. This is very attractive to women, and feels very good for you. **Principle #2  Handling Insecurities and Processing Emotions** When a man lets go of his expectations of trying to do anything specific with women (like pick them up, try to sleep with them, or figure out how to ask them on a date), it puts him into a state of raw vulnerability. As his expectations leave, his ego leaves. His heart starts to open and he will start to feel emotions that have been buried up for years. This process can be scary and very confusing. Expectations in the dating game, from a core level, are created when there is a feeling of fear underneath. An insecurity. This could show up as feeling like you arent worthy of love, feeling like youre doing something wrong, feeling like you arent enough. They are also created from past relationships when things ended badly, or if there are misunderstandings about yourself or women in general. Its beyond the scope of the article to go into detail into why those expectations are created, however what you need to know for now is that as you release expectations, or as they get broken, the insecurities that created those expectations will surface. Its important to stay with your emotions and feel them in the moment as they arise. Like I said, this can be extremely confusing. How to navigate your emotions is highly situational and circumstantialand its not something I can cover in one article. **Principle #3  Trust** Finally, when a man is releasing his expectations and staying current with his emotions, the final part to upgrading his energy and gravitational field is to TRUST. Because it is vulnerable to not have any expectations with women, it can seem like initially that youre getting further and further away from women. Let this process unfold, and stay trusting that once things settle and the insecurities underneath the expectations are handled, women will be attracted to you more than ever. Its important to know that as a man continues to let go of his expectations and address his insecurities, all of the typical dating problems fall out the window. You dont have to think about whens the right time to text her. You dont have to think about whats the right thing to say. You dont have to try to be confident. You just have to beyou. Your gravitational field will upgrade moment after moment, and at a certain point, a woman will come into your orbit like I demonstrated in the stories at the beginning of this article. The beautiful thing about this methodology is that when a woman comes into your orbit in this way, the bond between you is based on your GRAVITY. Its based on reality without any external effort from you. When that happens, you can viscerally feel and know when theres chemistry between you and a woman. You can know that when you feel that chemistry its not because youre trying to force it, but because the woman is actually attracted to you for who you are, and not what youre saying or youre doing. Thats why in my example above I could just text the girl one line to meet up, and she met me there. No pickup lines or anything fancy. I could feel the energy between us and it was undeniable. That feeling is based on the energy of who you two ARE, and that is impossible to fake or lie about when you sense it. Watch the video below for a visual representation of how this works. [Anti-Method Visual Explanation](URL **Putting The Anti-Method Into Practice** The following exercise is something that you can go do immediately to start understanding how your energy affects your environment. Keep in mind that this isnt a one-off exercise. This is a continual practice that shows better results over time. The more you do this and the more you gain an awareness of the energetic dynamics, the more natural this process will become and it will eventually become a habit. **Step 1.** Go to a public place  a coffee shop, a strip mall, a friends party, a bar, etc. **Step 2.** Find a place in the middle, or a place that has the highest traffic. For instance, when I went to the bar with my friend, we stood right in the middle where the most people walk/hang out at. The reason for this is that in the spot with the most attention you can gain more awareness to the expectations in your field, that once broken, would expand your field of gravity. **Step 3.** Make a choice to yourself that although you could leave this spot, you want to stay put and do nothing. The reason for this is that when youre continually moving, its hard to see what your orbit is looking like and very difficult to sense what youre gravitational field is doing. **Step 4.** Wait. Do nothing. Notice the places in which youre drawn to do something externally  like talk to someone, get a drink, go to the bathroom, check your phone, and start to notice the place in yourself in which thats coming from. Its very easy to rationalize I need to get another drink but if you pay attention to your emotional state, youll start to be able to see that it could be a coping mechanism to prevent yourself from feeling awkward or anxious. The rationalizations are a clue that expectations are in your field  the very things that are stifling your attractiveness. Rather than avoiding them, stay in the same spot and see what emotions come up underneath. **Step 5.** This is where things may start to get uncomfortable, as the insecurities in your body will start to surface. Do you feel anxious being around people? Are you afraid that people are looking at you? Afraid that you might be creepy? Whats there? Start to examine your fears with a lens of objectivity, and let yourself feel anxious, nervous, fearful, sad, angry, whatever comes up. Sit in that emotion for a while. **Step 6.** Hold your ground and stay in your spot. People may try to push you around and get you to move off center or something may try and distract you. This means that its working, stay with it, and dont move off your center. **Step 7.** As youre feeling whatever emotions are coming up, continue to let yourself feel them until your body relaxes. This usually comes right after youre feeling the most awkward, anxious, sad, whateverwhich is why its important to stay in it. But at a certain point, youll feel an energetic pop or simply feel more relaxed, or at the very least more present, even if its just a tiny bit. **Step 8.** Now that youre present and current with your emotions, you can go with the flow and follow your natural desires. If you want to talk to someone, talk to them. If you want to go to the bathroom, go to the bathroom. If you want to grab a drink, grab a drink, whatever. Youll start to notice whos orbiting around you. If you think of yourself like the Sun, different people will start to sit around you, chat it up with you, interact with you. At this point simply be yourself, remain open, and go with the flow. **Step 9.** If a woman comes into your space and youre talking with her, just be yourself without any type of agenda or expectation on what your connection with her may look like. The mindset around this if youre wanting to attract a woman is the one of well see what happens. **Step 10.** If theres an opening, feel free to take it if youre digging her. Over time youll learn to sense the energy of the woman  if shes attracted to you, if shes trying to play games with you, if shes open to connecting with you. A woman might just bounce and leave your orbit, but if shes sticking around shell make it pretty obvious if she wants to keep hanging out. She may invite you somewhere, ask you what youre up to later, give you her phone number, etc. Just relax, take it easy, and take the opportunities if youd like to connect further with her (again without expectation). That being said, women have different energies that can be hard to read. If you stay in the realm of observing and paying attention, through your experiences you can begin to feel out what a woman is saying to you with her energy. **Step 11.** Thats it. Continually practice  this is a continual process as there are always more fears and expectations that are coming up. Its a practice that once ingrained in your habitual structure will provide massive amounts of love and connection in your life. **What To Do From Here** After applying this method over and over again, women will start to become attracted to you in various ways. Some will feel friendly, others will feel attracted to you, others will feel overbearing, others will feel uncomfortable. Youll start to notice a lot of different behaviors with women. But when it comes to connecting further, keep apply the same methodology. Remain stable, release your expectations, feel whats underneath, act when things pop, and notice what happens in your orbit. Dont worry about what to do say, or over-think your actions. When youre working on your energy with the Anti-Method, your being speaks for itself. If you want to ask a girl out, do it. If you want to text a girl, do it. Dont worry about the how. Your experiences from this point on will dictate how women respond, and as long as you stay with the process, youll start getting positive feedback from women. TLDR; If you learn how to properly shift your internal state by understanding the energetics of dating, dating will become easier and easier as you won't get flaked on, get rejected, etc. Read from 'How To Upgrade Your Energy' for the how-to, but the stuff above that is helpful to understand what's going on with masculine/feminine dynamics. TLDR2; Do nothing. Feel your emotions (anxiety, anger, awkwardness) until they ""pop"". Release expectations. Get approached. Have a good time. EDIT: Formatting EDIT 2: First of all, thank you all for chiming in your perspectives in the comments. I'm glad to see that this is making sense to a lot of people, and helping men understand previous experiences that have went very well for them. I can also see how this can be confusing, or not much make sense at all, or seem ""woo woo"" or whatever. I've gotten a lot of comments and messages asking for help - asking for certain advice, how to apply this in certain situations, how it works in general, etc...and so I've decided to launch a private Facebook group for the men who want support with this further, and to join a tribe of guys who are on the same journey of them. If you'd like to join, feel free to stop by and interact with us. Here's the link to join us: [The Anti-Method Private FB Group](URL "

Me(29/m) her (36/F),1,5m6xso,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/5m6xso/mixed_signals_me29m_her_36f/,2017-01-06 02:21:15,"Hello All, I dont normally air personal stuff like this but Im completely out of my depth and could really use some help/advice. This is going to be a bit more long winded than I prefer because I feel like there is a lot to this whole thing and frankly I need to get a lot off of my chest. First, a little bit about myself. Im a 29 year old professional and single father. I married at a young age but it didnt work out and divorced less than two years later. I havent dated anyone, or even really been this interested in anyone, for around 8 years. Dating has never been my thing. Im very specific about what I want and Im also a coward and am unable to really put myself out there. I started my current job about a year and a half ago and immediately noticed that I had a connection with one of my coworkers, lets call her Claire. Because im a serious introvert and dont have the confidence to reach out to women to see if they are interested this connection simmered for the longest time. We enjoyed a fun relationship at work, very teasing and flirty at times. Eventually I got up the nerve to ask her to go do something outside of work, not on a real date because im a coward, but I was hoping these out of work activities would lead to more of a personal relationship/connection. I was right. Gradually we began to hang out more and more until our friendship kind of superseded our working relationship. A few months ago I kind of kicked things up a notch with a few seemingly well received gestures essentially letting her know that I cared for her. Recently shes been going through some medical stuff that while not necessarily major can be quite worrisome. After Christmas she got some not so good news (more worrisome than bad) and I could tell she didnt want to be alone so I invited her over. Later that night while on the couch she started crying, I held her hand, rubbed her back and tried to comfort her as best I could. She eventually wound up falling asleep in my lap and neither of us moved until it was time to go to work the next morning. I felt like she was finally starting to open up to me on a deeply personal level. Like we had taken a major step forward. Over the next few days she would come over right after work to hang out and things became increasingly intimate between us, with a lot of touching and hand holding. 4 nights in we had a very frank discussion about the prospect of us kissing. I had wanted to kiss her for days but I thought I knew why she was over (she didnt want to be alone) and I did not want to take advantage of her vulnerability. We also talked at length about her emotional state and the connection that was between us. We both acknowledged that we liked each other and that this had been building for a long time. It was at this point that she first mentioned that she was emotionally closed off and didnt know if she could be in a relationship. Long story short, after this conversation she ended up kissing me and we made out for much of the night with a significant increase in intimacy. The next night was much the same, a lot of kissing and physical contact with sexual overtones. In the morning we talked about what all of this meant and it was at this point that she said she liked me but didnt know if it was enough. She thought she should be more giddy and excited about the whole thing but wasnt. She has a lot going on at the moment, medical stuff, an international trip with family right around the corner and a new job/promotion on the very near horizon. She came to the conclusion that she needed time. She said that she did have feelings for me but couldnt promise anything beyond us being friends. Being the sap I am this kind of broke my heart, Im really into this girl and it felt like a rejection. Everything within me wanted to cut ties and run but she said she needed a friend right now and I didnt want to bail on her so I offered to give her time. A very rough two day (for me) after this conversation I invited her over (as a friend) to kind of clear the air and the tension between us. We have a few fun conversations last night and everything was strictly friendzone (no kissing, touching or even flirting) until we wound up watching a TV show on my couch together. She quickly resumed the position of nights before, head on a pillow in my lap with my hand rubbing her back. Eventually she fell asleep for a few hours. When she woke up, she kind of unceremoniously gathered up her stuff without speaking to me and left with a single goodbye. This is confusing to me, the whole thing is honestly. I feel like im getting inundated with mixed signals. One minute shes telling me that she cant promise anything more than friendship and the next she is falling asleep in my lap. Admittedly, I dont have many friends (introvert) so I have no idea if this is normal or not. We have a connection, we both know it, but I dont know what to do at this point. This is eating away at me and I want so bad to cut and run for my short term emotional health but im really into this girl and firmly believe she is worth the time and effort. What should I do? Am I taking things the wrong way? Seeing things that arent there? Should I back off or be the friend that she needs right now? Im lost and could really use some help. - J "

I am older than her but have less dating experience. We have spent a decent about of time talking, and sharing stories and stuff. She is, I assume at least somewhat into me since she keeps going on dates with me, but I am constantly anxious about where we stand. we are both in our early 20's so I know its normal to some extent to be nervous... I think my issues come from insecurities on my end, that and when we share stories and talk about ourselves, she has all this positive, fun stuff to talk about, but for me, looking into my own past is depressing and sad, so I dont usually share as much because I dont want to bring her day down with all my baggage. I dont think I have a TON of baggage, but my story pool is so limited. If anyone has been in my situation before, what did you do about it to make sure your date still wanted to keep dating you? If anyone is maybe someone who was on the other side of things, what do you wish was done or said earlier, like where do I draw the line? I am also super insecure about my physical appearence, she is way out of my league in that department and I try to just pretend I dont notice or dont care, she hasn't brought it up, and I know that particular thing is all dependent on her so nothing can be said about how to deal with that here. I already work out and am making steady progress, but I know its not something she could have noticed this early on. what advice can anyone give me to help her understand that when I dont share a lot, it isnt because I dont want to, and it is because I dont want to talk about depressing things while we are on a date? How can I present that fact about myself without making myself seem hopelessly depressed when I am in fact not that depressed anymore, I was before, still am a little bit sometimes, but not really that bad anymore. Do girls exist in this world that arent completely put off by dudes who are insecure and may just need to spend a little more time with them before really opening up? I feel like as a guy I need to be always strong cool and in control because thats what is expected of me. Like is it allowed for me to show any vulnerability at all before we get serious? Maybe I am just overthinking things since its such a new relationship, but in the end, I am completely head over heels and all this shit keeps coming up making me second guess myself. I am sure those of you who have dated a lot probably dont have this struggle and are thinking ""wow what is this guy like 12?"" but in terms of relationship experience I may as well be. any advice or tips are appreciated"

Really appreciate any constructive insight you'd like to share. Thanks! **Background info** * I've had a few serious relationships that all ultimately ended because I was using them as an emotional crutch or a comfort blanket. Some I loved a lot and leaned on too hard, others I didn't love much at all and severed ties to avoid doing us both a disservice. * I've done a lot of casual dating in the last couple years, and while I have no problem at all attracting people, the ones I'm catching really don't seem to be the ones I'm looking for. Most of my encounters crash and burn before they've even gotten off the ground, mostly due to perceived 'dealbreakers' on my end or theirs. * About 7 months ago I met someone in a unique, intense and memorable way who seemed to hit a lot of my checkboxes. That very first night I felt blissfully in love with him, though I was self aware the whole time that it had to be lust...chemical...not real...but damn did it feel good. I told myself then that if things didn't work out with him - someone so seemingly uniquely suited to me - I needed to take a break from dating for awhile. We saw each other for a couple of weeks until a very early unexpected pregnancy scare blew things up. It was too much, too soon and we didn't continue dating. * I was disappointed but not at all devastated. Went on with my life and stuck with my promise. If that guy, the epitome of what I'd been trying to attract all along, wasn't the right fit, then I needed some time to reevaluate what I was looking for. And to get fully used to being emotionally independent. * So that's exactly what I did. It's been seven months of no dating, no sex, and to be honest I feel great. I'm so much stronger and stabler now. I feel so confident with who I am and the life I've built for myself, even when really frustrating obstacles come my way. But with all that self-reliance and self-confidence, I find myself no longer understanding how to connect with people romantically. There's no more vulnerability to bond over. I could tell someone about my life struggles, but they no longer hold any power over me, so on *my end* it doesn't feel like any kind of meaningful disclosure. * I've also grown very confident in what I'm looking for, but it seems nowhere to be found. For some feedback, I've made a little [wordcloud](URL of my *wish list* for a long term romantic life partner. I would never expect a person to be every single one of these things, but I'm not even finding anything remotely close. I've even included some faults/flaws that I think could work well with my personality. **So the questions, if you've made it this far:** * Am I fundamentally misunderstanding something about the nature of relationships? It seems so common for people in relationships to use each other as a crutch, bring out some of the worst qualities in each other, and stay together out of comfort or fear of being alone. I'm no longer motivated by co-dependence or fear of being alone, so what makes for better relationship glue? * Is there something about the things I'm looking for that's especially unusual or unreasonable? Are there environments or communities where these traits are more common? Aside from not wanting traditional genetic children I suppose, but I don't usually kick off relationships with that conversation. Do I need to focus on continued reevaluation and deprioritization of those desired qualities (is that not settling..?) or do I need to focus on a new strategy for attracting/surrounding-myself-with people with those qualities?

We dont grow up wanting to be with bad violent guys. No one wants to commit to someone who is lying, cheating, fighting, running, hiding. So, obviously, what makes bad boys so attractive is not their bad behavior. But what makes them so sexy? Here are 8 bad ass traits that you can adopt to boost your attractiveness. #Bad boys are actually nice, at least in many womens fantasies The ultimate aphrodisiac is a guy who appears to be tough on the outside, but who turns into this lovely, vulnerable being when he is with her. #Bad boys are exciting, dangerous, and mysterious Bad boys have a personal opinion and they dont fear to say it aloud. They dont change their mind so they can impress somebody. They are not ashamed of feeling the way they do, or of saying what they really mean. You should practice by starting to say yes, when you mean yes, and no when you mean no. #Bad boys know what they want and dont fear to show it Bad boys dont ask for permission. Have you ever seen bad boys in the movies who ask their date, if they are allowed to kiss her, grab her, love her? Nope  they are confident enough to know she likes them. So, they just pull her closer, look her in the eyes and kiss her. &gt;*The fundamental difference is some people wait to be given permission and others give that permission to themselves.*  Nicolas Cole #Bad boys have confident body language Their head is held high and their back straight. They move slowly and precisely. Both feet are firmly placed on the ground. Everything about their body language screams confidence and dominance. They also take up a ton of space by e.g., sitting with open legs and arms stretched out. Because hey, they deserve it. #Bad boys dont fear rejection They know that rejection is a good thing. It tells them who they dont want to waste their precious time on. They dont see any point in being with someone who is not excited to be with them. #Bad boys dont give a f*%ck what others think about them What other people may or may not think about them doesnt cross their mind. A bad boys focus is directed to the outside. If anything, other people should worry what the bad boy thinks about them. #Bad boys are brave Not like a superhero or Hercules. But they are ready to protect their loved ones, anytime, anywhere. #Bad boys talk honestly and dont fear vulnerability They dont play games. If they dont like you, youll know. Bad boys never pretend to like someone. Everything is straightforward with them. "

Step by step. The path to solving your problem is by starting conversations with everyone but women you are attracted to: 1. Chat with women whose job is talking to customers e.g: bartenders, waitresses, salespeople etc. These folks wont reject you! Its more or less their job to be nice to you and to give you a good feeling. ;) 2. After that talk to random women you are not attracted to whenever an opportunity arises (or in your case women who are not at your age). 3. The last step would be talking to women, you are afraid talking to most, but just asking them one question. For example: Asking for directions, opening times, restaurants, That way you wont have the pressure of continuing the conversation. Your mind should notice that nothing bad happens when you overcome your fears and ask a woman a single question. Then you just expand the conversations with other women over the course of time. It would also be helpful to be vulnerable: Let's say you see an attractive woman and want to introduce yourself. Go over there and just say ""Hi"". Then if you can't move forward because of your fear, stop trying to impress her and just tell her the truth. &gt; You get anxious around attractive women and that's what you have been working over the last few weeks because you want to improve and overcome your problems step by step. You know how attractive that sounds? You are telling her basically that she is one of those extremely attractive women you can't even talk to, but you are trying to improve, showing vulnerability by letting her know how awkward you feel right now. That way the pressure of introducing yourself and making a great impression goes away. Don't think of it as a hitting on her but as a training until you feel ready to approach by yourself, without anxiety. See it as some kind of systematic desensitization  you're talking honestly with women so long until you start feeling comfortable in approaching."

We're both college seniors, she's going to grad school next year and I'm planning on using my undergrad degree to get a full-time job. We spent the week between coffee date and actual date texting a lot and just growing closer in general, and then we went to an art museum and nice dinner for Friday. The time flew by - like, we were together for six hours and it felt like fifteen minutes - and as I drove her back to her place felt really good about where we were heading. We had breached topics of conversation that normally wouldn't come up until longer down the line, and it just clear that there was something tangible between us. As I dropped her at her place, she took the time to sort of just spill out how she felt. I don't remember her words verbatim (I tend to black out in moments of truth), but essentially she explained how she wasn't expecting to really have a great time that night - but that she ended up having a lot of fun and really enjoyed spending time with me. But then she just up and said she's not emotionally ready for a relationship - knowing grad school is coming up for her in a few months and full-time job life for me, and she is apparently still getting over a relationship that ended over summer. She said she's never been one for guy friends, i responded by saying I don't do well as the guy friend. I told her that I don't see myself being able to keep hanging out with her unless it was in the context of a budding relationship, she said she's just not ready for one and we ended the night on that. Haven't talked in the two days since. My normal inclination is to accept this as her rejecting me and just move on from that - I'm surprisingly good at dealing with rejection. But I don't even feel like she friend-zoned me or anything like that, she told me that she was starting to develop something for me but just didn't feel comfortable actualizing that yet. I just feel like she's having an internal conflict of her own - one where she's weighing her own fears of getting into something that could be tough to get out of in nine months against what we have today. Because I made it clear that I only want to date her and not keep hanging out as friends, I didn't intend on maintaining any sort of contact, and assumed that if she changed her mind she'd text me. I don't need friendships, especially when we've already established that we couldn't be 'just friends.' But as people whose opinions I respect have told me, she could just be wanting to take things slow and let them develop into whatever they develop into naturally instead of putting labels on something early on. Maybe if I just keep hanging out with her, she'll realize that what we could be together is worth exploring more than her own emotional vulnerability is worth protecting. I don't know whether to move on and give up on this girl just because we're at different places in our lives, or to stay the course hoping it all works itself out in time. "

I for my part dislike small talk. I just find it boring. How is the weather in Tampa? Is this heat wave still going on? Even writing it seems to make some grey cells want to commit suicide. But for the better part of my life, I had no idea how to navigate around the seemingly unavoidable small talk and talk on an emotional level instead. That should change one warm summer night on my university's campus. How was your exam? she  an acquaintance who I met at the exam  asked after we were done. ""Here we go again,"" I thought. A new round of mind-numbingly polite small talk followed by some awkward silence. Not this time, I swore myself. I needed to find a way to get to a deeper, more emotional level. But how in the world could a guy whose favourite words are effectivity and strategy do that? Well, strategically. **The 3 Step Rule** First, I needed a transition from small talk into more emotional subjects. Its self-evident that you cant continue a conversation that started with *How was your exam?* with *Great! Now tell me about your deepest desires.* So I decided to give what I call the 3 Step Rule a try. **Step 1:** Talk on the same level of emotion your conversational partner is on. **Step 2:** Show vulnerability by opening up first in order to make the other person feel safe. **Step 3:** Gradually introduce more emotion. Here is how I continued the conversation: *The exam went great! I think its gonna be an A. I am so relieved its over now. All that studying made me almost go crazy and I am so happy to be talking to real people again.* Lets rip my answer into pieces and take a closer look at the remains: * The exam went great! I think its gonna be an A.  I answer the question and stay on a rational level. One foot in front of the other. * I am so relieved its over now.  I cautiously introduce some emotion. * All that studying made me almost go crazy and I am so happy to be talking to real people again.  By showing vulnerability I give her permission to open up as well. Not a perfect answer, but definitely good enough. Now it was her turn. I did my part and gave her the opportunity to talk on an emotional level with me. Here is what she threw back at me: *I feel exactly the same way! At one point I was so fed up with studying that I put my books aside for a day, called some friends, and went on a binge drinking spree. Not a good idea!* Bingo! Now I was in the perfect spot to take the conversation in any direction I wanted. Here are some possible options: * I think if I did that I couldnt get back to studying. Are you a party girl?  flirting for beginners. * We should celebrate!  to get shitfaced. * Its crazy how after all the pressure is gone you kind of start to miss the studying.  more of the same. * Are you gonna write any other exams this week?  small talk. * I once went to an exam directly after going out and aced it. She: Really? I: No, I failed miserably and puked on the school toilet.  to make her laugh. We talked for a long time and decided to do more exams together in the future. It was a breakthrough for me. But the story didnt end there; I knew I was lucky that my friend was receptive to taking the conversation to a deeper level, but of course not everyone would immediately open up like that. Lets find out why and what you can do about it. **The right situation** Not every situation is suitable for talking about emotional topics. When you meet someone in a parking lot with grocery bags in their hands, you probably will do better with, *Hey, how is it going? Wanna meet up tonight? Ill give you a call. See you!* than with a spirited debate about sexual desires. What is the perfect situation? * You have privacy. * You sit in an angle to each other or next to each other (like birds on a wire). * You are involved in an activity that doesnt demand any attention. (drinking, smoking, walking, throwing a baseball, etc.) * Both of you arent stressed and have enough time. * Both of you arent distracted by other thoughts or emotions. **The right person** In my experienced, the vast majority of people want to talk about deeper topics than traffic jams or weather conditions. (given the right situation) However, occasionally you will come across more challenging types. But dont worry, there are ways to get through to the less emotionally expressive as well. **The buttoned-up type** Some people just cant open up unless they are drunk, or stoned, or both. Thats fine. I have friends who are like that and I always use the opportunity to talk to them when the situation is right. You cant push anyone to talk about their feelings. How do you know someone is not receptive? Ill take my example about the exam to illustrate it. I: *The exam went great! I think its gonna be an A. I am so relieved its over now. All that studying made me almost go crazy and I am so happy to be talking to real people again.* Them: * I think Im gonna get a B or C. * Have you seen Tanja lately? * Damn, its so hot today! I should have left my jacket at home. If the other person changes the topic or obviously tries to stay in the small talk zone, you should stop pushing. They are signaling an unwillingness to go deeper. You cant force anyone to open up. You have got to wait for the right circumstances or create the right circumstances. **The suspicious type** Other people do want to talk about things that move them, but need a little more trust than others. All you have to do in that case is make them more comfortable and show them that their secrets are safe with you. I: *The exam went great! I think its gonna be an A. I am so relieved its over now. All that studying made me almost go crazy and I am so happy to be talking to real people again.* Them: *I know the feeling. It happens to me also.* In this example, your conversational partner opens up a little and shows receptiveness. But not much yet. All you need to do is show more vulnerability so your conversational partner can feel secure about talking openly. A sentence that can work wonders in such situations is: Tell me more about it. It gives the other person permission to talk, shows you are interested, and in case the other person is just a little opposed to opening up, it causes a slight push. Most people wouldnt say I dont want to talk about it after they gave you some hints that they feel likewise. **Having an emotional opinion** *What do you think about euthanasia?* You probably wont have much of an opinion about questions like that unless you have concerned yourself with the topic before. In school, and especially later, in college and university, you learn to have an opinion on topics ranging from abortion to the war on drugs. But who, ever taught you about emotional opinions? The whole process is laughably simple. Whenever something noteworthy happens in your life, ask yourself: *How do I feel about this?* Lets practice with some examples: * Friends meet and dont invite you: I feel excluded and sad because it seems they dont enjoy hanging out with me anymore. * You start a new job: I feel excited because this job poses new opportunities to my career, but I am also nervous because I feel like I have to prove myself. * You just graduated from university: I feel incredibly happy and proud but the feelings are bittersweet because I still have no idea what I want to do next. Do the same with information you get from other people. When someone tells you: *I've been thinking about moving to Germany*, they dont want you to suggest cities with low crime rates and good health care. They want to tell you about their inner fights and why they feel they have to go. People are constantly crying out for attention to their feelings but seldom someone listens. Those who do, are rewarded with lifelong friendships, exciting romances, and happy relationships. I think you are now well equipped to take future conversations from boring small talk to relationship building exchange of feelings. Just know that even though going deeper can often be more interesting and beneficial, there is nothing wrong with some mindless chatter or flirtatious joking. Every form of communication has its place and time."

It's based around a belief of putting on a show, much like an actor. ""Fake it tell you make it"" is the words of someone who doesn't believe they are capable.

They call con men, con men for a reason. Con is not in reference to a them being a negative, but being focused on confidence. Confidence men. Confidence is so surface level and expresses no depth to how a person values and thinks. I sincerely believe that this hyper focus on confidence is what has made dating so difficult and confusing in general. Many people are trying to be highly competent alpha experts of dating and hooking up that the things that really matter get disregarded as ""useless"" and even detrimental to one's efforts. Fuck all that nonsense. A person can only be brave when they are afraid. Appearing confident is a paper tiger, glass cannon, house of cards approach. It is more exhausting and in the end simply isn't worth it. Knowing thyself is much more valuable than being confident. Does anyone else feel the same as I do? When I hear someone give advice and focus on confidence it screams to me ""hide your insecurities, hide your vulnerability, hide your humanity"". I ask, what is the point of being naked around another person, physically and emotionally, if you are putting on a show and selfishly proving to yourself you can ""pull it off""? I feel like I'm taking crazy pills."
265,vulnerability,dating_advice,5 Things You Can Learn About Love From Dating Older Men!,0,4vm5sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/4vm5sq/5_things_you_can_learn_about_love_from_dating/,2016-08-01 22:11:10,"Whether you set out to find an older man or it just happened, there is a lot to be learned in a relationship with a bit of an age gap. In some cases, a variation in ages can make the relationship more complicated, but more often than not, the age range is beneficial to both parties. So, if you are interested in pursuing an older man or are currently in a relationship with a mature fellow, focus on what you have to learn from the relationship and make the best of the experience. 1. Age really is just a number. When it comes down to it, age really is much less important than maturity. And, dont be fooled and assume another individual will be more mature just because he is older. When youre in a meaningful relationship, particularly with an older and more mature man, youll discover the benefit of emotional maturity that involves empathy, vulnerability, and even effective communicative. These are the primary components to a lasting, fulfilling relationship. 2. Sharing a life perspective is essential. Whether youre dating someone of the same age or not, sharing a perspective on life is essential. If one of you is solely focused on professional development and mildly interested in personal fulfillment, the relationship wont go far. Likewise, if you cant come to similar terms on your understanding and appreciation of aging, especially if you are in somewhat different life stages, you wont be able to make it work. Be sure to spend time sharing your goals and dreams, which is also an element of maturity. 3. Mutual appreciation goes a long way. Youve probably been in a relationship in which you were the only one working on the relationship. Or, maybe youve experienced a relationship in which you were constantly being underestimated. Neither of these situations is the foundation for lasting or fulfilling relationship. As you make a commitment to a relationship be sure that you each have a mutual relationship of one another and the relationship itself prior to devoting yourself to the relationship or another person. This is especially important when you are pursuing an older man because its likely that he might underestimate your intelligence or worth as an equal individual. Dont let anyone take advantage of your value. 4. Communication is fundamental to any relationship. Effective communication is fundamental to any relationship, but especially one that involves a bit of an age difference. There are always lots of things to discuss in a relationship, but the topics become even more varied when you and your partner are in different life stages. If youre not able to discuss topics that range from everyday experiences to far off fears like dying, your relationship likely wont last very long. Its also important that you both are able to express what youd like to get out of the relationship. 5. Time is precious. One of the bittersweet realities of dating an older man is realizing how precious time is. Because you are already in different life stages, the reality of the time that you have left will be even more apparent to you. This could put a damper on the relationship for some individuals, but you just need to allow this realization to encourage you to make the most of every moment. You can learn a lot from any relationship, but youll learn even more when you are seeing an older man. Love is a funny thing, but it just keeps getting more beautiful with age, especially if you allow yourself to enjoy it for what it is.

I really want to date again, but I don't feel much attraction to them because I am afraid. I talk to a girl, but I can't really tell if she cares or if she is just looking for someone to support her dream lifestyle or who just wants to ""have fun."" I feel like I've been ghosted a few times, and that any slip-up or vulnerability can and will be used against me. The appeal of a ""sexy body"" has kind of worn off, but I just want to be with a woman who is passionate and happy to be in a relationship and who is also healthy physically who hasn't lost the need or drive for intimacy (and who hasn't dissociated or dissociates love from sex and who treats romantic love as exclusionary and seriously). Someone excited about a relationship who doesn't just view it as like a ""side hobby."" So I feel attracted to a sweet kind caring woman, but how do I date if I am not really attracted to anybody because I don't know if they are these things, or they are towards me? Like how do I distinguish between a woman I'm wasting my time with (it's hard to tell but you know for sure she DOESNT care if she suddenly leaves when things get tough) . Like maybe if she was trying to get my attention or something I could possibly tell, but it seems like the general attitude is ""we don't need you we are busy with (school/work/whatever)."" If I try to do something nice or make time the attitude tends to be ""oh that's cool did you EXPECT me to give you validation?"" I mean, I guess I don't expect anything at this point which is one reason I'm not really attracted to anyone. It would be nice if someone appreciated something so that I can tell that I'm actually making a difference. Nihilistic, negative, or hopeless comments I will have to disregard, I'm looking for uplifting advice"

Only one time did it feel like a date, the rest were just hanging out. I like to think we have tons of ""chemistry"" but it's been pretty platonic, not necessarily romantic yet. Even when we first talked online. Because we are both kinda playing off of that vibe, I have no idea where he is at with it. However, I am REALLY into this guy and cannot stop thinking about him. We would text every few days between seeing each other, small talk ""how are you"" stuff, but also some pretty deep conversations compared to what I text other friends. I went off the grid while I was traveling for a few weeks. He texted me before I left, saying he hoped it would be a great time for me, etc. Haven't heard from him since. I've been back for 4 days and he knows based off of things I have posted on social media that he has liked. Again, I am so head over heels for this guy, but am slightly afraid I am in the friendzone, so haven't risked the vulnerability of telling him. Do I wait for him to contact me or do I reach out? And if we see each other soon, should I be straight up, out of left field honest? Or is it possible to take baby steps out of the friendzone? Any advice would be helpful and ease my racing mind.

I'm feeling disappointed, but not devastated. Here's what happened: we'd been seeing each other for a couple of weeks. On the first date there were instant sparks and and after dinner the hug goodnight turned into a kiss goodnight, and then into a make-out-in-the-street-goodnight. We agreed to meet again ASAP. I was walking on air on my way back to my car. This girl was smart, gorgeous, ambitious, worldly.... When I got to my car I got a text from her asking if she could come to my place to drink some water and let the effects of the wine we had with dinner wear off before her drive home. I chuckled because I believed her, but the kissing was so good and electric! There would probably be some more to follow. At my place things got heated quickly to the point where I insisted we shouldn't have sex that night. It was funny because she had tons of nervous energy... clearly wanted to have sex, wanted me to talk her out of it, want me to talk her into it. Eventually she (grudgingly) agreed, we made out some more, then she went on her way. We met again a few days later, had another nice time together, and then at the end of the night she invited me in to her place. Again, tons of nervous energy, sexual tension, and this time we had sex and it was good! Tons of sparks, amazing physical chemistry. I think she'd been celibate for a while and just _needed_ it. We met again a few days after that, had a great time at dinner, a walk, lots of good (and non-superficial conversation). We make out some and says she thinks we shouldn't have sex for a bit. That it was moving so fast, and she thinks she really likes me. I agree because I really like her and at 38, I truly am looking for a slow burn and to nurture a meaningful relationship. The next couple of weeks become increasingly frustrating. She was never super-responsive to my texts, but I am often the same way, so I can understand. Eventually I bring it up and she denies there's anything to it... she just isn't good about responding right away, or is busy and then forgets. This is obviously a red (or maybe yellow) flag for me, because I'm thinking if someone is into you they don't forget about you or think to drop a ""hey what's up"" now and again. Anyway, things were busy for both of us between work and travel. We got together last weekend and had a cool time, spent the day outside just walking around, talking, getting to know each other more. I sensed she was pulling back so as we said our goodbyes I gave her a hug only. Then I am _pretty_ sure she is the one who initiated a quick kiss. I'm thinking to myself, ok... this is just slowing down. Getting our bearings. Not rushing too fast. I text her the next day, something trivial, just to let her know I'm thinking of her, and hear nothing back. A day after that, I text again, something silly, and she responds, but then just disappears mid-conversation. It's late and I'm in bed, so I text goodnight and go to sleep. We have plans for dinner the next day anyway. Next day comes, and instead of dinner, she suggests we grab a coffee first and... well... I can see where it's going. She says it was all just moving too fast... I tell her I get it. If you aren't feeling it, you aren't feeling it. She was nervous and didn't offer too much in the way of an explanation beyond that and I didn't ask, and honestly in that moment I think I didn't want to know, or to put her on the spot either. I thought in the few moments of vulnerability we had together there was something special there, really. An excitement I haven't felt in a long time and was starting to think I wouldn't feel again! So I'm pretty disappointed, but I have been in her shows. Recently actually. If it's not there, it's just not there. After some reflection though I'm asking myself, _was_ there something there and my excitement (and maybe over-zealousness) just sabotaged it? I know none of you know me, but I'm sure some can relate. Does anyone have any advice or observations? I feel like I am pretty choosy when it comes to relationships, but when I decide to let things turn romantic, I kind of just go for it and I'm worried that I'm not sure how to ""play it cool"" or in other words act like I don't feel like there's some grand symphony swelling in my chest, when there is! Anyway. Thanks for the chance to vent, and any observations, advice, or comments are really appreciated."
270,vulnerability,dating_advice,"Just left a toxic abusive relationship, and now I have feelings for a completely different girl... is it a reaction?",0,4jeq9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/4jeq9f/just_left_a_toxic_abusive_relationship_and_now_i/,2016-05-15 14:47:56,"So around 4 months ago now I left a girlfriend of 3 years. It was a super intense relationship and great 90% of the time but she had some serious repressed traumas that she took out on me, in verbal abuse every day (which for the most part ran off me) and on the occasions that I told her she was being a bitch, she's resort to violence. It was pretty horrific every now and then, but I put up with it because I loved her and she threatened suicide every time I tried to leave her. I eventually did, making sure that her family would be with her within the hour I left her for safety. Thankfully she has reacted better then she told me she would, even if this has required her being a complete bitch since. Anyway, nothing more need me said on that front. I am immensely relieved to be out of a toxic relationship. After a bit of time, I get myself back on the market as much as possible. Telling myself I'll be polyamorous for a few years before I settle back into anything. I meet start seeing a few girls under a strictly non committal basis, and its great. Except one I seem to click with more. We end up seeing each other 4 weekends out of 6, and for days at a time, a total of 10, and we speak every day when we're not together. And its fucking bliss. I've always felt misinterpreted by people and girls, but not in the slightest with this girl. Our communication is totally seamless, like I've only had with a few guys who are my best mates. We can talk about anything, I don't have to watch my tongue. I find it quite impossible to imagine us having an argument. So yeah, it's great. I've totally developed feeling for her on this basis. But I have some concerns. 1. Am I feeling more then I should because just came out of a toxic relationship that was the complete opposite in to this dynamic? 2. She is depressed. I told myself I would avoid that. But her depression is very different to most, it's very insular, she jokes about it all the time. I think its circumstantial, she's a highly intelligent girl who doesn't know what to do with herself, I think she just needs someone to push her out of her overthinking tendencies and get her to persue one of the many things that interest her. But I may be wrong, and end up feeling responsible for another persons happiness, and I don't want that. 3. She is quite shy and quiet. I didn't realise this until I introduced her to some mates, obvious we had a rapport before we even met and we spent the first few times with just us. My last girlfriend was the opposite, very charismatic, made a great impression on everyone. I thought I valued that. But part of me is saying it's a low priority, I shouldn't be with a girl based on what impression she makes on other people. Yet Im not sure, I definitely would value that of she had it. 4. This kinda ties in with the last one, but she's a bit misanthropic. I can empathise, as that is a word I have used to describe myself in the past, but I never consistently feel like that, and rarely do now. Anyway, more good things. The sex is amazing, we are both very adventurous and have agreed to do whatever the other person wants. She has a great taste in music. She's an intensely curious person, I thought I'd never met anyone as curious as me, but she's a match on that front. Oh and she is ridiculously understanding, she knows my situation with my ex. And she basically said that I should go and be single, do what I need to do for as long as I want and if I still want to start dating properly (committed) then she'll be up for it. She just went away for 2 months, we agreed to not communicate but she buckled a few days ago. In the meanwhile I have taken her for her word and have been rampantly on tinder and have about 10 dates arranged, been on one brief one already and I'm gonna see that girl again. I've told her to go and sleep around whilst she's travelling, but she's with her sister who has serious anxiety issues and she cant leave her side, so she probably wont (her words). So Im feeling a bit guilty about sleeping around and seeing the girls, but Im telling myself it will help me gauge how much I liker her. In conclusion. We are both 26 (soon 27), so not at the year that you enter into relationships without some serious thought as to long term compatibility. We both wanna start families around aged 30. And as much as I feel compelled towards this girl, I don't want to enter into something serious (which is the direction its going) and decide its not right having wasted her time as her biological clock is ticking. Shes already expressed vulnerability in her feelings towards me that are unfamiliar to her. I guess the question is, do make a compromise in these things I think might matter to me, for the sake of having someone that completely understands me? Im not exactly feeling head over heels for this girl (like I have for other in the past, and could quite well again which is what Im worried about I guess) Its more my head telling me that this is an incredibly rare dynamic (for me at least) and I should cease it."

I realised what the trigger was to bringing out my true personality, how I could connect instantly, say the right things which aligned with ME and make lasting impressions on people.

There is only one way a woman can have an experience of pressure-free, safe, exciting, and connected physical intimacy with you: for you to be having that experience as well. In order to bring an experience to the table, you must be having that experience. You cant give something you dont have. If youre feeling pressured and constricted, its going to be damn near impossible for her to feel good. On the other hand, if youre feeling chill and open, you invite her to feel chill and open. In order to feel good connecting with a woman, you must be vulnerable. As Mark Manson says, Vulnerability is consciously choosing to NOT hide your emotions or desires. One of our dearest Introverted Alphas, Gera, is masterful at this, and it struck me in a recent email he sent me. Reading that email, I saw all kinds of gold nuggets about how to increase physical intimacy that I know you guys can glean from, so I asked him if I could share his email with yall. He said yes! Ive worked his email word-for-word straight from him into the body of this post in an easy-to-read format for you. Heres what youll learn from Gera today: &gt; The pattern he noticed in the last 3 women he was physically intimate with. &gt; Why and how each woman was hesitant at first, and how he melted them: the words he said and the spirit behind those words. &gt; How to initiate physical intimacy and how to move it along with new women. Alright, now lets hear from Gera directly. Take it away, Gera!    // Physical intimacy happens in stages. // I find it really interesting how similar of an experience Ive had with the last 3 women Ive been with, regarding physical intimacy. First theres a spark. Attraction on both sides. Curiosity and interest peak. Eye contact is prolonged and starts to deepen. All of a sudden youre flirting  Its like a dance, like a courtship ritual. Then you touch for the first time, and thats when the magic begins. If you are trained in First Touch To First Kiss, then eventually the first kiss becomes inevitable. The curious thing Ive experienced is that all of these 3 women were interested but also hesitant. They were hesitant to different levels but they all expressed some sort of, Hold on for just a second, hesitant thought. // Why were they hesitant at first, and how to melt them? // I remember the first one said, Wait, were not even boyfriend and girlfriend. The second said, I dont want to have sex if thats the implication. The third simply said, I should go, and later texted to say that for her, becoming intimate takes longer, but that it doesnt mean she doesnt like me. In all of these cases, I wasnt really implying anything. I was just going with the flow. I was completely respectful of all of these womens feelings and choices, yet at the same time I followed my desire for intimacy and moved forward whenever I got the right signals. In the first case, I simply responded, Thats okay. We dont have to do anything you dont want to. Would you like me to take you home now? In the second case I said, Theres no implication here. All I know is that being here with you like this feels really good. In the third case, I was simply patient. There was no resentment or irritation. I kept going out with her because I really liked her and was under the impression she liked me. Of course, I wouldnt have kept pursuing her indefinitely. At some point I would have simply moved on, but I was very encouraged because every time we went out, afterward it seemed like a layer of ice melted away. She started becoming more affectionate. It was little things: squeezing my hand when I held hers, leaning a bit closer to me in conversation, kissing me when I dropped her back home at the end of the night. These are subtle but very meaningful signals. // Physical intimacy is vulnerable and beautiful. // All of these 3 cases eventually ended in sex, and it was great. I dont believe there is any shame or regrets on either end (even though Im no longer seeing two of these women). It was simply a beautiful experience of intimacy  expressed and fulfilled desire. The main takeaway I had was that intimacy makes people feel vulnerable, so it is really important to be offering a safe environment and vibe. At the same time, you need to maintain your confident and attractive vibe. In all 3 of these cases, I felt the women slowly but surely melting  to the point of full trust and letting go. Eventually they just wanted me to have my way with them (perhaps more of a dark vibe for these cases although very sexy), but I literally felt like I could do anything to them during sex. Its such a wonderful experience. Of course I never abused this, but to the contrary. I used it for mutual gain and happily took on my role as an Introverted Alpha. Not just happily for me, but definitely also for the women I was with. I feel I better understand what you mean when you say that Turn-On = Attraction + Feeling Safe. :~) Turn-On = Attraction + Feeling Safe I find it funny how similar these experiences were. I used to think of love and attraction as very mysterious things that happened by chance. Now I see there are certain human desires and responses that are more universal, so to speak. Its like we are hardwired a certain way, and when we accept that and let go of our inhibitions, we experience true joy just from being who we are  without offering any resistance to that.    Alright, its Sarah again. That was beautiful, yes? I hope you learned a lot from the way Gera thinks. He is pure-hearted and also bold. I love that combination. It feels really nice for you guys and for the women you date. Heres a summary of what Gera taught us about building physical intimacy: How To Start Physical Intimacy: &gt; Its the natural progressing flow of Chemistry Spark &gt; Flirting &gt; Touch &gt; First Kiss Becomes Inevitable &gt; Women can be and want to be melted by your strong and unwavering presence and the feeling of absolutely zero-pressure, while still feeling and enjoying the attraction flowing between you. &gt; Intimacy makes people feel vulnerable, so it is really important to be offering a safe environment and vibe, while at the same time maintaining your confident and attractive vibe. What is considered physical intimacy? Its on a grey scale, and it depends on what you feel comfortable with and inspired to do. Naturally, you wont want to have sex with every woman you meet. Thats okay! Theres no pressure. Its just two people feeling out a connection. So thats it folks! For the formatted article and links to more like it, go here: URL"

So basically this seems contradictory. If you openly admit to any fault or insecurity you are not confident, but if you don't then it would kind of suck to be the almost ""perfect"" macho man or something. What's the point of having a partner then? You can't talk to them about anything or have any validation from them because ""you don't need it"" you are ""confident"""

But after a while I realised half of you would have stopped reading. I strongly believe you need to be reminded about the importance of smiling. Its too freaking simple to not do it more often. Research showed that children smile up to 400x a day while the average adult only smiles 20x a day. This made me sad. Which made me write this to hopefully get you to smile a little more like you used to do. - Here's a different approach you should keep in mind from now on when thinking about smiling: You dont smile because you are happy. You are happy because you smile. Viewing emotions as a tool, instead of emotions tooling you, is one of the greatest epiphanies Ive had the last years. If emotions tool you around, you arent in control of your life. Taking the higher ground and using your MOTION to have control over your E-MOTIONs is the first step I took in regaining back my control. This requires some re-wiring in your brain to get used to, so dont dismiss it if it feels weird at first, because it will. You will see and FEEL the value in it sooner rather than later though. The first 10 minutes of this video will make everything I talked about clear for you. I highly recommend you to check this Ted talk out. I hope by now you know I like to have a strong WHY for what I do. So let's start off this article with a f-ton of logical reasons why you should smile more, before we proceed with the practical stuff. 15 reasons to smile: 1. Laughing disarms people. It relaxes them and makes them less defensive and hence, more receptive for you. It takes away the serious vibe, makes everything more light weight. 2. People always want to join the fun or a laughing crowd. Nobody ever wants to be the party pooper. Smiling disarms but also protects you! Try and feel good after bringing someone else down! 3. Laughing displays Life Force! One that is often undervalued. 4. It has been proven in studies that laughing gives you a 2 to 5x higher chance of healing from life threatening conditions. (Emotional Intelligence, by Daniel Goleman) 5. Smiling is Contagious. It is one of the fastest and easiest ways of getting someone else to smile. People remember how you make them feel, not what you say to them. 6. Smiling raises the oxygen levels in your blood and brain which will help you feel and communicate better. 7. When you laugh, your intestines get an amazing massage! 8. Laughing reduces stress. 9. Laughing stimulates social bonding. 10. Laughing makes you appear more attractive, this has been shown in studies. 11. Laughing makes someone easier to be around. 12. Laughing can extinguish anger. It makes people forget about things that went wrong. 13. We laugh more when we can laugh with others. Laughing has a huge social aspect that amplifies good emotions. You will laugh more watching a series with friends then you would alone! Making it also more enjoyable. 14. Laughter or smiling is very honest. It is VERY hard to fake a good laugh or smile. It breeds trust and vulnerability. Two basic building blocks for an amazing relationship. And THE most important one to me: 15. Laughter or smiling is very honest. It is VERY hard to fake a good laugh or smile. It breeds trust and vulnerability. Two basic building blocks for an amazing relationship. It clears the rubble between you and another person. It is the fastest way to get a connection between two people. Okay, so you skimmed over the classic benefits of laughing. Nothing too crazy, I know.

Your life is not really panning out like it should. Or you have some other excuse not to be happy and hence smile or laugh. Or it is but you still dont really feel that good that you want to walk around with a smile? No worries, because of the re-frame at the start of the article, smiling just got a new dimension. You no longer smile because you feel good. You start smiling now to START feeling good LATER. There are a million ways to achieve this. One research example that backs this up is the ancient psychological experiment of putting a pencil between your teeth for a few minutes which emulates smiling and feeling your state go up. In the seduction industry it is also a huge part of self-amusement. A cornerstone in seducing women. My man Terry Travis wrote a great article on Self-Amusement to Attract Women that you can check out in this link. 4 of my personal favorite ways: 1. Get someone else to smile and smile or laugh WITH them (not at them). The best way to make yourself happy is to make someone else happy (Socrates). You can do this with silly jokes or in however way you see fit 2. Fake it till you make it. Laugh as hard as you can for no reason for 2 minutes. Feel how you start laughing because of how retarded you are laughing (this is VERY hard to do at first). 3. Imagine strange situations with good or funny outcomes, and really try to believe them. Imagine how you got into an accident and where no longer able to use your legs. For 10 years you were wheelchair bound. Now all of a sudden you get to use them again for 10 minutes! Using some self-deprecation, try and dance in the most retarded ways while you smile and get your state up! 4. Grab your nose with your right hand and your right ear with your left hand. Then switch, grabbing your nose with your left hand and your Left ear with your right hand. Do this with a smile and try to do this as fast as you can. Challenge others in a random moment to do the same. Enjoy the laughs of the pointlessness of it! There are endless ways to get yourself to smile first and feel better afterwards. Fight through the resistance and find what works for YOU. It is a struggle worth having. Once you find it re-use it. Most people worry about what others think about them when doing these forms of becoming happier. But remember: Being a retard makes other people smile, which in turn will make you smile. Its a confidence training exercise. ------- Thats it! Read the rest of the article here: URL"
275,vulnerability,dating_advice,A Beginner's Guide to Asking Women Out and Getting Dates,57,3w1300,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3w1300/a_beginners_guide_to_asking_women_out_and_getting/,2015-12-09 15:12:06,"As an introvert, I struggled a lot when it came to trying to date women. I hadnt even gone on my first date with a woman until I was in my twenties, whereas some of my friends just seemed to naturally fall into their perfect relationships without even trying. It just seemed like for most guys, knowing how to approach women, talk to them, and get a girlfriend was just common sense. I used to believe that it was just something that men should be able to do. Meanwhile, I didnt know how to go about dating or even where to learn those skills. I had no idea what youre supposed to say to a girl youre interested in. Are you supposed to use a pickup line? Are you supposed to impress her? How do you start a conversation and what do you say to her? Sometimes Id hear that you need to be very bold with women. Sometimes Id hear that you need to be very direct. And sometimes, Id read some PUA advice that made me question my faith in humanity. I just wanted to find a compatible woman to share fun times and love, to kiss and hold hands with and experience that sense of intimacy, yknow? Now, things are different. I learned how to talk to women and get them to go out with me. I met this wonderful girl a while back and was able to successfully ask her out. Today, we enjoy a lot of fun times together and its amazing to experience that love we have for each other. And I was able to accomplish all of this naturally, without becoming a jerk or an alpha or resorting to any of those sleazy PUA tactics  me, the introverted late bloomer! Honestly, if I can do it then you can too! Here's my beginner's guide for talking to women and landing dates: **Find a time to talk to her when shes not busy** The first thing you want to do is find a time to talk to her when shes not busy or preoccupied with something else. So, if youre interested in that one barista at Starbucks then try to talk to her either when shes getting off work or when there are no other customers. If you fancy that cute girl in your class then try to catch her when lecture is over (just please dont try to do it during class! This should be obvious but Ive seen someone try to do that before.) That beauty you see in the bar? As long as youre not interrupting her conversation, go for it! You get the idea. Once shes available, approach her and **Strike up a fun and authentic conversation** When I first started to try and date women, one of the biggest areas that I struggled with was that I had no idea what to say. It turns out that the answer might be simpler than you think. When talking to her, you should just aim to have a fun and authentic conversation with her. Dont try to be flashy or impress her by being someone youre not. Instead, let your natural personality shine through. For example, in real life Im kind of sarcastic, I speak softly, and I tend to use dry humor when talking to people. So, if Im talking to a girl Im interested in then Im not going to try to talk to her in an overly-masculine and aggressive tone in order to try and impress her. Thats not who I really am inside. People can sense inauthenticity a mile away, yknow? As clich as it sounds: just be yourself and try to have fun! Starting the conversation can be as simple as saying Hi, my name is Steve or even just Hi. It really doesnt matter too much how you begin the conversation. Just stay away from pickup lines, since most of them come off as inauthentic (unless you can pull it off in a really endearing way.) To keep the conversation going, I suggest trying to find out something about her that she would love to tell you about. For example, maybe you notice that she has a folder with a photograph of a cute puppy on it. That might be a picture of her dog. Ask her about it! Displaying a sense of authentic curiosity and showing that youre genuinely interested in learning more about her is a great way to build rapport. Talk with her for a little bit and see how the two of you feel. If youre having a really great time talking to her then go ahead and **Ask her out!** Ask her to come with you to dinner, or to coffee, or some sort of event happening in your citywhatever! Just do it as confidently as you can and try not to come off as needy or desperate. Back when I was inexperienced, I used to be like ""Umm...if you want...would you...maybe...like to get dinner with me...or something?"" You can imagine how well that worked for me. Instead, you can say something along the lines of Hey, Im interested in going ice skating at the park this Saturday. Why dont you join me? or Hey, would you like to get a cup of coffee Sunday morning? These types of questions are more non-needy. If youre asking out someone that you just met or don't know that well then you can try showing a little bit of vulnerability. You might say something along the lines of Hey listen, I really enjoyed talking to you and I wouldnt mind getting to know you better. Would you like to get a cup of coffee this Saturday? Make sure you have a concrete time and place in mind when asking her the question. Shell be looking for you to lead so dont make her to plan it for you. Instead of saying Would you like to get dinner sometime? ask her Would you like to get dinner at Maters this Saturday? Remember that if she agrees to going out with you sometime then she hasnt actually agreed to doing anything at all! Okay, thats enough with the examples. You get the idea. Go and ask her out already! **She said no (or maybe or some variation of Im busy)** Bummer, man. It sucks to hear that. No, youre not a loser for trying. And no, shes not going to think less of you or laugh about it to her friends. We all get rejected sometimes. Keep in mind that its not always your fault. Maybe she prefers a different type of guy, maybe she already has a boyfriend, or maybe shes just not interested in dating anyone at the moment. Who knows? Typically women will try to let you down easy instead of flat-out saying no. Instead you can expect to hear something along the lines of maybe or Im busy or I cant make it. Often, if a woman is busy but she is still interested in going out with you then shell instead suggest alternate times for you to go out. So, dont pout or keep trying to suggest different dates if she says that shes busy. Instead, behave like you are okay with it. You can say something along the lines of Sure, no problem. You took a chance and stepped way outside of your comfort zone there. So, congratulations! Go ahead and treat yourself. Grab some Doritos, play some Fallout 4, watch some Game of Thrones, or whatever else you like. You deserve it. **She said yes!** Congratulations!! I know youre excited, but try and resist the urge to start dancing. Get her phone number if you dont already have it so that you have a way to keep in contact with her. She wont say no to this if shes already agreed to going out with you, so just say Can I get your phone number? Make sure to work out the logistics of the date with her before the actual event so theres no confusion: Are you meeting her there or picking her up? What time are you two going out? Where are the two of you going? Etc. etc. You can do this while talking to her now or over the phone later. Okay, now you can start dancing! **What next?** If youve enjoyed this guide, Ill be creating more dating guides such as this one about topics like: what to do after you land that first date, how to go from dating someone into being in a relationship, and how to be confident when talking to women over on my website [URL Sign up for my newsletter and youll receive these articles in your inbox as they are written.

She texts me first a lot, which is a good sign. But lately we seem to be dabbling in more serious/vulnerable topics, which scares me. Whenever I get close or vulnerable with a girl in the past, it freaks them out and they leave. So I'm really hesitant to do it here. We went out a few times, and she's someone I could see myself with, but past experience says as soon as serious topics come up, dating is no longer super fun, and the girl quits. I can't see her for 3 weeks because I'm away visiting my dad who just had triple bypass surgery and helping my mom out around the house. I'd like to talk to her about it, but afraid of showing vulnerability that could scare her away. I'm also worried she'll lose interest in me since we can't hang out for three weeks. "
277,vulnerability,dating_advice,What Dating Truly Is About,3,3o5zlw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/3o5zlw/what_dating_truly_is_about/,2015-10-10 11:29:05,"**Most dating advice is based on absolutely irrational beliefs.** Men should *impress* women with their success or achievements, and women should play *hard to get*. These are the norms and drive most of the behavior most of us have with our dating endeavors. These beliefs stem from socialization; or in other words, society is teaching us how things ""should"" be done. This is why many men are unconfident with beautiful women, and why many women feel the need to suppress their sexual needs. But if we take a look at the basics of attraction; what it actually is and on what it is based, we will find that it solely consists on *finding the most suitable mate*. **Attraction is *not* a decision.** Attraction is an emotion. Masculine is attracted to feminine, and vice versa. Therefore, all we need to focus on is: 1) What side of the spectrum are we? 2) How can be improve that quality? For example, beautiful and sexy (feminine) women are instinctively attracted to confident and dominant (masculine) men, because that would give them and their offspring the highest chances of survival thousands of years ago, when there was no social security or hospitals. However, masculine men simply look for the most feminine girl, as femininity (beauty and vulnerability) communicates youthfulness, health, and fertility, and that's, in contrast, exactly what offers men's babies the highest chances of survival. That is really what attraction boils down to. **To increase your chances of successful reproduction.** You might say, ""This is the year 2015, nowadays we look at more than just what's sexy"", and that's true. However, our emotions and instincts still run the show *primarily* and date from thousands, maybe millions of years ago. Back then, we still lived in the wild and thought very differently. For example, back then we had no money, no designers clothes, no fancy sports cars, golden watches, magic tricks, pick up lines, or tattoo's. This has nothing to do with attraction, however too many people believe it does. **Our emotions (attraction) always rule over our rational, logical thinking (most dating advice).** Therefore, quit believing all the nonsense you learn all around you which doesn't have to do anything with attraction. Advice such as... ""Create rapport by copying someone's body language, way of conversing, or endeavors."", or, ""Use this awesome, new and cool pick up line to impress her!"" (Which is an excuse to approach, therefore indirect and thus feminine.) Or, ""Play hard to get, to make it a challenge for him/appear wanted."", or, ""Don't compliment her on her looks; especially with the hot girls, you'll lower your value."" Playing hard to get is *always* counterproductive, even if it might appear it is not sometimes. If you like someone, but that person plays hard to get with you, do you enjoy that emotion? Of course not. You might still want that person as much, but it doesn't feel good, hence it is uncharming and therefore unattractive. A far better way to convey you have options is by being (or acting) very confident. Confident people lift others up, they don't push them down in any way. Incidentally they also seem to be the most attractive, regardless of sex. So... Focus on your side of the spectrum. Masculinity or femininity. That's all you need to understand. And of course to be confident, but that's a whole different subject on itself! Feminine: vulnerable, submissive, indirect, emotional, high pitched voice, contracting body language (as a sign of vulnerability). Masculine: Invulnerable, dominant, direct, confident, rational, low pitched voice, slow movements, expanding body (as a sign of dominance). **Quit listening to what society preaches you, like, ""*she's out of your league*"", or, ""*make him wait!*"".**"

We have a solid foundation as friends, with emotional and physical connections on top of that. He is kind, thoughtful, sincere, honest, and everything I hoped to find in a partner. He adores me, tells me all the time and I can tell from his actions. I don't believe he would ever do anything to hurt me, and he is very clear about seeing us as a couple for the long term. The problem may arise from my own insecurities and have nothing to do with him, but I am unsure. My biggest fear at this point is getting hurt. Sometimes I think about breaking up with him so that I won't be the one to get hurt. I sometimes feel as though I should end this before I get too dependent on him. I have always been independent and relied on myself alone. Even with friends, I distance myself from them when I find that I am becoming too reliant. I would rather sabotage relationships than allow myself the vulnerability of being hurt or used. He has done nothing to indicate that he is using me, and we have not gone far physically and he respects that I want to wait until I'm certain that I'm ready (I'm 21 and a virgin, he is late 20's and not a virgin). I also fear that sex will cause me to get even more attached to him and this is probably the main reason I am waiting. I don't want to have sex with him and then have this relationship end, since to me sex is a big deal. I also fear that he will get bored of me after sex, even though I know he likes me for who I am and is content with waiting. All in all, I am unable to stop my cycle of getting close to him and then distancing myself when I feel myself opening up to him. He has noticed and commented on this, asking me to explain why I distance myself and I told him I am just afraid and he knows I have intimacy issues. He has been nothing but patient. Does anyone have any advice on this? Thanks, I really appreciate it."

The interest felt mutual enough, but I try not to get excited about things like this before they flesh out. The dilemma I'm having is that I've been finding out that casual sex isn't really my scene and that I might just be doing it out of loneliness. I've got quite a few opportunities waiting in the wing, but I don't know if I want to spend my time chasing more tail when the sex is never really that great. Basically, I'm tired of it. But I also don't want to throw pretty much all of my eggs into a single tenuous basket. For all I know, this girl may just want to fuck and then never speak again. I don't want to put myself in a position of vulnerability, but I also feel weird about trying to fuck a bunch of young pretty college girls I have no intention of trying to date when I'm interested in someone else."

I sincerely apologize. So i'm not really your typical college bro. Ever since I was a kid I was ostracized for a great number of reasons. Ive also unfortunately had more than my share of violent encounters with bad people. Things that separated me: -religious differences in private schools -awkward -frequent nose bleeds which made me gross to everyone -obesity -etc. Like many people, I learned to not trust others at an early age. When girls would give me compliments I knew it was only for their ego so that they could feel good by putting me down. At the height of my obesity I even had 3 of the most popular senior girls at my hs regularly fighting over me in a gym even though i said no to all of them just so they could feel powerful and make fun of me in public. I know they were put up to this by guys that hated me, and I have forgiven them. Highschool was hard for alot of us, and if I could make anyone's day a little easier I don't see the evil in that. I picked up weightlifting (shout out to broscience life for getting me through the hard days with humor) and music and got a procedure done to stop the nose bleeds. I taught myself to cook and my friends have helped me embrace my inner-nerd through their passion for video games/anime. I am now everything I wanted to be when I was 20. Along the way I have gotten at least moderately attractive as evidenced by the number of people hitting on me in public. Some girls have told me that I am everything they want in a guy, and I can honestly believe that because I know how hard I worked to change. The problem is, the emotional damage is still there. I have taken a few girls on dates now, and I only push away their attempts at intimacy. When I go drinking with friends, people often ask if anyone is still a virgin, and one of my friends looking out for my best interests is always bound to use the opportunity to send attention my way. Girls are always confused how I got to be this old without even so much as kissing someone. I have overheard many conversations about my virginity when people don't know I am listening and girls seem to agree amongst themselves that I am very attractive for such an outcast. I remember one girl in particular who I asked on a date who didn't know this information at the time. The date went boring and although she said she had fun I felt I was too nervous to be enjoyable company. I saw her at a party and when my virginity came up, it took 10 minutes of story-telling to convince her I was still a kissless-virgin. She started tickling me and trying to cheer me up, and I felt the coldness in my heart seize my chest. I knew this girl drank every week, I knew she had her own problems. She had admitted earlier that some terrible things had happened that she couldn't cope with outside of drinking. I suddenly felt her pain. Her vulnerability. I told her I would never forgive her if she continued to try to kiss me. It obviously came across as very cold and immediately stopped her behavior. She eventually fell asleep on my shoulder, and I sat there drunkenly enjoying at least the feeling of warmth of another human being. It was so alien but a great feeling. I don't want to date a girl who is this damaged, because I have learned that I cannot fix other people. I can never be her happiness. This pattern has occurred time and time again. When a girl complemented my biceps at a party I just instinctively cackled for a few seconds at the thought someone found me attractive. When I have taken girls on dates I suddenly feel apathetic as hell and I think this is me shielding myself from rejection. Every time I think I have conquered this problem, I demonstrate that I still cannot trust people and especially girls without constant exertion. When I head back to college in the fall I have a few questions. I honestly feel like I have done everything I can to be who I want to be, so my questions will revolve around dating specifically. How do I meet the right girl? Should I party more or try harder to just dive deeper into my hobbies and hope that I happen to find someone? I have trouble getting along with 99% of people because I am pretty quiet. Is my lack of experience a big deal? How should I talk about this issue to girls? Whats your best general advice for someone in my position? tl;dr: Used to be ugly, now I'm sexy as all hell. Still inexperienced though. See 4 questions immediately above. "

Am I [29/F] being too crazy, or is his online activity shady?",1,31zxv1,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/31zxv1/dating_a_29m_who_asked_for_exclusivity_am_i_29f/,2015-04-09 23:55:13,"I don't know if these are all my own hang ups, or if there is a mix of things. I've been dating this guy for a little over a month. Things escalated kind of quickly, so we slowed things down a little. Then, just around the 1 month mark, he asked if I wanted to be exclusive. I asked him what that meant to him, he said that he isn't interested in looking for anyone else right now. That I was free to, if I chose, but he wasn't going to. I took some time, but ultimately I am looking for a relationship, so I said yes. I wouldn't date anyone else. I stopped at putting a label on it. Here's where things get tricky for me. I have trust issues. I know they are my issues, not his. But, he still checks his online profile, daily. And, though he has less than 100 friends on Facebook, every new one is a semi-local girl. Of these, 2 out of 3 are his ""type."" On to the good things: -He initiates dates often. I see him between 1-4 times a week, depending on circumstances. -He plans future events. We already have a date for the end of May. -We have so much in common. -We've been on day trips without a single disagreement, and then I spent the night at his house. -He texts me every day, multiple times a day. It isn't always full conversations, but he initiates 90% of these. -After a date, he likes when I come back to his house to cuddle. And it really is just cuddling. He also likes when I spend the night. We have not had intercourse, yet. (He said he likes to wait for that.) -He is very verbally, and physically, affectionate. Even in public. So, what's wrong with me? He's consistent with dates, texts, and affection. I'm having a very hard time getting over the online activity. We never had the ""delete your profile"" talk and I'm the one who didn't want a label. But, it seems contradicting that he still checks his profile and has added a few random girls on Facebook. Are these actual red flags or am I self-sabotaging? I don't want to be the crazy girl. I'm genuinely trying to get ahold of my trust issues. I haven't known him that long, so I don't want to grossly misjudge in either direction. TL/DR: Dating a guy who asked for exclusivity, but checks his online profile. He's consistent in every other way. I'm feeling a bit of vulnerability and attachment. So am I just looking for things or is this a problem? Edit: I forgot to add, he speaks in ""We"" future terms. We should do this, we're going to, next time, etc. Maybe I'm just too scared of getting hurt. "

Your psychological defences run rampant. It sucks for us. However, its the truth that we only value what were afraid of. Id argue that to be happy. We have to tussle against our fears. For progresss sake. Thats because we value progress. Psychological research shows that people arent happiest at rest. They prefer to be doing something. Many a times, we settle and go for spouses and partners that were not afraid of being rejected from. Its easy. We settle for the cultural pressure. The judgement from friends and family. We settle because it gives us a sense of control. It wont bruise our ego. Think about it. The times you have been so afraid of rejection from a partner youre attracted to. Those were the times you lost it completely. Those were the times you fucked it up. Its a conundrum. Its counter intuitive. You Only Value What Youre Emotionally Invested Into So we go for the partners that are unlikely to reject us. Even if they do, its okay, we were never emotionally invested in the first place right? I started this self-improvement journey wanting to date attractive girls. During the process, I did groom myself to become more attractive. I did date more attractive girls. However, I found myself dating girls that I felt that I was comfortable being rejected by. I wasnt least bit emotionally invested into the relationship. It was not fulfilling. I was still blocking out certain emotions. If it fails. Fuck it. Ill just go find another one. The trick here is not to over-invest. However, when dopamine fire and our psychological maps are rubbed upon. Theres little we can do about it. Irrational behaviours that come in flavours of ice cream tubs and men proclaiming their undying love comes into play. Emotional Investment: Vulnerability And Intimacy The game of love is an emotional process. Never once forget that. Its a movement inside of you. Its decided by your movement, or a lack of. Theres little and nothing to do what you say. Weve covered vulnerability. I would like to touch on intimacy on this post. Intimacy, vulnerability are by nature raw and touchy. Certain events can leave us awake all night. With dopamine rushing into our brains, or perhaps the lack there of. Leaving us depressed. Ive noticed a current trend in my social and romantic relationships. I jump ship and refuse to work things out when things get a little rough. I rationalise it with commitment issues. In my mind, I can always get another friend, I can always get another girl. Relationships are not scarce. However, Id figure its just an unwillingness to deal with my own un comfort with battling things out. If vulnerability is the ability to express and assert ones needs and desires regardless of the outcome. Then Id say that intimacy is the ability to express your needs to someone you trust whenever youre feeling vulnerable, in hopes that the person doesnt find you disgusting or reject you. Its tough, weve been in those moments where our ex-lovers or parents left us feeling even worst in those times of neediness. Behind The Curtains When Tables Fall Beyond this current trend. Im going against my fears. Likes yours, my psychological defences run rampant. I avoid what Im afraid of. Ive been with girls that I dont truly enjoy or am not that attracted to. Its a way of telling myself that, oh, Im doing fine, Im still kicking ass in this area of my life. That cannot be further from the truth. Its about time to further bring more self-awareness and sticking to my values. Think of the time when you chased your first girlfriend. Think of the time you nerved up and had to courage to chase a girl you had no idea whether it was going to turn out good or not. Think of the time you risked it all. Think of the time she actually said Yes. You treasured the fact that she was around and returned your affection. A good part of me wondered what happened to those days? You now choose your partners based on your comfort level of rejection. Your psychological defences run rampant from previous or first love traumas. Your ego kicks in and settle for comfort. After all, youre the fucking player right? Which brings me to my next point. The Attraction Conundrum Getting comfortable with emotional rejection is the only way through. Not for the sex, and not for awesome relationships. But for long term happiness. Dating 10 girls you have murky interest in and totally fine with the option of being rejected is not going do much for your happiness. Because you dont value it in the first place. Youre just doing it for ego thrills. Psychological research shows that happiness requires a strong habit of courage. Dating 1 girl youre emotionally invested in yet scared to death of rejection will do a lot more for your happiness. Even if you get rejected itself. Its a paradox. However, another paradox kicks in here. The more emotionally invested you are in someone, the more youll come off as less attractive to them, the higher chance youll be rejected by them. Hence the attraction conundrum. Theres a way out. The only way is to be comfortable with expressing those needs and desires honestly to someone youre attracted to, and being okay if things dont work out."
284,vulnerability,dating_advice,My first steps taken before dating.,1,2xu4bf,http://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/2xu4bf/my_first_steps_taken_before_dating/,2015-03-04 09:06:57,"When starting to date, I had to realize that I needed to ensure that I was secure and well within myself before I began to embrace others into my life. How did I make the most of my singleness and start preparing to be open for a relationship? Focusing on these 3 areas was essential to helping me become whole, before entering into a new relationship. 1)Let go of past hurts and pains. There is saying that hurt people hurt people. So if you are holding on to past hurts and pains from previous relationships, be it from old loves, your family or family member, or even from yourself, its imperative you take time to resolve those issues. Find a way to release those feelings that bombard your thoughts and create road blocks that hinder you from moving forward. Often when dealing with a bad relationship we put a band aid on the problem and move on with our busy lives, rather than dealing with the hurt and pain that are harbored due to the situation. Worse, we carry those inner feelings from relationship to relationship and wonder why our relationships are not successful. No one should enter into a new relationship full of emotional and mental baggage. Being single is a time to renew, restore, and build oneself. Taking the time to do this while single is not only a great benefit to you in your next relationship, but also to your overall health and wellness. Contrary to popular belief, you dont want to have to find someone to complete you, the goal is to work to be whole within yourself so you are complete. 2)Identify those barriers that hinder your openness to love. Have you ever said, There are no good men, all men cheat, all men are dogs, or I will never find The One? If so, these are what modern day relationship coaches call these limiting beliefs. I know I am guilty. I have had my share of limiting beliefs after a couple of relationships that went sour. But like the Law of Attraction posits, Like attracts like. In other words, the energy you put out will be the energy you attract. So according to the Law of Attraction, if you feel there are no good men, then you will attract men who are no good. Or if you feel all men cheat, then you will attract men that cheat. After years of harboring negative energy due to what someone had done to me in the past, I had to change my thinking and release those limiting beliefs. And now I have a new attitude! Trust me when I say this, ALL MEN ARE NOT BAD! There are good men out there that want to treat you the way you deserve to be treated because you are a Good Thing! 3)Take time to develop self. As women, we often give of ourselves prematurely not fully understanding what power we have within to not only be great powerful women ourselves, but also to be powerful helpmates for another. However, we often demand/expect more than we have to give. So my question is, Are you a reflection of the characteristics you seek in a mate? We have to take the time and energy to work on self. Relationships take work! We as women tend to be in such a hurry to be in relationships that we skip or dont fully develop the necessary skills and characteristics that will prepare us to be successful in our relationships. And unfortunately, we prematurely enter into relationships not mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually or financially well. This only leads to disappointment, hardships, and hurt because we look to the other person to fulfil the voids. Knowing who you are takes a sense of vulnerability and openness that can only come from within. As a single woman, I have many male friends and I have heard them say women want or expect things that they themselves cannot provide or give. One male friend expressed to me that he met a women that harped on having a man that was financially stable and able to provide for her, but when he further probed he found that the women was up to her nose in debt and could not spell finances much less manage them. Being a women does not automatically qualify one as a good thing or one that has the ability to be a good wife. We have to work at it! Many have heard about the infamous Proverbial 31 woman because her virtues were admired by many. She is described as: worthy, trustworthy, good hearted, good work ethics, provider, financially stable, disciplined, physically fit, generous, service oriented, protector, well kept, honorable, wise, kind, productive, and spiritually guided. WOW! Now thats a good woman but the reality is that these arent characteristics women should possess just to get a man, these are characteristics that every women should work to possess to be productive citizens while here on earth. I had to take inventory of where and who I was before I could fully choose to start dating. So what type of energy are you putting out in the atmosphere? If you want positive energy, real love, and the chance of a successful love relationship to come to you, you have to speak, think, and live positively because only then will you begin to attract that which you are.

I don't want to settle down or anything, just find people who are fun to hang out with, who I can share some intimacy with and who treat me with respect. I hadn't been on a date for 8 years and I went out with a guy last week. He'd spent the whole lead up to the date telling me how much he liked me and how interesting and beautiful I was and how he wanted to understand me. I thought it was a bit much, I thought I couldn't meet his expectations but I wanted to give myself a chance to find something that made me happy. When we met he was very open, he asked straightforward questions and told me bluntly what he thought. I really respected his ability to say exactly what he was thinking as I can be quiet a closed book, I felt safe, I felt like his openness made him more trustworthy. I felt good about myself with him so I went back to his place we just watched tv then made out, gave each other oral sex then he cuddled me all night. The next day he went off to work and I went home. I texted him and he responded very bluntly, I immediately felt my stomach sink but I hoped he was just busy with work or felt a bit awkward about the night before. I sent him a little anecdote about my day that evening but he never responded, I decided to try one last time a few days later but again, nothing. I knew for sure now that he wasn't interested and that wasn't a problem, I didn't think we had much chemistry but I had enjoyed our date and it gave me a confidence boost, but after he ignored me I was just angry that he hadn't had the balls to tell me the truth when that was the thing I liked about him most. He clearly had no interest in me before I went back to his, I felt cheated and used. It's been playing on my mind, so I confronted him today. I told him I was disappointed and I felt he's misled me. That I would've respected him if he'd texted me and told me he had a nice time but he didn't think we were compatible (or whatever else). Sure enough he responded that time telling me exactly that, I responded telling him I'd got the hit but I needed to tell him how it made me feel for my own peace of mind, I wasn't fishing for a response. He told me my 'negativity is overwhelming' and that he hadn't done anything wrong. I don't know if I'm cut out for dating, I think I'm too sensitive. I'm really sex positive but I don't expect to me ignored about a sexual encounter, I find that really disrespectful... It's made me feel ashamed and embarrassed that I believed his spiel. Where do I go from here?"

I'm a 30-something woman who ended a physically and emotionally abusive relationship about two years ago, and spent the last three years working on my codependent tendencies. I used to think that I had to give people all the love and time I had in order to feel worthy enough of their love. Then, when they responded with distance or meanness or manipulation, I would feel lost, unloveable, and desperate, giving away my entire self in order to get crumbs of affection. I would describe my inherent attachment style to be ""anxious"" but, through therapy, I have worked on my self-esteem, my needs, and my own life. I avoided dating while working on myself, and over the last six months have really felt amazing - confident, beautiful, excited about life, made many new friends, working toward personal life goals... and most of all, feeling like *I* am enough for me. I didn't feel like I need another person's validation in order to feel alive or happy. However, about three months ago, I met a man through a friend has a similar personality as my own (I am a bit strange so, this was kind of amazing to me), and we quickly became friends. We immediately had very deep, intellectual and intimate conversations with each other. We both felt very connected to one another. And eventually, we started to date each other instead of being just friends. In the beginning, I felt very much ""myself"" -- I felt like I had no expectations, didn't feel like I was giving too much of myself, felt very much like I could be ME and if he liked me, good, and if not, who needs him. It was super liberating, and I felt like I was on the right track with love... finally. However, once things started becoming more intimate and we started kissing (among other things) I have found myself slipping back into my old attachment style and it is freaking me out - to the point where I'm thinking of cutting and running. I have never really ""dated"" anyone before. I have a history of being friends with men first, usually for a long time, and then we fall in love while friends and commit to each other and at that point. My relationships have been very long and monogamous. This current man and I are taking it slowly, not committing, which was really great at first, but I find myself confused and insecure because we *are* intimate outside of a relationship. Perhaps I wasn't ready to do this, but I WANTED to, and it definitely felt right at the time. We had been hanging out for about 2 months when we became sexual, seeing each other a few times a week and talking for hours every day. After this happened, we both agreed that we were not going to sleep with other people, but neither of us were ready to put the ""relationship"" label on what we had. I am definitely okay with not committing in the sense that I want a healthy, amazing relationship that works for both of us, and I do believe I've rushed into commitment in the past, to my detriment. I do not want to ever enter another serious relationship that is unhealthy or not a good match for me. Still, even with me feeling okay with not being his ""girlfriend"" and seeing where things go, I can't help but feel insecure. I feel like I'm giving a lot of myself to this guy, at least in terms of honest and vulnerability, and he's been very cool, a bit guarded, and noncommittal. I find that I am afraid that he will ultimately reject me, and I feel like I'm just waiting for it to happen. He has noticed my fear recently, and said that the dynamic has changed between us. That I have given him too much power, and he doesn't know why. I find that I am no longer the confidant, fearless girl I had worked so hard to become, and am back to yearning for someone's love... to prove my worth to someone. All while not even knowing if I want to even be with this guy for the long term! I am so distracted by my own fears that I feel I cannot even think clearly about what *I* want. On top of it, my fear has made me more shy, less myself, and I can feel him pulling away. He said he wants me to be myself and that he wants me to be confidant again, but I don't know how. And now that I can feel the shift in intensity changing between us, I am even more afraid. I'm trying to not let this stuff get to me, but I am really having trouble. And part of me wonders if this is just not a healthy start to a relationship - that there is something in the way we are when we are together that is triggering bad feelings and actions from me, and that I need to look for a more secure connection from someone else. That maybe we are just not a right fit. But I don't know if the problem is JUST me, and something I personally have to fix. Or, maybe I'm just not healthy enough for a relationship again. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you."

So we just continued to chat on messenger... I asked her out, and she said, OK i can go... But her sister, who i later found out was her brothers girlfriend, was having some baby issues, and next week they were taking the baby.. so i said OK, family comes first. She said maybe when things get better we can meet up... I said OK.. Let me know.. Then i asked her if we can talk on the phone, she said i think that is OK, as i am so busy, she would have to schedule it.. I said OK, pencil me in... she never did. we never did talk on the phone... I would make time to see her in the different building, she let me touch her, and she let me rub her feet... We would just talk, and she would just say, she was so busy, would try her best to schedule things, but she couldn't make any promises.. So i said ok, well let me know when you have free time, she just say OK, i will... I would always initiate the conversations,flirt with her via messenger, she just thanks.. and i ask her to california to go sailing with me, or just go for a drive, she just say she was busy... Hell, she even said, she was off for 4 days, and she said what do you need help with.. I said lets meet up, how about Friday, she said she is busy, i said how about saturday, she just said probably not... Maybe week after next... I said well i would like to sit down and meet and we can go from there. She just say ok... &amp;#x200B; I left the job, due to my business taking off. I told her, i am leaving, the job, and since its a cybersecurity business, i was going to get off messenger due to some clients not wanting us to use that.. she said wow, thats great, text me, and i will chat with you, and be your friend.. I said i am going to miss seeing you, she said well maybe we will see each other again someday.. We talked a few days after, i said would you like to help out, she said i cant commit to anything, as she will be busy with work and school. And i should not be obligated to her, She told me that i need to focus on the business. And she said she will be so busy with work and school. I said well do you have plans this weekend.. She said yes i am going camping with my family and friends.. Maybe next week... at that point, i figured you know what.. Maybe its time give her some space... I told her she was an amazing beautiful lady, she will do great at school, and when she has some free time, or wants to do something, or needs help with school, or anything else, let me know, if you want to talk give me a call or text... I gave her my number and email.. It took her 4 days to get back to me and then she blocked me on messenger.. -- A few weeks later, i was Instagram, and accidently clicked like on one of her pics, she freaked out, blocked me, and then made her profile private.. &amp;#x200B; After that it was over... Maybe it was me, walking away that pissed her off. im still hurt by it... Maybe i should have not sent that message to her asking her when she was free, or give me a call... lets hear your stories... &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"
291,cybersecurity,dating_advice,How to get a date at an Australian university?,1,9xb43q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/9xb43q/how_to_get_a_date_at_an_australian_university/,2018-11-16 00:22:02,"Australian universities are different to the ones in the UK and the US. Very few students dorm, the vast majority commute from home, and they stick to the same group of friends they made in high school. Social club scenes are pretty sucky and not many students bother to go to them. I still go to them, but groups seem to have already been preselected and nobody seems to want any more friends. My social skills are pretty bad, however. I never made any lasting friends in high school because of Asperger's and crazy helicopter parenting. My degree is in cybersecurity, so there aren't any girls in my classes, save for electives. So what do."
292,cybersecurity,dating_advice,Question about asking for advice: Why the assumption I'm a troglodyte?,7,65tysc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/65tysc/question_about_asking_for_advice_why_the/,2017-04-17 16:20:15,"Ok, so here's what I'm talking about: I'm 30 years old, I have a well paying cybersecurity job, I'm getting ready to put a down payment on a house after renting an apartment on my own for 6 years, I keep up with my hygiene and grooming, and looks-wise I may not be a Calvin Klein model, but my mirror doesn't shatter when I look into it either. In short, I am a functional adult. So why is it whenever I ask for advice on how to meet people, the first words out of 9/10 people's mouths are to the effect of ""get a job, move out of your mother's basement, shower, shave, and hit the gym""? It really irritates me, because the only thing I can do with that advice is to say ""ok, done. What's next?"" I've got my ""A"" in Adulting 101, kinda looking for the advanced classes now. So I want to know, why is it that we (because God knows I've been guilty of it too) tend to default to treating people with the self-awareness to ask for help and advice in the dating realm with the assumption that they are primitive neanderthals? Because it's damned discouraging. :/"
