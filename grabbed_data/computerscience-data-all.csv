(Tl; Dr at the bottom) Obviously, cyber security involves knowing about security. The only problem with this is that the concept of security is the amount of theatrics. People with a security mindset see the world differently. They cant walk into a store without noticing how they might shoplift (Schneier, The Security Mindset). They have to think like an attacker, or an adversary. Using this mindset, security engineers can build a support system, which basically means that if an attacker takes down one system, there would be other systems to go through. Sounds simple right? Wrong. The security theater provides stories for the people to feed off of. Take terrorism for example. Terrorist attacks are few and far in between, and yet, people fear those over actual risks like road accidents (Parker-Pope). The culprit for this is your brain. As Parker-Pope stated in Wrong About Risk? Blame Your Brain, fear is a great way to remember something, so people are more inclined to remember plane crashes and terrorists over car crashes, resulting in roughly 1000 additional vehicular deaths because people believed it would be safer to drive to their long distance locations rather than fly (Parker-Pope). It also doesnt help that people view security like some sort of movie plot: we may know an attack is coming, but unless the attacker specifically says how, when, and where they are attacking, we cant prepare for it as people seem to think we can by evacuating people or sending in law enforcement. Bruce Schneier said movie plot security only works if we guess right, but since we cannot guess accurately, the best thing we can do is prepare a defense against all threats, no matter how important or unimportant the people perceive them to be (Schneier, Terrorists Dont Do Movie Plots). That brings us around to the third and final problem. There is an imbalance between attackers and defenders. The defender has to defend against all attacks while the attacker just needs to exploit one vulnerability to achieve their goal, resulting in an asymmetric relationship that favors the attacker. In conclusion, there is no such thing as a perfect security. People perceive larger, flashier threats as more important than actual threats, leaving the us open to all sorts of attacks. As Schneier says in regard to the theatrics in security, stories are what we fear (Schneier,Beyond Security Theater). We will not be able to defend ourselves properly if the people continue to hold onto this mindset. SOURCES: URL URL URL URL URL URL I rushed this as I was supposed to read 10 articles and didn't start till yesterday so this isn't my best work. Tl;Dr : Perfect security doesn't exist thanks to the dramatic imagination of the people. "

7,cybersecurity,computerscience,Discussion on alternative ways of teaching Computer Science,1,i8fnwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/i8fnwv/discussion_on_alternative_ways_of_teaching/,2020-08-13 01:22:48,"Hey all! I recently posted that I would be teaching Python basics for Cybersecurity on a stream and one of the comments was that what I was doing is ""not CS, it's coding"". Of course I agree that CS is not simply coding, but rather the study of computers, how they are built, programmed and how we interact with them. However coding is still a subsection of CS just like math is or physics is. They are all tools used to accomplish goals within CS. This response has caused a broader discussion where that same user suggested that lectures and assignments are not CS. I again disagreed with him saying that although, granted, Computer Science is not only about lectures and assignments, they very often, and traditionally serve as stepping stones to learn more about the field. Of course some people refrain from traditional education methods and are very successful without them, but it is not right to discredit the current and traditional way of teaching CS. So this is where this post originated from. Now I would like to start a discussion. 1. If you teach or got into CS through a non-traditional (lecture/assignment) format, I'd love to hear more about it and I bet the rest of this subreddit would too. 2. If you have any ideas on how to deviate from a traditional way of teaching/learning CS, post them below! 3. This is a longer one: Most classes enforce a plagiarism policy (which all courses should), however many of them consider working with someone in that class plagiarism, even if you were the author and the code was original. Computer Science and its subset of programming are both VERY collaborative areas, so discouraging students from working together and creating a collaborative network seems wrong to me. Granted there will always be people who will just copy, not learn a single thing and slack off if collaboration is allowed. So my question is: how to we encourage collaboration in lectures while also keeping people accountable for learning? Do you have any other alternative ways of structuring classes to make learning more collaborative?"

Here is the post I made recently about the club: ""First, I want to mention the goal of this club, which is to encourage students to pursue the growing field of cybersecurity. To achieve this goal, I don't intend for this to be like a class. I am a firm believer in the idea of ownership: you get out what you put in. That said, I won't be putting any deadlines on any of the assignments. Moreover, the meetings are only for those who want wholeheartedly want to participate. I will NOT be holding anyone accountable for handing in work late or not handing in work at all. This club is for you, not me. Second, this club is COMPLETELY virtual. We will online be contacting each other via this classroom page, email, and possibly Reddit. Our meetings will consist of coursework that you can work on and discussing cybersecurity topics. I also want to complete a collaborative project (that will also be virtual and optional) by the end of next year. Third, I want to talk more about what we'll be doing in this club. I will be making and assigning strict coursework EVERY week (on Mondays). The coursework will consist of videos, articles, independent activities, etc. that either I or someone else has made. Completing the weekly assignment will only take a few hours (three hours max). There will also be occasional virtual hackathons that you may participate in. These hackathons will be cybersecurity-related games that I have found online. I did have to pay for some of the material that I am assigning so please do not take any of this lightly. Lastly, thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this. I truly believe that if you have read this message in full, you are on your way to becoming a great student not just in cybersecurity but in general. I can't wait to get started and I hope you feel the same way. I've always loved the concept behind cybersecurity. It's an interesting and incredibly fulfilling field. That said, let's have some fun! If you have any questions please shoot me an email. I would love to hear from you!"" Please message me if you have questions!"

So I'm a student, it's lockdown, and I found a free online course in cybersecurity which I'm doing to keep my sanity. ([SANS Cyber Aces](URL if anyone's curious.) I've just gotten into the unit on networking, and am learning about the [OSI model](URL of network communications. I got through with layer 2, and there's something I still don't get. So now I understand that every device has something called a MAC address baked into the hardware. I also see that a WIFI router would use this address to differentiate between different devices that are connected to the local network. After a [bit of googling](URL I also learned that duplicate MAC addresses ending up on the same network happens every so often. It seems the only solution to this problem is to spoof that device's MAC address so it shows up as something unique to the router. A bit more googling showed that modern smartphones and mobile devices also have a MAC address so they can connect to the internet. So here's the question: what about mobile data? To my knowledge, the way mobile data works is basically to send WIFI signals through the cell towers/cell network. But each cell tower serves a **crap ton** of people, and there's no way to make sure that each phone connected to a mobile data network has a unique MAC address. And while I have no experience with the subject, spoofing a MAC address looks like a task that would require a human operator somewhere. So in short, how do mobile data networks handle having so many devices connected to them while still getting over the issue of ensuring each device has a unique MAC address? (Or, really, any unique identifier?) &amp;#x200B; ^(Disclaimer: this is) **^(not homework help)**^(.

Isn't there another layer of encryption created by the Server on top of the Client's first encryption that has to be peeled off first? My logic is for example: compressing/encrypting (add to archive) a file with a password using 7zip (file.7z) and then proceeding to do the same to that file but with a different password. So in order to decrypt the original .7z file we have to first go through the first decryption/password and only after that can we decrypt the second one. Your help would be greatly appreciated!

Follow-up to my previous post. I'm a cybersecurity student and I'm eager to understand the basic processes of an SSH session. I wrote down the stages to the best of my ability but need help understanding what happens right after the TCP handshake and right before the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Please help: *Session Start/TCP Handshake* 1.Client begins a session with Server by initiating a TCP handshake. *Assymetric Encryption for TCP Session* 2.Server and Client negotiate back-and-forth and agree upon a mutually supported encryption protocol for the TCP session. **At this point, post-protocol-negotiation, it is unclear to me how their session is initially being encrypted. I used Wireshark to try and capture the Client or Server sending over their public key or something but couldn't see anything. Regardless, please explain this stage if you can.** *Client and Server negotiate a shared secret key for this session using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm in order to establish a symmetric-key encrypted session.* 3.Client and Server begin process of producing temporary key pairs, using 1. Shared prime number 2. Encryption generator (typically AES) 3. Private prime number (as private key). 4.Client and Server use these three to each generate their own public key that can be derived from their own private key. 5.Client and Server each share their generated public key with each other. 6.Client and Server each use their own private key, the other's public key and their original shared prime number to generate the same secret key. 7.Client and Server use this key as their shared secret key to encrypt and decrypt all future communication on this session. *At this stage, Client and Server have successfully established a symmetric-key-encrypted session without having needed to send the secret key over insecure channels.* **If I got anything else wrong I'd really appreciate any clarification.

I recently got a acceptance letter from Vcu accepting me into school of engineering. If I was to transfer I would mostly likely major in computer science with cyber concentration there. However I am unsure if I should transfer or not. My main reason would be that I am not feeling the college vibe and the experience I thought I would get. Mason doesnt feel as lively to me maybe because I dont know many people since I started from spring instead of next fall. I just wanted thoughts on what you guys think I should major in. Many people agree Mason has a good cyber program and where its located its networks are pretty good as well. Still its very difficult for me to decide, I feel like if I stay I may lose the opportunity to actually enjoy college while working hard or if I transfer I let go of a good program I am in although (quick fact) Mason is giving less aid compared to VCU. Im in a big dilemma please honest thoughts. Thanks!!"
35,cybersecurity,computerscience,News Flash: You By No Means Need A Degree In CS,1,fg5z2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/fg5z2a/news_flash_you_by_no_means_need_a_degree_in_cs/,2020-03-10 12:34:53," *So this whole rant is triggered by a guy I saw asking why all the good cybersecurity technicians that the government wants are junkies, and I needed somewhere to post this. This is not to say all the people who do CS as a pastime are junkies (obviously), but it's just what triggered this particular post. I really want to educate younger folks who may be considering the field and want to know their options:* With my experience in Comp Sci, I've realized the reason that the bureau can't find people with decent cybersecurity skills is that all the straitlaced ones who go the degree route are in general not as good. Most of my friends smoke weed, I'm not gonna lie. I've never touched it myself since addiction runs in my family and I don't wanna risk putting my family through what I've gone through. But at the end of the day, these people who I know are also the most skilled people I know. This is most likely because Comp Sci degrees are advertised as teaching you all you need to know about the field, which is sooo wrong. Most comp sci majors graduate knowing like 2 languages, maybe a bit more if they're lucky and get in a tech college like MIT, with zero experience in the practical use of them. They may learn more than just Java and a C, but from what I've heard just the basics of them. Even if you argue that you can transfer skills from one language to another (which I agree with), someone with heavy practical use in a few languages/areas as a long-term hobby is more likely to beat out someone with a basic CS degree, in my opinion. The one thing that a degree is good for is connections, which honestly won't get you far for very long in the tech field if there are many people who can outperform you. At the end of the day, people who start young and devote time to coding, CTFs, ARGs, and such as a pastime are going to be much more skilled to practically defend/attack technology. Unfortunately, in my experience with people that start cybersecurity in their free time, these tend to be people with authority issues. They also have a tendency to question almost everything, which is a common trait with these, and so some of the good ones end up turning to drugs. Besides this, the amount that government agencies pay their technicians is absolutely appalling. I know a lot of people are hypnotized by the ""secret agent"" glamor, but I could never imagine working for an agency paying that low rather than a private company for significantly more + travel. Don't get me wrong, a comp sci degree can help someone out. If you, for example, start out as a hobby and then continue that education in college, you will be an actual *god*. Still though, out of my friend group and myself, I've never gotten a degree in Comp Sci. But all of my jobs have been programming/tech-related. When I was very young I got my start from making video games (cliche I know), moved onto cybersecurity and got very familiar with Linux, then got a job at a small startup in my hometown, and I have remained in the field since graduating hs. A friend of mine actually got employed as an *officer in the army* without a degree cause he solved some sort of cybersecurity puzzle (I'm sure you can read up on it somewhere, look up Army Cyber Command Puzzle or something of the like, there were a few different ones, most commercial). Another dude I knew ended up getting a software engineer job at E-Bay with a Political Science degree. My brother (who introduced me to the tech field) and other friends all managed to do pretty decently in the tech community as well without any degrees just freelancing and finding other jobs. Anyways, sorry for this long-ass rant, had to get it off my chest since I think it's incredibly fucked that college advertises to highschool students as if they need to spend thousands of dollars to get a programming job when that couldn't be farther from the truth. Don't get me wrong, if you can afford it and it won't put you into 10+ years of debt, go for the degree. I'm not saying it'll hurt you. As I said, those who are already skilled programmers and advance their education with a degree are practically unstoppable in my experiences. But if you can't afford it, or if you feel college isn't right for you. Don't sweat it. Just bust your ass, find a passion for something in the tech field, and keep working on it and looking for jobs. Quick tip: You can still try applying for jobs even if they have a degree requirement in their application post! This means get working on your portfolio since if you don't have a degree this and the weight of your name/previous workplaces are the only things that an employer can use to validate you. The worst thing they can do is turn you down, but if they see your portfolio is very impressive, you may have a decent shot even at these workplaces."

For the past 5 year I have been a Financial Analyst working in local government. I have a decent, comfortable job, but ultimately I don't find it fulfilling and am looking for new career opportunities. It's worth noting that I'd also like to stay in the public sector. I enrolled my local community college for the Summer Semester for Cyber Security. With all of my transfer credits, I could finish an AAS program in under a calendar year, taking night courses. However, as registration date approaches, I'm beginning to become unsure about which program would be better suited for me, or if any of this is ultimately worth my time. I was initially considering Cyber Security, because this appears to a field with a good job market, especially in the public sector. Recently, the largest city in my state (Charlotte, NC) had hackers seize and hold ransom sensitive personal data. However, the course load for Cyber Security doesn't seem to be weighted as heavily in the fundamentals of computer science and is focus on more abstract concepts. I also don't know what kind of career opportunities are available with just an AAS. There is also an AAS in Systems Security, but I'm being honest when I say I don't understand the difference between the two. There is also an AAS in Programming and Software Development, which looks like it just teaches programming languages. I have started in earnest to learn HTML and Javascript, and I think programming is something that I could learn fairly easily. If I stayed motivated and given the huge amount of resources out there, I might could probably teach myself what the community college is offering on my own. Although I think I would enjoy this course of study, I don't know if the program would lead to any career opportunities. Our CTO, has said that our County doesn't hire programmers anymore and as a County we are moving away from native programs (a lot of our applications are home-grown rather than licensed but this is changing). Lastly, there is a program in Database Administration that focuses almost entirely on SQL. I know that our DBAs use SQL to manage the massive amount of data generated by the County. However, I don't know how much I would enjoy doing Database Administration or if an AAS would even carry any weight.

Am I being naive? Are there jobs out there where I can get hired with an AS and start getting a feel of the career?

Kind if like psychology or kinesiology. If so, what should I focus on besides my CS BS? Im open for whatever at this point. But for sure needs to something stable and consistent. I really like the AIs studies, I happened to find them fascinating. I also like the idea of Cybersecurity, seems very interesting.

Currently at work I use Matlab on and off for mission planning but that's about it. My question is, how much is it going to suck? I still remember the basics but nowhere near where I should be. Are there any Computer Science refresher programs that I should look into before jumping into a master's program? Any books you all recommend? Other options are a master's in cybersecurity or a master's in Information Technology. Thanks for your help!"

You think i could study Software engineering and with that knockledge learn cybersecurity (I already have some knockledge of Software, but almost nothing about Cybersecurity, i was doing a course, but stopped when i was about to penetrate my first WPA/WPA2 network) If it was for me, i'd box, or do something completly related to martial arts (I LOVE MARTIAL ARTS) I'm 17yo"

I'm a senior girl in high school right now debating on whether or not I should major in computer science. For the longest time I was set on majoring in it but now I'm having doubts... I'm not sure why but I'm just afraid that either i won't be interested in it or it'll be too difficult. I initially took an interest in computer science because I've always been fascinated with technology. I've obviously used computers since I was like 4 and love them. However, I have ZERO experience with coding/programming. The closest thing our school offers to a coding class is ""web page design"", which I've taken, but all we did was mess around with HTML and dreamweaver. I initially entered with a ""wow I am 100% going to major in computer science!"" mindset, but the reason I started questioning that decision is because I'm not sure if I'm genuinely interested in purely coding/writing code. I also am a little nervous about the environment I'm going to be in since I'm a girl and computer science is predominately male, but that's not a huge factor. The main thing I'm worried about is if I'm going to be good at it, I guess. I love trying new things and want to learn more about computers (I would specifically like to enter the field of cybersecurity) but I'm just nervous about whether or not the classes will be difficult or I will enjoy them. So I guess my biggest question is: for those of you who had absoluely zero experience with coding, did you struggle with the classes? I'm afraid that the biggest thing holding me back is my lack of experience. Also, what can I do to help prepare myself for the classes?"

As such, I have spent the last 8 months completing introductory courses at the university (Discrete Math, Intro to Programming, Computer Systems I & II, Data Structures I & II). A family member of mine who has been a software engineer for the last 25 years recommended to me to instead pursue the MS Cybersecurity degree, stating that cybersecurity is in high demand and low supply, with the industry only looking to grow in the future. He said that software engineers are a dime a dozen in today's saturated market, and that now is a good time to specialize in cybersecurity. Both degrees require the same introductory courses. I am approaching the end of my intro courses, and need to make a decision about which program to pursue. I've greatly enjoyed the programming elements of my classes thus far, would love to pursue programming further. Is there a significant programming element within the field of cybersecurity? I wasn't sure whether cybersecurity involves a lot of just looking at assembly language. I've also been reading on some online forums that a degree in Cybersecurity is not a good investment, since many employers simply look for security certifications.

I mean the only thing we have to look forward to is a console output that just adds numbers or something. But another thing that bothers me is that it seems that most CS jobs aren't doing things you feel passionate about, but instead just maintaining other people's code or fixing broken crapplets for a company because the guy who made it hated his job and designed it terribly. I kinda understand why there are so many people who despite the ire of most CS forums, want to go into game design, because it's something that interests them more than whatever other real world job they've seen that is CS related. Another fear I have is that the job place for CS is too cold or not very social. I also dislike the whole idea of before getting a job, people say you need to contribute to random github projects you don't care about at all. Are jobs stable or do you need to freelance allot? But that's a bit too judgemental for me I think, and I'm certain many people here may have had a very positive experience with this field. So maybe I should start with my interests. I am good at math, have always liked technology, especially computers and of course video games like most people my age. I also have a mild interest in cybersecurity, city design, sociology, and story writing. I don't like biology or unapplied classes. I'd say I've always been best at STEM oriented courses ever since elementary school (l liked Discrete Math, very different and interesting). But now that I think more of it, I realized I don't care about software, and find most of it to be bloaty or cumbersome or unnecessary. Maybe I wouldn't be able to enjoy coding for something I don't care about. Maybe a more hard oriented approach would be better, I think find coding too abstract or just a means to an end. What does this sound like to you? Also, sorry for dumping a spaghetti of thoughts onto here, I was thinking r/STEM but decided here is better. I hope this is the right place.
