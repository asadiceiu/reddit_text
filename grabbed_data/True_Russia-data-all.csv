Enlarge / Demonstrations in Belarus over the reelection of Alexander Lukashenko are just one of the mass protests where Bridgefy is being promoted. &amp;#x200B; The rise of mass protests over the past yearin Hong Kong, India, Iran, Lebanon, Zimbabwe, and the UShas presented activists with a major challenge. How do you communicate with one another when Internet connections are severely congested or completely shut down and at the same time keep your identity and conversations private? &amp;#x200B; One heavily promoted solution has been Bridgefy, a messaging app that has the financial and marketing backing of Twitter cofounder Biz Stone and boasts having more than 1.7 million installations. By using Bluetooth and mesh network routing, Bridgefy lets users within a few hundred metersand much further as long as there are intermediary nodesto send and receive both direct and group texts with no reliance on the Internet at all. &amp;#x200B; Bridgefy cofounder and CEO Jorge Ros has said he originally envisioned the app as a way for people to communicate in rural areas or other places where Internet connections were scarce. And with the past years upswell of large protests around the worldoften in places with hostile or authoritarian governmentscompany representatives began telling journalists that the apps use of end-to-end encryption (reiterated here, here, and here) protected activists against governments and counter protesters trying to intercept texts or shut down communications. From a Bridgefy video promoting the app as suitable for protests. Enlarge / From a Bridgefy video promoting the app as suitable for protests. Bridgefy &amp;#x200B; Over the past few months, the company has continued to hold out the app as a safe and reliable way for activists to communicate in large gatherings. Bridgefy's tweets embrace protestors in Belarus, India, and Zimbabwe, not to mention the Black Lives Matter protests throughout the US. The company has also said its software developer kit can be used to build COVID-19 contact tracing apps. &amp;#x200B; Just this month, on August 10, this article quoted Bridgefy cofounder and CEO Jorge Ros saying: Last year, we became the protest app. Up until last week, Bridgefy told Android users via the Google Play Store, Dont worry! Your messages are safe and cant be read by those people in the middle. The company continues to encourage iOS users to have secure and private conversations using the app. &amp;#x200B; But now, researchers are revealing a litany of recently uncovered flaws and weaknesses that show that just about every claim of anonymity, privacy, and reliability is outright false. Unsafe at any speed &amp;#x200B; In a paper published on Monday, researchers said that the apps design for use at concerts, sports events, or during natural disasters makes it woefully unsuitable for more threatening settings such as mass protests. They wrote: &amp;#x200B; Though it is advertised as safe and private and its creators claimed it was secured by end-to-end encryption, none of aforementioned use cases can be considered as taking place in adversarial environments such as situations of civil unrest where attempts to subvert the applications security are not merely possible, but to be expected, and where such attacks can have harsh consequences for its users.

After reverse engineering the app, they devised a series of devastating attacks that allow hackersin many cases with only modest resources and moderate skill levelsto take a host of nefarious actions against users. The attacks allow for: &amp;#x200B; deanonymizing users building social graphs of users interactions, both in real time and after the fact decrypting and reading direct messages impersonating users to anyone else on the network completely shutting down the network performing active man-in-the-middle attacks, which allow an adversary not only to read messages, but to tamper with them as well &amp;#x200B; Impersonation, MitMs, and more &amp;#x200B; A key shortcoming that makes many of these attacks possible is that Bridgefy offers no means of cryptographic authentication, which one person uses to prove shes who she claims to be. Instead, the app relies on a user ID thats transmitted in plaintext to identify each person. Attackers can exploit this by sniffing the ID over the air and using it to spoof another user. &amp;#x200B; With no effective way to authenticate, any user can impersonate any other user, as long as an attacker has come into contact with that user (either one-on-one or in network-wide broadcast messages) at least once. With that, the attacker can pose as a trusted contact and trick a person into revealing personal names or other confidential information, or take harmful actions. The lack of authentication can also give rise to eavesdropping or tampering of messages. &amp;#x200B; Heres how: When hypothetical Bridgefy user Ursula messages Ivan, she uses Ivans public key to encrypt the message. Ivan then uses his private key to decrypt the message. With no cryptographic means to verify a users identity, an attackersay, one named Evecan impersonate Ivan and present her own public key to Ursula. From then on, Eve can intercept and read all messages Ursula sends to Ivan. To tamper with the messages Ursula or Ivan send, Eve impersonates both parties to the other. With that, Eve can intercept the messages each sends and change the contents or add malicious attachments before sending it on to the other party. &amp;#x200B; Theres a separate way to read encrypted messages, thanks to another major Bridgefy flaw: its use of PKCS #1, an outdated way of encoding and formatting messages so that they can be encrypted with the RSA cryptographic algorithm. This encoding method, which was deprecated in 1998, allows attackers to perform what's known as a padding oracle attack to derive contents of an encrypted message. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Page: 1 2 Next &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Bridgefy, the messenger promoted for mass protests, is a privacy disaster Researchers notified the company in April of serious flaws that have yet to be fixed. &amp;#x200B; Dan Goodin - Aug 24, 2020 12:00 pm UTC Bleichenbacher strikes again &amp;#x200B; Further Reading 1998 attack that messes with sites secret crypto keys is back in a big way By carefully modifying the ciphertext, sending it to a targeted phone, and monitoring the phone's reaction, an attacker can learn the underlying plaintext contained in the ciphertext. In this particular attack, the padding oracle can be built on compression that Bridgefy uses to reduce the load on mesh networks. This is a variant of the so-called Bleichenbacher attacknamed after its discoverer Swiss cryptographer Daniel Bleichenbacherwhich has been the source of other crippling encryption flaws, including the HTTPs attacks known as DROWN and ROBOT. &amp;#x200B; The utility of the Bleichenbacher attack devised against Bridgefy is limited because it takes about 14 hours to complete. Still, it could be useful in the event police obtain a phone following the arrest of its owner. The attack may also be feasible in protests where targeted activists stay holed up in protest camps for extended periods of time. Its not a vulnerability... its a feature &amp;#x200B; Two other attacks dont exploit Bridgefy vulnerabilities, rather these attacks target features developers intentionally designed to add app capabilities. One attack allows police or counterdemonstrators to build detailed social graphs of users connected to a network. Bridgefy's proposition? Be within a few hundred meters of each other, and you can send and receive both direct and group texts without Internet connectivity. Enlarge / Bridgefy's proposition? Be within a few hundred meters of each other, and you can send and receive both direct and group texts without Internet connectivity. Bridgefy &amp;#x200B; It works because all one-to-one messages contain the sender and receiver IDs in plaintext. The result is that anyone with physical presence can build a social graph of which IDs are communicating with every other ID over a given mesh network. The adversary can then use publicly available programming interfaces to query Bridgefys Internet server for the usernames that correspond to the IDs. &amp;#x200B; In many cases, userswhether individual or those who are included in a social graphcan be tied to real-world identities thanks to another design feature that lets users find friends who are also using the app. When users verify their accounts, theyre required to provide their phone numbers. Other users, whether verified or not, can then use a Bridgefy API to identify anyone in their contact list who has a verified account. &amp;#x200B; By using a phone that has every local or even national number in its contacts database, police or counter protestors can use this feature to obtain the phone number of any verified user. Until last December, Bridgefy required verification for every account. Since then, verification is an option. &amp;#x200B; An adversary can also track individual users movements in a crowd by building a rough topology of the network as it evolves in real time. This attack is possible because Bridgefy sends three receipts when a message is received: a mesh reach in cleartext, an encrypted delivery receipt, and an encrypted viewed receipt. The technique works because users who are further away from each other will experience a longer delay between a message and its receipts. &amp;#x200B; Another attack that results from design decisions, and a lack of defensive programming, is a zip bomb that completely shuts down a network. As the name suggests, it works by sending a compressed zip file in a broadcast message thats beamed to all connected users. When carefully crafted, the attachment is about 10 kilobytes when decrypted, but it balloons into more than 10 megabytes as soon as its unzipped. &amp;#x200B; The massive size causes the Bridgefy app to crash. Each time a user restarts the app, it will once again unzip the file and experience the same crashing error again. With all apps connected to the network repeatedly crashing, the network completely shuts down. The only way to recover is to reinstall the app, but theres nothing stopping an attacker from repeating the attack again and again. Phones have become an essential tool for modern protest organizing.

Nathan Howard/Getty Images Back to the drawing board &amp;#x200B; The researchers notified Bridgefy of their findings in late April. The app maker has yet to fix any of the vulnerabilities but said it is in the process of completely overhauling the messaging internals to use the Signal protocol, the widely trusted open-source cryptographic engine that drives both the Signal and WhatsApp apps. &amp;#x200B; In a statement, company officials wrote: &amp;#x200B; After we received the Royal Holloway University of London research teams findings, our original approach was to work quickly to fix the current Bridgefy SDK so we could release a security update to the app stores. Once we started digging deep into how we would do this, however, we realized that the SDKs current security model was based on a design that was appropriate for when Bridgefy was a small startup, but not for the scale it has today and the growth we want to achieve in the future. Fixing the reported issues would be hard to do and the solutions would not guarantee a healthy security position for our product. &amp;#x200B; Because of this, we decided to think outside the box and consider the possibility of rewriting our entire model from scratch, designing a new one that would get rid of all the reported issues right off the bat. Trying not to reinvent the wheel, we searched for an existing solution that we could use that was already validated by the industry and security experts and this is when we found the Signal Protocol. &amp;#x200B; By using this open-source protocol we are going to add a very robust end-to-end encryption mechanism to our SDK, making our users feel more confident to use our product given that this solution is already used by millions of people around the world through messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. Most importantly, we will be delegating all the security heavy lifting to the real experts and focusing more on the actual peer-to-peer mesh technology that makes our company and our SDK unique. &amp;#x200B; In terms of engineering progress, we have already begun testing a version of our SDK internally that lacks the previous outdated security layer and now encrypts messages between devices using the Signal protocol, thus fixing all of the most severe security issues reported. We are also adding another security layer that will encrypt all the SDK control messages on a per-app basis so only users from the same app can understand the messages sent through the apps mesh. &amp;#x200B; The statement went on to thank the research team. &amp;#x200B; In June, the app maker began issuing tweets like the ones here, here, and here that correct earlier statements and acknowledge the app, in fact, doesnt provide end-to-end encryption and shouldnt be relied for sensitive communications. &amp;#x200B; But the company continues to send mixed messages. The App Store and Play Store promotions mentioned earlier give the impression Bridgefy can be trusted to keep messages private, even though it has been clear to the company since April that they cant. Tweets that continue to refer to mass protests and welcome activists using the app are another example. &amp;#x200B; Its unclear how widely used the app is, despite the company touting the 1.7 million installs the messenger has, with more than 1 million in the Google Play Store alone. A fair number of comments there reported that the app doesnt work well or at all. Its also hard to find evidence of large grass-roots embrace of the app from protestors. Its possible that the majority of people who downloaded the app dont actually use it. &amp;#x200B; Even if thats the case, the rise of Bridgefy is a cautionary tale about putting trust in apps that promise security, privacy, and resiliency in adverse settings. Thats particularly true for messaging apps thatunlike Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegramare designed to work when theres no Internet service available. &amp;#x200B; Our work ... draws attention to this problem space, the researchers wrote. While it is difficult to assess the actual reliance of protesters on mesh communication, the idea of resilient communication in the face of a government-mandated Internet shutdown is present throughout protests across the globe. Yet, these users are not well served by the existing solutions they rely on. Thus, it is a pressing topic for future work to design communication protocols and tools that cater to these needs. \----------------------------------------------------------------------- \*\*\*     - Join Us: [URL  [URL &amp;#x200B;   ,  ! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*   .   .    !   ! &amp;#x200B;  ,       ?         -    . &amp;#x200B;      +  -         ! &amp;#x200B;           ,      ,         :             -      ,     ! &amp;#x200B;  , , ,   ,     .       !  .   .   .      .   .  .   .     .     ,  . &amp;#x200B;  ""  .    -  1"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  2"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  3"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  4"": [URL &amp;#x200B;     , ,  -  : [URL  [URL &amp;#x200B;     - !  .  .      .     . &amp;#x200B; True Russia -  . .  .   .    .      ,  .

Create a directory and move all the images you wish to protect into that directory. Note the path to that directory (e.g. \~/Desktop/images). Open terminal and change directory to fawkes (the unzipped folder). (If your MacOS is Catalina) Run sudo spctl --master-disable to enable running apps from unidentified developer. We are working on a solution to bypass this step. Run ./protection-v0.3 -d IMAGE\_DIR\_PATH to generate cloak for images in IMAGE\_DIR\_PATH. When the cloaked image is generated, it will output a \*\_min\_cloaked.png image in IMAGE\_DIR\_PATH. The generation takes \~40 seconds per image depending on the hardware. &amp;#x200B; PC: &amp;#x200B; Download the binary following this link and unzip the download file. Create a directory and move all the images you wish to protect into that directory. Note the path to that directory (e.g. \~/Desktop/images).

Select from min, low, mid, high. The higher the mode is, the more perturbation will add to the image and provide stronger protection. \-d, --directory : the directory with images to run protection. \-g, --gpu : the GPU id when using GPU for optimization. \--batch-size : number of images to run optimization together. Change to &gt;1 only if you have extremely powerful compute power. \--format : format of the output image (png or jpg). &amp;#x200B; when --mode is custom: &amp;#x200B; \--th : perturbation threshold \--max-step : number of optimization steps to run \--lr : learning rate for the optimization \--feature-extractor : name of the feature extractor to use \--separate\_target : whether select separate targets for each faces in the diectory. &amp;#x200B; Example &amp;#x200B; fawkes -d ./imgs --mode min Tips &amp;#x200B; The perturbation generation takes \~60 seconds per image on a CPU machine, and it would be much faster on a GPU machine. Use batch-size=1 on CPU and batch-size&gt;1 on GPUs. Turn on separate target if the images in the directory belong to different people, otherwise, turn it off. &amp;#x200B; How do I know my images are secure? &amp;#x200B; We are actively working on this.

It has seen the true arrival of commodized machine learning, where deep learning models and algorithms are readily available to Internet users. GPUs are cheaper and more readily available than ever, and new training methods like transfer learning have made it possible to train powerful deep learning models using smaller sets of data. &amp;#x200B; But accessible machine learning also has its downsides. A recent New York Times article by Kashmir Hill profiled [clearview.ai](URL an unregulated facial recognition service that has downloaded over 3 billion photos of people from the Internet and social media and used them to build facial recognition models for millions of citizens without their knowledge or permission. [Clearview.ai](URL demonstrates just how easy it is to build invasive tools for monitoring and tracking using deep learning. &amp;#x200B; So how do we protect ourselves against unauthorized third parties building facial recognition models that recognize us wherever we may go? Regulations can and will help restrict the use of machine learning by public companies but will have negligible impact on private organizations, individuals, or even other nation states with similar goals. &amp;#x200B; The SAND Lab at University of Chicago has developed Fawkes1, an algorithm and software tool (running locally on your computer) that gives individuals the ability to limit how their own images can be used to track them. At a high level, Fawkes takes your personal images and makes tiny, pixel-level changes that are invisible to the human eye, in a process we call image cloaking. You can then use these ""cloaked"" photos as you normally would, sharing them on social media, sending them to friends, printing them or displaying them on digital devices, the same way you would any other photo. The difference, however, is that if and when someone tries to use these photos to build a facial recognition model, ""cloaked"" images will teach the model an highly distorted version of what makes you look like you. The cloak effect is not easily detectable by humans or machines and will not cause errors in model training. However, when someone tries to identify you by presenting an unaltered, ""uncloaked"" image of you (e.g. a photo taken in public) to the model, the model will fail to recognize you. &amp;#x200B; Fawkes has been tested extensively and proven effective in a variety of environments and is 100% effective against state-of-the-art facial recognition models (Microsoft Azure Face API, Amazon Rekognition, and Face++). We are in the process of adding more material here to explain how and why Fawkes works. For now, please see the link below to our technical paper, which will be presented at the upcoming USENIX Security Symposium, to be held on August 12 to 14. &amp;#x200B; The Fawkes project is led by two PhD students at SAND Lab, Emily Wenger and Shawn Shan, with important contributions from Jiayun Zhang (SAND Lab visitor and current PhD student at UC San Diego) and Huiying Li, also a SAND Lab PhD student. The faculty advisors are SAND Lab co-directors and Neubauer Professors Ben Zhao and Heather Zheng. &amp;#x200B; 1The Guy Fawkes mask, a la V for Vendetta &amp;#x200B; In addition to the photos of the team cloaked above, here are a couple more examples of cloaked images and their originals. Can you tell which is the original? (Cloaked image of the Queen courtesy of TheVerge).

Enlarge / Demonstrations in Belarus over the reelection of Alexander Lukashenko are just one of the mass protests where Bridgefy is being promoted. &amp;#x200B; The rise of mass protests over the past yearin Hong Kong, India, Iran, Lebanon, Zimbabwe, and the UShas presented activists with a major challenge. How do you communicate with one another when Internet connections are severely congested or completely shut down and at the same time keep your identity and conversations private? &amp;#x200B; One heavily promoted solution has been Bridgefy, a messaging app that has the financial and marketing backing of Twitter cofounder Biz Stone and boasts having more than 1.7 million installations. By using Bluetooth and mesh network routing, Bridgefy lets users within a few hundred metersand much further as long as there are intermediary nodesto send and receive both direct and group texts with no reliance on the Internet at all. &amp;#x200B; Bridgefy cofounder and CEO Jorge Ros has said he originally envisioned the app as a way for people to communicate in rural areas or other places where Internet connections were scarce. And with the past years upswell of large protests around the worldoften in places with hostile or authoritarian governmentscompany representatives began telling journalists that the apps use of end-to-end encryption (reiterated here, here, and here) protected activists against governments and counter protesters trying to intercept texts or shut down communications. From a Bridgefy video promoting the app as suitable for protests. Enlarge / From a Bridgefy video promoting the app as suitable for protests. Bridgefy &amp;#x200B; Over the past few months, the company has continued to hold out the app as a safe and reliable way for activists to communicate in large gatherings. Bridgefy's tweets embrace protestors in Belarus, India, and Zimbabwe, not to mention the Black Lives Matter protests throughout the US. The company has also said its software developer kit can be used to build COVID-19 contact tracing apps. &amp;#x200B; Just this month, on August 10, this article quoted Bridgefy cofounder and CEO Jorge Ros saying: Last year, we became the protest app. Up until last week, Bridgefy told Android users via the Google Play Store, Dont worry! Your messages are safe and cant be read by those people in the middle. The company continues to encourage iOS users to have secure and private conversations using the app. &amp;#x200B; But now, researchers are revealing a litany of recently uncovered flaws and weaknesses that show that just about every claim of anonymity, privacy, and reliability is outright false. Unsafe at any speed &amp;#x200B; In a paper published on Monday, researchers said that the apps design for use at concerts, sports events, or during natural disasters makes it woefully unsuitable for more threatening settings such as mass protests. They wrote: &amp;#x200B; Though it is advertised as safe and private and its creators claimed it was secured by end-to-end encryption, none of aforementioned use cases can be considered as taking place in adversarial environments such as situations of civil unrest where attempts to subvert the applications security are not merely possible, but to be expected, and where such attacks can have harsh consequences for its users.

After reverse engineering the app, they devised a series of devastating attacks that allow hackersin many cases with only modest resources and moderate skill levelsto take a host of nefarious actions against users. The attacks allow for: &amp;#x200B; deanonymizing users building social graphs of users interactions, both in real time and after the fact decrypting and reading direct messages impersonating users to anyone else on the network completely shutting down the network performing active man-in-the-middle attacks, which allow an adversary not only to read messages, but to tamper with them as well &amp;#x200B; Impersonation, MitMs, and more &amp;#x200B; A key shortcoming that makes many of these attacks possible is that Bridgefy offers no means of cryptographic authentication, which one person uses to prove shes who she claims to be. Instead, the app relies on a user ID thats transmitted in plaintext to identify each person. Attackers can exploit this by sniffing the ID over the air and using it to spoof another user. &amp;#x200B; With no effective way to authenticate, any user can impersonate any other user, as long as an attacker has come into contact with that user (either one-on-one or in network-wide broadcast messages) at least once. With that, the attacker can pose as a trusted contact and trick a person into revealing personal names or other confidential information, or take harmful actions. The lack of authentication can also give rise to eavesdropping or tampering of messages. &amp;#x200B; Heres how: When hypothetical Bridgefy user Ursula messages Ivan, she uses Ivans public key to encrypt the message. Ivan then uses his private key to decrypt the message. With no cryptographic means to verify a users identity, an attackersay, one named Evecan impersonate Ivan and present her own public key to Ursula. From then on, Eve can intercept and read all messages Ursula sends to Ivan. To tamper with the messages Ursula or Ivan send, Eve impersonates both parties to the other. With that, Eve can intercept the messages each sends and change the contents or add malicious attachments before sending it on to the other party. &amp;#x200B; Theres a separate way to read encrypted messages, thanks to another major Bridgefy flaw: its use of PKCS #1, an outdated way of encoding and formatting messages so that they can be encrypted with the RSA cryptographic algorithm. This encoding method, which was deprecated in 1998, allows attackers to perform what's known as a padding oracle attack to derive contents of an encrypted message. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Page: 1 2 Next &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Bridgefy, the messenger promoted for mass protests, is a privacy disaster Researchers notified the company in April of serious flaws that have yet to be fixed. &amp;#x200B; Dan Goodin - Aug 24, 2020 12:00 pm UTC Bleichenbacher strikes again &amp;#x200B; Further Reading 1998 attack that messes with sites secret crypto keys is back in a big way By carefully modifying the ciphertext, sending it to a targeted phone, and monitoring the phone's reaction, an attacker can learn the underlying plaintext contained in the ciphertext. In this particular attack, the padding oracle can be built on compression that Bridgefy uses to reduce the load on mesh networks. This is a variant of the so-called Bleichenbacher attacknamed after its discoverer Swiss cryptographer Daniel Bleichenbacherwhich has been the source of other crippling encryption flaws, including the HTTPs attacks known as DROWN and ROBOT. &amp;#x200B; The utility of the Bleichenbacher attack devised against Bridgefy is limited because it takes about 14 hours to complete. Still, it could be useful in the event police obtain a phone following the arrest of its owner. The attack may also be feasible in protests where targeted activists stay holed up in protest camps for extended periods of time. Its not a vulnerability... its a feature &amp;#x200B; Two other attacks dont exploit Bridgefy vulnerabilities, rather these attacks target features developers intentionally designed to add app capabilities. One attack allows police or counterdemonstrators to build detailed social graphs of users connected to a network. Bridgefy's proposition? Be within a few hundred meters of each other, and you can send and receive both direct and group texts without Internet connectivity. Enlarge / Bridgefy's proposition? Be within a few hundred meters of each other, and you can send and receive both direct and group texts without Internet connectivity. Bridgefy &amp;#x200B; It works because all one-to-one messages contain the sender and receiver IDs in plaintext. The result is that anyone with physical presence can build a social graph of which IDs are communicating with every other ID over a given mesh network. The adversary can then use publicly available programming interfaces to query Bridgefys Internet server for the usernames that correspond to the IDs. &amp;#x200B; In many cases, userswhether individual or those who are included in a social graphcan be tied to real-world identities thanks to another design feature that lets users find friends who are also using the app. When users verify their accounts, theyre required to provide their phone numbers. Other users, whether verified or not, can then use a Bridgefy API to identify anyone in their contact list who has a verified account. &amp;#x200B; By using a phone that has every local or even national number in its contacts database, police or counter protestors can use this feature to obtain the phone number of any verified user. Until last December, Bridgefy required verification for every account. Since then, verification is an option. &amp;#x200B; An adversary can also track individual users movements in a crowd by building a rough topology of the network as it evolves in real time. This attack is possible because Bridgefy sends three receipts when a message is received: a mesh reach in cleartext, an encrypted delivery receipt, and an encrypted viewed receipt. The technique works because users who are further away from each other will experience a longer delay between a message and its receipts. &amp;#x200B; Another attack that results from design decisions, and a lack of defensive programming, is a zip bomb that completely shuts down a network. As the name suggests, it works by sending a compressed zip file in a broadcast message thats beamed to all connected users. When carefully crafted, the attachment is about 10 kilobytes when decrypted, but it balloons into more than 10 megabytes as soon as its unzipped. &amp;#x200B; The massive size causes the Bridgefy app to crash. Each time a user restarts the app, it will once again unzip the file and experience the same crashing error again. With all apps connected to the network repeatedly crashing, the network completely shuts down. The only way to recover is to reinstall the app, but theres nothing stopping an attacker from repeating the attack again and again. Phones have become an essential tool for modern protest organizing.

Nathan Howard/Getty Images Back to the drawing board &amp;#x200B; The researchers notified Bridgefy of their findings in late April. The app maker has yet to fix any of the vulnerabilities but said it is in the process of completely overhauling the messaging internals to use the Signal protocol, the widely trusted open-source cryptographic engine that drives both the Signal and WhatsApp apps. &amp;#x200B; In a statement, company officials wrote: &amp;#x200B; After we received the Royal Holloway University of London research teams findings, our original approach was to work quickly to fix the current Bridgefy SDK so we could release a security update to the app stores. Once we started digging deep into how we would do this, however, we realized that the SDKs current security model was based on a design that was appropriate for when Bridgefy was a small startup, but not for the scale it has today and the growth we want to achieve in the future. Fixing the reported issues would be hard to do and the solutions would not guarantee a healthy security position for our product. &amp;#x200B; Because of this, we decided to think outside the box and consider the possibility of rewriting our entire model from scratch, designing a new one that would get rid of all the reported issues right off the bat. Trying not to reinvent the wheel, we searched for an existing solution that we could use that was already validated by the industry and security experts and this is when we found the Signal Protocol. &amp;#x200B; By using this open-source protocol we are going to add a very robust end-to-end encryption mechanism to our SDK, making our users feel more confident to use our product given that this solution is already used by millions of people around the world through messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal. Most importantly, we will be delegating all the security heavy lifting to the real experts and focusing more on the actual peer-to-peer mesh technology that makes our company and our SDK unique. &amp;#x200B; In terms of engineering progress, we have already begun testing a version of our SDK internally that lacks the previous outdated security layer and now encrypts messages between devices using the Signal protocol, thus fixing all of the most severe security issues reported. We are also adding another security layer that will encrypt all the SDK control messages on a per-app basis so only users from the same app can understand the messages sent through the apps mesh. &amp;#x200B; The statement went on to thank the research team. &amp;#x200B; In June, the app maker began issuing tweets like the ones here, here, and here that correct earlier statements and acknowledge the app, in fact, doesnt provide end-to-end encryption and shouldnt be relied for sensitive communications. &amp;#x200B; But the company continues to send mixed messages. The App Store and Play Store promotions mentioned earlier give the impression Bridgefy can be trusted to keep messages private, even though it has been clear to the company since April that they cant. Tweets that continue to refer to mass protests and welcome activists using the app are another example. &amp;#x200B; Its unclear how widely used the app is, despite the company touting the 1.7 million installs the messenger has, with more than 1 million in the Google Play Store alone. A fair number of comments there reported that the app doesnt work well or at all. Its also hard to find evidence of large grass-roots embrace of the app from protestors. Its possible that the majority of people who downloaded the app dont actually use it. &amp;#x200B; Even if thats the case, the rise of Bridgefy is a cautionary tale about putting trust in apps that promise security, privacy, and resiliency in adverse settings. Thats particularly true for messaging apps thatunlike Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegramare designed to work when theres no Internet service available. &amp;#x200B; Our work ... draws attention to this problem space, the researchers wrote. While it is difficult to assess the actual reliance of protesters on mesh communication, the idea of resilient communication in the face of a government-mandated Internet shutdown is present throughout protests across the globe. Yet, these users are not well served by the existing solutions they rely on. Thus, it is a pressing topic for future work to design communication protocols and tools that cater to these needs. \----------------------------------------------------------------------- \*\*\*     - Join Us: [URL  [URL &amp;#x200B;   ,  ! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*   .   .    !   ! &amp;#x200B;  ,       ?         -    . &amp;#x200B;      +  -         ! &amp;#x200B;           ,      ,         :             -      ,     ! &amp;#x200B;  , , ,   ,     .       !  .   .   .      .   .  .   .     .     ,  . &amp;#x200B;  ""  .    -  1"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  2"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  3"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  4"": [URL &amp;#x200B;     , ,  -  : [URL  [URL &amp;#x200B;     - !  .  .      .     . &amp;#x200B; True Russia -  . .  .   .    .      ,  .

Globalism propaganda tool and Rothschild family-owned publication, The Economist has branded the US President a present danger to the New World Order, and stated that the internationalists that formed it are spinning in their graves. &amp;#x200B; The Economist names Trump is the biggest threat to the liberal New World Order above other legitimate threats such as jihadism and terrorism, Communist Chinese expansion, and North Korean hostility. Perhaps the greatest danger at present is the incumbency of an American president who despises international norms, who disparages free trade and who continually flirts with abandoning Americas essential role in maintaining the global legal order, writes The Economist. &amp;#x200B; The rules-based international order that emerged from the wreckage of the second world war was a huge improvement on any preceding era, states the article. Yet liberal internationalism is now under attack from many sides. Donald Trumps America First doctrine explicitly repudiates it.The Economist describes how the Trump administration views the world stage, citing a piece written by two of Trumps advisors in a Wall Street Journal op-ed. The world is not a global community but an arena where nations, non-governmental actors, and businesses engage and compete for advantage, H.R. McMaster and Gary Cohn wrote. We bring to this forum unmatched military, political, economic, cultural and moral strength. Rather than deny this elemental nature of international affairs, we embrace it. &amp;#x200B; The Economist then makes the strange assertion that, despite being directly responsible for numerous wars and destabilizing coup attempts around the world, the New World Order is better than any of the alternatives. Of course, there are still plenty of wars, it states. In some ways, the New World Order, which has helped make international wars so much less imaginable, has inadvertently made possible more intranational wars. Fragile and fractious countries that would previously have feared being conquered by more powerful neighbors can now fall prey to civil wars or brutal insurgencies without bad actors fearing loss of the national territory they seek to control.Non-state groups, such as Islamic State (a misnomer), can take and hold, at least for a while, territory from dysfunctional governments.Well-meaning but ill-conceived wars to change odious regimes have sometimes gone badly wrong.The magazine concludes by saying that the NWO architects of the past must be spinning in their graves considering how far Trump has already come and that he must be removed from office to preserve the New World Order. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*   .   .    !   ! &amp;#x200B;  ,       ?         -    . &amp;#x200B;           ,       ,        :            ,   ,     ! &amp;#x200B;  , ,   ,     .       !  .   .   .     .   .  .   .     .     ,  . &amp;#x200B;  ""  .    -  1"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  2"": [URL &amp;#x200B;     , ,  -  : [URL  [URL &amp;#x200B;     - !  .  .      .     . &amp;#x200B;   ,   ,  : [URL &amp;#x200B; True Russia -  . .  .   .    .    ,  .

Kennedy Jr. By Guest Author Last updated May 13, 2020 May 9, 2020 &amp;#x200B; By Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Childrens Health Defense Why are the worlds top vaccine promoters, like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez, frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine? &amp;#x200B; Scientists first attempted to develop coronavirus vaccines after Chinas 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak. Teams of US &amp; foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals suffered hyper-immune responses including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same enhanced immune response during human testing of the failed RSV vaccine tests in the 1960s. Two children died. &amp;#x200B; In this video footage, Offit, Hotez and even Anthony Fauci (in an unguarded moment), warn that any new coronavirus vaccine could trigger lethal immune reactions vaccine enhancement when vaccinated people come in contact with the wild virus. Instead of proceeding with caution, Fauci has made the reckless choice to fast track vaccines, partially funded by Gates, without critical animal studies before moving into human clinical trials that could provide early warning of runaway immune response. [URL &amp;#x200B; Gates (in the video) is so worried about the danger of adverse events that he says vaccines shouldnt be distributed until governments agree to indemnity against lawsuits. On February 4, 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website, there were only 11 active CV cases in the USA, yet the U.S. quietly pushed through Federal regulations giving coronavirus vaccine makers full immunity from liability. &amp;#x200B; Are you willing to take the risk? &amp;#x200B; 2012 Study: Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology on challenge with the SARS virus. &amp;#x200B; [URL Federal Register giving liability protection, The PREP Act [URL &amp;#x200B; ------------------- &amp;#x200B; 2. &amp;#x200B; KENNEDY: Fake News Pusher Bill Gates Controls FactChecker And Politifact Line On Vaccines By Robert F.

UN Photo / Jean-Marc Ferr By Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.  May 17, 2020 &amp;#x200B; \#BillGates is the worlds largest vaccine producer and the single largest donor to #WHO and the #CDC Foundation. Those agencies are now marketing arms for his vaccine empire. &amp;#x200B; In January 2019, #Gates had WHO declare vaccine hesitancy the top global health threat (with Ebola, cancer, war, and drug-resistant pathogens), signaling a worldwide #Pharma Gold Rush to mandate vaccines to all people. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Gates maxed-out in donations to Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiffs PAC. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; In February 2019, Schiff wrote to Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Pinterest, demanding they censor vaccine misinformation, a term meaning all skepticism toward government and industry pronouncements about vaccine safety or efficacywhether true or not. Schiff wrote: &amp;#x200B; Vaccines are both effective and safe, &amp;#x200B; There is no evidence to suggest that vaccines cause life-threatening or disabling disease. &amp;#x200B; This was misinformation. A year earlier, Schiff pushed a bill to hike the Vaccine Court admin budget to $11,200,000 to reduce vaccine injury backlogs. The court had already paid out $4 billion for vaccine deaths and disabilities. Facebook and Pinterest said that they will rely on Gatess WHO and CDC to say which on-line statements are misinformation or hoaxes. Facebook and Google hired FactChecker (Politifact) to censor vaccine misinformation. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The Gates Foundation is FactCheckers largest funder. &amp;#x200B; In his article, Fact Checker, a Propaganda Device, investigative journalist #jeremyhammond Jeremy Hammond concludes, &amp;#x200B; Facebook is guilty of misinforming its users about vaccine safety. &amp;#x200B; They have no problem with lies about vaccine safety and effectiveness, as long as its intended to persuade parents to vaccinate their children. &amp;#x200B; On May 4, 2017, FactChecker declared false Del Bigtrees statement, Vaccines include aluminum and mercury, which are neurotoxins, and vaccines cause encephalopathy. &amp;#x200B; FactChecker explained, &amp;#x200B; Current data show vaccines are safe and do not cause toxicity or encephalopathy. &amp;#x200B; Manufacturers inserts reveal that many vaccines contain aluminum and mercury, and cause encephalopathy.

Eisenhower, January 17, 1961) &amp;#x200B; \*\*\* &amp;#x200B; The World is being misled concerning the causes and consequences of the corona crisis. &amp;#x200B; The COVID-19 crisis is marked by a public health emergency under WHO auspices which is being used as a pretext and a justification to triggering a Worldwide process of economic, social and political restructuring. &amp;#x200B; Social engineering is being applied. Governments are pressured into extending the lockdown, despite its devastating economic and social consequences. &amp;#x200B; What is happening is unprecedented in World history. &amp;#x200B; Prominent scientists support the lockdown without batting an eyelid, as a solution to a global health emergency. &amp;#x200B; Amply documented, the estimates of the COVID-19 disease including mortality are grossly manipulated. &amp;#x200B; In turn, people are obeying their governments. Why? Because they are afraid? &amp;#x200B; Causes versus solutions? &amp;#x200B; The closing down of national economies applied Worldwide will inevitably result in poverty, mass unemployment and an increase in mortality. Its an act of economic warfare. &amp;#x200B; Stage One: Trade War against China &amp;#x200B; On January 30, 2020 the WHO Director General determined that the coronavirus outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The decision was taken on the basis of 150 confirmed cases outside China, First cases of person to person transmission: 6 cases in the US, 3 cases in Canada, 2 in the UK. &amp;#x200B; The WHO Director General had the backing of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Big Pharma and the World Economic Forum (WEF). The decision for the WHO to declare a Global Emergency was taken on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland (January 21-24). &amp;#x200B; One day later (January 31) following the launch of the WHO Global Emergency, The Trump administration announced that it will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in China in the last 14 days. This immediately triggered a crisis in air transportation, China-US trade as well as the tourism industry. Italy followed suit, cancelling all flights to China on January 31. &amp;#x200B; The first stage was accompanied by the disruption of trade relations with China as well as a partial closedown of export manufacturing sector. &amp;#x200B; A campaign was immediately launched against China as well ethnic Chinese. The Economist reported that &amp;#x200B; The coronavirus spreads racism against and among ethnic Chinese &amp;#x200B; Britains Chinese community faces racism over coronavirus outbreak &amp;#x200B; According to the SCMP: &amp;#x200B; Chinese communities overseas are increasingly facing racist abuse and discrimination amid the coronavirus outbreak. Some ethnic Chinese people living in the UK say they experienced growing hostility because of the deadly virus that originated in China. &amp;#x200B; And this phenomenon is happening all over the U.S. &amp;#x200B; Stage Two: The Financial Crash Spearheaded by Fear and Stock Market Manipulation &amp;#x200B; A global financial crisis unfolded in the course of the month of February culminating in a dramatic collapse of stock market values as well as a major decline in the value of crude oil. &amp;#x200B; This collapse was manipulated. It was the object of insider trading and foreknowledge. The fear campaign played a key role in the implementation of the stock market crash. In February, roughly $6 trillion have been wiped off the value of stock markets Worldwide. Massive losses of personal savings (e.g. of average Americans) have occurred not to mention corporate failures and bankruptcies. It was a bonanza for institutional speculators including corporate hedge funds. The financial meltdown has led to sizeable transfers of money wealth into the pockets of a handful of financial institutions. &amp;#x200B; Stage Three: Lockdown, Confinement, Closing Down of the Global Economy &amp;#x200B; The financial crash in February was immediately followed by the lockdown in early March. The lockdown and confinement supported by social engineering was instrumental in the restructuring of the global economy. Applied almost simultaneously in a large number countries, the lockdown has triggered the closing down of the national economy, coupled with the destabilization of trade, transport and investment activities. &amp;#x200B; The pandemic constitutes an act of economic warfare against humanity which has resulted in global poverty and mass unemployment. &amp;#x200B; Politicians are lying. Neither the lockdown nor the closing down of national economies constitute a solution to the public health crisis. &amp;#x200B; Who Controls the Politicians? &amp;#x200B; Why are politicians lying? &amp;#x200B; They are the political instruments of the financial establishment including the Ultra-rich philanthropists. Their task is to carry out the global economic restructuring project which consists in freezing economic activity Worldwide. &amp;#x200B; In the case of the Democrats in the US, they are largely concerned in opposing the reopening of the US economy as part of the 2020 election campaign. This opposition to reopening the national and global economies is supported by Big Money. &amp;#x200B; Is it opportunism or stupidity. In all major regions of the World, politicians have been instructed by powerful financial interests to retain the lockdown and prevent the re-opening of the national economy. &amp;#x200B; The fear campaign prevails. Social distancing is enforced. The economy is closed down. Totalitarian measures are being imposed. According to Dr. Pascal Sacr &amp;#x200B;  in some countries, patients can leave hospital by agreeing to wear an electronic bracelet. This is only a sample of all the totalitarian measures planned or even already decided by our governments in favor of the coronavirus crisis. It goes much further, its limitless and it affects a good part of the world, if not the whole world. . &amp;#x200B; The Herding Instincts of Politicians &amp;#x200B; Are corrupt governments acting like police dogs with herding instincts going after their sheep. &amp;#x200B; Is the herd too scared to go after their government? &amp;#x200B; The analogy may be simplistic but nonetheless considered relevant by psychologists. &amp;#x200B; Some breeds of dogs \[corrupt politicians\] have herding instincts that can be brought out with the right training and encouragement \[bribes\]. . teach your dog \[political proxy\] basic obedience and see if it \[he, she\] displays herding tendencies.  Always look for a trainer who uses reward-based training methods \[bribes, personal gain, political support, accession to high office\] (How to Teach Your Dog to Herd) &amp;#x200B; But there is another dimension. Politicians in high office responsible for convincing their herd actually believe the lies which are being imposed upon them by higher authority. &amp;#x200B; The lie becomes the truth. Politicians endorse the consensus, they enforce social engineering, they believe in their own lies. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Its Not an Epidemic, Its An Operation &amp;#x200B; US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo (slip of the tongue) tacitly admits in a somewhat contradictory statement that the COVID-19 is a Live Exercise, an Operation: &amp;#x200B; This is not about retribution, This matter is going forward  we are in a live exercise here to get this right. &amp;#x200B; To which president Trump retorted you should have told us. &amp;#x200B; Those words will go down in history. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Geopolitics &amp;#x200B; Let us be under no illusions, this is a carefully planned operation. There is nothing spontaneous or accidental. Economic recession is engineered at national and global levels. In turn, this crisis is also integrated into US-NATO military and intelligence planning. It is intent not only upon weakening China, Russia and Iran, it also consists in destabilizing the economic fabric of the European Union (EU). &amp;#x200B; Global Governance &amp;#x200B; A new stage in the evolution of global capitalism is unfolding. A system of Global Governance controlled by powerful financial interests including corporate foundations and Washington think tanks oversees decision-making at both the national and global levels. National governments become subordinate to Global Governance. The concept of World Government was raised by the late David Rockefeller at the Bilderberger Meeting, Baden Germany, June 1991: &amp;#x200B; . Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as internationalists and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure, one world if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it. (Ibid) People do not question the consensus, a consensus which borders on the absurd. &amp;#x200B; . &amp;#x200B; Global Capitalism and The Economic Landscape &amp;#x200B; The crisis redefines the structure of the global economic landscape. It destabilizes small and medium sized enterprises Worldwide, it precipitates entire sectors of the global economy including air travel, tourism, retail trade, manufacturing, etc. into bankruptcy. The lockdown creates famine in developing countries. It has geopolitical implications. &amp;#x200B; The Pentagon and US intelligence are involved. The corona crisis affects to conduct of US-NATO led wars in the Middle East including Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and Yemen. It is also used to target specific countries including Iran and Venezuela. &amp;#x200B; This engineered crisis is unprecedented in world history. It is an act of war. &amp;#x200B; The lockdown triggers a process of disengagement of human and material resources from the productive process. The real economy is brought to a standstill. Curtailing economic activity undermines the reproduction of real life. This not only pertains to the actual production of the necessities of life (food, health, education, housing) it also pertains to the reproduction of social relations, political institutions, culture, national identity. At the time of writing, the lockdown is not only triggering an economic crisis, it is also undermining and destroying the very fabric of civil society not to mention the nature of government and the institutions of the state (crippled by mounting debts), which will eventually be privatized under the supervision of Big Money creditors. &amp;#x200B; There are conflicts within the capitalist system which are rarely addressed by the mainstream media. Billionaires, powerful banking and financial institutions (which are creditors of both governments and corporations) are waging an undeclared war against the real economy. Whereas the Big Money financial and banking establishment are creditors, the corporate entities of the real economy which are being destabilized and driven into bankruptcy are debtors. &amp;#x200B; Bankruptcies &amp;#x200B; This diabolical process is not limited to wiping out small and medium sized enterprises. Big Money is also the creditor of large corporations (including airlines, hotel chains, hi tech labs, retailers, import-export firms, etc.) which are now on the verge of bankruptcy. &amp;#x200B; The global financial establishment is not monolithic. It is marked by divisions and rivalry. The dominant Big Money faction seeks to destabilize its competitors from within. The results of which would be a string of bankruptcies of regional and national banking institutions as well as a process of global financial consolidation. &amp;#x200B; In the US, numerous retailers, airlines, restaurant and hotel chains filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in February. But this is just the beginning. The big gush of bankruptcies will occur in the wake of the lockdown (The New Normal). And at the time of writing, the financial establishment is relentlessly pressuring (corrupt) national governments to postpone the lifting of the lockdown. And the governments are telling us that this is to protect people against the virus. &amp;#x200B; Canadas province of Alberta which is largely dependent on oil revenues is bankrupt. &amp;#x200B; Countries that represent over 50 per cent of the worlds global GDP are closed for business. Economists looking for historical comparisons mention the 1929 stock crash, the 1974 economic crisis or the 2008 recession. But they admit that these all fall short of the toll that this pandemic could have. (Wired News UK, April 29, 2020 &amp;#x200B; In Britain, recent reports state (Its very British) we do not know how many have gone bankrupt. &amp;#x200B; A chunk of Britains business landscape may have already been permanently erased, as some 21,000 more UK businesses collapsed in March alone than the same month a year ago, according to data gathered by the Enterprise Research Centre, a group of university researchers. &amp;#x200B; What these reports fail to mention are the unspoken causes: a fear campaign on behalf of the creditors, instructions by corrupt governments to close down the economy, allegedly to save lives, which is a big lie. Lives are not being saved, and they know it. &amp;#x200B; The coronavirus crisis has ground U.S. business to a halt. National economies are destabilized. The objective of Big Money is to weaken their competitors, pick up the pieces and eventually buy out or eliminate bankrupt corporations. And there are many to choose from. &amp;#x200B; Global Finance Capitalism &amp;#x200B; The interests of Big Money (global financial interests) overlap with those of Big Pharma, Big Oil, the Defense contractors, etc. Major banking institutions in the US including JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, State Street Co. and Goldman Sachs, are investing in the war economy including the development of nuclear weapons under Trumps 1.2 trillion dollar nuclear weapons program (first established under Obama). &amp;#x200B; The ultimate objective of Big Money is to transform nation states (with their own institutions and a national economy) into open economic territories. That was the fate of Iraq and Afghanistan. But now you can do it without sending in troops, by simply ordering subservient proxy governments integrated by corrupt politicians to close down their economy on humanitarian grounds, the so-called Responsibility to Protect (R2P) without the need for military intervention. &amp;#x200B; Impossible to estimate or evaluate. More than half the global economy is disrupted or at a standstill. &amp;#x200B; Lets be clear. This is an imperial agenda. What do the global financial elites want? To privatize the State? To own and privatize the entire planet? &amp;#x200B; The tendency is towards the centralization and concentration of economic power. Heavily indebted national governments are instruments of Big Money. They are proxies. Key political appointments are controlled by lobby groups representing Wall Street, The Military Industrial Complex, Big Pharma, Big Oil, the Corporate Media and the Digital Communications Giants, etc. &amp;#x200B; Big Money in Europe and America (through Washington Lobby groups) seek to control national governments. &amp;#x200B; In what direction are we going? What is the future of humanity? The current corona crisis is a sophisticated imperial project, which consists in Worldwide domination by a handful of multibillion dollar conglomerates. Is this World War III? Global capitalism is destroying national capitalism. &amp;#x200B; The unspoken intent of global capitalism is the destruction of the nation state and its institutions leading to global poverty on an unprecedented scale. &amp;#x200B; The following citation by Lenin dated December 1915 at the height of the First World War pointed with foresight to some of the contradictions which we are presently facing. On the other hand, we should understand that there are no easy solutions and that this crisis is intended to reinforce imperialism and the clutch of global capitalism: &amp;#x200B; There is no doubt that the development is going in the direction of a single World trust which will swallow up all enterprises and all states without exception. But the development in this direction is proceeding under such stress, with such a tempo, with such contradictions, conflicts and convulsions not only economical, but political national, etc. etc  that before a single world trust will be reached, before the respective financial national capitals will have formed a World Union of ultra imperialism, imperialism will explode and capitalism will turn into its opposite. &amp;#x200B; (V. I. Lenin, Introduction to Imperialism and World Economy by N, Bukharin, Martin Lawrence, London, printed in the US, Russian Edition, November 1917) &amp;#x200B; How to reverse the tide. The first priority is to repeal the lie. &amp;#x200B; In this regard, it is unfortunate that many people who are progressive (including prominent Left intellectuals) are despite the lies supportive of the lockdown and closing down of the economy as a solution to the public health emergency. Thats the stance of the Democratic Party in the US, which goes against common sense. &amp;#x200B; Truth is a powerful weapon for repealing the lies of the corporate media and the governments. &amp;#x200B; When the Lie Becomes the Truth There is No Moving Backwards &amp;#x200B; Without the fear campaign and media propaganda, the actions taken by our governments would not have a leg to stand on. &amp;#x200B; Social Distancing does not prevent the financial elites from providing instructions to corrupt politicians. &amp;#x200B; On the other hand, social distancing combined with confinement is being used as a means of social subordination. It prevents people from meeting as well as protesting this so-called New World Order. &amp;#x200B; Organization, Truth and Solidarity are essential to reversing the tide. The first step of a worldwide movement is counter-propaganda. &amp;#x200B; Related articles &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; 2009 H1N1 Vaccine Caused Brain Damage in Children.

The carefully-crafted statements and promises from local Democratic politicians stand in stark contrast to decades of inaction on police violence and inequality, bloated police budgets, and the damning records of Democratic Governors, Mayors, and City Councils who hold power in nearly every major city where racist police brutality and gentrification are dominant features of life in low-income neighborhoods. &amp;#x200B; To win systemic change, we need continued mass protests with accountable leadership that can fight for and win concrete demands: &amp;#x200B; Our movements will need our own political representation independent from corporate politicians.

Our City Hall before listening to a number of speakers at the peoples mic, as Sawant called it, on a range of issues, from the importance of Black LGBTQIA+ women in recent protests to taxing the council members familiar foe. &amp;#x200B; \#BlackLivesMatter protesters in #seattle have taken city hall. Thousands are moving in. [pic.twitter.com/1cTRNRZ5fv](URL &amp;#x200B;  Alex Garland (@AGarlandPhoto) June 10, 2020 &amp;#x200B; It is about building the kind of political representation that brings the voice of the people into the halls of power and grabs power for ordinary people, Sawant said. Starting Wednesday, the City Council is going to be discussing budget issues, meaning two very important demands for us: Defund SPD and Tax Amazon. &amp;#x200B; Many protesters also stayed behind to maintain a presence in the zone around 12th and Pine. Others spoke out saying the community, not politicians, should drive decisions around the camp growing outside the large police precinct emptied of equipment and boarded with plywood. So far, the boards have remained in place. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; At City Hall, after a song telling Durkan You about to lose your job, another speaker decried Sawants cooptation of the movement to push her own agenda. &amp;#x200B; Please stop using Black Lives Matter for your political campaigns, the speaker said, also noting the whiteness of many speakers at recent protests. Im really sorry, I want to tax Amazon too, I want to do all these things too, but this is not a movement for you to be politically active, for you to be politically correct, and for you to gain all these votes. Please stop taking advantage of us. &amp;#x200B; Sawant also had critical words for her council colleagues, who she called corporate politicians and sellouts. &amp;#x200B; When Im sitting on the dais, every moment I remind myself theyre not my people, youre my people, she said on the steps up to the council chamber. &amp;#x200B; ""Hey hey, ho ho, Jenny Durkan has got to go!""

A new sign hung outside the East Precinct that said this space is now property of the Seattle people. &amp;#x200B; The impromptu peaceful visit comes just a day after the SPD ceded its East Precinct at 12th and Pine, where protesters created the CHAZ which continued to sprout Tuesday as demonstrators watched a documentary in the evening and filled the space with food and beverages. &amp;#x200B; Welcome to Free Capitol Hill  Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone forms around emptied East Precinct  UPDATE &amp;#x200B; It also came after a two-hour rally on the turf field at Cal Anderson Park, where an estimated 2,000 protesters gathered in the rain for a community meeting hosted by Sawant in which about a dozen speakers from activists to religious leaders spoke. CHSBLMJune92020-3 CHSBLMJune92020-7 CHSBLMJune92020-27 CHSBLMJune92020-25 CHSBLMJune92020-37 CHSBLMJune92020-40 CHSBLMJune92020-39 CHSBLMJune92020-46 &amp;#x200B; What weve defeated here is the political establishment of this city, Sawant said, referring to the victory of taking over the SPDs East Precinct and calling out gentrification in the city and police killings over the last decade. Our fight is not just against the police, our fight is for systemic change. &amp;#x200B; K. Wyking Garrett of Africatown Community Land Trust called on city leaders to pay the fee for centuries of unfair treatment, several speakers called for the removal of the Seattle Police Officers Guild from the MLK Labor Council, and Rev. Robert Jeffrey of the New Hope Missionary Baptist Church talked of being stopped by police more than 50 times. &amp;#x200B; Ive been hit in the stomach with batons, Ive gone through everything and experienced the total demonic structures that is Seattle, said Jeffrey, who is Black. What happened to George Floyd happens to Black Americans in this country everyday. &amp;#x200B; Jeffrey closed his remarks by repeatedly telling protesters to fight on. &amp;#x200B; The weekend saw two straight nights of aggressive dispersal tactics from law enforcement, including the deployment of tear gas Sunday night, before the Seattle Police Department essentially abandoned its east precinct on 12th and Pine that it had been guarding for a week, even leaving the front door open despite extensive fencing and wood panels covering the building. &amp;#x200B; Sawant arrived at the peaceful teach-in with minimal police presence Monday evening donning her Tax Amazon mask and lauded the multi racial solidarity of the movement against police brutality and called for a demilitarization of law enforcement. &amp;#x200B; One protester grilled her on whether or not she would abolish the police before mocking her accent and having the crowd turn on him. She said police abolition was impossible in the current political system. &amp;#x200B; You can never have zero police and an elimination of racism and oppression on the basis of capitalism, Sawant said at about 11PM Monday night at the 12th and Pine intersection. &amp;#x200B; Sawant, who was at the front of another demonstration on Sunday after giving a speech a few hours earlier at another protest in Rainier Beach, said she was maced as tensions escalated that night. &amp;#x200B; The next day, she introduced two pieces of legislation related to police handling of the protests. One would ban the use of all types of chemical weapons and the other would ban police from employing chokeholds. &amp;#x200B; Welcome to Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone #capitolhillautonomouszone #CHAZ #seattleprotest #seattleprotests [pic.twitter.com/nfEUrHFpNn](URL &amp;#x200B;  riles. (@rileyhotsauce) June 10, 2020 &amp;#x200B; Knowing the who, what, and how of the zone shifts from moment to moment. Tents are beginning to sprout as some protesters move in joining the neighborhoods shelters and sleeping spaces already created by people experiencing homelessness. Official looking street signs proclaiming WELCOME TO CAPITOL HILL AUTONOMOUS ZONE and showing the exit to FREE CAPITOL HILL have gone up. There is a food co-op, an idea for a flag, and designated no smoking zones. &amp;#x200B; Misinformation  some innocent, some trolling efforts at dissent  abounds across social media and infects even smaller reservoirs of information including the CHS comments. CHS is investigating claims raised including the presence of firearms in the camp and rumors of businesses being asked to help pay for security. &amp;#x200B; The toughest part was keeping it simple, but this is what I've done. I know many wanted more black. This was difficult to achieve without changing the colour of the fist, something I absolutely did not want to do. A white fist on a BLM flag would make zero sense. #CHAZ [pic.twitter.com/fSCCZmXDNs](URL &amp;#x200B;  The true bearded leader of Antifa (@Plat\_Bumper) June 9, 2020 &amp;#x200B; CHAZ road signs have successfully been installed. #seattleprotest [pic.twitter.com/66XZab7g7C](URL &amp;#x200B;  Natalie Evans (@natalierenaee) June 10, 2020 &amp;#x200B; A list of demands has been published and has been shared widely by people on the ground and familiar with the reality of the situation in the CHAZ. The 30-point list is posted here. It is high-minded  We demand the de-gentrification of Seattle, starting with rent control  and much of it will take years. Removing Mayor Durkan, Sawant and her office should note, did not make the list. &amp;#x200B; Though Durkan has remained silent on the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, the city has not abandoned Pike/Pine. In a press release that came in the midst of the City Hall protest titled City Takes Steps to Create Safe Place for Peaceful Demonstrations, Durkans departments list off their efforts to help: &amp;#x200B; The Seattle Fire Departments (SFD) mission is to save lives and protect property.Recognizing that the Seattle Police Department (SPD) East Precinct is adjacent to residential and commercial buildings, SFD has and may continue to upstaff resources near the area to ensure crews are appropriately equipped to respond to fires and medical emergencies when its safe to do so. Several City departments have taken steps to improve access to the area for fire apparatus should an emergency occur. Additionally, with recent intentionally set bonfires, dumpster fires and attempts at structure fires, the department shared information on arson awareness and steps businesses and residences in the vicinity can take. &amp;#x200B; To help keep the area safe and clean, Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is picking up debris and trash, has cleaned graffiti that displayed hate, racist, and vulgar language or concepts, and has arranged for garbage cans and portable toilets to be placed in the vicinity for use by demonstrators. Streets are closed from 10th to 13th on Pine and on 11th between Olive and Pike. &amp;#x200B; In an effort to improve site access for firefighters and prevent arson fires in dumpster receptacles, Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) cleaned and/or removed 50 dumpsters or carts from the area in the last 24-hours. To keep the area cleanly, waste pick-up for businesses and protesters is ongoing, and daily debris removal efforts from the right-of-way continue. SPU crews continue to assist with graffiti abatement and proactive and reactive board-up of windows. In addition to SPR facilities, there are currently at least 12 portable toilets in the vicinity. &amp;#x200B; To keep Cal Anderson Park a safe and cleanly gathering area, the Parks Department (SPR) is helping with garbage and debris clean-up, weeding and tree trimming, repair of damaged garden beds, and removal of graffiti. The department has also worked to repair damaged fencing and bathrooms, and is providing support for boarding-up local businesses. An artist has been brought in to create a mural at the Park. Lights at Cal Anderson will stay on until 4 a.m. to keep the area well lit. &amp;#x200B; To help inform local small businesses of the Citys efforts and what to expect with regards to first responders operations, the Office of Economic Development (OED) canvassed area businesses. &amp;#x200B; Tonight, the Seattle Police Department will continue to answer 911 calls throughout the city, including those serviced by the East Precinct. &amp;#x200B; Seattle Fire Chief Scoggins is out here this afternoon working with SDOT and activists to get some of the barriers removed from outside the East Precinct as a way to ensure safe access for residents, businesses, and the Fire Department. Still no police here. [pic.twitter.com/Gtn3ZN9Bql](URL &amp;#x200B;  matt (@mmitgang) June 9, 2020 &amp;#x200B; Last nights decision to take down the barricades and allow protesters to freely move in and around Capitol Hill was an important step in the Citys efforts to lead with de-escalation and rebuild community trust, it reads. The City is committed to creating a safe space for peaceful demonstrations, and will also take steps to minimize property damage or potential injuries. &amp;#x200B; The role of SPD in all of this remains murky. Overnight, officers responded to a lighter than normal night of calls. But there were also moments of confusion. &amp;#x200B; Around 9 PM, a dispatch request to checkout a report of a possible fire being started in an alley was met with an usual response from police. That appears to be in the New Republic of Capitol Hill, a police officer responded. Uh, they can handle that. &amp;#x200B; Twenty minutes later after reports of the exchange spread, officers were again dispatched and reported to the scene. By the time they arrived, police learned the 911 caller had taken things into her own hands, using a fire extinguisher to put out the small fire  and spray away the alleged perpetrator. CHSBLMJune92020-50 CHSBLMJune92020-21 CHSBLMJune92020-23 CHSBLMJune92020-24 CHSBLMJune92020-22 &amp;#x200B; UPDATE 1:25 PM: In the first public comments from a city official following the exit of police officers from the East Precinct, Assistant Chief Deanna Nollette said the building has not been abandoned. &amp;#x200B; In a brief, 10-minute appearance with media, Nollette said SPD had not pulled officers out of the area, only removed the departments visible presence and boarded up building. &amp;#x200B; If the East Precinct were to catch on fire, there is a possibility the fire could spread and a very real possibility that those businesses and residents would be affected, Nollette said of the blocks near 12th and Pine. &amp;#x200B; The assistant chief reiterated the explanation given by Chief Best and the mayor that a threat of burning down the building identified as credible by the FBI drove the decision to lockdown the building and that the safest plan was to secure the structure. &amp;#x200B; Nollette said SPD is working to identify those responsible for the threats and that the department remains dedicated to working with peaceful protestors. &amp;#x200B; SPD says its officers also did not accompany Tuesday nights march from Capitol Hill to City Hall because it was peaceful and did not warrant law enforcement presence. &amp;#x200B; While Nolettes words will hopefully be reassuring to those concerned about a lack of police presence around Capitol Hill and the Central District, CHS reported on overnight East Precinct radio dispatches in which calls near the protest zone were sometimes declined by officers. &amp;#x200B; The assistant chief said the department is planning to hold daily briefings on the situation. Wednesdays session took place downtown at SPD headquarters  far from the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. &amp;#x200B; [URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; \*\*\*   .   .    !   ! &amp;#x200B;  ,       ?         -    . &amp;#x200B;           ,              :             !  ,   .       !  . &amp;#x200B;   .   .     .   .  .   .     .     ,  . &amp;#x200B;  ""  .    -  1"": [URL &amp;#x200B;  ""  .   .  2"": [URL &amp;#x200B;   , ,  -  : [URL  [URL &amp;#x200B;     - !  .      !     !   ,   ,  : [URL &amp;#x200B; True Russia -  . .  .   .    .    ,  .

The real scene is chill, peaceful, happy- a bit boring, to be honest. Here are a few scenes from a casual stroll a little earlier today.

They have to vote on constitutional amendments that include allowing Vladimir Putin to remain in the Kremlin potentially until 2036. &amp;#x200B; Organisers of Russias pseudo-referendum to amend the constitution  originally scheduled for 22 April but delayed owing to the coronavirus outbreak  appear to be making up the rules as they go along. &amp;#x200B; In a single vote, Russians must choose whether to support a package of amendments that include pension and minimum wage boosts, a modest reorganisation of government, a constitutional mention of faith in god, a ban on gay marriage, exhortations to preserve Russian history, and a ban on top officials holding dual citizenship. &amp;#x200B; Ads for the vote barely mention that it will also reset term limits for Putin, who has ruled since 2000. &amp;#x200B; It is not an official referendum and the rules are custom-designed. Unlike in normal elections, voting is allowed online and takes place over a week, between 25 June and 1 July. As Russia continues to grapple with the coronavirus, some voting officials have decided it is safer to collect ballots outdoors, planting ballot boxes on tree stumps, in the boots of cars, in public buses and on plastic patio furniture. An outdoor polling station in Novosibirsk. Photograph: Kirill Kukhmar/Tass &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; The referendum is both momentous and absurd. Russians can endorse (or oppose) a plan to let Putin run for two more terms, potentially prolonging his rule beyond that of Stalin, and then win a washing machine or a hairdryer. &amp;#x200B; It looks like a gameshow but Im telling everybody I know to take this seriously, its enough to make you lose your mind, said Oleg Kharlamov, a laboratory technician from Moscow who said he intended to vote against the amendments. The vote would help determine whos in charge for the next generation, and if we complain, they will say  you voted for it, he said. &amp;#x200B; Timeline Putin's hold over power in Russia Show The raffles and prize giveaways are just part of a broad get-out-the-vote effort endorsed by the government. Companies have authorised their own prize giveaways that could allow them to track employee voting, while government workers such as teachers and doctors  some of whom are busy fighting the coronavirus outbreak  are reportedly being urged to cast ballots, in systematic attempts to boost turnout. &amp;#x200B; Meanwhile, Instagram and TikTok influencers claim they have been offered millions of roubles by shady middlemen to urge their young followers to vote. &amp;#x200B; Analysts say the Kremlin has concluded that the rescheduled referendum had to happen now, after Russia had declared victory over the coronavirus (despite more than 7,000 new cases a day still being reported) and before the effects of a battered economy or a potential second wave further sour public opinion. &amp;#x200B; The situation looks volatile, people are in a tough situation. Many have lost their jobs and more could lose them in the future, said Tatiana Stanovaya, the head of the R.Politik analysis firm. They \[the government\] want to hold this vote quickly and close the topic. The longer they waited, the harder it would be to mobilise the public and get the right result. &amp;#x200B; There are broad concerns that the results will be manipulated, particularly with limited scope to monitor polling places and online voting. Pavel Lobkov, a reporter for TV Rain, managed to vote in person at a polling station and then online on Thursday as the polls opened, effectively casting two ballots. Election officials said his extra vote would be discounted. &amp;#x200B; There is almost no likelihood the vote will fail. Weeks before the vote, publishers had begun stocking Moscow bookstores with copies of the amended constitution. &amp;#x200B; The Kremlin is said to be targeting 70% support for the amendments, and it would embarrass Putin for the measure to sneak through with a thin majority. But the government also must avoid any image of a rigged vote like that which led to protests following the 2011 parliamentary elections. &amp;#x200B; Rather than an emphatic public endorsement of Putin, the vote has more resembled a chore that must be done. &amp;#x200B; Prize draw leaflets, badges and wristbands for voters at a polling place at Moscows Kazansky railway station.

Photograph: Stanislav Krasilnikov/Tass It will be something that the bureaucratic machine will be happy to get off its chest. Were done, now lets forget about it, said Yekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. She added that the vote was more of a burden on the Kremlins political resources than a chance to win a new political mandate. It will not be the source of additional legitimacy to the political regime or to the president individually. &amp;#x200B; The government campaign has avoided reminding Russians that they are potentially endorsing Putins right to rule until 2036, which Schulmann said was most divisive amendment. Instead, billboards have urged Russians to preserve family values or featured images of the poet Alexander Pushkin saying protect our language and culture. &amp;#x200B; I dont know how the campaign organisers actually sold it to \[Putin\] but he is not that popular right now, said Schulmann, noting that the presidents ratings had dipped since 2018. So thats why we see children and Pushkin, so as not to antagonise but consolidate the electorate. &amp;#x200B; Putin himself dangled the possibility of amending the constitution in 2012 but then boasted at his restraint in leaving the countrys founding document untouched. When he returned to the idea in the last year, advisors understood that the campaign would be divisive. But despite calling for the referendum, Putin has exhibited a characteristic disdain for campaign politics, barely advocating for his own measures. &amp;#x200B; A portrait of Vladimir Putin at a polling station in Moscow FacebookTwitterPinterest A portrait of Vladimir Putin at a polling station in Moscow. Photograph: Maxim Shipenkov/EPA Putin believes he has the publics support, that they believe in him and his reforms, and for him this \[vote\] is just a formality, said Stanovaya, noting that he appeared far more invested in holding the countrys rescheduled Victory Day parade than in the vote. &amp;#x200B; The vote was targeted at stabilising elite circles, argued Stanovaya. He needs a reference that he can show his elites and say: I have public support to rule for as long as I believe I need to. No one of you has the right to discuss successors. &amp;#x200B; There remains debate over whether Putin will actually return for terms five and six or simply wants to avoid becoming a lame duck. As he himself argued during a TV interview last week, his potential return will put to bed discussions of a possible successor for the coming four years. Or 10.

Its a backdoor with phone functionality, quips Gabi Cirlig about his new Xiaomi phone. Hes only half-joking. &amp;#x200B; Cirlig is speaking with Forbes after discovering that his Redmi Note 8 smartphone was watching much of what he was doing on the phone. That data was then being sent to remote servers hosted by another Chinese tech giant, Alibaba, which were ostensibly rented by Xiaomi. &amp;#x200B; The seasoned cybersecurity researcher found a worrying amount of his behavior was being tracked, whilst various kinds of device data were also being harvested, leaving Cirlig spooked that his identity and his private life was being exposed to the Chinese company. &amp;#x200B; Today In: Cybersecurity &amp;#x200B; This Surprisingly Simple Email Trick Will Stop Spam With One Click Microsoft Just Dealt A Blow To Google Chrome With These New Security Features WhatsApp Suddenly Gets Powerful New Security Boost: Heres Why It Affects You When he looked around the Web on the devices default Xiaomi browser, it recorded all the websites he visited, including search engine queries whether with Google or the privacy-focused DuckDuckGo, and every item viewed on a news feed feature of the Xiaomi software. That tracking appeared to be happening even if he used the supposedly private incognito mode. &amp;#x200B; The device was also recording what folders he opened and to which screens he swiped, including the status bar and the settings page. All of the data was being packaged up and sent to remote servers in Singapore and Russia, though the Web domains they hosted were registered in Beijing. &amp;#x200B; Meanwhile, at Forbes request, cybersecurity researcher Andrew Tierney investigated further. He also found browsers shipped by Xiaomi on Google PlayMi Browser Pro and the Mint Browserwere collecting the same data. Together, they have more than 15 million downloads, according to Google Play statistics. &amp;#x200B; Many more millions are likely to be affected by what Cirlig described as a serious privacy issue, though Xiaomi denied there was a problem. Valued at $50 billion, Xiaomi is one of the top four smartphone makers in the world by market share, behind Apple, Samsung and Huawei. Xiaomis big sell is cheap devices that have many of the same qualities as higher-end smartphones. But for customers, that low cost could come with a hefty price: their privacy. &amp;#x200B; Cirlig thinks that the problems affect many more models than the one he tested. He downloaded firmware for other Xiaomi phonesincluding the Xiaomi MI 10, Xiaomi Redmi K20 and Xiaomi Mi MIX 3 devices. He then confirmed they had the same browser code, leading him to suspect they had the same privacy issues. &amp;#x200B; And there appear to be issues with how Xiaomi is transferring the data to its servers. Though the Chinese company claimed the data was being encrypted when transferred in an attempt to protect user privacy, Cirlig found he was able to quickly see just what was being taken from his device by decoding a chunk of information that was hidden with a form of easily crackable encoding, known as base64. It took Cirlig just a few seconds to change the garbled data into readable chunks of information. &amp;#x200B; My main concern for privacy is that the data sent to their servers can be very easily correlated with a specific user, warned Cirlig. &amp;#x200B; Xiaomis response In response to the findings, Xiaomi said, The research claims are untrue, and Privacy and security is of top concern, adding that it strictly follows and is fully compliant with local laws and regulations on user data privacy matters. But a spokesperson confirmed it was collecting browsing data, claiming the information was anonymized so wasnt tied to any identity. They said that users had consented to such tracking. &amp;#x200B; But, as pointed out by Cirlig and Tierney, it wasnt just the website or Web search that was sent to the server. Xiaomi was also collecting data about the phone, including unique numbers for identifying the specific device and Android version. Cirlig said such metadata could easily be correlated with an actual human behind the screen. &amp;#x200B; Xiaomis spokesperson also denied that browsing data was being recorded under incognito mode. Both Cirlig and Tierney, however, found in their independent tests that their web habits were sent off to remote servers regardless of what mode the browser was set to, providing both photos and videos as proof. &amp;#x200B; When Forbes provided Xiaomi with a video made by Cirlig showing how his Google search for porn and a visit to the site PornHub were sent to remote servers, even when in incognito mode, the company spokesperson continued to deny that the information was being recorded. This video shows the collection of anonymous browsing data, which is one of the most common solutions adopted by internet companies to improve the overall browser product experience through analyzing non-personally identifiable information, they added. &amp;#x200B; Both Cirlig and Tierney said Xiaomis behavior was more invasive than other browsers like Google Chrome or Apple Safari. Its a lot worse than any of the mainstream browsers I have seen, Tierney said. Many of them take analytics, but it's about usage and crashing. Taking browser behavior, including URLs, without explicit consent and in private browsing mode, is about as bad as it gets. &amp;#x200B; Cirlig also suspected that his app use was being monitored by Xiaomi, as every time he opened an app, a chunk of information would be sent to a remote server. Another researcher whod tested Xiaomi devices, though was under an NDA to discuss the matter openly, said hed seen the manufacturers phone collect such data. Xiaomi didnt respond to questions on that issue. &amp;#x200B; Behavioral Analytics Xiaomi appears to have another reason for collecting the data: to better understand its users behavior. Its using the services of a behavioral analytics company called Sensors Analytics. The Chinese startup, also known as Sensors Data, has raised $60 million since its founding in 2015, most recently taking $44 million in a round led by New York private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which also featured funding from Sequoia Capital China. As described in Pitchbook, a tracker of company funding, Sensors Analytics is a provider of an in-depth user behavior analysis platform and professional consulting services. Its tools help its clients in exploring the hidden stories behind the indicators in exploring the key behaviors of different businesses. &amp;#x200B; Both Cirlig and Tierney found their Xiaomi apps were sending data to domains that appeared to reference Sensors Analytics, including the repeated use of SA. When clicking on one of the domains, the page contained one sentence: Sensors Analytics is ready to receive your data! There was an API called SensorDataAPIan API (application programming interface) being the software that allows third parties access to app data. Xiaomi is also listed as a customer on Sensors Datas website. &amp;#x200B; The founder and CEO of Sensors Data, Sang Wenfeng, has a long history in tracking users. At Chinese internet giant Baidu he built a big data platform for Baidu user logs, according to his company bio. &amp;#x200B; Xiaomis spokesperson confirmed the relationship with the startup: While Sensors Analytics provides a data analysis solution for Xiaomi, the collected anonymous data are stored on Xiaomi's own servers and will not be shared with Sensors Analytics, or any other third-party companies. &amp;#x200B; Its the second time in two months that a huge Chinese tech company has been seen watching over users phone habits. A security app with a private browser made by Cheetah Mobile, a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, was seen collecting information on Web use, Wi-Fi access point names and more granular data like how a user scrolled on visited Web pages. Cheetah argued it needed to collect the information to protect users and improve their experience. &amp;#x200B; Late in his research, Cirlig also discovered that Xiaomis music player app on his phone was collecting information on his listening habits: what songs were played and when. &amp;#x200B; One message was clear to the researcher: when youre listening, Xiaomi is listening, too. &amp;#x200B; UPDATE: Xiaomi posted a blog in which it delineated how and when it collects visited URLs visited by its users. Read it in full here. &amp;#x200B; The company reiterated that the data transferred from Xiaomi devices and browsers was anonymized and not attached to any identity. &amp;#x200B; \*\*\* &amp;#x200B;   ,   ,  : [URL &amp;#x200B; True Russia -         IT    IT      Russia  Internet  Cybersecurity cybercrime privacy security and surveillance"

Unfortunately, we  the 96% of the worlds population living elsewhere  are dependent on decision makers elected by the 4% living in the US."" &amp;#x200B;  : &amp;#x200B;  : Durov's Channel ""Today is a sad day for us here at Telegram. We are announcing the discontinuation of our blockchain project. Below is a summary of what it was and why we had to abandon it."" &amp;#x200B; What Was TON And Why It Is Over Pavel Durov May 12, 2020 &amp;#x200B; For the last 2,5 years some of our best engineers have been working on a next-generation blockchain platform called TON and a cryptocurrency we were going to name Gram. TON was designed to share the principles of decentralization pioneered by Bitcoin and Ethereum, but to be vastly superior to them in speed and scalability. &amp;#x200B; We were very proud with the result  the technology we created allowed for an open, free, decentralized exchange of value and ideas. When integrated with Telegram, TON had the potential to revolutionize how people store and transfer funds and information. &amp;#x200B; Unfortunately, a US court stopped TON from happening. How? Imagine that several people put their money together to build a gold mine  and to later split the gold that comes out of it. Then a judge comes and tells the mine builders: ""Many people invested in the gold mine because they were looking for profits. And they didn't want that gold for themselves, they wanted to sell it to other people. Because of this, you are not allowed to give them the gold."" &amp;#x200B; If this doesn't make sense to you, you are not alone  but this is exactly what happened with TON (the mine), its investors, and Grams (the gold). A judge used this reasoning to rule that people should not be allowed to buy or sell Grams like they can buy or sell Bitcoins. &amp;#x200B; Perhaps even more paradoxically, the US court declared that Grams couldn't be distributed not only in the United States, but globally. Why? Because, it said, a US citizen might find some way of accessing the TON platform after it launched. So, to prevent this, Grams shouldnt be allowed to be distributed anywhere in the world  even if every other country on the planet seemed to be perfectly fine with TON. &amp;#x200B; This court decision implies that other countries dont have the sovereignty to decide what is good and what is bad for their own citizens. If the US suddenly decided to ban coffee and demanded coffee shops in Italy be closed because some American might come there  we doubt anyone would agree. &amp;#x200B; And yet, despite that, we have made the difficult decision not to proceed with TON. &amp;#x200B; Sadly, the US judge is right about one thing: we, the people outside the US, can vote for our presidents and elect our parliaments, but we are still dependent on the United States when it comes to finance and technology (luckily not coffee). The US can use its control over the dollar and the global financial system to shut down any bank or bank account in the world. It can use its control over Apple and Google to remove apps from the App Store and Google Play. So yes, it is true that other countries do not have full sovereignty over what to allow on their territory. Unfortunately, we  the 96% of the worlds population living elsewhere  are dependent on decision makers elected by the 4% living in the US. &amp;#x200B; This may change in the future. But today, we are in a vicious circle: you cant bring more balance to an overly centralized world exactly because its so centralized. We did try though. We're leaving it to the the next generations of entrepreneurs and developers to pick up the banner and learn from our mistakes. &amp;#x200B; I am writing this post to officially announce that Telegrams active involvement with TON is over. You may see  or may have already seen  sites using my name or the Telegram brand or the ""TON"" abbreviation to promote their projects. Dont trust them with your money or data. No present or past member of our team is involved with any of these projects. While networks based on the technology we built for TON may appear, we wont have any affiliation with them and are unlikely to ever support them in any way. So be careful, and dont let anyone mislead you. &amp;#x200B; I want to conclude this post by wishing luck to all those striving for decentralization, balance and equality in the world. You are fighting the right battle. This battle may well be the most important battle of our generation. We hope that you succeed where we have failed.
