0,vulnerability,CompTIA,Attempting CYSA (CSO-001) soon! Quick question,1,i2tiap,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i2tiap/attempting_cysa_cso001_soon_quick_question/,2020-08-03 18:41:56,"Hey everyone! Hope everyone is doing well with their certification goals I recently completed my Security+, CEH and degree last month, and was attempting to go for the CySa+ next in order to be well equipped for the working world. I was just wondering as Ive recently enrolled in and finished Jason Dions course, and was wondering if anyone who had taken the exam before thought it was adequate enough alone to prepare for the exam. I found many of the topics he covered to be a bit basic and not in-depth (maybe thats all were supposed to know for the exam though) I was also wondering if anyone had any great resources they could recommend for this exam. Ive heard it comprises mainly of reading logs and vulnerability reports."
1,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed CASP+,1,i4rexn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i4rexn/passed_casp/,2020-08-06 23:02:46,"Heres my obligatory passed post. So last Friday I took CASP+ and passed. I held off on posting because I received no communication from CompTIA acknowledging that I passed. Pearson shows I passed. However, it appears that it must be some issue with the importing of exams for CASP. I will say yes, the exam was harder than expected. However, I failed it last year and decided to go back and take CySA to shore up any knowledge gaps. That plus on the job experience (was a sr sec analyst at the time) has been the biggest aides to passing the cert. I definitely knew more than I thought I did. The materials I used were; * CASP+ AIO - This book was great, it is my everyday reference on all thing security now. It's value really shines in real world for me. * Pocket Prep - Was great at concepts but, nothing on pocket prep will be on the exam. However, needed to hammer concepts to understand questions. * Pearson Test Prep (Cert Guide) - Actually, really great. The questions were the closest to the exam. * Sybex Test Prep (Wiley) - Another great resource. I want to shoutout others on the subreddit for just giving me to motivation to keep going. Also, thanks to u/databass007 for all the tips and advice. Im currently a Sr InfoSec Engineer. My role is a mix of Application Security, Vulnerability Management, Project Management, and Reverse Engineering. So I am working on validating my skillset and enhancing my craft. Next up is Pentest+, eJPT, (CEH cause Im forced to get it for a dumb reason even though I dont need it lol) CISSP, CCSK, CHFI, and GCIH."
2,vulnerability,CompTIA,CySA+ Passed! (CS0-001),1,i69473,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i69473/cysa_passed_cs0001/,2020-08-09 09:26:40,"Hey everyone, I passed my CySA+ yesterday on my first attempt with a 797! I've been in networking since I was 19 (now 23) and switched over to a Cyber Security role to reindulge my Pentesting passion. I stopped because I hated coding then automation came around and fell in love with Python and some other languages. So I figured, if I am going to get good at coding why not do something that I wanted to since I get into this profession during my high school classes? &amp;#x200B; Anyways, here is what I used to study: &amp;#x200B; \- Sybex CySA+ \- [ITPRO.TV](URL (HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM) \- HTB, Kali, and my own lab as well as ITPROTV's labs. &amp;#x200B; I already have my A+, Net+, Sec+, CCNA, CCNP r/S, and NA Security (before it got retired). The exam itself was good and I have never failed a Comptia exam....can't say the same for cisco though LOL. Honestly, I wanted to get into security later in my career (im 23 now), but since I am going for my masters in Cybersec, I decided now was the time to leave networking behind (I'll miss it, but not the cisco koolaid). I currently work with a focus in NAC, IDS, and FW (Checkpoint is next.....can't wait for our palos (:, checkpoints meh). &amp;#x200B; I will offer some advice if anyone plans to take this one before the exam retires, and I would recommend you know the Incident Response Process, how to analyze pcaps, brush up on some basic networking concepts if you don't have networking experience (ARP, how routing works, etc.). The vulnerability section was huge and a ton of fun, but I will say the most difficult was the different frameworks and understanding the SDLC. I can't go into specifics, but you really do need to know all the exam topics to get the big picture. Otherwise than that, good luck y'all!!! Onto checkpoint now ):"
3,vulnerability,CompTIA,Security+ exam 601 or 501?,1,i7ks79,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/i7ks79/security_exam_601_or_501/,2020-08-11 14:04:55," Hello, I will be graduating with bachelors in computer engineering this fall. I want to pursue cybersecurity field and I might do masters in cybersecurity in future(not sure yet). Before that, I am considering Security+ exam but Im not sure if I should wait for the newer version or go for SY0-501. I do not want to overload my classes but I do not know how much time I would need to put in for this exam. I also do not know when is the last day to take 501 exam. I might be little late to this. I began watching videos on LinkedIn Learning by Mike Chapple for SY0-601 and so far I completed first chapter Threats and Vulnerability. I know that 601 has a lot of new content. If I were to take 601 exam, when should I take it? If I were to take 501 exam, what is the last day to take this exam? I think Im also asking which exam should I take 501 or 601? Thank you!"
4,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed CySA+,1,idwzjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/idwzjo/passed_cysa/,2020-08-21 23:45:06,"Finally go this exam under my belt. I initial started studying last year but dropped it after a few weeks, then started again at the end of last year but had to drop it again as work needed me to sit a different exam. And now on my 3rd attempt to study the exam I passed on first attempt. I took the 001 exam both to renew my Sec+ and get the CySA+ before its end of life for the 002 **Materials** I used the Sybex Study Guide Book, From which i made my own note on [github](URL I also used [Daniel Arsenault's notes](URL on google docs which were very good. And a handful of resources on this CySA+ [study link](URL Its from all of these that I assembled my notes. I also used Jason Dions videos &amp; Brent Chapmans videos on Udamy, Both were very good and it is worth watching both. If you had to pick one I would pick Jason Dions. Once I had covered this I used the Sybex Practice questions book. Which I registered online to used their web interface for questions which was a little clunky but way easier than doing questions from the book. These were slimier to the exam and I would say more difficult. I also got the Jason Dion practice questions which were a bit meh **How Long Did I Study** Hard to say Ive tried 3 times to study for this but other things got in the way. If I was to take a guess I would say 8 weeks start to finish would be what I did. Taking restarts into account. **Readyness** I was scoring around 75% on the Sybex test questions, I knew I was missing question as I was missing words in the questions such as LEAST, MOST, NOT. I know in a exam setting i would be taking things slower so figured I should be around 80% - 85% if I was to really concentrate. **Experience** Im working 2-3 years in security and have a few Security certifications. Although this helped I fell with little to no security experience you could get the certification if you focused on the exam. **On the Day** Didnt look at any notes on the day, Just scheduled a early exam in a pearsonvue test center and sat it in person. Its more important to switch off the night before and get a good nights sleep rather than any last minute cramming. I skipped the performance based question and worked on the MCQ, I was expecting to feel like I was failing but about half way through I was feeling good, no curve balls or topics I didnt know or hadn't heard of before, by the end of the MCQ I was feeling good. The performance based questions were challenging but not impossible, there is alot of information to get through but by the time you have analyzed the situation they give you they are not to bad. That said I did have on where I had to analyses a number of outputs from servers and say what one was compromised and why. I had no idea they all looked fine so I just guessed. **What should you study** I seen alot of ""what would you do next"" questions, which is really a test of do you know the incident response steps, alot of vulnerability questions and prioritizing vulnerability. There were logs (shock right) most I could read pretty easily and there was linux commands. I feel you wont know enough about linux commands to cover every question they will ask but if you know a little you can tell what looks wrong and what wont give you what you need. I didnt feel there was too much outside the scope of what was covered in the materials I used to prepair. **A note on Logs** Alot of what I read here is people nervous about that they will have to read through logs, firewall rules etc. The log samples Ive seen are short samples maybe 8 - 16 lines you will see what look unusual. Its not a fill log dump of 2000 lines and they ask you to find the 1 SQL injection. I think people make a bigger deal of this than what it is. Have a look at [URL which will help. You dont need to know any of the examples but if you can follow whats being shown in each you know enough to pass **Next** Going to pull away from security certification and work on AWS certs. **Finally** Thanks you to all who share your story's hear, it was motivation to hear the success story's. WHat i would say is this subreddit need more flair. There is no flair for CySA+ or Pentest+ which makes finding posts on it consist of endless scrolling. If you have any questions please let me know il do my best to answer them"
5,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passes CySA+ version 1 with a 797,1,ie6j5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/ie6j5f/passes_cysa_version_1_with_a_797/,2020-08-22 08:12:53,"I passed this morning! I used the following materials: -Jason Dion's Udemy Course -Jason Dion's CSO-001 Practice Exams -The Cyber Mentor's Practical Ethical Hacking on Udemy -a bit of work experience I passed Sec+ last year which is truly a bulk of the exam. Prior to studying for the exam, I did TCM's Practical Ethical Hacking course on Udemy. I didn't do that as a way to study for the exam, but I was really comfortable with the Threat Management and Vulnerability Management domains because of that course, but instead of using those techniques to exploit the system, you use the knowledge to defend the system. From the time I decided to purchase the voucher and start studying to today was about 3 weeks (I finished PEH a while ago). Goal was about 1-2 hours of study a day. I watched all of the videos and took notes, then worked on the practice exams. At first, I did not review questions I got wrong, I just restudied the domains. Closer to test date, I started reviewing the questions and scored between 86-97% on all of the practice exams. On the work experience side, I was used to seeing nessus scans and understand how group policy and sccm works, at least superficially to pass the exam. I did the online test with PerasonVue. Take the 30 minutes prior to get set up. I did and still didn't start until 20 minutes after my exam start time because of photo and camera issues, but the proctor worked through them with me. Ultimately, I'm happy that I did this exam. If you have any questions, please let me know!"

7,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed CySA+ 001 exam 1st attempt,42,hx01gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/hx01gk/passed_cysa_001_exam_1st_attempt/,2020-07-24 21:25:03,"I have successfully passed this exam. A lot of studying it took. I will list my study materials and how long I spent studying but first, my thoughts. The exam was hard. This was by far the hardest comptia exam I have personally take. I have multiple comptia certs:A+,Net+,sec+ and now Cysa+ I also hold CCENT, CCNA, CCNP Switch and ITIL v4. You will see a lot of questions on there about logs. Most of the log stuff I didn't even research before hand but my experience as sys admin and in IT generally (since 2014) helped. The logs you will see are http logs, buffer overflows, IDS/PS, ACL's, sql injections, more input validations, basic Linux logs( I have very very little Exp with Linux let alone logs from it) vulnerability logs, firewall logs, WAF logs, windows even viewer logs and possibly some more that I cannot remember. Bottom line, study up on logs, look at pictures of them, look at sites about all these types of logs and how to read them. Then there were the very long winded comptia questions that have similar answers but only the best wins (very subjective as in real life, the answers will not be the case). This was the hardest part of the exam for me. Reread the question a lot and start looking at the answers once the first fact comes up in the question to start the process of elimination. Good luck on the questions. Some where pretty straight forward and easy, others were difficult to say the least. Overall, I started studying heavily in late May/early June for about 2nhours a day including some weekends. It took me about 1.5 months to complete this. Not bad but still a lot of time and effort. (full-time job and kids) Study materials: Jason Dions Udemy course(very good and definetly helped a lot) Mike Chappels linkden course with Sybex book(this follows the book and the course was great and in depth, even so better than Jason dions albeit some stuff) Sybex book Wiley tests (same end of chapter tests but online) Cybrary for labs and practice exams(labs were good but didn't necessarily help me a whole lot, but did a little, would recommend) Good luck on passing the exam to whomever takes it. Use all the study tools you need to pass.. Pm me for advice or want me to clarify more."
8,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed PenTest+ at 802,1,hyul8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/hyul8e/passed_pentest_at_802/,2020-07-28 01:40:25,"Hello fellow redditers I have passed, a while ago, PenTest+ exam with 802 score. This comes two weeks after passing CySA+. I looked through the exam objectives and found a good amount of overlap with CySA+ especially the Vulnerability assessment and attacks parts, so I decided to go for it after CySA+ immediately. My plan was to read Sybex book and watch Jason Dion's udemy course. However, I had a family emergency and had to skip about three days from my allocated two weeks. Hence, I read only the first four chapters of the book and then decided to go for the videos only. So I did that. And I can safely say it was a wrong decision. The videos were not adequate for the exam. Many questions needed deeper knowledge of the attacks and exploits than what was shallowly discussed in the videos. If I didn't have a good background knowledge or didn't prep well for CySA earlier, I would've definitely failed. I'd recommend this: 1. Take appropriate time to prepare. 2. Don't rely on one reference. I was kinda forced to because I had very tight timing constraint and couldn't postpone the exam. 3. Jason Dion videos would make a nice revision prep, but not the main ref. 4. Sybex book seems really nice and detailed. It has a very important feature which is the distribution of the tools discussion over all the other chapters. So when the chapter discusses vuln. assessment it shows in details the tools and examples. This is particularly important because CompTIA exam domains has a separate domain for tools. So, many resources explain the attacks and exploits separately from the tools which can be confusing. 5. Try to build a small virtual lab to exercise. Metasploit VM, metasploitable VM, and perhaps a windows 7 VM for windows exploits. 6. Last, read the holy SQL injection in all of its forms!! Last, I'd like to thank everyone in this subreddit. You've been super helpful in my couple of months (and 3 certifications) here."
9,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed Security+ SY0-501,1,hz6xy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/hz6xy0/passed_security_sy0501/,2020-07-28 13:11:27,"Hello everybody, Just passed Sec+ with 792. Thanks for all your insights and advice. Around 10th question in, I thought I was going to run out of time (happened) and may be just fail. I wasn't too sure until I saw the score. There were so many questions I thought I got wrong. Some question/answer sets just didn't make sense or cried out loud for more context. I suspect there were many experimental, unscored questions. I've heard some who passed say they they felt they would fail, so during the exam keep this in mind...you are probably doing not as bad you think. I prepped for a week and half, but don't go by that because I have tons of IT experience (COTS app deployment/integration, IT Service Management, AWS etc.), although I never focused solely on security before. **Preparation:** Mike Meyer's Udemy course - recommended, very engaging. Entertaining actually. I could watch him for hours. 19 hours total. I finished in a week at mostly 2x speed. A for this course, would give A+ if he gave you summary notes/deck. Jason Dion's Udemy practice tests - managed to do 2 of them - recommended. Prof. Messer's notes and sample exams. I bought this after finishing Mike Meyer. People like his free videos, but I watched a few minutes and wondered if he could have held my attention like Mike Meyer did for long stretches. Prof.'s notes helped reinforce my video learning (seeing it in text was different). Sample exams are very good (did two), but serious pain in the neck and time consuming to do/score because it's one PDF file, not online like Jason's. **About the exam:** All PBQs were in the beginning, and they killed me. I skipped three PBQs and at the end ran out of time with one to even put random answers. One was a stunner, as I didn't see it in any of the sample tests. There were around 10 lines of Linux command line code used to make a server secure. You had to put the commands in order. They mean it when they say 2 years of experience recommended. Else, you can still pass with good preparation, but some of the questions will stump you. Some PBQs still don't make sense to me. There was one about dragging and dropping various security measures to defend different parts of the network (corporate office, data center, unsupervised lab, remote laptops). Matching security measure shouldn't be hard, but I still don't understand things like if they needed me to drag and drop three Cable Locks or one Cable Lock, to the ""unsupervised lab"" section where they showed three laptops. You are not testing my security knowledge at this point, but testing my ability to figure out how you setup the question and the diagram (hint: not intuitive). I needed to know some port numbers (main ones, you will find lists of 10-12 around). I advise learning about one common protocol that uses UDP. Reading ACL lines/fixing them (CIDR, protocol, port number). RADIUS. Mail encryption. Shibbeloth. SAML. Kerberos. DNS. http vs http. sftp. ssh. scp. TLS. CYOD, BYOD. Ddos, XSS. Capture portal. Passive/active reconnaissance, intrusive/unintrusive vulnerability assessment, penetration tests. nmap vs netcat. multiple attack types (such as vishing, social engineering, spear f., whaling, bluesnarfing) . Buffer overflow. Whitebox/black box etc. Volatility during forensic. CRL. HOTP. MTTR, MTTF, MTBT. Cloud broker. RAID 0,1,1+0. SIEM, DLP. WAF. Honeypot. Airgap.... At home testing went without a hitch, highly recommended. Thanks for all the posts that helped me find the right resources to get this done in short time. Good luck to all who are preparing. You can do it!"

12,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed Security+ 2 hours ago with 844/900,10,hcv3sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/hcv3sp/passed_security_2_hours_ago_with_844900/,2020-06-21 08:26:26,"Warning: Very long! After studying on and off for past 2 years I got serious last month and passed this afternoon. I got 81 questions, 5 PBQs and scored 844/900. Here are my thoughts. **Background:** Working in IT but no direct experience in Security. **Study Method:** I bought GCGA but did not read all. I gave up on half way because it is too much to absorb and I am not a reader. I binge-watched Keith Barkers videos on CBT nugget. I like his teaching style but dont find it as organized as Professor Messer who covers all the topic if you can keep yourself engaged. Once I was familiar with the topics, I started taking notes. I listed all exam objectives and started filling out the information. I had to buy Security+ by WM. Arthur Conklin because he followed the exam objective and was easier to take notes from. I would have utilized Darril Gibson if he had followed the exam objective (huge influencing factor for me). Once I finished version 1 of taking notes, I did all end chapter quiz from WM. Arthur Conklin and GCGA. I usually got 3-4 questions wrong (out of 15) on each chapters and took quiz on CBT nugget. I do not remember the actual score but I was very disappointed with the result. Therefore, I had to change my study method (lesson #1). I went back to my notes and pretty much googled every topic and filled in more information. After spending 1 week inside Lord Google, I bought Dions practice test and scored 75 on the first one. Again disappointed, I learnt collecting note is not sufficient but you actually have to understand and retain it (lesson #2). In next four tests, I scored 82%, 81%, 84%, and 81%. I was still not satisfied so I reviewed the questions I got wrong and found out just knowing the definition is not sufficient to pass the exam but you need to be able to differentiate two similar looking terms (lesson #3). I also bought Professor Messers practice tests and scored, 85%, 85% and 90%. I did the last Dions test and scored 80%. At this point I was like I am not going to score more than this and scheduled the exam last night for this afternoon. It was online and went smooth. **Thought about exam:** 70% of questions were no-brainer. 20% of questions needed second revision to understand what the question was saying. And 10% including PDQs were b\*\*\*h. They were totally confusing and unheard of. I know zero about Linux so I could not understand 2 or 3 logs/commands and just chose one. When I finished all multiple choice and returned to PBQ, I had 28 minutes left. **My advice:** 1. Pick one resource and read everything. Do quizzes and revise everything you did wrong and the right one that you were confused about. 2. Now pick a second resource and fill in the gaps. 3. Do examcompass quizzes to make sure you understand the definition. 4. Print the exam objective and try to explain each terms. Are you able to answer what, why and how? If not, you have not understood it, youve just memorized it. 5. Do Dions and Professor Messers quiz to understand scenario based question. CompTIA does not test you whether you know definitions or not. It tests you whether you can apply to knowledge in the given scenario. **Bonus:** Since you managed to read until this point, here are some Security+ concept to think. Especially to those who have failed the exam and wondering why they failed despite reading many resources and memorizing all definitions and acronyms. If you were able to drill down answers to the following 2 options, will you be able to differentiate between these two? (These are all from SY0-501 objective.) IV vs Nonce, Data-in-use vs Data-in-transit, Ephemeral vs PFS, key stretching vs salting, security through obscurity vs obfuscation, ECC vs ECDHE, CTM vs GCM, PGP vs S/MIME, CCMP vs AES, NAC vs 802.1x, pinning vs stapling, Subject Alternate Name vs Wildcard, extended validation vs domain validation, PFX vs P7B, BPA vs MOU, Adverse actions vs Off-boarding, RTO vs MTTR, PIA vs PTA, snapshot vs system image, differential vs incremental backup, Technical vs Logical control, role of Data steward vs Data custodian vs Privacy officer, Transitive trust vs Federation, SAML vs Shibboleth, OpenID Connect vs OAuth, Secure Token vs Software Token, ABAC vs RBAC, PIV vs CAC, Recertification vs Credential Management, reason to delete user account vs disable account, If you are looking to improve password policy, would you prioritize complexity or length?, SCADA vs ICS, sensors vs collectors, reverse proxy vs load balancing, TAPS vs port mirror, correlation engine vs SIEM, HSM vs TPM, attestation vs secure boot, Hardware root of Trust vs TPM, Trusted OS vs RTOS, SoC vs IoT, Secure baseline vs Continuous Integration, Immutable system vs Non-persistence, SQL queries vs Stored procedures, stress testing vs fuzzing, model verification vs configuration validation, Static code analyzer vs sandboxing, compiled code vs runtime code, containerization vs Type II Hypervisor, Paas vs Iaas, DMZ vs AirGap, RAID 5 vs RAID 1+0, Fault tolerance vs Redundancy, scalability vs elasticity, master image vs templates, RFID vs NFC, motion detection vs Infrared detection, Firewall rules vs ACL, AH vs Tunnel Mode, Full tunnel vs tunnel mode, Heuristic IDS vs Behavioral IDS, Inline vs In-band IDS/IPS, Out-of-band vs Passive IDS/IPS, Layer 3 switch vs Router, active-active vs Round-robin load balancer, application proxy vs transparent proxy, Fat vs Standalone AP, Thin vs controller-based AP, Agentless vs Dissolvable NAC, SMTP vs IMAP4, Media Gateway vs Spam filter, Network scanner vs protocol analyzer, Pulverization vs Pulping, Netcat vs banner grabbing, exploitation frameworks vs Pentesting. Nmap vs Network mapping. License compliance violation vs application blacklisting, DLP vs data exfilteration, Data Execution Prevention vs code signing, WAF vs load balancing, Bluetooth vs ANT, Infrared vs Bluetooth, containerization vs sandboxing, storage segmentation vs virtualization, Corporate-owned vs COPE, Rooting vs Sideloading, FDE vs TPM, GPS tagging vs Geolocation, Ad hoc vs Wi Fi direct, tethering vs Hotspot, SFTP vs FTPS, Subscription services vs SaaS, Race conditions vs memory leak, DLL injection vs Refactoring, embedded systems vs SoC, intrusive vulnerability scanning vs active pentesting, Privilege escalation vs Pivot, Hash collision vs Birthday attack, WPS attack vs brute force attack, IP spoofing vs smurf attack, Typosquatting vs watering hole attack, session hijacking vs replay attack, URL hijacking vs clickjacking, Amplification vs DDos attack, ARP poisoning vs MITM attack, SQL injection vs XSS attack, backdoor vs RAT etc. **Final thought:** Security+ is hard. Only knowing definition does not help. If you read the exam objective it says given a scenario, analyze/deploy/troubleshoot etc. Therefore, you need to know how to analyze, deploy, troubleshoot different scenario. Dont just memorize the definition. You might be able to pass the exam but you will not learn. Here are my notes. I did not learn from this note but I learnt in the process of compiling this notes from multiple resources. If you are a visual person, the pictures will help you. Ive gone deep in some topics, for example, IPSec which you might not need but it really helped me understand what it is and the process of implementation. [URL"
13,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed Pentest+! My experience,1,hjwien,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/hjwien/passed_pentest_my_experience/,2020-07-02 22:56:51,"I very recently passed Pentest+ with a score of 778/750! Maybe cutting it a bit close to the mark but a pass is a pass! I originally intended to do the exam about a month ago but had problems with the Online Proctored version so I had to reschedule (and I put it off a bit inbetween) The exam itself is no joke, it is difficult but that shouldn't put people off, I learnt a lot during studying for the exam Some of the resources I used included: Jason Dion's Pentest + Udemy Course Various practise tests from books and found online, while these were a good resource, they are all heavily focused in some areas and not much focus in others. These are definitely a good way of practising and some of the questions I came across seem to come up word for word on the exam, but try not to spend too long on practise questions, as you will start to see the same question come up and rather than learning from and understanding the answer, you'll just remember the question / answer combination. I have also done Udemy courses from TheCyberMentor on practical ethical hacking, windows &amp; linux priv esc. It's really important to get a hands on feel for pentesting from using resources such as HackTheBox and TryHackMe. Some areas of focus I would recommend outside of what's covered in the above resources are Nmap &amp; nmap switches, you need to know what they are and what output to expect, even the switches that are barely used. You need to have a good idea of what to do when you come across certain protocols, you see SMB open, what do you do? etc Programming as well, bash, python, powershell &amp; ruby, try to get hands on experience, just the basics, how to define a variable, but also be able to read and understand scripts. Something like building a port scanner in each language I think would be useful knowledge. A big one that tripped me up a lot of times was identifying vulnerabilities in code .. all the types of XSS, blind, union, error, etc SQL injection, LFI, RFI, command injection .. etc , and know the best remediation for each vulnerability Bit of a lengthy post but I hope this helps anyone looking to sit the test as these posts helped me, it is hard but don't be put off by this, you may not even know the answer for a question but with experience you'll be able to discard other answers as it's multiple choice."
14,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed Pentest+,1,glnusq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/glnusq/passed_pentest/,2020-05-18 07:31:16,"820/900 Resources I used: * Sybex PenTest+ Study Guide: Exam PT0-001 &amp; Practice Test Book * Jason Dion Udemy Pentest+ Course &amp; 4 bonus tests * Heath Adams' Practical Ethical Hacking Udemy Course Speaking on these resources, they all provided really amazing value. I have used Sybex for everything since Network+. The writing is dry as hell, but they are very thorough, and their questions are always very similiar to the actual test. I feel like the Heath Adams course is a must! You gotta actually do this stuff hands on to fully understand it. Just reading about it doesn't do it justice. For background, I am a cyber security engineer who actually aids in pentesting for the firm I work at. So I do have prior experience and knowledge. But I did these courses from the ground up just to be thorough. Overall, the stuff that hurt me the most was the web application attack/vulnerability objectives. Was a real weak spot of mine. If that stuff wasn't included, I probably would have gotten like a 880 haha! I already do a lot of internal and perimeter network pentesting, and help write some of the reports at work, but we do not do any web pentesting, and when we do, its farmed out. So yea, I gotta get better at understanding that. I have already ordered two books on web app pentesting to learn more because it bothered me that I had so much trouble with it. Tips: * Really concentrate on your Python/Bash/Ruby/Powershell objectives. Know the syntax, and make sure you actually do the scripting yourself to understand it. * Know your NMAP flags and commands. All of them. Inside and out. * Study your webapp stuff. Cross site scripting, SQL Injections, Directory transversals, insecure direct object references etc * Know your regulations (GLBA, HIPAA, SARBOX, etc) * Know your pentest report sections, and what they contain"

I studied maybe 10 hours a day for the past month.Passed the Pentest+ a month ago, and now the CySA+. Have been racking my brain on what I want to complete next. LPIC2, CCNP, SSCP, or CASP. I think i'm going to go with CASP. Instead of my normal one to two months that I study for these certs i'm going to maybe take my Sec 501 or at least use that as the basis for my CASP. I took 401 like 5 years ago and the hardest part about that was the symmetrical and asymmetrical encryption. Now Comptia has stepped their game up and they are building from each block leading up to CASP. There was a huge amount of bleed over from Pentest+. I'd highly recommend doing both to anyone who wants to be versatile. How can you evade defenders or evade attackers if you don't know how they operate. For study material I used: Book: Red Team Field Manual, Blue team Handbook Incident Respond Edition, Securing Windows Server 2016 (Exam Ref 70-744) Sybex: Sec+, Cysa+, CASP 002, Pentest+, and Sybex 1000 question book.

Linux Academy - They have great Hands on Labs for CySA if you are unfamiliar with linux. I installed on my home network: Nessus, Kali, Burp Suite, and MBSA. Take aways(TLDR): Learn how to identify artifacts/malware on Windows/Linux. Understand how to construct ACL's. KNOW LINUX commands. I can not stress this enough. Know how to read firewall logs. How to to read vulnerability scans. I spent my last week before the test looking up CVE's and how they were found. Understand what network appliances do what and how they work. Make sure you know Web attacks and defense."

Ive used the following resources: Jason Dions CySA+ Udemy course + 5 practice exams Maymi and Chapmans AIO Guide + Total Tester practice exams Im scoring in the 90s for these practice exams, and I feel should be confident to test at this point...but something is holding me back. Almost every resource Ive reviewed has differing opinions of what the CySA+ Exam will be like...some say marginally more difficult than Security+; some say brutal and insanely challenging. I almost always have some anxiety before the exam, but Im having the most anxiety in preparation for CySA+. There doesnt seem to be a general consensus around the difficulty of the exam or style of the exam. One person stated it was almost entirely related to reading logs and identifying indicators of compromise. For those of you that have passed CySA+ with a high score, whats your take? What are the key areas to focus on? (In my head this is reading logs, deciphering vulnerability scans, using CMD/Terminal commands, Incident Response, vulnerability management, Security Frameworks, ports/protocols, SDLC, tools) Based on the resources Ive used and my practice exam results, do you think Im ready? Really cant afford to burn $300."
19,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed CySA+,1,fcgbnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/fcgbnq/passed_cysa/,2020-03-03 05:19:06,"I passed CySA+ this morning with a 792/900. I had 70 total questions with 4 PBQs. I have to admit, the exam was a little more of a challenge than I expected based off of my studying. In true CompTIA fashion, many of the questions and answers were worded in such a way that I wasn't really sure if I selected the ""best"" right answer. At times it felt like maybe I had been studying the wrong material. But as I got deeper into it, the nerves started to wear off a bit and I became more confident. Except for one, the PBQs weren't too bad. There was one that involved identifying a malware infected process on a host. That one I'm not sure if I got entirely right. But the others weren't bad if you just thought through them. It helped for me to think of how I would address the problem in the question as if it was occurring in the real-world. As other posters have mentioned, you really need to be comfortable reading and interpreting different kinds of logs and reports. For example, ACLs, packet captures, firewall logs, netstat output, SIEM output, and vulnerability scans were a recurring theme in the questions. If you can master those, you will be golden. Items I used to study: Video Courses * Jason Dion's CySA+ Udemy Course (watched the whole series twice) * TOTAL: CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Udemy Course (watched the whole series once) * Cybrary's CySA+ Course (watched the whole series once, this one was probably the least useful to me) Practice Exams * Jason Dion's 5 CySA+ Practice Exams (many of the questions on the exam also appeared in the app I mention below) * Kaplan Practice Exams through Cybrary Apps: * CSA+ Study App by Magic Bytes Soft (the paid version gives you access to over 900 questions, and from other reviews, they appear to mainly come from the Sybex book) Books: * CompTIA CySA+ All-in-One Exam Guide - Kindle Version (I mainly just used this to reinforce some concepts, I didn't read it cover-to-cover) I also referred to YouTube a lot for topics I was unclear on. In total I studied for about a month. I already had Security+, an MS in Information Science, and experience in web application development. I will say that having Security+ probably helped tremendously. So if you're wondering if you should skip Security+ and go straight to CySA+, I'd suggest getting Security+ first (unless you have lots of experience in the exam domains). I'd be happy to try to answer any questions you might have if you're preparing for this exam. Good luck!"
20,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed CySA+ today...2nd Try,1,ekk614,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/ekk614/passed_cysa_today2nd_try/,2020-01-06 09:33:16,"I passed the CySA+ exam today with a 766, this was my second attempt. I took the test a week ago and failed it, 714. I already have the CASP+ so I wasn't going to bother taking the test again. But my husband made me take again and I am glad he did! I found the CASP and the CySA exams to be hard. If you failed it before, don't get discouraged, just tweak your studying, try again and accomplish your goals! I am going to keep it real, I used prayer to pass the CASP and I had to use prayer to pass the CySA and it worked. I believe in God and I had to use that higher power :-) I took a classroom course, 2 Udemy courses and practice questions from various sources. What I had to add to my study in order to pass the test was Google and YouTube videos. I recommend Googling and YouTubing how to read server logs, web logs, vulnerability scanners, linux commands for cybersecurity, tcpdump, cyber forensics and whatever else you are not familiar with. Use the practice exam questions to get an idea what to search for. The various courses I took helped me actually understand concepts and theories, so repetition of material helps a lot. But you will ""need"" to understand how to read and analyze logs. It is better to see the actual pictures of tools or a live demo of tools and commands to really understand. PowerPoint with just text is not going to help you pass the exam."

Things I never saw on the test that seemed to be drilled home in v1. (This doesn't mean you won't get these, I just never saw a single question with any of this.) CVSS vectors. PluralSight's content which had the Kaplan practice exam seemed to have a hard-on for knowing how to read these. I never saw this in Linux Academy at all. Nmap switches, I really hammered home Nmap and honestly... just know basic Nmap output and how to read it. Vulnerability scan results (example Nessus) Application types, like nmap is this type of application, or snort is an IDS/IPS. Not a single PowerShell output. No questions about IR process, steps for information security vulnerability management process, Stuff that you definitely need to know: How to correlate logs, scans, ACLs, and just general content with each other and how to act on that content. I really enjoyed the performance based questions. Those I felt really solid on. Know your all attacks and how to mitigate them. Understand nmap output. There was A LOT of BEST answer scenario questioning. Some of it I did ok on others I didn't even feel like there was enough data to go on. Also in this beta there were a couple questions where I feel like the content and the answers MAY have changed from v1 to v2. I have one question in mind that given the v1 study material they drill home a specific answer. They had 4 answers and only 2 of them made sense, based 100% on the old content, the answer was obvious. However, it's entirely possible the new content is different and it was the other answer, unfortunately all I had to go on was the old content. (I know this is a really vague explanation, but hard to explain without giving away the question) I think the training material from v1 to v2 is going to change a fair amount based on the test I had. But given you use the correct training material and have a fairly decent jack of all trades background or understanding of how systems interact, then this test is totally doable given you can navigate the BEST answer scenarios, mind fuck questions and the notoriously bad CompTIA question writing."

Thought I was ready, sadly the exam hit me hard in the face. Total of 80 question, 5 performance based 75 multiple choice. I could confidently say I pass 4 of the performance based as it was matching question. Example: Company Phone has an empty slot and you would drag a remote wipe box into that slot. I skip the one where you had to configure the WAF, as I wasn't prepared for that. While most of the question were straight forwarded, some of the question was worded in a way that made me have to read three or four times, and I believe I fail to understand what it is asking sometimes. I got stump on some of the question, and try to recall from memory. An example is what would you use to protect the cable, and I had to think really hard since I didn't know the answer and the most obvious choice was conduit. (Yes, conduit is the correct answer after reviewing. Security+ Score: 682/900 I thought I did bad as this is my first time taking it. As I was never good at taking test or exam. Plus I am still new to IT, mainly learning about Security. I was able to learn about Group Policy, Active Directory, and few others thanks to the job I have. I will be retaking it again in 2 weeks or so. Will be reading my Security+ 501 book and be re-watching Professor Messer videos again. Right now I got to buckle down and understand my stuff. &amp;#x200B; Things that appear on the test that you should be familiar: Nmap, Netcat, Netstat, SSL, SSH, TLS, RADIUS. Know MD5, SHA1, RSA Something that caught me offguard was WPA2, WPA, EAP, and WEP. The question was which one of the following is has a weak vulnerability or something like that. (I picked WEP, because it was either that or WPA. Let me know if I'm right) Another was something I didn't memorize cause I thought it wasn't important is degaussing, pulverizing, and wiping. My Advice: To anyone who is taking the test soon. Read the question carefully. Dissect the question and really understand what it is asking. Eliminate the choices down to two. Ask yourself what does that choice do and does it answer the question. There is my rant, now back to me studying."

A little background: I am a junior cyber security analyst with less than a year of experience in the field. I have an M.S. in Information Systems, but prior to this job, I had no professional experience in tech. Also, my current position focuses a lot more on information assurance; there isn't that much autonomy in regards to what I can do, so a majority of my duties pertain to writing, attending meetings, and providing information to stakeholders. I have the A+, Security+, and ITILv4 certifications. Resources that I used: * All-In-One CySA+ Exam Guide * Jason Dion's CySA+ Course on Udemy * Jason Dion's 5 CySA+ Practice Exams * **Recommended:** Sybex CySA+ Study Guide by Mike Chapple and David Seidl * **Recommended:** Sybex CySA+ Practice Tests by Mike Chapple and David Seidl * Googling individual topics that I wanted more information on * Summaries of the different knowledge domains and key points: [URL * I provide another link for a penetration test course that actually helped me understand topics for this test in the *Advice* portion of this post. I studied for 1.5 months; a majority of my studying occurred over the Christmas/NYE holiday season, so I took a lot of breaks to enjoy the festivities. Reviews of the resources: * The All-In-One Exam Guide was a good starting point for me. I don't believe that this should be the sole resource used for exam preparation, but it was decent. (6/10) * In my opinion, the Jason Dion resources were not very useful. The practice exams were nice to take during my morning commute on the train, but they weren't particularly challenging. (4/10) * The Sybex resources were the most useful. I read the study guide book within 5 days (I took a one day break on Saturday to recharge). The book is only 13 chapters long, and each chapter seemed to range between 35-60 pages on the kindle app. (8/10) * The Sybex practice tests were really challenging at first! I answered about 100 questions from each domain over the course of 3 days, focused on the subject areas that were difficult to me, and revisited the questions a few days later. (9/10) * The Infosec site was nice to read during my lunch breaks for reminders/refreshers on a few topics. The domains are broken up into smaller sections. (4/10) Advice: * The day before the exam, I decided to chill out and mentally unwind. Cramming the day before isn't the worst tactic, but I felt like I couldn't retain any more information than I already had. * I was extremely nervous leading up to the exam. In fact, I had to calm myself down within the first five minutes of taking it. I reminded myself that this wasn't a bad experience; if I weren't to pass, then I would have a clearer grasp of how to do even better on the retake. * **NOTE:** I didn't find this out until literally 3 days before my exam, but you can access the online test bank for the Sybex practice exams after you buy the book. Here is the link to register your book and get access to the online tests: [URL This was really useful during my morning and evening commutes. You can customize the amount of questions, duration, knowledge domain(s), and order of questions (random or in order from the textbook). * As previous test takers have said before, GET COMFORTABLE WITH LOGS! The Sybex practice tests provide plenty of log examples. * For a week, I actually took a break from studying for the CySA+ and focused entirely on penetration testing. This actually helped me A LOT with having a deeper grasp of various command-line tools, vulnerability scanning, and TTPs of potential attackers. If you don't already have any experience with the aforementioned subjects or using a Linux system, then I recommend the Hands-On: Complete Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking course on Udemy: [URL This course provides great resources on creating a virtual lab with 4-5 different systems to practice with. * The only direct NIST questions that I had were from SP 800-86 and 800-88, but I do believe that understanding all of the following NIST Special Publications will help with overall exam understanding. Also, I'd recommend actually looking into each. I actually read a few pages from each of the documents, and it helped to really understand the importance and intention of each one. * This was the first exam in which I actually chose to answer the PBQs at the end, and it was pretty cool. One pertained to firewall logs and IDS logs, another involved results from a vulnerability scan, the other two mostly dealt with different types of servers in a network architecture (how to harden and/or detect malware). Opting to answer the PBQs at the end allowed me to glean clues from the multiple choice questions. * There will be at least one or two questions that nearly provide the answer for a previous question or at least help to narrow down the results, which conveys the importance of reviewing each question after answering them all. * Some of the questions are really wordy, but that's mostly done to throw you off. There were a few that had introductory sentences that had nothing to do with what was actually being asked of you. You'll definitely be tested on how attentive you are and whether you're capable of deductive reasoning. * There is more than enough time to get through all of the questions and review them at least once. I ended my exam with 35 minutes remaining because I had to pee. The best part about passing the exam is that it renews any lesser CompTIA certs, so my Security+ and A+ were automatically renewed. The next certs that I plan to get are: PenTest+ and CASP. I've been considering Linux+ as well. I really like using Kali now that I am a bit more familiar with it."

So I am a Network Administrator doing overseas contracting for DoD. I've only been doing IT for about 3 years. I have Sec+, and CCNA R&amp;S and just got CySA+ today. I took the test last Friday and got a 695 and needed a 750 to pass. I reflected on aspects of Linux, frameworks, and understanding more about what certain ports do. I passed it today with a 761. The test had a surprising amount of Linux related ""what does this command do"" type questions. Make sure you're able to tell the difference in server logs just by looking at them, and finally take some time to review when and what the difference between frameworks are. There were also a lot of specific viruses/attacks that were emphasized over others. Like knowing what the Heartbleed vulnerability is AND what resolves the issue. I used the Chapman book and Dion's Udemy course to help me out. The PBQ's were surprisingly fair to me both times around, just be extremely versatile with ACL, Firewall, DMZ, and reading vulnerability reports and the difference between False positives, false negatives, true positives and true negatives. I do think working in the field helps but taking good notes is critical as well.

I just wanted to give you all an idea of how I studied and what exam was like so it can help this community that helped me study and pass. **What was the exam like?** I had 70 questions, 4 were Performance based questions. The first PBQ question I got had either a typo or was just trying to trick me, it got me real nervous on how the rest of the test would be. I decided it was trying to trick me and answered the question to the best of my ability. The rest of the PBQs were right after, my advice would be make sure you are really detailed and confirm all IP addresses and logs match up to the right host you are looking at. They will try to trick you. Make sure you know your port numbers and how to look for malicious activity. This came about 80% from my professional experience and 20% from what the book/course taught me. **Types of questions:** * There were no questions on specific frameworks and regulatory policies/frameworks, I had spent a ton of time memorizing these :\\ * PBQs were very detailed and purposefully tried to confuse you, make sure you pay attention. * nmap questions * A lot of questions that gave you a scenario and asked you to pick the BEST remediation action. (lots of questions like these are on the AIO book practice tests so I had a ton of practice on these) **Study Materials used** I used the following study materials (provided with ratings that helped me most): * Jason Dion Udemy Course (8/10 great video series, learnt a lot but some of the dry in depth stuff (frameworks and policies, using certain scanning and pen test tools the series did not go over well) * Linux Academy Video series by Bobs Salman (7/10 better than most video series, the labs in here I found useless and I skipped the last few because it was terribly basic and I would not learn anything and it was a waste of time) * Linkedin Learning video series by Mike Chapple (No rating as I did not go over these in detail just watched specific videos where I felt I was lacking, it was still useful) * CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst AIO Certification Bundle (Exam CS0-001) Book with Practice test [URL 10/10 in depth book that goes in detail and the end of chapter practice quizzes are great. The practice test questions that came with the book are also very similar to the ones I got in the exam. The extra practice test questions in this bundle also helped greatly as I was able to successfully gauge my preparedness level using these practice tests. **Study journey** I booked the exam for Oct 31 back at the end of July. I did not start studying after coming back from a vacation on Sept 22. I would study for about an hour a day in the beginning watching the Jason Dion videos at 1.5 speed. Once I finished the video series I did the Jason Dion practice test and scored 85%. I didn't think this was enough going by how a lot of other people in this sub have mentioned these questions are way easier than what will be on the test. I moved on to watching the Linux Academy video series by Bob Salman, I found these video series OK, I didn't learn much new information that was not in the Jason Dion video series, I would only do the Jason Dion series if I had to do this again. The labs in this series I found were useless and a total waste of time, I would skip them. I had access to LinuxAcademy from work so I decided to take advantage. I did the practice test again and I scored about 81%, I looked at the questions I was getting wrong and there were specific areas where I was clearly lacking (Frameworks and Policies, Incident Response process, vulnerability toolsets) At this point it was Oct 25 and I was stuck at this 85% level on the practice test in the AIO books, I decided to just power through and started studying about 3-4 hours a day before the exam. I decided to brush up on my weak objective areas by viewing the Mike Chapple video series on Linkedin Learning again provided by work. I only focused on the videos that covered my weak objectives. Took the test again and I got about 75%, I was getting even worse. Same objectives, the material just wasn't sticking. I don't know why I focused on the videos so much, I am a book learner, I decided to read through the book and reschedule the exam to Nov 10. I powered through the book studying about 2-4 hours a night. I didn't get to the last 2 chapters but I skimmed them and did the chapter end practice quizzes. Now I did the practice exams and was regularly hitting over 90%, I was prepared. Even got some 100% quizzes. The only part I wasn't sure about were the performance based questions. The PBQs provided by the book didn't look advanced enough to be the ones on the real exam. I asked some friends who had taken the test and they provided some good feedback, I still wasn't sure what I would run in to. Without breaking the NDA they are pretty simple but make sure you look for trick questions and be detailed going through the logs. Studied for 8 hours on Saturday and about 2 hours before the exam today, went and wrote it, was nervous about the result, I did way better than I thought I would. I like that CompTIA tells you what objectives you got questions wrong in. In the future I will just zoom through a video series to get a good overview and then read through a book. Practice tests really helped me gauge how prepared I was. **TLDR: Make sure you understand remediation actions, AIO practice test and book are amazing, make sure you are gauging how prepared you are using practice tests. Test will actively try to confuse you.** Good Luck!"
30,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed CySA+ with an 814,1,dz3kus,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/dz3kus/passed_cysa_with_an_814/,2019-11-21 02:29:16,"I passed the exam today with a score of 814. Some background on me: I have 6 years experience in IT, one of those is security. I work in Vulnerability Management predominantly but I can be asked to do a number of things across the security domain. Some bullets on my cert journey: * I studied 2 days a week for 1.5 months. * I read the Sybex/Wiley Book cover to cover. * I did the quizzes at the end of each chapter and the Assessment test in the book. * I didn't do the practical exercises, I felt I had enough experience in industry. * I used the Jason Dion Udemy Course for video learning and read the corresponding part of the Sybex book after each video. * I used the practice exams in the Dion course and used an access code from my Sybex book for more practice exams. * I used an app called CSA+ CS0-001 on my iPhone for flashcards and other sample questions. Exam Observations: * Be comfortable with port numbers, the services associated with them and what the categories of ports are called. * Be comfortable with logs if various types, understand what the logs are telling you and what anomalous entries in logs look like. * Be comfortable with various tools, for example dig, netstat, nmap etc. Know them well enough to identify common uses and the command to invoke them. * Questions will almost always have more than one plausible answer, you have to pick the BEST. * Read the questions carefully, they will have key information in them that you can miss because of the way they are written. * PBQs were, in my opinion, straight forward and actually quite fun but leave them to last.

First off, I already have my Net+, Sec+, and CCNA. I work as basically a tactical network administrator in the army and only do IT stuff a few times a week. So I basically have no security experience. This test was in some ways harder, but easier than all the other exams I've taken. I felt like I had a very good understanding of networking and security and this test really pushed my critical thinking skills in these areas. It had NO NIST questions or anything else on the TOGAF and other frameworks. Every question had multiple ""right"" answers where all of them would fix the issue, but you had to find the best answer for the companies environment. I was straight up drained after this exam.... For studying, I used Jason Dion's udemy course for $10. This course was the majority of my studying and was fantastic. Very in depth and slow enough for me to take notes while it played. This is almost a MUST for anyone wanting to take the exam. I also used the All in One book. This was a decent read. Had a few extra things that Dion didn't cover. Overally pretty good. I used the Sybex practice questions as well. These were way harder than the actual exam, but really helps you learn to make the best educated guess you can when they throw some really out of the ball park things at you. (Which will happen). Overall, make sure you know how to read firewall logs, vulnerability scans, system logs, and understand how an enterprise network is basically laid out. The incident response process is also very important. You can totally pass this test if you understand network+ and security+ concepts and study up on some incident response stuff. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask. Sorry if this seems unorganized lol my brain is still a little fried"

Only other cert before this was Security+ back in December 2018. Was working an internship with a SOC team since March and converted to full-time as an Engineer in September. Company agreed to pay for CySA so I dove right in. No prior IT or security experience beyond that. Been studying since mid-August. I used Jason Dion's course and practice exams as well as the all in one guide from Maymi/Chapman. Used the CompTIA CySA+ practice exams that I had access to through my company. The exam was challenging but certainly passable. Lot's of focus on the IR process and knowing how to read various logs and outputs from tools like Netstat, Wireshark, and NMAP as well as vulnerability scan results (deciphering false positives vs true positives). Overall I liked the process and feel that even though I had a decent foundation coming into it from school and work, it's certainly helped strengthen my skills and sharpen my knowledge more."

The first time i only studied practice tests (like a lot too) and got a 580. The second time i did it the right way. I studied pretty much everyday for at least 3 hours (i work night shift so i was trying to kill time). I got the comptia book and read the whole thing while taking notes on it and doing the practice tests at the end. Before i would go to read more, i would review what i already studied. Somedays i would just do review and practice tests. Nothing wrong with that. I also got Darrel gibsons GCGA, and i must say this book fills in many gaps. Once i started reading i could already tell i wouldve been fucked up if i just read Comptia study guide. GCGA literally has things that just arent in the other book. So i read GCGA and took notes, and reviewed. I would also do Exam Compass Exams, and i watched all of proffesor messers videos one time throuh on 1.25 speed (makes it much more enjoyable). I studies for a good 2 1/2 months. I wanted to take my time and actually learn the material since my potential job will want to see that i actually know it. I was really nervous to take my test the second time. I wanted to get 8 hours of sleep the night before but i only got like 5 hours because i had to work. I did force myself to eat breakfast though, which did help. I got there early, reviewed a little bit, and took deep breaths. I got asked sooo many questions on vulnerability scans, which is fine and dandy, but i almost wish i was tested on more things that i studied! I passed by 6 points, but like its really a great feeling!!! The hard work pays off. Everyones test is different, so you have to make sure you know all the material. Memorizing test questions is wayyy too iffy, but ive heard it work for some people."

I am also CCNA, Sec+ and A+ certified, and I am also an IT technician. I have no formal work experience with security whatsoever, but have had experience with all of the tools covered in CySA because of classes I've taken at school. First, I watched all of Jason's videos on Udemy. I felt that this was a very solid course. After that I read the book by Mike Chapple, which was a great book as well and I felt it covered any gaps that might've existed in Dion's course. I then took Dion's 5 extra practice exams, which aren't really similar to the questions on the actual test, but I thought they were worth getting just to identify some of the knowledge gaps I still had and just to get in the analytical mindset that's required for CompTIA's convoluted test questions. I also watched 8 of the 27 hours of Dale Meredith's pluralsight course, and he is a great instructor but I felt the course was overkill after the previous materials I used. Study materials: 1) Jason Dion's Udemy Course [URL 2) Jason Dion's 5 practice exams on Udemy [URL 3) CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide: Exam CS0-001 by Mike Chapple and David Seidl [URL 4) Dale Meredith's pluralsight course: [URL Final thoughts and recommendations: You really do need to read the test questions carefully. If you're feeling unsure, read the question, read the answers, then read the question again before choosing anything. I ended up flagging about 20 questions that I could narrow down to two choices, and the rest of the questions I felt had a clear enough answer to them and could answer confidently. I felt that the simulations are really what I struggled with the most. You need to be able to read and interpret logs and vulnerability scans and make sure you can identify false positives. Know how to remediate common vulnerabilities. Have familiarity with the syntax and output of tools like netstat, nmap, tcpdump, netcat. Overall I felt the difficulty of this test was about on the same level as Security+, I did not find it to be nearly as difficult as a lot of the posts on here have indicated but I think my schooling helped me gain a lot of familiarity with the material prior to studying for this test."

For books I used: CompTIA CySA+ Practice Tests: Exam CS0-001 by Sybex.

I had ITIL, Net+ and Sec+ before taking this exam. My tips: Know how to read logs. Know how to identify compromised servers. Know how to read nmap, Wireshark, vulnerability scan output, etc. Other than that, prepare yourself for typical CompTIA scenario based questions, take your time, eliminate obvious incorrect answers, and narrow it down.

My question is, even though I'll have these intermediate and advanced certs, should I also backtrack and get A+/Net+?

Udemy 5 Practice Exams All in all, I spent a solid month studying for this exam. The best advice I can give can be summarised in the points below: * Start going through practice questions as soon as you can. Whether it be after studying each module or even before. I found that the questions asked were not always black and white with most questions asking for the BEST answer. Also doing hundreds of practice questions (and reviewing incorrect answers) really forced me to read the question multiple times so I don't make a dumb mistake. Make sure you review all your incorrect answers! This will give you an idea of gaps in your knowledge. * The practice questions from Sybex were definitely harder than the actual exam and really prepared me well. The CSA+ practice questions app really made it easy for me to study during my commute to and from work. * The exam covers a lot of material so it is important to study from multiple sources! For myself I found it useful to read a module from the study guide then watch Jasons videos as it helped reinforce the concepts * For the PBQ. Make sure you are able to: * Understand output from Vulnerability Scan Report * Be able to identify malicious network traffic from firewall logs Good luck for those studying for the CySA+ exam!"

Even if the above definition is ""simplified"" for Security+, it seems misleading. Other texts (and certifications) define risk as a function of both likelihood and impact.

It seems to me a better definition would be: Risk is the *effective* impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability, taking into account the likelihood that that vulnerability is exploited. Thoughts?"

All these ""I passed"" threads are a big help. &amp;#x200B; I'm just wondering what people would suggest to get after the CySA+. I currently have the A+, Net+, and Sec+. I work for an MSP as a sysadmin but I will be moving into a very nebulous ""security role"" soon. I will be the first person to do this in our company and I'm wondering if there might be anything between the CySA+ and CISSP that might be worth getting. I definitely do not have the 5 years required for the CISSP (3 years, really since, I have Sec+ and a college degree), and I would be totally down to take the test and get the ""associate's"" version, or however they call it, but I think that there is a lot of middle ground between the CySA+ and the CISSP. So any suggestions would be appreciated. The role would likely be more managerial and way more blue-teaming than red-teaming. I am considering the following: &amp;#x200B; * RHCSA - I already have quite a bit of familiarity with Linux, and I administrate an Ubuntu home-server. I am pretty interested in Linux but my company does not have ANY Linux servers at all. * PenTest+ - My role would be very much more blue-teaming, and pretty much zero red-teaming. This would be a role that focuses more on vulnerability remediation in Domain Controllers and other servers, and probably a bit of corporate-style digital forensics. I think PenTest+ might be a quickie and pretty fun but I don't think it would apply too much * Project+ - This role would definitely be more managerial and I think this cert would look good for it, even if it isn't explicitly technical. I don't know much about this one and am especially interested in some anecdotes or experience anyone might have. * PMP - from PMI, the Project Management Professional exam. This one seems a bit more high-level than Project+ and I'm sure it probably looks better on a resume than Project+, I just don't know if its reasonable to assume I could grasp those concepts with no project management experience. Is it really high-level? Any experience with this would help a lot as well. * CCNA CyberOps - This exam sees to be a little more high-level than Sec+ but less than CySA+. Would getting this just be redundant with a CySA+? My company uses Cisco stuff but we are far from exclusively Cisco. * CASP+ - Every time I see this discussed, its because the poster wishes they got the CISSP instead of the CASP+. Does this ring true with anyone here? If it is a good stepping stone between CySA+ and CISSP, then I would like to go for it, but if its just a knock-off of CISSP, which it seems to be, then I'll pass. * CEH - This one is pretty much off the table. My job pays for certs and study materials but it will be hard to convince management to shell out $1300+, not including study materials, for a test that focuses exclusively on red-teaming. I do hear that it helps get past tons of HR filters if I ever decide to switch companies/jobs. I think this one is kind of just out of the running but I'd still love to hear opinions on it. * Microsoft Azure Security Engineer Associate - Our company uses a lot of Microsoft cloud products, and while only a few of our clients have Azure domains, pretty much everyone uses Office 365. This would be a more technical exam and might be a bit out of my league, although I am not too sure because this one is brand new.

Saturday and Sunday: Spent the entire day watching Jason's Udemy videos and tried to memorize his materials as much as I could. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: Went through 1/3 of **CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide** each day (4 chapters per day). Thursday: Spent first half of the day going over the exams on the study guide and re-learned the questions that i missed. Spent the rest of the day reading logs and memorizing ports and learning programs. Friday: Repeat what i did on Thursday (I was able to achieve around 100% on Jason's practice exam and 90\~100% on Study Guide's end of chapter exam) and started going over the **CompTIA CySA+ Practice Tests: Exam.** 50 questions on each domain. I scored between 60\~70% on each domain. Saturday: I purchased Jason's Dion Lab because i thought it was a good idea. It was not IMO. Continued studying the materials through practice tests. Sunday: Reviewed everything with Objectives/read NIST SPs 800-30, 800-61, 800-86, 800-88, 800-115, and 800-150/Laws and regulations of each industry. If I didn't get a good Test day: Drove to the test center with a cup of coffee and turkey bagel/hash browns from Dunkin' Donuts. Reviewed nmap, logs, vocabs and concept before the exam. &amp;#x200B; **Thoughts and Conclusion** Foremost, Jason's Practice Lab on his website wasn't good in my opinion. It gives you an access to multiple different servers (Win10, Win8, Win 2012 servers/etc) and you have to install programs such as Nessus on the server. I had a hard time installing Nessus for some reason and just skipped the lab and read logs online. It did not benefit me at all since i had such a short amount of time to study CySA+. I was trying to return it but you can't return the service (**Oops, goodbye my $99, pepehands**). This lab is only recommended to those who absolutely have no system background whatsoever. If you have time to setup your own network environment, you should do it! &amp;#x200B; I have a bachelor degree in Management Information System and got my Sec+ about two years ago. I do not have any decent networking knowledge or Security background other than reading articles/blogs (I know how to read basic Cisco network logs/ACL list/etc). My job absolutely has nothing to do with security/network/computer. I also do not have the time to study during work or after work. I did not like the idea of studying little by little and trying to retain the memory for such a long period of time. So I just decided to use my PTO and just take the exam. 10/10 would not recommend cram this thing in 9 days. Two weeks is probably ideal timeline to study for this certification. &amp;#x200B; When people say this exam is hard, yes, it was hard. Especially if you do not have a decent background in many different systems (Network/Vulnerability logs/System Logs/Windows Logs, you are most likely to struggle during the exam. However, it is feasible to pass this exam without having prior knowledge. That's why I read loads of RAW logs/references/network diagrams through google. &amp;#x200B; Good luck studying!"

Questions were all over the place. Review: the book and review tests were almost identical to Sec+ and neither really helped with this exam.

For the study guide, I have used the Sybex one from Mike Chapple and David Seidl (see below link). It's well-written and it covers every topic for the exam. There are 1 or 2 chapters about network forensics which I find interesting. For this exam, it is not required to have deep knowledge of forensics but it's also useful to have an exposure to it. [URL I have also used the practise test from David Seidl: [CompTIA-CSA-Practise-Tests](URL I went through this book 2 weeks before taking the exam. It helped me a lot during the exam because there are many questions with vulnerability reports and output of logs. For those who plan to take the exam, you will need to be comfortable with reviewing vulnerabilities and provide with the best solution on how to mitigate them. You will also need to be able to identify threats from syslogs, events logs and routers. Despite 2-3 months of study, I didnt get a high score (777 out of 900). But a pass is a pass!

There will are questions where you know there are multiple things that need to be done, but it may only be appropriate for a CSA to unilateral act on one of them. The rest likely need to be elevated further up the corporate chain (press releases, for example). \- Understand how to identify vulnerability false-positives.

This was by far the most difficult exam I have ever taken. I have a Bachelor of Science in IT and and undergrad certificate in advanced cyber security. The wording in the questions are SO INCREDIBLY important. It is imperative that you take practice exams so that you are forced to critically think about scenarios. I used Jason's course on Udemy for practice exams. DEFINITELY worth every penny. I also used Mike Chappel's CYSA book on amazon which was useful. &amp;#x200B; The PBQ's were honestly the worst part. Trying to decipher all the information on a tiny 18 inch screen is unrealistic in today's workplace. I almost ran out of time trying to go back and forth between the questions and information needed.

A good majority of the questions can indeed be very wordy; whereas some of them were simple one-lined questions. There were maybe only one or two questions with answers that I never came across in my study materials. What killed me were the ACL log scenario based questions on the multiple choice. I had two of those suckers. Other logs I had included an easy SQL injection followed by two I completely guessed on (cookie theft/replacement situation + system intrusion relating to the Windows registry key). So about 5 or 6 audit logs questions. The SIMS were easy, and I only guessed on one that related to a Linux log. I also will admit that having some Networking knowledge can help. Unlike most, Domain 3- Architecture &amp; Design was always my weakest point- which is funny because for most people it seems to be Cryptography. Regardless, Dion's exams matched the difficulty of the actual exam. But, expect a few questions that are wordier than those and questions with lines worth bullet points.Up next? CCENT and revisit Python programming. Thanks for reading and hope this helps."
53,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed CySA+ today. Here's my review and advice.,58,bhho0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/bhho0k/passed_cysa_today_heres_my_review_and_advice/,2019-04-26 13:25:24,"**TLDR**: Passed with 828. Used Dion's Udemy course and Sybex practice test book, about 5 weeks total study time. I'm a web developer doing DoD contract work, and had Sec+ and CEH alrady. Details below - I hope they help! # Study Resources My primary source of study was [Jason Dion's Udemy Course](URL and review of my own notes on the course for about a month. For an additional week I went through about half of [CompTIA CySA+ Practice Tests Sybex Book](URL Jason's course was great for covering the exam objectives to create a good core knowledge core, but I found all the extra stuff covered by the Sybex book gave me an edge. The book covers lots of tools, Linux commands, specific EA framework trivia, and plenty more things you *probably* won't see on the exam BUT each new bit of info expands your knowledge base a little further and gets you in the mode of thought to analyze all the scenarios the exam will throw at you. See something you don't know? Look it up, write it down. I ended up doing 100 questions from each domain, plus the 2 practice exams -- scoring anywhere from 75 to 85% in the domains and \~80% overall. # Exam Details and Thoughts Definitely a big step up from Sec+. Difficulty comes from a heavy emphasis on analytical skills and informed judgment calls. *A lot* of the exam requires you to know both attacker concepts, techniques, and tools, so the knowledge I had from my CEH was instrumental. Makes sense, right? To analyze results of attacks, you need to know how attacks work, AND how to respond to them according to standardized procedure. I know you're probably reading this to learn what to possibly expect, so for your reading pleasure... ** Spicy (ethical) details/advice, based on my experience:** So the PBQs I rolled had drag-and-drop, clicking on things to view reports and logs, etc. -- the usual CompTIA stuff. I'll ask you some questions based on the ones I had: * *Can you identify malware beaconing on one or more network hosts based on traffic analysis AND apply one or more effective firewall rules to block it?* * *Can you identify potential malware on one or more hosts in a network based analysis of individual host processes and their network activity?* * *Can you effectively analyze vulnerability scan reports for multiple network hosts, identify false positives, AND recommend appropriate remediation for true positives?* * *Can you identify what services and applications that network hosts might be running solely based off vulnerability scan reports, AND identify false positives based on your identification?* As far what you should make sure you're solid on overall: * Know all your commonly-seen ports instinctively; no-brainer. Service port knowledge was central to *all* my PBQs. * Get good at identifying suspicious entries and patterns in stuff like vulnerability scans, firewall logs, traffic capture, netstat, procmon, etc. * Get good at making educated judgment calls based on incomplete info in scans, configs, logs, etc. For example, how can you differentiate between a DNS, web server, or file server if their running services are almost all the same? Can you tell a false positive from a true positive in a scan report if the vulnerability isn't obvious or the report doesn't have all its sections? * Know your NIST SPs [800-30](URL [800-61](URL [800-86](URL [800-88](URL [800-115](URL and [800-150](URL processes and standard terminology. Know how to *apply* them, because that stuff most definitely shows up a lot on the exam. * Know your [detailed exam objectives](URL Pay special attention to gaining basic familiarity with all the laws and regs (HIPAA, FISMA, PCI-DSS, etc.) and frameworks in Objective 4.1, and the tools listed in Objective 4.5. ## My Background I'm a front-end web developer by trade, currently team lead/senior engineer on a team doing non-security DoD contract work. About 10 years' experience; nothing purely security-related. Prior certs are Security+ (last renewed 2016) and [CEH](URL (v9, obtained 2016). ## Why CySA+? My team is currently serving the second iteration of a contract, set to recompete for the third iteration later this year. Going from iteration 1 to 2, my position's description was changed to include Security+ and CEH because a single instance where we thought we might need to run Fiddler on the NIPRNet for a task \\\_()\_/. For 2 going to 3, those two were changed to be [DoD 8570](URL baseline certs for IAT Level II and the CSSP roles minus Manager, so I figured I'd get CySA+ to renew Sec+ too. Also not really a fan of EC Council in general, and I'd rather have a CompTIA cert. My CEH expires this fall with 0/120 CEUs -- was planning to retake it, but not for the new $1200 price tag... *maybe* I'll try to get 80 more units (CysA+ will give 40 IIRC) in the 1 year period I'll have after it expires, but who knows."

My primary responsibilities included completing vulnerability assessments and ensuring our end points in the PCI environment were secure via Windows Group Policy, lock-boxes, and some other things. 2.5 years as an IT consultant in a help desk. My primary responsibilities are to manage an IT call center, system administration for an LMS, and end user security consultations (purely awareness, not technical). **My Story:** I currently work full time and Im in Grad school full time. I hold two project management certifications: ITIL and Project+. Id like to one day be in Senior Management so I think its important to have a good foundation of project management skills and knowledge. My current aspirations are to move back into the InfoSec world. I studied for about 3 weeks. The first week I just listened to Jason Dions Sec+ course on Udemy. Strictly listening and no notes. I like to just hear concepts for the first time before I take notes on them. The second week is when I got more serious. I went through every chapter of Darryl Gibsons GCGA SYO-501 Study Guide. As I went through the chapters, I skimmed over concepts I was already familiar with like common malware attacks. I took notes on all the acronyms that I didnt know. From previous certs, I knew that if you knew the acronym, you were in a much better spot to make an informed guess on the multiple choice. After I finished the chapter, I would take the quiz. I usually scored around 85%  90%. If I missed one, I made sure to go back and google more info on them to get a better understanding. During the week of the exam, in my spare time, I would do two things: look over the common ports and watch Professor Messer videos. I also did some googling on certain concepts that I wanted better clarification on. I also completed all of the online labs associated with Darryl Gibsons previously mentioned book. The day before the exam I went through all 24 practice tests on [URL I actually didnt do that well on these. I was scoring in the low 80s. I made sure to take notes on questions that I missed. I dont recommend these for a simulated tests experience, these are more for understanding definitions. **Sec+ Exam Experience:** Im an early riser so I opted for a 9AM slot at the Pearson testing center. Before the exam, I looked over the common ports and the notes I made over the questions that I missed on the examcompass practice tests. The exam itself consisted of 82 M/C and 5 PBQs. After reviewing other threads, it sort of seems like everyone who took the exam around the same time as me had the exact same PBQs (strictly speculation). My PBQs were:  Distribute security controls for a lab, office, and a data center (i.e., cctv, locks, etc.)  Distribute security controls for a data center and a mobile device (i.e., cable locks, encryption, etc.)  Configure a network with a WAP, switch, and servers like LDAP and RADIUS.  View a log of a compromised server and identify when the server became compromised.  (sorry, Im blanking on the last one) I think I did okay on the PBQs. The network configuration one through me for a loop at first, but once you click through the icons youll get a better understanding of what to do. I wish I knew about Mike Meyers practice PBQs before I took the exam. I went in with no experience with them. The M/C were typical CompTIA style questions. They want you to select the best available answer for that question. There were some dingers, but nothing crazy. Only had 1 question on ports and maybe 1 or 2 on CLI tools. Overall, Im glad I passed and now its time for the SSCP. Let me know if you have any questions and Ill try to respond. "

I have some of the Microsoft Fundamentals certificates from a free testing day in college, but otherwise nothing to really compare this exam to. I have over 5 years of experience working in IT as a helpdesk technician, datacenter technician, and currently as a security analyst for about 2 years. For study I completed Keith Barker's course on CBT Nuggets, as well as Jason Dion's practice exams. I scored roughly 65% on average on his exams, and found many of the questions to be too ambiguous. Overall I would say it was a pretty challenging exam, I know the only reason I passed was due to my experience, but I still felt the need to reread each question 3 times and make sure I understood why I was choosing each answer, really drawing on a lot of past experience, particularly with the problem based questions. I ended up changing my answers a couple times and by the third review I had caught a really glaring mistake I had made. I would say make sure you fully digest the logs, even when you think you have the right answer. I believe I had about an hour and a half remaining when I completed the exam, but I could absolutely see most people without 2 years analyst experience using the full time. The questions were really quite complex and required a lot of log digestion and analytical thinking. I was really unsure going into this exam on if I would pass, but I was sure that pass or fail it was going to be pretty close. I made a small study sheet with some acronyms and other book knowledge items on it that I reviewed in the car before heading in, and felt like that helped a lot with remembering some of the little things that I typically google at work. I also found reviewing[ these flashcards](URL on ""Quiz"" really really helped get these things concrete in my head. I honestly don't think I did enough to study for an exam of this caliber, and instead passed from my experience. I would say this makes the CySA+ a pretty solid one to have under your belt. "

Out of all the exam questions, there was only about 10 that I knew the right answer right off the bat. Most of the other questions I made ""educated guesses"". The problem wasn't lack of study, I studied every day for at least 2-3 hours by either reading the GCGA textbook, or doing practice tests on the GCGA premium website or mobile app. The main problems were how the questions are set up: Most of the questions were quite straightforward, but most of the answers had more that one ""technically"" correct answer. This made picking out the right answer quite tough, since they could all be correct. You need to remember that this is a ""security"" exam, so all the answers should be answered from a security point of view. What was weird is that I had no questions regarding ports, and maybe 2 questions regarding encryption or hashing protocols. About 12 of my questions were looking at a log, and finding out what went wrong. I also had a large number of questions relating to time offsets, permissions, and vulnerability scans. The Performance-based questions were the easiest part of the exam, they were drag and drop and took no longer than 3 minutes. IF you do the practice performance-based questions on GCGA premium, you will be well prepared for them. Overall the exam was very difficult, the biggest tip I can give you is to know all the acronyms like the back of your hand, as many of the questions have more than 2 acronyms in them, and to flag and skip any questions you do not know, as some of the other questions will refresh your memory on them. I highly recommend buying the full ""GCGA premium"" package, as it has just about everything you need to look over and know for the exam, but be warned, the practice test questions are much simpler and easier than the real exam. Good luck on your exam, and ask me any question you have."

63,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed the CySA+ today!,1,9nrovx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/9nrovx/passed_the_cysa_today/,2018-10-13 17:19:09,"It was very different from what I expected. My study materials are: -Comptia CySA+ Study guide by Mike Chapple -Pluralsight CySA course (7 courses - 28 hrs) -Kaplan bundled practice exam -Googling samples of logs and checking also my company enviroment I do have 9+ years IT experience and most of it from Provisioning security devices (FW,IDS/IPS,Scanners,NAC appliance,WAF), Sales and SOC engineer and analyst. The practice exam got 0% of the real exam since my questions are geared into Vulnerability Management and Network Reconaissance (which all 3 labs i encountered are covered). My expereince got me through the hump though and I was out of work for the past year and only studied for the past month to refresh my memory and get a recent cert undwr my belt since my CCNA Sec already expired and a few other vendor specific certs (i may have understudied ). I am not sure whats next for me, I amcurrently doing Security analysis and any recommendations on a career path is welcome!"
64,vulnerability,CompTIA,Sec+ 501 (I passed!),1,9r587z,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/9r587z/sec_501_i_passed/,2018-10-25 11:11:46,"**Bottom line:** Passed with a 802 today! Grateful for the advice I've read on Reddit, so I thought I should pass my knowledge forward. &amp;#x200B; **Test itself:** Throughout the test, I thought I was struggling because there were a good hefty amount of questions that had 2 good answers. I think I had about 25 questions ultimately that I flagged or was unsure of. This kind of echoes what I think other redditors have experienced, so I didn't necessarily panic, but tried to do the best that I could by eliminating the obviously dumb answers and making educated questions. Some other questions were just incredibly straight forwards, so there was a good mix. I had 85 questions total, 5 of which were PBQs. I ended up running out of time. Just be prepared to have to take this dumb survey towards the end when all you want is your test results! &amp;#x200B; The test had a wide variety of questions including log analysis-pattern analysis, mobile security, knowing common ports like LDAP, knowing how to configure a network (this one was tough), understanding basic linux commands (pwd), EAP, CHAP etc. &amp;#x200B; **About me/starting point:** In the field for approximately 1.5 years in more of a support/project management role for cybersecurity companies with knowledge of Windows Server 2012, PenTesting, vulnerability assessments and threat intelligence. Before I starting working in the cybersecurity field, I majored in Int. Studies/Econ. So, if you aren't sure you can do this..you absolutely can! I think having some sort of relationship to Sec+ at work was helpful, especially when I wanted to ask a co-worker about PEAP or EAP or a Radius server. However, its widely accepted that this is a stepping stone for everything else. Sec+'s material is quite broad in nature, which is why it is challenging in its own right. &amp;#x200B; **Overall Prep:** I studied sort of on and off for approximately 6 months. I took a skillsoft online course first, but it completely went over my head. I think its only through multiple means does the material start absorbing into your head. I then took another online Security+/Network Security course at my local community college using TestOut. Only about a month ago was when I started taking this certification more seriously. 2 weeks before the test I started cramming like crazy. I ultimately really relied upon Reddit/Internet Googling, Co-worker knowledge, a little of Professor Messor's YouTube Videos, MeasureUp exam (access given by work), CompassTest, other practice online tests, Darrill Gibson's book, Darrill Gibson's Security+ App and Darrill Gibson's Online portal (extra material and questions included with the purchase of the book). &amp;#x200B; *Editorial note:* I believe that everybody studies differently, so tailor your studying to your own personality! I'm the type of person that only does well in tests with pressure. But, I did significantly absorb the material over the 6 months and through my job to be able to understand the context for the test questions. It was very useful to be able to review the exam objectives/terms. If I didn't understand something, it would try my best to look it up and reinforce memory recall through quizzes. I think when you get to the point when you're hitting 85-90%+ of the questions correctly and where you can explain why the other answers don't work to help your process of elimination..you're on the right track. &amp;#x200B; Test material review: Skillsoft - I think the material has gotten better, but I generally glossed over most of it. If you plan on using it, I would suggest using 1.5x or 2x speed to get through it and use it mostly to bolster what you don't understand. The quiz questions were okay, but seemed off base. &amp;#x200B; TestOut - Overall information was interesting and relevant like Skillsoft. But, again, it was a lot and merely helpful for hearing the information. I took it as part of a community college course, so it was ""class"". The simulation were meh. Its not until I started doing more hand on stuff with Windows Server that I understood how group permissions worked more. The questions are a little bit off base in my opinion. &amp;#x200B; Professor Messor: I went through some of his videos to supplement what I was learning through GCGA. I'm more of a book learner, so this supplemented GCGA's material. I recommend using it at 1.5 or 2x speed. This should NOT be your only material in my humble opinion. Don't just gloss over it, but be an active learner and ask what makes sense..what doesn't make sense. &amp;#x200B; MeasureUp exam - this test was crazy hard and unrealistic at times. I took an exam 5 times until I hit 80% plus. I would say MeasureUp was still more realistic than Skillsoft and TestOut questions though. Just don't be nervous if your test score is lower. &amp;#x200B; CompassTest ([URL Free resource, helped me reinforce terms that came up with Gibson's GCGA. There are no explanations, but generally everything is factually correct, so you can use GCGA to help you with these quizzes. Very good resource that I wished I tapped into earlier on in the week instead of just a few days prior to the exam. There are almost 30 total 25 question tests, so pace yourself in order to absortb the material. &amp;#x200B; Gibson's GCGA 501 book: Great material that covers all of the test objective areas. Just overall good material that flows well and gives you the context in an easy to understand format. Note: In my edition of the book the binary/ASCII description of certificates was INCORRECT. &amp;#x200B; Gibson's GCGA 501 security+ app: I used the quick tests, flash cards and the tests in my free time. Some of this material mirrors the actual book. But, it helps you cycle through the material on your own time. I would recommend buying this. &amp;#x200B; Gibson's GCGA 501 online resources: I only the material that was complementary because I purchased his book. Not bad material, but I wished I used it earlier. He has a few PBQs and updated materials on there as well as a correction to the binary/ASCII mistake. &amp;#x200B; PocketPrep+ Security 501 app: This was not very helpful or accurate for test taking. I didn't learn as much as I did through Gibson's materials or CompassTest. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps! "

First, quick notes about the 501: * Studied on/off for 2 months using uCertify (bleh), Professor Messer videos, partial GCGA book, various practice tests. * Went into the test fairly confident about all subjects besides cryptography. Something about that topic just would never stick for me. * Flagged PBQs and any questions I was unsure about and then revisited those at the end. Highly recommend this method for every CompTIA test. * Among the objectives I would highlight security controls, vulnerability scanning concepts, and cryptography algorithms as particularly important. I started the CompTIA journey back in December of last year by completing my A+, Network+ in April, and Security+ now. As I am in school, I studied other topics/certifications in-between those dates. I would say the hardest test, in general, was the Network+. Overall studying wise, I spent about: * 1 month per test of A+, so 2 months total * 1.5 months for Network+ * 2 months for Security+ (much more off/on than the others) Glad to have that trio behind me! On to ITIL Foundations and then Project+."

I'm going through WGU to get my B.S. in CyberSecurity and Information Assurance and had to renew my A+, and get Net+, and Sec+. A+ was no biggie. Stupid test with loads of outdated information I'll never need to know. Net+ I failed on my first try. I took it on the last day of the semester after not studying because I had nothing to lose by trying. I think I scored a 710? Took it again a few weeks later after studying and stressing out of my mind and passed with an 811. Just passed the Sec+ after being up for like 18 hours with a score of 786. I felt confident I could pass before going in, but like everyone else says, that kind of went out the window once the exam began. I did get the NTP question, the POODLE question, and a bunch of log questions. I had 83 multiple choices and 2 drag and drop sims, maybe 3. A good amount of log questions that weren't too different than what I see at work. I did have a few that were analyzing code? You had to figure out what kind of vulnerability it was i.e. buffer overflow/interger overflow. Anyways, just super excited to be done with CompTIA. A+ I used only the uCertify materials. Net+ I used uCertify, TestOut Labsim, and bought Professor Messer's notes. His notes were by far the most helpful thing in my opinion. Sec+ I used uCertify, TestOut Labsim, and bought Professor Messer's notes. I really only felt like I needed to brush up on PKI and cryptography so I didn't go over his whole pdf but I'm sure its quality."

Today I passed with a score of 775. Not as comfortable as I thought it'd be but a pass is a pass. Simulations were straight forward and I had an understanding of 95% of the questions. The odd question that relied on you reading a log and interpreting the data/vulnerability was tricky for me as it didn't come up in any of the study material I used, so I'd recommend looking for material on this if you are looking to take the exam. The majority of my learning was doing practice exams on Total Tester and exam compass. I had the Darril Gibson study guide which I skimmed through, reading all of the ""remember this"" grey boxes and doing the end assessment test. Unlike others I didn't really watch any YouTube videos on this as I struggle to learn this way. I would also say I gave up on CertMaster about 10% of the way through because the material is so much harder than what you get in the actual test (I learnt this with N+ too)! There we two different study notes that I found on reddit that were helpful to read over. Main advice for the test would be to know your acronyms! A lot of the questions were answerable just by knowing these as they'd throw in a lot of completely irrelevant acronyms.

Taking a month off then plan on studying for the CySA+ And hopefully receiving by the end of the year. IT Experience Bachelors in Cyber Security received in May. During school I ran some vulnerability scans with Nessus and wrote reports in our Cyber Security center. I have also been working as a Security Analyst for the last 3 months.

Took every practice test in the book. I also used the certmaster which was very helpful for me. I finished the whole thing then went back and did a smart refresh on all the questions I missed the first time. Took all of Messers pop quizzes and briefly used the Gibson paid iPhone app. I have had the book for a while and have briefly studied it over time, but I spent the last 2 weeks studying a few hours a night and about 8 hours on the weekend. Test I had 72 questions with two PBQ questions. I did the PBQ questions 1st and they were honestly the easiest part of the test for me.They word the multiple choice questions so terribly, a few of them I had to read multiple times to figure out what the BEST answer was. I did not get the POODLE question that Ive seen on here, but did get a few weird log and Linux questions. Helped to know the basic Hash and Encryption methods as well as ports."

The 1000 practice questions help a lot as you would learn how to read the logs and gives you a lot of practical situation.

I am a web developer, so most of the material does not apply to my actual work, but I took the exam to get a new job/promotion. I studied for 2 months, and passed on Mt first try. Below are my observations, and how I prepared. Materials used: -CompTIA Security+ All-in-One Exam Guide, Fifth Edition (Exam SY0-501), 5th Edition -Professor Messer videos (I watched most of the videos, but I also used youtube-dl to download the audio to the videos, and would listen to them on my way to and from work) -Certmaster quizzes that came with the deluxe package About the exam: -I was definitely tested thoroughly on vulnerability types, access controls, and secure protocols. -I had I believe 1 question that directly asked about ports. A couple were looking at logs or command line tool outputs, and ports could help a little on those, but knowing ports was definitely not a deal breaker on passing the exam. -Like ports, IP addresses were not a significant part of my exam. Only a handful of questions showed them, and only a couple of answers depended on knowing anything about them. -Understand categories of protocols, encryption vs hashing vs file transfers etc. Some questions would say something like Bob needs to send a file to Joe securely, but it is too large for email, pick 3 options, and if you can eliminate the email protocol, or a hashing algorithm, you can narrow it down to the appropriate answers. I was nervous that the test would be much more technical asking about ports and if it is tcp or udp etc. I think that the questions in CompTIA CertMaster and quizzes in the book mentioned above were a good representation of what was on the exam. Hope this helps somebody, as I know I looked here and appreciated the info from others. If you have any questions I'm happy to answer while it is fresh on my mind."

The only material(s) I used were Darill Gibsons book and Professor Messers YouTube video for any topic that needed further explaining. I passed with a 770 and halfway thru I thought I was most likely going to barely fail. I think what helped me pass is really being able not only know why the right answer is right but why the wrong answers are wrong. I found by eliminating most choices I was able to make very educated guesses as to what the correct answer and I ultimately think this was the difference in me barely passing vs barely failing. Also, definitely review logs and be able to identify what the attack is. Though again, it helps to be able to eliminate choices even in the PB-Qs. I personally chose to not even read the Performance Based-Questions but to mark for review and tackle them last. I got over 10+ questions wrong and still passed. Lastly, I am a relatively fast test taker in general. I completed this exam with about 45 minutes to spare which gave me plenty of time to review my choices. I would review all questions but especially any that you didnt right away. Then I would focus on the key words that are being used and the specific category of answer theyre looking for. For example, if its asking what vulnerability this is then you can eliminate anything that isnt a vulnerability. Ultimately, I think your best bet is being able to understand the material to the point where you are able to use context to make very educated guesses (if you need to).

For instance, I got a question about vulnerability scanning where one answer narrowed down between ""credentialed scanning"" and ""authenticated Scanning"". It racked my brain for a few moments until remembered that the objective under vulnerability scans only asks about non credentialed vs credentialed scanning, so authenticated most likely wasn't right. It's important to make sure you learn all concepts against the backdrop of what is used in the objective. The terms matter and they'll try to catch you on that. * Lean on Professor Messer Security+ 501 Videos - I can not stress enough how much 501 series on youtube was the foundation for most of my study habits. I was constantly listening to his lectures and going back to them when there was something I wasn't fully understanding. I also bought his $20 study guide. * CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide - I read Gibson's study guide front to back and then used it along with the CompTIA Objectives to create an outline for my study plan. I also used his online resources and practice performance questions (I paid the $50 for access). * Know all common ports &amp; their protocols. Know what those ports are usually used for (eg. 53, UDP, DNS query / Zone Transfering with TCP). * Know common tools like nslookup, tracert, traceroute, dig, arp, ntbstat, tcpdump, netstat. What do they do? Which ones are for windows? Which ones are for linux? Which could prevent a MitM attack? Which could be used for branner grabbing? Which would you use to see if you can get to see if you can connect to a DNS server or another system? etc * Understand the multi-factor authentication and what's involved. Including ""Something you know"", ""Something you have"", ""Something you are"" &amp; expensive/inexpensive implementations of each. * There were a couple of programming questions. What I mean by that is, they'd show me a piece of code and ask me ""What's happening here?"" As a developer, I could tell that ""Oh this was a logic bomb"" or ""they're trying to put too many characters into an array"" or ""Oh, someone is trying to inject SQL here"". I guess it would be a good idea to know what grep, if &amp; else mean and perhaps what SQL looks like. * Read the answers from bottom to top. I have a problem where I try to choose answers before seeing all the options. Reading the answers from bottom to top helped me remember to see all options, eliminate the incorrect ones and then choose the *best* from what's left over. "
79,vulnerability,CompTIA,"I took PenTest+ today and even as a pentester, that exam is difficult. How'd everyone else feel walking out of it?",2,8er30w,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/8er30w/i_took_pentest_today_and_even_as_a_pentester_that/,2018-04-25 15:06:23,"I seriously don't feel like I passed, though a coworker that found out he passed a week back said he felt the same, too. There's no material to study for the exam, no guides, nothing but the experience you have and what you've learned. I bought Penetration Testing by Georgia Weidman to look over and some of the material is very similar to the content in many of the questions. If you're wanting to take the exam and relatively new to pentesting, it's a good book to have. **Rant:** I was frustrated with many of the questions because they would ask what tool would BEST work for a given situation and then there are 4 given options but none are ones that I would personally use. There is such an overlap and wide availability of tools used commonly in pentesting where I might use one tool but someone else may use another and we both end up with the same info. Just because I'm not familiar with a particular tool doesn't mean I lack proficiency, it just means I operate with a different set of tools. **Rant, cont:** I think CompTIA has made great strides with this test and it's definitely a challenge but I think that because pentesting tools vary with each person, a hands-on practical approach would probably be best. The cert is to showcase a person's abilities and that they can apply information. However, because of brain dumps, certs are almost anything but that these days. To get certs back to having proper weight, it needs to evaluate a person's abilities to accomplish a goal, not memorize test questions or vague definitions of tools. I hope I got it. I liked some of the exploit/tool troubleshooting questions (I have a strong dev background). I didn't much care for the questions giving you a vulnerability designator and asking you what it pertains to--that's why we have NVD and mitre, so we don't have to memorize each published vulnerability. I haven't taken a cert exam in 8 years and I forgot how molested you feel afterwards. Anyone feel like they tanked it? Did you pass?"

I had reviewed the Pentest Handbook by Gloria and even read up on available information. I had even went as far as to watch some ethical hacking videos, tutorials on various tools, and play around with a virtual lab. After the test started, I realized that this test might have just kicked my ass. For those who will be taking the beta exam or planning on taking this test in the near future, definitely read up and do some basic scripting in Python, Bash, and Ruby. Get acquainted with prioritizing vulnerabilities. And on top of all, be sure you know your Nmap and NetCat switches and command syntax. I have 14 years IT Experience, a M.Sc in Information Assurance, and a whole slew of IT Certs. Does this mean I know it all? Nope... I barely know a drop in the bucket compared to everything that's available in the Offensive side of InfoSec. The CySA+ certification is geared more towards defensive cyber as explained by CompTIA - ##While CySA+ focuses on defense through incident detection and response, PenTest+ ##focuses on offense through penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. The moral of the story... take some of my tips and build on them. Take the objectives presented by CompTIA and study the offensive tools and methodology used by PenTesters. I'm very curious to find out how I did, but I will be waiting with the rest of the group who has taken the Beta. May the odds ever be in our favor! "

93,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed Sec+ on Saturday exclusively using Certmaster,9,3gh366,http://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/3gh366/passed_sec_on_saturday_exclusively_using/,2015-08-11 01:29:33,I see a lot of questions on here about whether or not certmaster is worth it and if it is a good study tool. I purchased the Deluxe package when it was on special (all though it seems like it always is) and was willing to gamble using that as the only study tool since the package comes with a retake voucher. I mainly wanted the cert as a resume builder for my job search. On Saturday I took the test and passed with a 803. Here is my review of the software and my opinions on it. 1. The software gave a nice over view covering majority of the materials on the test. * I felt that it missed out on some key vulnerability types that were on the test * Most of the Encryption algorithms were covered in full * All relevant ports were covered through certmaster * It did not do an adequate job on preparing me for 2 of the simulations I had (practical knowledge was more useful). * As I was using the tool I had to remind myself not to study the question but look at why that was the answer to the question and why the other ones were wrong. * Without my real world experience (5 years in the field and a Bachelors degree in cyber security) I do not think I could have passed using only certmaster. Overall I think certmaster could be used by anyone but is geared towards someone who has practical knowledge and can use certmaster to help understand the type of language comptia uses on their tests. If someone was green in the field I do not think they could pass only using certmaster as their study tool. 
94,vulnerability,CompTIA,Passed Sec+ today with an 861! Debrief inside.,10,337x27,http://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/337x27/passed_sec_today_with_an_861_debrief_inside/,2015-04-20 20:27:08,"I studied for about two months using a combination of Mike Myers' book, CBT nuggets, Professor Messer's videos, and Darril Gibson's book and premium material. My final evaluation to see if I was ready was to do all the examcompass.com practice tests and all of Darril Gibson's practice tests without scoring below a 95% on any one test. As has often been said in this sub, Darril Gibson's stuff is awesome and contributed to about 70% of my total study material. The CBT nuggets made up about 20% more, with a combination of everything else filling in the last 10%. Regarding the exam itself, Darril Gibson's performance based questions turned out to be VERY VERY VERY important. Be completely confident that you know the concepts they present and that you can work them perfectly over and over again. Gibson's regular test questions were good, but I was amazed at how well prepared I was for the sims based on those performance based questions. I had 5 simulation/performance based and 69 multiple choice. For the multiple choice questions, be sure you know the following: Ports (and TCP vs. UDP), encryption and hashing methods (very important that you can tell them apart), wireless security (difference between TKIP and CCMP), user account security (password history, complexity, disable vs. delete accounts), mobile device security, difference between black/white box testing, difference between pen testing and vulnerability scanning, differences between NIPS/NIDS/HIPS/HIDS, and order of volatility. Also be sure that you are comfortable with subnetting and false negatives/positives. I mention these apart from everything above because I was surprised how much my exam hit on these two topics. Your mileage may definitely vary, but just in case... For subnetting, knowing how to chose the correct range was very important on a few occasions. Know that writing 192.168.10.5/32 is the same thing as simply writing 192.168.10.5 and be sure that you can also (somewhat quickly) calculate subnets for the rest of the class C range. I didn't have anything more complicated than a /24. For false negatives/positives, be sure you can tell the different between the two across several different scenarios that might not be as clear-cut as ""What is it called when a NIPS alert is triggered by legitimate network traffic?"" That's about all I can remember right now. Feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer them as best I can."

Been in cybersecurity for \~4 years, with some hands on experience with Kali, etc. BS in cybersecurity, also have SEC+. **Resources used:** * PenTest+ All in One by Ray Nutting * Honestly, not great. It often seemed like the author wanted to write a book on penetration testing instead of a book for a penetration testing certification exam. There is a lot of information here, and subsequently, a lot of information that *is not covered on the exam*. Ordering of topics is strange, and I really only finished like 3/4 of the book because I kept skipping over sections that were not in the test objectives. However, the topics in this book that *are* in the exam objectives are covered very thoroughly. * Udemy course by Jason Dion * Really good for a *foundational level* of what the test objectives are, and some walkthroughs of exploitation, privilege escalation, etc. If you can get it for $10-15 on sale, go for it. Follows the exam objectives almost to a T. * I made an 85 on the practice exam FYR, then passed the real thing a couple of days later after brushing up on some delinquencies. **The Exam:** This was honestly more in-depth than I was anticipating. If you only used Jason Dion's course from Udemy, you likely wouldn't pass. That being said, the questions weren't that difficult, and you could probably reason your way through a lot of them *if you knew the technologies*. Understanding the purpose of most services and tools will get you a long way. However, the PBQs (5!) were fairly difficult. I spent about an hour (out of 2?) on the exam, and a large portion of this was in the PBQs. I didn't feel like I did well during the exam, but was happy to see that apparently I was wrong. **What you should probably know really well:** * How to read/understand/write a simple script, and the ability to differentiate between the four scripting languages listed on the exam objectives * TOOLS. Tools, tools, tools. Even if it's just a baseline familiarity. * OWASP top 10, and subsequent remediation strategies * Flag PBQs and come back to them. Seriously. I would've been tilted during the rest of the exam if I did these first. * NMAP. The switches covered in the exam objectives are a good baseline. * How to identify vulnerabilities. * Familiarize yourself with injections. Like, well. If you have questions, let me know. I won't braindump, but maybe I can help out."

Still not sure where I want to go, but I'd like remote work and cybersecurity is interesting to me. I took the first A+ test after 2 weeks of study then took the second one today and passed after another 2 weeks. Part of getting the verifications is just to learn more about the fields and see what interests me (any suggestions based on IT and remote work?) My original plan was to get Net+, but I'm thinking I'd rather do CCNA. But! I think I'm going to get Sec+ first, and then go back to networking stuff since that was my original interest. Anyways, given that it took me 2 weeks per A+ test - what is a reasonable timetable for the Security+ (also CCNA?). I was only working part time before COVID (so I could practice me sport twice a day) and my hours have been close to halved and I also can't do my sport twice a day (more like twice a week lol, plus other exercise) so I have plenty of free time. My final question is - now that I have passed both A+ exams - do I need to do anything to complete the certification? I saw some stuff about on the test printouts about creating an account etc to get a certificate mailed to me. What if I don't want a physical certificate? Am I certified? Do I need a physical one? It might seem weird, but I kinda want it to be a secret lol. No one knows but one of my friends what I've been working on."

The reach out and community support is a real inspiration. Ive listed my journey below to hopefully help others in their studies. Apologises for the length but please take away what is relevant to you. I have minimal IT experience with the mission of achieving the necessary certs required for a career change into cybersecurity. I purchased a complete study package which included videos, practice tests and exam vouchers For both the A+ exams, Net + &amp; security +. Downside  expensive &amp; is all only valid for 12 months. With hindsight, I would not choose this option again given what I have learnt since. Started with A 1001  studied hard but failed. I picked myself up and found this group. I took the excellent advice and motivation on offer and completely changed my study strategy. With one eye on the 12-month clock ticking, I made the decision to bypass A+ and go straight to Net+. Reason being that A+ is not that important for me to have in the career path chosen, Net+ &amp; Sec+ are. Following 6 months of study passed the Net+ first attempt. I took it at the test centre which suited me and was quiet. I had 79 questions, 3 of which were PBQs. Left these until the end which really helped  good to build confidence and momentum first then return to the tricky ones. What surprised me was how straight forward most of the questions were  none more than 2/3 lines long. Not sure if I was lucky or thats generally how it is? I had one question on subnetting which was straightforward. Quite a few of the practice Qs I did were lengthy and required 100% concentration to try and keep up with/picture the problem. Thankfully not one Q like this. In addition to the above, I spread my resources far and wide for the best chance of success:-  Todd Lammle Net+ study guide  very thick book and detailed. I do feel that in general the content &amp; detail goes beyond what you need to pass the exam, nonetheless a great reference book to go back to for the future. I found the end of chapter Q&amp;As plus a simple way to approach subnetting really useful.  Jason Dions course plus the 6 extra practice tests. I highly recommend this &amp; great value. I felt it was more tailored to passing the exam. If you are very close to/passing all his exams before test day, ( I was getting between 87-95%) you stand a great chance of passing (notwithstanding varying degrees of anxiousness we all feel on the day that has to be managed). I have purchased his equivalent Sec+ course  Professor Messers videos  I dipped into them if I was struggling with a topic to see if from a different angle. Unbelievably this is free  as a result, I felt it right to purchase his notes as a thank you (used them a little towards the end of my studies)  I took advantage of the recent ITProTV free weekend (kindly advertised by you guys). Personally, if I had to choose the best resource it would be this. I found the hosts are really engaging and for me, it was the ideal balance between detail whilst still focusing on preparing you for the exam. I intend to sign up to this for my Sec+ studies.  CompTIA Net+ questions app (free I think - if not very cheap). A huge bank of challenging good questions. It is split up into all the sections of the objectives and great to test your understanding along the way. There is a 50 question test at the end covering the entire syllabus  pass this 5 times in a row and they say you are good to go  In my final 2 weeks, I went through the CompTIA objectives and used this as a guide to make sure I had good knowledge of all the components, helpfully listed which makes it easy to focus on and tick off One final thing  I found by doing masses of questions, when comparing them to what I was confronted with on the exam, although worded differently are similar in nature and content. If you can grasp both the issue/problem and solution during practice questions, there are only a limited number of ways in which a question can be reworded. Good luck to everyone in their studies and stick with it. Sec+ here I come!"

Scored 796 Little background I am a 24 year old student who was studying something completely different when I decided I didnt like it and it was draining my life. I was always interested in IT but never decided it as a career path (wish I did this ages ago) Anyway I decided to enrol in this course that helps you study for certifications to get a cybersecurity job. This was almost a year ago, I had other commitments so my studying was on and off. About 3 weeks ago I went ahead and booked the test. At this point all I did was watch bits of mike myers course and bits off messer. Didnt complete anything. A bit more procrastinating and I had 10 days left. I grinded the hell out of studying everyday for about 12+ hours. Here are the resources I used: Messer videos and notes Myers video Dion Examcram book Pocketprep Examcompass I didnt use the examcram book well. All I used it for was the questions at the end and reading on things I didnt understand. Myers video are entertaining but I feel like it is difficult to apply his videos into applicable knowledge on the test if that makes sense. The MAIN THING I did was watch messe videos at 1.75 and not write notes but instead questions. This is based on the active recall thing (search ali abdaal on youtube). Anyways I would write questions and after every video. I would try to answer the questions in my mind to save time. I then look at at Messer notes to fill in the knowledge gap. I solidified my understanding with the examcompass quizzes. Anything I couldn't understand I tried to read up in the examcram book or I would put it in Flashcards and review it every night. The best resource however had to be JASON DION. When I first tried his practice test I scored 84% and 77%. I was really happy with this. I went back and worked on the wrong objectives and only ended up doing the first Practice exam again but score 98% because I was running out of time. His wording and questions were so similar to the real exam, I was so happy that I found this resource. The next best thing was simulations. I got 4 sims and thanks to dion I am pretty sure I nailed those. It is simply brilliant. This is a must use resource. Now I'm off study for my 220-1002. I barely slept this past week. Averaging around 5 hours because I didnt want to fail even before the test I only slept around 4 hours but I feel fine. If I could do it, you guys can too. Be sure to hydrate and go to the toilet before hand and be sure to use that blank piece of paper they give you. I quickly wrote down all the ports because I had alot of trouble remembering it. I really recommend some medication aswell everyday to calm down and prepare yourself mentally"

I have lurking this sub since I started to study. I studied for 3 months, 2 hours a day. If you have a busy schedule, 1.5-2 hours a day with consistency will achieve the goal. You may be thinking that i spended alot of money with all the material, but noup. I only spended $22 and where on buying dion's and meyer's practice exams. I borrowed all the other material. **Materials:** **Books** Todd Lammle Study Guide (8/10): His first chapters were pretty solid, but near the end he started to teach about many things not covered in the objectives. Exam Cram (10/10): I didn't use it as my main study guide, but i used near the end to enforce some concepts. It also has some side notes that are incredably useful. **Video Courses** Jason Dion's Course (10/10): He teaches in a way anybody will understand, and enfatices on the important stuff. He also tells you what exactly to remember of every topic. Mike Meyers (6/10): His way of teaching is just not for me. He is pretty good at making the course dynamic, but i'am more of a facts guy. I didn't saw the entire course, but at the end of each video he has some notes about the topic to remember which are very good. Professor Messer (11/10): He is just great and free, isn't that enough to deserve a 11/10? His video courses follow the objectives, which is great if you wanna make sure you don't miss anything. I will recommend using it near the end. I also used his notes which are also very good if you just want facts that help you remember each topic. **Practice Tests** Dion's (10/10): For me, his practice tests were harder than the actual exam, and pretty precise with the simulations. scores on the first try: 60,76,84,82,74,82. On the second try i just did 3; scores: 92,93,90. Meyer's Tests (8/10): His test's ask more direct questions, it can help learn the concepts really good. Also i felt the tests are more about his course rather than to simulate the real exam. Craig Zacker's Practice Tests book (9/10): Is pretty good and provides good explanation to every answer. It has a 200 question test per objective that i will defitnely recommend. If you get 75%-80% on it you're good to take dion's test and boost your confidence to pass. It also has a free app called Comptia Network+. **The day before the exam** I used [examtopics.com](URL to get used to the way comptia asks questions, don't use dumps to learn but to learn the style of the exam. &amp;#x200B; **Exam Experience:** I went to a test center because of all the horror stories of online proctoring. That said, i got 79 questions which contained 2 pbqs. Both pbqs practically asked to build a topology, which for me was really easy because i get hw like that on college (associate's in cybersecurity). The wording of the questions was not that bad, maybe i got a good set of them. Everybody says that their exam went heavy on wifi and troubleshooting. Mine went heavy on ports and protocols, so study every theme to be prepared. Next step Security+!!"

However, the thought that cross my mind is whether it was worth it because I know we have to maintain its status, if not it will not be valid in the future. This in return would require me more money in the future to go to events and things like that to have the certification validation to br prolonged. In addition to that, the certification is only theory and no real world practice. I understand that it's recognize by the department of defence and a lot of companies but don't all of them have their own methods for us to get promoted to a higher position? This summer I got into the BIG 5 for an internship without any certification. However, I did do coding and hacking projects in my free time (where I had to show them my portfolio) and I work as a tutor in cyber and compsci at my university, while being in related clubs to my major (cybersecurity). From what I learn from my internship and my peers at work, no one seems to have security+ only a few has CEH, CISSP, and higher ""rank"" certifications, but those people has been on the field 5+ years.

These tests are super expensive too, so what approach should I take? Should I begin with some of the core certs and then branch out to some like PenTest? Also, are these tests really worth it? I am a Highschool student so paying for these tests will be hard, so I want to plan the right route..."

Was supposed to take it last May and June but I encounter technical issues on the day of my exam, so I had to reschedule. But it gives me more days to study and review. The online exam experience now was smooth. And now I have my first cybersecurity certification! The study materials I used are: * Darril Gibson's CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead SY0-501 Study Guide - this book is the real deal. Your money is worth it. * Professor Messer's Security+ training course and study group videos on YouTube - those are very informative. * Professor Messer's Security+ Practice exam - out of all the practice exams I've tried, this one is the closest to the real exam. Worth the money. * CompTIA Security+ Exam Prep on the app store by Thanh Hung - I haven't answered all the questions, but there are a lot practice questions on that app. * I also availed of Jason Dion's course and practice exams on Udemy - those are informative too. I never scored 80% above on his practice exams. If I would give an advise, read carefully the question. Understand what the question is asking. I was able to have a second pass/look on at least 20+ questions after I finish answering all the questions before my time runs out. I change my answers to some of it and for the other questions, I trust my gut. Looking at my exam report I have incorrect answers on all the main objectives of the exam. **It was hard, but If you put the effort in studying, you will pass**. And oh, that survey at the end should be illegal. I was way more nervous answering those. Hahaha. Good luck!"

I got BA in a soft science 11 years ago. Then worked in another unrelated field for 7 years. I started learning programming on the side. Then I got a job providing support for a SaaS product. At that same company, I got into an entry level front-end developer role. That lasted a year and I was put on a PIP. I came to learn the PIP was a formality and they planned to fire me. Before I got fired I took a job as an Application Analyst providing support for a couple different products(locally installed and SaaS products). I made that move 3 weeks before covid. I don't want to be providing support long term and am not sure what I want to do. All I know is that when I get off work the last thing I want to do is code which is what I would need to do if I wanted to find another jr level developer role. I've thought about SysAdmin or CyberSecurity which is what's led me here. I saw that the starting point was CompTIA A+. Lots of it still new and challenging but after studying, buying a voucher and scheduling a test I am questioning if A+ is really necessary. I am already in the field and I live in a major metropolitan area and make 55k annual. Should I have just jumped into Network+ or Security+? Advise plz?"

A little background, I have a bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems and have always enjoyed learning cybersecurity stuff in my spare time. For resources I watched all of professor Messer's videos, I also heavily used The Official CompTIA Security+ Study Guide (SY0-501). For practice exams I mainly used professor Messer's as well as Jason Dion's. Prof. Messer's exams were extremely similar to the exam questions while I found Dion's were actually fairly more difficult than the actual exams questions. Also, I thought 3/4's of the way through the exam that I had absolutely failed so if anyone else is taking the exam and feels that way don't give up! If anyone wants any advice or wants any questions answered I'd be glad to help out as its the least I could do considering this subreddit is the reason I passed.

Starting off, I deepdived on this subreddit to find study materials and tips from prior test-takers. For my main study materials I ended up using: Darril Gibson's Get Certified Get Ahead book. Jason Dion's practice courses and exams. Professor Messer's YouTube course. I took really thorough notes on the book alone. I found that writing it down really helped it stick. I also watched Jason's Dion's course and Professor Messer's videos a full time through independently and then rewatched videos as I was at work or about to go sleep. After going through all the material I went through the exam objectives even going as far as to make quizlets for each domain. Although when it came to memorization, I used Anki which is free on Android and browser. I also found that making visuals/slideshows helped me with some concepts that I had a hard time remembering. I studied for about a month and a half. I would say that I made sure to dedicate most of time to studying. By my estimate I would say on average 6-10 hours/day. I took the exam online due to the pandemic and lack of transportation and found OnVue to be very easy to navigate. I had a total of 81 questions and 5 PBQs. I went through the multiple choice first and made sure to leave about 40min for the simulations and review. On practice exams I had mostly either barely passed or came within a few points of passing so while taking the exam, I had completely thought I failed and flushed my money down the drain. However, if I can do it I'm sure you all can as well. Hope this helps."

I recently graduated with my masters degree in cybersecurity from a Big Ten university and I spent some time working in incident response with my university, which made analyzing logs in the PBQs easier. I studied with the Security+ Study Guide from Sybex and I watched about 80% of the Jason Dion course on Udemy. I also bought Michael Meyers' course too. I would really pay attention to log analysis, setting firewall rules, and take several practice exams to get more familiar with how the test asks questions. During the test, I was hit with all the PBQs and after the sudden shock, went into the rest of the exam. Some stuff simply was not covered in my exam prep materials but I was able to carefully read, analyze, and think of an answer. Memorizing stuff doesn't really help except for port numbers!

There are 3 certificates I'm thinking about: 1. CySA+ - I have fresh knowledge from Sec+, and working as security analyst already. 2. CCNA - I have experience and knowledge in Cisco networking and I was preparing for this long time ago, but never finished it. 3. CCNP Security - Probably the best option, but too hard and expensive and it will take me too much time. The main factor of choosing the certificate is to get myself more attractive for recruiters.

It seemed like every time I was getting into a good groove, something would come up: a coworker (or 3) would leave, Id have to take on new responsibilities (which thankfully came with a pay increase every time), the virus hit, etc. It felt like I was constantly backsliding and having to relearn everything each time. I used professor Messer, Mike Meyers, and Jason Dions resources to pass. The exam itself was super anxiety inducing for me, Im not sure if its because its been a year and a half since Ive graduated college and havent taken any tests since, if the year and a half grind leading up to this was getting to me, or if the money riding on the line (my company was going to reimburse me for the cost of the test and study materials, but only if I passed) was what got to me, but I was an anxious wreck the night before and morning of. The question seemed designed to really make you go with your gut feelings, for me a solid 50% I was unsure of but went with what I felt was the best answer. I passed with an 812 out of 900, not too shabby! Now that Ive finished Im going to take a month or two off from studying. When I started my network+ journey I was a level 2 tech, and now Im a server administrator in a Linux/Microsoft environment.

Im trying to decide whether to pursue Linux+ or Security+ as my next move. I feel I dont have a very deep knowledge of either, but Im more privy to security than linux which may be a problem in my new role.

I was able to accomplish my goal of acquiring the CompTIA trifecta in less than 30 days (29). I am currently in the transition phase of my military career, but for the past 20 years I have pushed aside my IT aspirations while working in the Aviation field. So I am pretty excited that I was able to focus and complete this goal. The last time I was involved in IT beyond administrative MS Office work was back in 1999 during a summer job Y2K patch program. Not sure if my training plan will work for anyone else, but I'll share my experience.... &amp;#x200B; July 1st I purchased my first Udemy courses : [Mike Meyers - TOTAL: CompTIA A+ Certification (220-1001)](URL [Mike Meyers - TOTAL: CompTIA A+ Certification (220-1002)](URL After going through the 1001 content I didn't feel comfortable enough to even purchase and exam voucher yet and began searching for more content. That is when I finally came across r/CompTIA and noticed several users mentioning Jason Dion's practice tests and Professor Messer's YouTube channel. So back to Udemy I went for: [Jason Dion - CompTIA A+ (220-1001) Test Prep, Exams and Simulations](URL [Jason Dion - CompTIA A+ (220-1002) Test Prep, Exams and Simulations](URL Having zero experience with the CompTIA or PearsonVue process these videos actually helped out greatly and put me at ease and ready to walk into the testing center. However I figured I would check out Professor Messer's videos as well, but I dreaded sitting through another 14 hours of video on the same subject so I ran these at 1.5x speed. [Professor Messer - CompTIA 220-1001 A+ Training Course](URL [Professor Messer - CompTIA 220-1002 A+ Training Course](URL Once I finished both 1001/1002 exams I felt as though I no longer needed to continue with the learning content from Mike Meyers as I progressed further. This decision wasn't really based on lack of quality of content as his videos are very informative and cover the same percentage of content as the other two. It was more of a decision based on time and I found I was able to retain information well with running Jason Dion's videos at 1.25x and Professor Messer's at 1.5x. For both Network+ and Security+ I ran the same gauntlet.... Jason Dion's videos first; I would take notes while I watched these lessons then I would take the practice test included. While I took the test though I would have the Exam Objectives available with the acronym list to associate anything that wasn't spelled out. After that I would pull Professor Messer's playlist up and let it run in the background while I watched baseball and surf my new found reddit. Prof. Messer's videos go in order of the exam objectives, so I sort of followed along with them as well associating subject areas. If anything would sound unfamiliar compared to Jason Dion's videos I would usually back the video up and pay more attention. I then would go back to Udemy and do more of Jason Dion's practice tests again completing them ""open book"" with acronym list.

I never really ""passed"" any of the practice tests by the way, but I thoroughly reviewed the results of all the practice tests. I tried to understand why it was wrong as well as reinforce the the understanding of the questions that I did get right. I only took each test one time as well since I didn't see the necessity in taking the same test again within 24 hours. Well that's my experience, hopefully it can provide some helpful insight. Now I just need to figure out what direction to focus my efforts next. &amp;#x200B; Investment wise: \~$115 on Udemy Courses $20 iPhone App $1020 in Exam Fees (I didn't choose the most frugal option at first, but found Govt.

Currently work at the help desk for a national furniture and electronics retailer. I was working in sales management but they opened a call center locally and I basically forced my way into an IT role with no experience by talking to the right people and impressing them I guess. I have been here 3 months now. Basically I just wanted input on what certs to go after I get my sec+ and what I should try to do to move into security role hopefully with my same company."
158,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed the new CySA+!

Most of it was straightforward. I'd say I knew 70% of the material without a doubt. **I have 10+ years experience in cybersecurity and I studied for about 3 days prior to the exam, mostly just reading recent articles and whitepapers that interested me regarding the exam topics.** If you're a nerd for this type of stuff, this exam is right up your alley. The material was good enough that I was even able to understand the topics I had no idea about. For example, I've never messed with mail servers and I certainly don't know how they interact with DNS. But I looked it up afterward and made the right intuitive guesses. I wasn't expecting a question about how to hack cars, but it was a pleasant surprise. PBQs were easy-peasy. **If you've never done a PBQ before, take the sample one on CompTIA's website.** You get points specifically for following the instructions, regardless of whether you know the material intuitively. That means clicking every screen, every relevant logfile, etc.! I think if you click reset, that means you have to look at every relevant screen all over again. Make sure you know all about netstat, nmap, Nessus, PHI, PII, PCI, HSM, NIST, ISO, STIG, types of ping scans, OS identification, credentialed scans, etc.! I didn't have a single question on ancient viruses or concepts that have been dead for 5+ years. **It's a very up-to-date test that focuses on modern cybersecurity operations.**"

The entire time I was taking the exam, I felt like I was failing. So happy to be wrong! What I did to study (and this was over the course of about 8 weeks) was: (1) Udemy: both Jason Dion and Mike Meyers courses and practice exams; (2) Prof. Messer videos, notes and practice exams; (3) Darryl Gibson GCGA book and iOS app; (4) PocketPrep iOS app; (5) the ExamCram prep book; and (6) CBT Nuggets (just the free week to watch all the videos). Also, this sub has been super helpful in providing tips and just being encouraging the whole time! I really did not want to have to take this again which is why I used so many study sources.

I have also worked as an information security specialist for a financial institution for just over 2 years, in total I have 6 years experience in IT/IS. I passed both the Security+ and Pentest+ back in February. In my opinion, I believe the CySA+ is the easiest out of the three. This could solely be because of my work experience. I felt that it was less based on definitions and random facts but actually focused on situations that you would come across. I understand that this is the ""Blue Team"" certification and the Pentest+ is the ""Red Team"" certification. I found the Pentest+ to be way more difficult than the CySA+. For studying I just picked up the Sybex CySA+ Study Guide. I'm sure i'm forgetting some things, but please feel free to ask any questions!"

Have in the realm of 18 months of IT experience, very little with actual cybersecurity. My only previous certification is A+ 901/902. Study materials were exclusively free resources online and resources through the National Guard. Specifically, Professor Messer, FedVTE, and Army Skillport. I was scoring around 80% on my practice tests. Main contribution I wanted to make was regarding the OnVUE software. I've heard plenty of horror stories on here (I mostly lurk), and truth be told it was my biggest source of anxiety during all this. I was worried that there would be a technical issue along the way that would kick me out or that the system would be hypersensitive, but I had no issues at all. I used my personal Mac to take the test, as work laptops wouldn't let me shut down all the applications. I started trying to run the system test (the more in depth one, not the camera/mic/internet test on the website) about an hour before my test and ran into issues with my work PC, causing me to switch to my Mac. Got that configured about 15 minutes prior and sat around until my proctor showed up, which was about 10 minutes prior to my scheduled test time. Proctor was American (which I bring up mainly to cover concerns about language barriers; I registered for the English test). They identified a system permission issue and asked me to reboot my machine and they called me on my phone while I did so. They had me move a couple items in my room before they turned on the test. Once the test was running, it was just like previous CompTIA exams I've had at testing centers. They lock you out of other applications during testing of course. During the test, my spouse was the only other person at home, and they were on the opposite side of the house. I observed no hypersensitivity during the test. After the test began I didn't hear from my proctor at all. The first annoyance was the bar at the top of the screen, which had your webcam feed being recorded, the proctor chat button, and a whiteboard button. I found the bar slightly overlapped several items during PBQs. The second annoyance was that PBQs with drag-and-drop items were very finicky. I had to click and hold the item for about three seconds before it was ""picked up"", but then it worked as intended. Finished the test, exited the exam, OnVUE opened a window asking if I'd take a survey. I said yes, then nothing else happened, so I went to relieve my overfull bladder. &amp;#x200B; All in all, I think I'd prefer a testing center in the future just because I was so anxious about stuff going wrong and getting me flagged for a BS reason, but everything ran pretty much like they said it would."
164,cybersecurity,CompTIA,I passed sec+ with no IT experience! (Resources used and exam tips),1,gxx838,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/gxx838/i_passed_sec_with_no_it_experience_resources_used/,2020-06-07 05:21:52,"Hi all, first a little about me. I want to get into Cybersecurity as a new career after working in logistics for a government contractor for the past few years. I do have a Bachelor's degree, but it's in History/Political Science, so I don't have any formal training in IT. I started with the idea that I'd get A+, then N+ and finally Sec+, but people I know already in the industry recommended I go straight to Sec+. I started studying in mid-January a couple hours a week and ramped up my studies once quarantine hit in late March. Here are the resources I used (in the order I used them): Wiley Efficient Learning SY-501 Online Course * I like the *idea* of this course a lot. It lets you plan out how many hours you want to study each day and gives you a syllabus to help you get ready by your proposed test date. * The problem is that the ""estimated completion"" times are way off, especially if you need to take notes, so the syllabus ends up becoming useless if the software expects you to take 30 minutes to watch and take notes on a 40 minute video. Plus, there's a written portion to each lesson that *may or may not* include things not covered in the video. * The end of lesson quizzes would also invariably include a question for the *next section* leaving my confused how I missed a certain piece of information. *Overall, I really like Robb Tracy and the videos he did. They gave me a good foundation, but there really are better options out there. I took 150 pages of notes for the course, and didn't feel the need to go back to them after I started using other resources. Professor Messer SY-501 Videos, Notes and Practice Tests * After finishing the Wiley course, I watched all of Professor Messer's videos without taking additional notes (just the ones he sells). These were a huge help because he clearly goes through each part of the objectives so you know you're not missing anything and it's easy to find something if you need to brush up on it later. * His practice exams were also the best representation of the exam questions I found, ESPECIALLY the performance based questions. The firewall ACLs, matching etc. very closely matched what I saw on the exam. I took the practice tests once a week in the 3 weeks leading up to the exam and scored a 79%, 89% and 91%. Darill Gibson GCGA Book * I bought Gibson's book when I initially started studying, but mostly used it for the practice questions and as a supplement to Professor Messer's videos when I wanted more information. * It's a great book and I definitely recommend using it. It goes into more detail on some things than Professor Messer does. Even if you don't want to read the whole thing, each chapter has an excellent summary of what was covered and can be great for a quick review. Jason Dion's SY-501 Practice Exams on Udemy * I heard about these about a week before the exam and took one almost every day before the exam itself. I finished with about an 80% on each test. * They're hard and tend to match the complex wording of some of the questions in the way that they ask you how to solve a problem rather than just which technology does what. * I'm not a big fan of how he likes to incorporate material from Network+ in his tests, and nothing like that ever came up on exam day. It does emulate being asked questions you have no idea about and critically working through them though, so that's a plus. Whew, that was a lot! After all my hard work I passed the exam on my first try with an 840. Here are a couple things I'd recommend remembering for test day. * Know your ports. The Wiley program and Professor Messer didn't cover much, but it's important to know the port numbers for all of the protocols listed in the exam objectives. Darill Gibson has a good list from SY-401 on his website as well as his study guide. In particular I covered: HTTP, HTTPS, POP3 (secure and unsecure), SMTP (secure and unsecure), IMAP4 (secure and unsecure), LDAP, LDAPS, FTP, SFTP, FTPS, TFTP, SSH, Telnet, NTP, DNS, DHCP, RDP and SNMPv3. These were enough for me, but I certainly didn't recognize everything I saw, YMMV. * Work through questions critically. There were a few questions that I just didn't know the answer to, but if you break down exactly what they're asking and what options you're given, you should be able to narrow it down to 1-2 possible choices. * Skip the performance-based questions. Everyone says it, and it's true. The PBQs can take up a lot more time than your average question, so if it looks intimidating or you can't answer it right away, skip it and come back at the end. Good luck to all of you studying! If I can do it, so can you."

I am leaning towards the CySA+ because it covers 4 more areas of the Approved Baseline Certifications. Here's a little bit about my background. I graduated last year with my B.S. in IT Cybersecurity and a couple weeks ago with my M.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance. My masters program closely aligned with the CISSP material which I am not eligible for because of my lack of experience. One of my masters courses required me to get the CEH certification. As far a professional experience i have very little. I have a year of help desk experience and a 4 month internship with my undergrad university where I spent two weeks at each IT team which included IT Security.

I had to reschedule quite a few times due to other obligations and conflicts, but overall I studied on and off for a few months (whenever I had free time or had motivation, which was rarely). These last few weeks though, I took advantage of quarantine and really buckled down. For reference, I have no IT experience, but I've taken a couple CIS classes from my local community college. I passed IT Fundamentals in September of 2018, but failed Network+ last October. (I think I got between 500-600). My high school paid for my classes and vouchers, so I didn't really have anything holding me accountable.

I watched through the video series once to familiarize myself with the concepts. I didn't take notes, but I bookmarked a lot of slides for reference. I also made flash cards for important TCP port numbers and acronyms. The most crucial thing though, at least for me, was taking practice tests. It was really helpful going back and seeing where I made mistakes and taking notes on those *concepts* and not just noting up the answers. I used the textbook (free with my course) just for reference, and it was helpful in summarizing tool sets. A little wordy though. Hopefully this post helped someone just like this sub helped me. :)"

Well I have scheduled my exam for June 27th and I have been studying constantly for it for the last 2 months but I can't seem to score 80% or above on any of my practice tests which is one of the important parts of exam practice considering the passing score is 750 out of 900. I have been using Pocketprep, Darril Gibson's Sec+ app, and Professor Messer's exam to practice but I can't seem to get a score of 80% or above.

175,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed CompTIA Security+ (online) with no previous experience! 769/750,24,h8dmet,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/h8dmet/passed_comptia_security_online_with_no_previous/,2020-06-14 05:10:50,"Hi everyone! I work for an IT company for a non-security related position. Currently, I started MS in Cybersecurity a week ago to further my career. The only experience I did have was one month's worth of book reading and watching online videos. **I only paid for the Gibson's book and nothing extra.** Resources I used: * [Darill Gibson's ""CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide](URL \- This book covers **pretty much** everything. I read every single page of the book. * I set a goal to read about 20 pages/day during the week, since I work full-time; this took me about two hours a day including looking up difficult terms and concepts. * Every time I finished reading a page, I drew a check mark; this was surprisingly satisfying to see how much I was actually reading. * Did all the quizzes and practices questions - make sure you understand why the answers are correct and why the other options are wrong! **Don't just read explanation for the questions you got right/read all of them!** * [Professor Messers CompTIA SY0-501 Security+ Course](URL \- it's incredible all the videos are free to watch! I used his videos if I didn't understand something while reading Gibson's book. I probably watched the same videos multiple times until I understood the concepts clearly. * [Gibson's performance based questions](URL \- For performance based questions, you really need to understand everything in the book and more. This was a great place for me to get hands on experience. I also did all the labs (free ones) from his site. My brief impression of the test: * It's hard!!! - I mean I knew it was going to be hard, but not this hard. Questions were worded in a way that you need to know everything about the specific terms/concepts that they are asking about. * Experience needed for some questions - there were some questions that I just didn't see in the textbook, such as looking at specific Linux Logs and identify issues and stuff. I feel like you need experience in the field to answer those harder technical questions. * In order to be able to answer questions like above, I highly recommend to spend some time on looking up real life examples of specific concepts you see in the book, such as configuring firewalls for an organization, implementing physical controls for a data center, and so on. Tips for the exam: * Make sure you rest well on the day before! * Set a daily goal/weekly goal/pick a day to take the cert - setting goals are very important. Once you pick the long term goal/the day to take the cert, you can set smaller goals to see how much work you need to do daily to get there. * Skip the PBQ/hard questions. - don't spend too much time on PBQ/long and complex questions. SY0-501-security has some mean and confusingly long questions which trick people to answer wrong. You can always flag them and come back after you get to the last question. I did have 2 PBQs that I knew in my heart and I was able to answer them quickly, but I skipped other 3 and came back after. * Re-read questions - you need to really understand what they're asking in order to answer them. * i.e ) Are we trying to prevent the issue or detect the issue? * Is it asking most cost-effective method or Fastest method? I know everyone learns differently, so please don't get mad at me if my studying method doesn't work for you :) but I hope it helps some people prepare for the cert. I know you can pass it because I passed it!!!!"

Ive always had a thing for computers and wanted to get into IT when I was younger but had no drive and now more than ever I would love to get into it. Especially now since the pandemic is coming to a close and I dont want to go back to retail ever again. The school near me is offering a 16 week Cybersecurity boot camp. It will not grant me any certifications necessarily but the woman I spoke to from the college thats offering it told me its good to have on my resume that I went to a 16 week training course and I would have a better chance at getting hired and that they offer career advancements and can get me in connection with many internships and jobs looking for entry level IT techs. Ive also read from people whove self taught themselves and got certified on their own. It wouldnt be impossible to teach myself but I would rather have someone do it for me and educate myself at home as well but I was curious if anyone here has done the boot camp route and if its worth the money and time

I decided to post in here for anyone looking to pass the CS0-001 before the new deadline. So the total time I used was 3 weeks. I recently lost my new job due to the Covid-19 pandemic so I had good amount of time to study. It took a week to read the book from McGraw-Hill bundle (exam study and practice exam) since it was such a small book. Then I didn't really do any studying for a couple of days. Then 4 days before the exam I used the practice exam from McGraw-Hill. I did each module at a time from the book and then reviewed CBT Nuggets course (I don't believe this was very effective for me passing, just to reinforce) for that section each day. I was scoring an average of 60-70% on the practice exams on the book. A lot of them I did not get the question right since there was a lot of implied knowledge that the author did not explain. My IT background is 2 years + in desktop support. I also have the CompTIA A+, Network+, Security+, and CCNA Routing and Switching(which helped with ACLs). I believe the CySA+ exam objectives added to the Security+ so I advise people to get the cert first. For the exam day(from home) I scheduled it very early since I have kids and there is construction next to my apartment everyday. I skipped the performance based questions and came back to them, I ended having an hour left when I ended my exam. I'm not the type to go back through questions to second guess myself because either I know it or I don't. To summarize I only used: * CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) certification exam. Comprised of *CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Certification All-In-One Exam Guide (CS0-001) and CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Certification Practice Exams (Exam CS0-001)*, this bundle thoroughly covers every topic on the exam. * CBT Nuggets for Review (not necessary but it is a good course) I created an account in reddit to hopefully help someone.

I scheduled them as in-person because I test better that way. What Ive done so far: During quarantine in April I took advantage of the month of free PluralSight courses and went through 90% of their A+ material. I enjoyed the content for the most part, and took notes throughout the videos. In May I intermittently watched Messers 1001 videos while also playing around with Windows Server virtual machines using VirtualBox. I picked up a super micro server for $40 and took it apart and studied the motherboard manual. In June I began classes for Cybersecurity Fundamentals/Network Technician Certificates, and the first class is an online A+ prep course that runs until August 7th. It uses UCertify content including reading chapters, quizzes, some videos, and vocabulary glossaries. So far, I think the content is mostly good, too much detail in some areas and some glossary definitions are messed up or given twice with two slightly different wordings. Ill complete the 1001 portion in two weeks and then the 1002 portion will run until 8/7. There is a mock exam for each section. After I read each UCertify chapter I watch the relevant Messer videos via YouTube AND Mike Meyers videos on Linked-in Learning (1 free trial month) and take the chapter quiz. Ill echo the general consensus; messer is straight-to-business-heres-the-info-for-the-exam in bullet points; Meyers has a little more fun in his videos, might go off topic, but gives great info and visuals (plus you can tell he loves what he does and has fun doing it, I like the vibes). I take a day or two each week to review material from previous weeks using the chapter glossaries to make Quizlet sets. I pretty heavily edit the definitions as I copy them over using info from messers and meyers video content to fix UCertifys iffy definitions. I think this really helps solidify not just terms but concepts as well. Plan going forward: Ill finish all of the 1001 course content by July29th, spend 5 days reviewing, then take a Dion practice test and mark the areas of 1001 I need to review. The next day Ill take a meyers practice test and do the same. Ill then review those areas for the next week until July 12th, at which point I have the mock exam for 1001 through my online course and will see how I do. After going through the 1002 section of the online course, Ill take the week of August 10th to take another practice exam and study my balls off for the 1001 on the 8/14. Ill probably take a rest day or two, then take a 1002 practice exam and study whats left of my balls off until I take the 1002 on 8/21. This sub has been an awesome resource on this journey, and Im looking forward to writing an update once I take the exams. Good luck to everybody working towards their certs!!"

First, in regards to my personal experience, I am under 20 years old, and I have around 1 year of experience working professionally in cybersecurity. I have little to no college experience, and everything I know is self-taught. I currently hold multiple certifications, some of which I will discuss in this post, check my flair for the complete list. I passed the Pentest + certification via online proctored testing. My exam consisted of 65 questions, including five PBQs. Overall I found the exam to be fairly easy, the majority of the questions were a combination of technical, compliance, and law-based, mostly using situational scenarios. Having a strong hands-on technical background was the leading factor in passing the exam. For studying resources, I utilized Jason Dion's course on Udemy, combined with Michael Solomons course on Linkedin Learning. Aside from this, I took notes and made sure to cover every exam objective, once I felt comfortable talking about each exam objective, I purchased a student discounted voucher, and scheduled my exam. My general study method for passing any CompTIA or similar exam types is reviewing about 30-40 hours of videos and taking notes on each exam objective. Last year I took the OSCP certification from Offensive security, and this is my comparison and reasoning behind the taking Pentest+ If anyone is planning on becoming a penetration tester, I recommend getting both OSCP and Pentest+, OSCP was fun mainly because it was hands-on and highly technical. But Pentest+ was a great addition to that since Pentest+ covers a lot of laws, compliance, pentesting rules of engagement, and how to work with customers. If you study correctly for Pentest+, you will acquire skills that OSCP doesnt offer. Since OSCP is purely hands-on. Overall, both exams I found to be fairly easy (OSCP and Pentest+) and if you want to become a penetration tester, or expand your penetration testing knowledge within the information security field, I strongly recommend getting both certifications. Do not use one certification to prepare for the other, just get both, they both complement each other, one offering the hands-on technical work, and the other covering compliance, regulations, laws, and how to work with a vendor for running your penetration test. Have a great day."

I'd like to be able to get a tech job after one certification, doesn't need to be security, but I need to get out of my current job and I'd like to be somewhere in tech, is A+ good enough for that?"

This was truly a team win. For all those that say you need Net+ and Sec+ ... you're wrong. You need HANDS-ON experience. This was my first CompTIA exam and it was tough, the questions were on point, and quite frankly it made my brain hurt. All of the analysis really takes a toll. I have roughly a year of security analyst experience under my belt and I felt that this exam was a challenge I needed to overcome in order to prove to myself that I have what it takes to succeed in this field. I am 24 and my previous roles right out of college were more business analyst project management-oriented, I did have a little networking knowledge though, I passed CySA+ today with an 825. I studied on average 2 hours a day for the past month. My advice for future CySA+ test takers. * Practice Exam Practice Exams Practice Exams (Get familiar with CompTIA verbiage) * Familiarize yourself with outputs (What exactly am I looking at? What tool? What device?) * Simulate each scenario and act on it. (Put yourself in the Analyst mindset.) Everyone studies and prepares for certification exams differently so I won't get into the details of how I got ready to test, but below are the resources I used: * Chapple and Seidl CySA+ Study Guide &amp; Practice Exams (found pdfs online) * ITU CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) video course. (found a bundled course for $30) * CySA+ Public Study Guide (found on Reddit) Again Thank you to the Cyber Security community and Thank you CompTIA for challenging me. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Best of luck to everyone!"

Scored an 800/900. Used TestOut's ""Linux Pro"" course exclusively for my studies. I had no prior Linux experience, but I do have \~8 years of experience as a Windows Sys Admin, along with a B. S. in Cybersecurity and several certifications (A+, Net+, Sec+, AWS SA-Associate, AWS Developer-Associate, AWS SysOps-Associate, and CCENT...failed the CCNA:R+S this past February on the last day of Cisco's certpocalypse). My motivation: I've grown tired of Windows, so I'm shifting my career focus to cloud and DevOps. My goal was to use this exam as a stepping stone for the RHCSA and eventually the RHCE. Anyway, here's my take on the exam for those of you interested in pursuing it... \- 90 minutes, 65 questions, 5 sims at the beginning \- Know how to install, configure and troubleshoot web servers (Apache, NGINX) \- Know how to filter content from various command's stdout using awk, sed, etc... \- Know ""Infrastructure as code"", ""orchestration"" and how the two are related \- Be able to comprehend basic bash scripts \- Know Git commands \- Know how to launch GRUB2 from UEFI Side note: I took this exam via CompTIA's new online proctoring service, which was pretty sweet. They basically have you download a thick client which launches the Pearson testing center shell on your local machine. A proctor watches you via webcam and there's a chat window you can use to communicate with them as needed. Good luck!"

In both methods you will need to set a baseline to identify what would be considered normal operation on your network. This will allow you to compare changes that occur to what is considered normal. With anomaly analysis, it focuses on measuring the deviation from the baseline that you have set and then analyzing any deviations to see if they are statistically significant. With behavioral analysis, a slightly different approach is used where it analyzes multiple associated data points to determine if the changes from the baseline are actually abnormal behavior. Please note that for the certification exam, you would not need to distinguish between these two types but you should be aware that they are both related to data correlation and analytics. Trend analysis involves studying patterns over time to determine what kind of threats/risks are more likely to occur so that you can focus on those particular threats/risks. URL Given a scenario, analyze the results of a network reconnaissance. \----Data correlation and analytics \- Availability analysis \- Heuristic analysis \- Behavioral analysis \- Anomaly analysis \- Trend analysis &amp;#x200B; Looks like those two are in the objectives.

Decided to take the test to put some form of backing to my name and show what I have learned over the past few years. Studied casually for about 4 months then decided to hanker down. At some point, I ended up studying near 10 hours a day. My experience with tests has always been very different from most. Cramming I've always seen as my way of ""Agile Sprints."" It helped to reinforce the information that I wasn't completely satisfied with where I was (your mileage my vary please don't use me as a reason to cram if it doesn't work for you.) Night of the test, I legit couldn't sleep at all. Test was at 5pm and fell asleep around 11am day of(today.) Overall, the proctoring wasn't actually as bad as I thought it would be. They performed their necessary functions then got out of the way. Looking back, Dion's tests were outrageously helpful in me passing the exam. Getting into the mindset and finding random details. Just way out of left field information that seemed like a one-off random fun-fact, he tested you on and forced me to reevaluate how I was studying Used only the resources that were common knowledge around these parts(Dion tests, messer videos, GCGA) Shoutout to u/professormesser for being the Comptia Cert Dad."

My name is blueucube and this is my story. This is my third attempt at Pentest+. I took the beta and failed. I tried again after some study material came out and missed it by 30 points. The nuances needed to pass the exam escaped me. I decided to submerge myself in the material. I took Jason Dion course on Udemy. I read through CompTIA Pentest+ study guide, reviewed everything in Heather Linn CompTIA Pentest+ Certification Passport, and went over 100's of practice questions found in Sybex's CompTIA Pentest+ practice test. The Sybex questions are spot on and Jason Dion's course was super helpful. Pentest+ is probably one of CompTIA's hardest exams (in my opinion). CeH is no comparison. eJPT is pretty close. I have over 20 years in IT (mostly blue team and management). I'm excited to complete this journey. Moving forward I'm eyeing the OSCP and CISSP certifications. OSCP because I love the red team and I think you need to understand the bad to be good. CISSP because of $$$."

I built my own PC, help friends build PC and help my relatives with computer issues, but no formal security experience. At my community college, I took a class geared towards network+ but I didn't feel confident enough to take the exam. I will probably try to get this cert next. In the most recent semester, I took a class geared towards security+. RESOURCES: I started studying in mid-January at the start of this year. I will list the resources I used below: Security+ Exam Objectives: I printed them out and checked each topic off when I felt I was comfortable with it. I found this was helpful because it allowed me to identify any weak points or topics that a few of my resources missed. Port numbers and protocols from the Network+ Exam Objectives: The port numbers aren't on the Security+ objectives, but I decided to study them anyway. I recommend doing this because they did show up on the exam for me. Book: CompTIA Security+ Study Guide by Emmett Dulaney and Chuck Easttom. I read the book cover to cover once while taking a lot of notes. I'd say this book was a good start, but you shouldn't fully rely on it. Some of the concepts were hit or miss, so using multiple resources helps. Videos: Professor Messer's YouTube course. I like the way that he explains some concepts. I felt that my book lacked a lot of visual explanations and instead just wrote out a lot of concepts. Messer's videos use more visual aids and graphics to help explain certain concepts. I watched these AFTER reading my book. When I was on videos that covered topics I was comfortable on, I sped them up to 2.0 speed. On topics I was weaker on, I used either 1.25 or 1.5 speed. Practice Tests: ExamCompass, Jason Dion's exams, and Professor Messer's exams. ExamCompass helps you learn some concepts, but it is very barebones. It doesn't ask you to apply any of the topics to scenarios. It just says ""What does this thing do?"" My scores on Dion's exams for my 1st attempt on each were 84, 87, 78, 80, 82, and 81. These exams were pretty helpful. They include a good mix of short questions and longer questions that you might see on the exam. I didn't keep track of my scores on Messer's exams, but these tests don't get enough attention on this subreddit imo. His practice exams include some practice logs to read, and a lot of people on this subreddit tell you to learn how to read logs. I would highly recommend both Dion's and Messer's exams as I felt these were pretty accurate to how the real thing is worded. EXAM EXPERIENCE: My appointment was scheduled at 1:30pm, but I was allowed to start the check-in process at 1pm. I recommend doing this so you can try to work around any issues if they come up. Fortunately, I had a smooth online experience. I took a picture of my face, my ID, and 4 pictures of my testing environment. Within a few minutes of uploading them, my proctor showed up and let me in the exam. I had 85 questions and 4 PBQs. Like others suggest, I recommend skipping and flagging the PBQs and come back to them later because it is very easy to freak out when reading them. A lot of the questions make you read very closely to the wording of them, so if you rush, you will probably get them wrong. I flagged any questions I wasn't completely sure on. At the end, I think I had like 7 to 9 questions flagged. However, I didn't end up changing too much of my answers. At the end of the exam when I was filling out the survey, I was really nervous.

Part of the degree has us create resumes and such, and they're looked over by prospective companies. Well, a particularly well-known military contractor has shown an interesting in hiring me on, as a full-time paid intern but the catch is that I need a CompTIA Security+ certificate. Up until I was told that I'd need it, I'd only heard of the CompTIA Sec+ in passing, but never in detail. Now I'm reading through the threads on here - And seeing guys who sound like they have a lot of hand's on experience, say that the certification exam was extremely difficult. I feel like I'm out of my depth here, even though I'm coming up on the end of my 2-year degree. Does anyone have any recommendations for a complete newbie on how to start studying for this thing? I have roughly 60/90 days to get it and, if I don't have it by then, the contractor said they'd have to pass me over for someone else - And this is a really big deal, for me. I feel like it's that once in a lifetime kind of thing. tl;dr - As a complete newbie, how do I even go about preparing for the CompTIA Sec+?"

Im pleased to say I passed but only scraping it with 765, pass mark of 750. When I originally scheduled it I thought I was prepared, Id read the Wiley PenTest+ study book (twice) and been through all the Wiley Practice Questions averaging around 80%. Id also followed the IT Pro TV course, doing the practical bits as well in Kali and bWAPP. Ive worked in infrastructure as a sys admin for 6 years then transitioned to Cybersecurity where I have been for the past 3 years as a senior security engineer. I passed Sec+ and CySA+ just by reading the relevant study books so expected the same process should work. When it came to the exam, I realised how underprepared I was! I had a couple of issues connecting to the OnVue software which meant I had to try and connect to the exam three times before starting which added a bit of unnecessary stress. The exam itself, I did my normal technique, completely ignore and flag for review the four labs the go through the questions, flag any I dont know and answer ones I do and then do a second pass on the questions, the go on to the labs. I have to admit I felt like I only truly knew maybe half of the questions, the rest were all really best guess from process of elimination. By the time Id gotten to the practical labs I felt deflated and then even more once I looked at the labs and I dont think these are things you can prepare for without actually being hands on day to day and experiencing the types of vulnerabilities the questions were asking about, most of mine were heavily weighted toward web injection vulnerabilities. Once Id finished the labs I reviewed all the questions, and contrary to my normal approach changed some answers in the first couple of questions. As I did at want to change anymore in case I was changing for the sake of it I just hit End Exam. Expecting to see Sorry you are a FAILURE i was gobsmacked and relived when it said PASS! So my advice would be use more than just the Wiley books.There was ALOT of content that wasnt covered in that book and may only have really scratched the surface. Get as much practical experience as you can, Ive now started looking at TryHackMe and HackTheBox to get a better understanding of some of the vulnerabilities. Focus some of your study time on types of vulnerabilities (especially web injection) and how to mitigate. Id focused a lot on scripting and NMAP as other posts said these were heavily questioned but I only had 1 nmap question and 1 scripting lab. Good luck to anyone taking the exam! I really enjoyed studying for it just wish I practical experience!"

I've studied cybersecurity in college about 7 years ago, and I currently work in IT with my job focus mobile device deployment (don't let the job fool you, they actually made us un-learn things I learned in cybersecurity in order to be successful at the job, oddly enough). Tools I used: Darrill Gibson gcga syo501 book, professor messer security+ series on youtube, Jason Dion practice exams, and a few reddit study guides. Tips: I read the book front to back, took all of the end of chapter quizzes and the post/pre exams. Make sure you not only know the acronyms and some common ports, but more importantly to make sure you understand each of the topics in the comptia objectives and why each function/protocol/service does what it does. Doing so is essential in eliminating in incorrect answers. I also took lots of notes as writing reinforces what you read. I also made flashcards on all things that I was not familiar with or acronyms that gave me issues. Save the PBQ's for the end as they take up a lot of time. The PBQs are such as: Configure the BEST security for a WAP, the best way to prep for that is to actually set up a router (or watch videos of people doing such). That was the hardest PBQ the others were not that bad and you may not get as many as I did. As for interpreting the logs, you will have to know what commands do what and research different logs and attack patterns (I wouldn't focus on this TOO much as it can be a waste of study time). In all it took me about a month to prepare and I was also having health issues that affected my memory, so if I can pass this, anyone can."

No prior experience. Less than 60 hours of study in total. No A+, No network+, no nothing. Passed earlier today with 825/900. You can do it too. So I had 6 days to prepare as I was on a deadline and was told that I had to take the test (more on that later if you're interested) I'm a computer science graduate, with very limited cybersecurity and computer networking knowledge and no work experience. I didn't have enough time to read books, practice 600 flashcards, memorize every port and all the acronyms or anything so my time was very limited and I had to choose my resources carefully. I started my studies by watching professor messer's videos on YouTube (free) and then bought Jason Dion's course ($20) on Udemy. I went through the course and its notes in 3 days prior to the exam. I took 2 more of his practice exams and that's all I did (ran out of time and couldn't do all the 6 exams). I mean, read anything you want and learn from it. It's actually really good to learn beyond the exam's scope. But in my opinion, these courses are more than enough to pass. You don't need any experience. You don't need 10 different study resources or books. Just do what I did and you will pass for sure."

Being that computers and related technology are becoming relevant in every line of work, I view this an opportunity to get a certification and additional knowledge that while it wouldn't be the main focus of my job or resume, it could be an additional asset to have. I would like to get your opinion about what certs would be good for this scenario? Personally, the cybersecurity side is more interesting to me, but aside from taking a couple Udemy courses, I have no actual IT related background. Many years helping family with computer issues and built a couple computers about 15 years ago is pretty much the extent of my experience. Here's what I was considering: * ITF+. Seems like one of the most basic and probably not nearly as hard to study for. That being said, it's not seen as a professional certification so I feel like it wouldn't hold as much weight. * A+. The most basic professional certification if I'm not mistaken. Would definitely take additional time studying as I dont have the recommended 9-12 months experience. Would look better on a resume though just to show that I have some level of IT knowledge. * MTA Security Fundamentals. Not a CompTIA cert but also looked like a beginner level cert that wouldn't be too difficult with some studying but also wouldn't hold much weight. Any others? I appreciate your time and am open to any ideas/recommendations. Thank you"

Over the last 10 years I had always planned on knocking out a few certs but one thing or another always took up my time; getting married, having kids, moving a few times, etcin my current position certs were never a necessity as an ISO because of on the job training. While I generally like what I do I know Ive hit the glass ceiling in my current position as GS-13 and Im tired of listening to the lip service from my DD on how he is working on getting me my 14. Couple that with the general overall terrible work environment and I think its time to start looking elsewhere. Would love to stay in the Fed Gov but private sector also has its positives. I know I need to buckle down and get my certs because as my wife agreesI have no time to get a masters in Cybersecurity with two young kids that already take up most of my free time while trying to be a good father. So my question iswhat order do I go? I am thinking A+ (because I think a good refresher would be smart and a lot has changed in the 10+ years since I did desk side and server support) then Net+, then Security +, then hopefully a CISSP. Like I said, I generally like what I do as an ISO and working with end users and seeing the fruits of my labor paying off when applications go to Production. Information assurance and working on audits and assessments is also a large part of my workload and again, I generally enjoy doing those parts as well (except audit remediation and POAMS, I hate that stuff). Ok, so enough rambling. So again, what order of the certs should I start knocking out, and advice on studying and any guides/books to get, or any other general career advice would be greatly appreciated!"
248,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed Sec+ with an 801!!!,1,f0066j,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/f0066j/passed_sec_with_an_801/,2020-02-07 09:14:56,"Took the exam today after studying seriously for about 3 months. Im currently working part-time at a major payroll company in the USA, specifically chose part time work to have more time to study for the exam. As always, I skipped all 4 PBQs I had. The other 81 questions were multiple choice and pick 3 answers that apply types of questions. I finished the test with about 30 seconds left. My process for taking the exam was like this: the first 30 minutes, I went through all the questions, marking the ones I didnt know for review, and answering the ones I was immediately sure of. The next 50 minutes were spent looking over the flagged questions and trying my best to answer them with process of elimination. I also had questions I answered that I still had flagged. Process of elimination is your friend here. The last 10 minutes were spent on PBQs, and out of the 4, I only fully completed 2, and partially completed the other 2. For those curious about ports: I had just one question that directly asked what port a service would use. I knew my common ports so that question was a cinch. I also had several questions which had logs in them that contained port numbers, and knowing what that port was associated with definitely helped. **Learn your damn ports. Darril Gibson has a page on his blog with ports you can expect to see on the exam.** For studying, this is what I did (the usual pretty much): Professor Messer videos: watched them all at 1.25x speed, repeatedly watched videos on things I didnt quite get (certificate types/formats sticks out). The CompTIA objectives list: in my opinion, this should be your main study guide/reference. What I did was, I looked at every bullet point, then used Darril Gibsons book glossary to find each term. I then wrote down the page number/numbers next to the bullet points in the objectives list. It took a total of about 2-3 hours to match every topic with corresponding pages. It is more than worth it. Darril Gibsons GCGA book: a lot of people recommend reading it front to back, but that is way too time consuming, and youre just not going to remember anything. What I mentioned in my lsst section helped me the most: using the objectives list with page numbers, the only thing is that its generally out of order and youll be jumping around a lot. Definitely do look over his remember this sections, and definitely do his end of chapter quizzes, along with the pretest and post test. Jason Dion Exams: these were immensely helpful, too, I think. The wording of his questions is similar to the exam in terms of structure, although I found my exam was a bit more vague in some questions. I was scoring anywhere between 78% to 86% on his exams. Examcompass practice tests: these are not exactly anything special IMO, but the important part is that it helps reinforce concepts, something pretty important. Articles online: you should absolutely tune in to websites that post cybersecurity news, you will see the terminology being used in an environment that is alien to your study materials, and this will help you to make associations beteen study materials and the real world. So with that said, if you guys study and put in the work, you can do it too. Like many others I was very uncertain as to how I did, but as long as you can look at any topic in any objective and comfortably explain it to someone, you will be fine. Best of luck to all of you out there."

Since this reddit helped me so much, I feel obligated to share my experience, my strats, and hopefully help someone else as well. **Prepare for this mighty wall of text.** Quick Background: 28 yr old, Full time job working 1pm to 11pm in Helpdesk, Got my Masters in Cybersecurity in December 2019 while working (**P.S. that did NOT help in this exam like you'd think**), and a hobbyist in Web App Pentesting. My Strategy and What I Used (what 80% of you are reading for lol): I'll be bold here, there is far too much emphasis on the RESOURCES we use rather than actually learning how to LEARN and how we learn. There isn't a magic bullet course/book where everything just downloads into the mind. BUT with the right learning strat, it will at least feel like it does and save you time/energy/money by having a sys/t/e/m. I'll list my learning strats first, then the resources I used over 30 days. The follow is what works for me: * **For Learning Concrete/Abstract Concepts**: [The Essay Memorisation Framework](URL (credit to Ali Abdaal, youtuber/ a Junior Doctor) &amp; Mind Mapping (credit to Tony Buzan). All Free to learn online. In my style of using it, I created a mind map of a lecture, then from active recall I wrote a lecture styled essay as if I'm teaching what I just learned. I prefer handwriting the essay. * **For Learning Lists of Information**, like Port Numbers and Tool Features: Major Method/System (Turning numbers into words) and the Mind Palace (I only have 1 house with 5 placeholders in each room). I studied both memory palaces and the major method under Dr. Anthony Metivier's instruction. I'm a fan so I have his course, but he has free blog articles that teach the basics of both. * **Above all else, Experiment and use what you learned.** We're learning this stuff to use the stuff in the real world. At the very least, try to secure your home computer and your home's network. That will help bring it home to your mind. I wish I followed my own advice with this, but maybe I can save you the pain and trouble by being your ghost of security plus future (or is it past??) The Only 2 Specific Security+ Resources I used: * **Mike Meyers' Security+ Udemy Course**: As far as guided instruction goes, he is all I used. No other books or courses were used, just this course and the already full QA section. Following my strategy above, I have mind mapped and hand written a summary essay for over 100 of his video lectures. He is great edutainment and I find he goes in-depth when necessary, not by default. It's very easy to get bogged down by specific and often nuanced information studying for this thin. He also reminds me of Ms.Frizzle from the old Magic Schoolbus tv show. * **Jason Dion's CompTIA Security+ (SY0-501) Practice Exams with Simulations (Udemy):** His exams are the real deal. ***They are harder than the real exam and I never passed a single practice exam*****,** only scoring between 64% and ending no higher than 72% the first time taken, when the requirement was 80%. READ THE Q&amp;A of this course. There is so much value there that will quell frustration. I took 1 exam a week over 4 weeks, The 5th exam the night before the real exam, and then the final exam the morning of the exam. With the final minutes reviewing my mind maps on the day of the exam. **My Exam Experience:** So first, wear a sweater. Even if it's winter/fall, they'll make you put your coat in a locker while having the room freezing. I was wearing a t-shirt under a jacket thinking I'd be cool. If only I knew how COOL I really was going to be in that testing room. That really tested my focus and endurance more than anything. I had 85 questions and 5 were PBQ's. My advice is to make sure you really know ports with the application/protocol name, what attacks look like in logs, what attacks sound like described, and what attacks look like diagrammed. If you are not careful and familiar with that, then good luck buddy. The only other things that really stood out is that you really need to know how to securely configure hosts/networks and how network security works together. There are many scenarios where you will be hearing a problem that appears cut and dry, but you will have to think through the solutions they give you then choose the BEST one. Believe me, the ""BEST"" one may not always make sense to you. **Real quick about test taking mentality:** There was a gentleman there in the testing room, audibly freaking out in low murmurs of despair during his test. I wish I could've helped him, but maybe I can help you. It's okay to NOT know something and so release yourself of the pressure to ""ace"" the exam. The test is designed to give you leeway to be wrong. If you don't know something, mark it for review, and skip the question for that moment. There are times that future questions will prompt past answers. I guess my point is this, trust in your training and just do your best. You may not be the best by having all the answers, BUT you can without a doubt always be your best with the answers you do have. Unnecessary Stress just stops you from thinking clearly and causes easy questions or mild thinking questions to become hard and confusing. Good luck out there and I believe in you!"

I got a score of 776, and 750 is needed to pass. I started studying for this exam on the 31st of January of this year, 2 weeks ago today. These are the study materials that I used: [Jason Dions CySA+ video course on Udemy](URL [Jason Dions CySA+ practice exams on Udemy](URL [CySA+ All-In-One book by Fernando Maymi and Brent Chapman](URL Sybexs CySA+ practice tests by Mike Chapple and David Seidl URL [Sybexs CySA+ practice tests by Mike Chapple and David Seidl](URL [CSA+ - CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst. Exam CS0-001 app from the google play store](URL Quick background: I have a B.S. in Criminal Justice and a B.S. in Computer Science. I graduated in December of 2018. I'm a Signal officer in the Army Reserves. I've mostly worked in IT helpdesk jobs on the civilian side. I worked for my university's IT center throughout college, and then worked for a local bank's IT department for about a year before getting my new job. I started a new job as a digital forensic examiner this past December 2019, so I have a lot of downtime at work while I wait for them to send me to all of the different vendor trainings that they have planned. This definitely was one of the reasons why I was able to study so much in a short period of time. I wake up every morning at 3:00am and leave for work at 5:00am. I would get a good chunk of studying done during this 2 hour time frame. The rest was spread out throughout the work day. Here is how I tackled my studying: I started with Jason Dion's videos on Udemy and watched them all at 1.75x speed. This only took about 5 days for me to go through. This course was a good baseline for the exam, but it definitely does NOT cover every intricate detail that the exam tests you on. You will need to do your own research to supplement. Also, lots of spelling mistakes throughout the powerpoints, and especially during the post course practice exam. Then I read the all-in-one book in 3 days total, reading 5 chapters a day and doing the post chapter quizzes.I thought that this was a great book. It was an easy read, and gave more information than Jason Dion's videos did. But, like Jason's videos, it doesn't cover the minute details that the exam tests you on. Supplement with more research. Then I focused on doing the Sybex quizzes and Jason Dion's quizzes on Udemy until today. I registered the Sybex book on the Wiley website so that I could do the quizzes online in a web browser. The Sybex book was an awesome source of practice questions. I felt that the questions went above and beyond what the actual test questions were. I marked questions that I got wrong and then did some quick research on them afterwards. Also, the ability to customize the quiz length/questions was also pretty nice. Jason Dion's quizzes were alright, but if I were to do this exam all over again, I'd probably just skip over this. There were a lot of repeat questions in here that I saw in the Sybex questions. The CySA+ study app that I used on my phone was pretty cool too. It was just all of the Sybex questions. I used this when I wasnt around a computer and I was itching to study. I got my Security+ last April, and I thought that this exam was very similar, yet it expanded on the topics on a very in depth level. There was a lot of log reading, a lot of critical thinking (what would I do in this situation?). A lot of questions asked you to identify what you should do FIRST, or what is the BEST response, or what you should do NEXT. Didnt really get a lot of linux command questions, or framework questions. I got 70 questions total and 4 performance questions. I didnt think the exam was fairly difficult. There were several questions that threw me through a loop though. If there was one thing I'd change about my approach, its that I'd schedule my exam date sooner rather than at the end of the week. I felt ready for the exam way before today. I was getting bored/burnt out from doing practice quizzes and additional research. If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! Ill answer to the best of my abilies."

Just passed the test this evening. Background: Separated from Navy in October 2018 after six years. Due to horrible transition planning I ended up unemployed looking for anything and everything. Came upon a job posting listed at a defense contractor requiring Security+, didnt really know the test or the Cybersecurity field but figured how hard could it be I'll give it a try. I bought a waiver and scheduled my exam. Immediate regret and information overload followed. Studied but never felt confident to test after reading horror stories and taking practice exams. Received a job offer in April 2019 doing something unrelated to the Cybersecurity field. I've been rescheduling this exam for over a year. During that time I never really dedicated alot of time to studying hardcore since my job did not require it. It was basically just burning a hole in my wallet. I would just pick up Darril Gibson's book during downtime at work and read a couple of pages, do practice exams (mostly ExamCompass), and I watched Professor Messer's videos and attended one of his study groups. Well yesterday it happened. I forgot to reschedule the exam. I remembered 2 hours too late in the middle of some KFC chicken that I had jokingly rescheduled it to Valentine's Day as a joke of how that would really ruin the day. I had gotten a Pearson Vue reminder on February 11 of my impending doom but no other contact about the exam...even the day of! My fault for not rescheduling the moment I received the email. Anyways as you can see I was not confident, prepared, or wanting to take this exam. I went in very nervous. Even though my current job doesnt require it I still didnt want to waste my 320 bucks. I think that the biggest thing that helped me was good test taking practices and strategies. I followed the majority of test passes on here by first flagging the PBQ's then running through the other questions flagging ones I didnt know along the way. I never second guessed my answers because I knew this would cause mass confusion in my brain and I noticed on practice exams that when I changed my answer it was usually the first choice I had made. I got to the review of flagged questions and knocked out the PBQ's to the best of my ability. I had 4 PBQ's and they involved a myriad of things such as setting up a wireless network and implementing physical and network security controls. Nothing in the test really threw a curveball at me regardless of my score reflection (I was definitely ill-prepared). If you can remember all of the acronyms then that will definitely help you eliminate irrelevant answers. Just wanted to post for the people out there that dont feel prepared or feel like they never will make it there. Good luck to everyone in the future and I'm gonna relish in my Valentine's win."

(Security+),1,f5iqxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/f5iqxi/first_certification_down_security/,2020-02-18 11:28:10,"Passed my exam today with an 833 after about 2 months of studying. Background: Currently serving my final year in the military and then looking to transfer into cybersecurity when I get out. I decided to pursue Security+ since it seemed like a well rounded intro cert for security and also based off its worth in the DOD sector. Prior to this, my IT experience was limited to toying around with computers growing up and some time spent learning various programming languages (python and C++). Resources Used: \-Watched maybe half of the Professor Messer videos \-Read through CompTIA Security+ guide by Ian Neil (Friend had a copy so didn't cost me anything) \-Used the Sybex course that was up on Humble Bundle about a month ago. Went through all the modules and did ever practice question, exam, and flash card. Not sure what the full price normally is but it was definitely worth it for the price of the bundle. It came with an app that I could do all the questions from so it made it easy to study whenever I had a few minutes to kill. \-ExamCompass practice exams. &amp;#x200B; Next steps... I don't reallly know. Might go after CySA or CASP but I'm also starting to dabble into pentesting. Just upgraded my account to VIP so I can get my feet wet on the retired boxes using the writeups. Thanks to everyone that has previously shared their experiences, tips, and study resources! I spent a lot of time on this sub while preparing."

I didn't think I was going to pass when I was going through the questions I set aside for review at the end, but after that survey, I shed a single tear of joy at the congratulatory message. You can do it! My exam had 85 Questions, with 4 PBQs. I did not get a POODLE question. There were maybe 7 questions that had something to do with ACL rules. One of the PBQs had me configure a WAP to use a RADIUS server. Another one was a drag and drop sim to assign controls to network devices to prevent an attack launched from an external device. You also had to identify the attack. In my case, it was session hijacking (I think). Finished the exam with ~25mins left and 21 questions to review Some background on me: got A+ out of high school in 2015, got Network+ in 2018, and here we are. I'm a Cybersecurity major at GSU. I've been working at an electronics repair store for 4 years. Always been interested in security since I was a child. I spent about 2 years studying on and off for this, between work and school. Glad that it's somewhat over, for now Materials used for my study: Darril Gibson's Get Certified, Get Ahead: A great read! Worth more than a few skims. He explains topics thoroughly. It could use more emphasis on ACL stuff and reading logs Darril Gibson's Security+ app: Great for on the go study. Not sure about iOS version URL Professor Messor's SY0-501 course on YT Good for falling asleep to and getting some easy learning Professor Messor's Security+ notes These are basically notes on the videos. Good for last minute crams or train rides, I guess Security+ All-in-One Exam Guide Very broad and generalized, but full of good content CompTIA Training App Not as good as DG's app, but still a nice free version. It has multiple exams in it. Good general practice URL Lynda/LinkedIn Learning Mike Chapple SY0-501 Course: He goes in depth on a lot of things. The visuals used during the risk management videos really helped me remember on the exam. Big ups to this Jason Dion Practice Exams: I was scoring anywhere between 50%-80% on these. I wouldn't say they're harder than the real exam, for me. I found that waiting a few weeks to a month between retries was very effective. Go back and relearn and it should come out better the next time hackthebox.eu This is a penetration testing lab. You have to hack your own login code, but there are guides for that. Once you're in, it's pretty cool. Very hard for a noob like myself, but I've gotten root on 2 boxes Thanks to the community! Everyone here is amazing. I hope some of this is helpful to someone.

Had hardly studied over the weekend and couldn't reschedule because my voucher expires today. Couldn't schedule it any later due to comptia rules. I have a bachelors in CIS Cybersecurity and about a year worth of work experience in a SOC. Read like 2 chapters of gibGCGA, took one of Jason Dions 6 practice tests but didn't even get to review it and the rest were Quizlet cards. Total study time was about 8 hours over the week and I was pretty surprised when I got to my results screen. Regarding the exam, I feel like a lot of the questions were pretty straightforward. Make sure to skip the PBQs first. Leave yourself like 10-20 minutes to those at the end. A lot of the multiple choices were gimmes, as long as you read the question and the last few lines on those scenario based questions. Saves you time and you're more likely to get the answer right if you're able to narrow it down to 2 questions. I believe I passed mostly due to my schooling and a decent amount of work experience so don't take think that it's an easy exam to wing on if you didn't put in the time. The cert isn't cheap! Good luck to those taking theirs soon!!"

I'm not pursuing a technical major because I decided too late that I wanted to do cybersecurity. I have taken a few CS courses at my college but they weren't really relevant here and didn't help me pass. I did do a cybersecurity internship this past summer and I currently work as a cybersecurity intern at my college. Both of these experiences have given me a lot of hands-on experience that I very much needed. I also studied a lot for Network+ but never took it due to money and lack of motivation (I don't want to be a network administrator). For someone who had very little experience with networks and not much knowledge about how they worked, this helped A LOT. Before studying for Network+ I didn't know the difference between a MAC address and an IP address, if that goes to show my lack of knowledge on the subject. # Study strategy/timeline **A month and a half before the exam:** I didn't have classes in January and only work part time so I dedicated about 4-5 hours a day to study. I watched Professor Messer's videos during this time, taking extensive notes while watching them. **A week before the exam**: I took off from my work and spent about 8 hours a day studying. During this period, I read Darril Gibson's GCGA book. **Two days before the exam:** I literally did nothing but study non-stop (and eat and sleep lol). I took Professor Messer's practice exams (getting a 75%, 81% and a 91% respectively), timed myself taking these exams to practice time management (usually had about 20 minutes to spare), reviewed the answers I got incorrect, reviewed Quizlet sets, and watched Professor Messer's monthly study group replays. **The day of**: I ate a good dinner got a good night's sleep the night before and drank a lot of coffee in the morning. I reviewed some of the stuff I was a bit weak on like encryption algorithms, protocols and their port numbers, certificate file types, etc. **Taking the exam**: A lot of people say they skip the PBQ's and do them at the end but I decided to plow right through them. They were probably the hardest part cause I didn't spend a lot of my study time doing labs/didn't want to pay for them. I marked about 15 questions for review, finished with 15 minutes to spare, and spend the remaining minutes going over the marked questions. I changed 2 of my answers after reading the question more throughly. I really recommend reading the questions carefully cause they will have key words that will determine the *best* answer. # Resources * Professor Messer's videos (free) * I watched these at normal speed, pausing often, and taking pretty extensive handwritten notes. * Professor Messer's monthly study groups (free) * Just to get some extra practice questions in. I was getting almost all of the questions correct before the exam. However, these are pretty easy compared to the exam. I think his practice exams are a bit harder and thus a more accurate way to study. * Professor Messer's practice exams ($25) * These were *really* helpful and worth the 25$ investment. I really like how he goes over the incorrect answers too, so you really understand why you didn't get it right. * Darril Gibson's GCGA book ($35) * I read this cover to cover a week before the exam and did all the practice exams. This was definitely good to supplement Professor Messer's videos with as there are a few gaps. Be warned though, there are a few typos, most notably the difference in CER and DER files (DER is binary, CER is ASCII, he says the opposite). I didn't need to know this for my exam but it's worth pointing out. He also addresses the typos on his website and has decent additional practice questions. I did one of the labs but gave up cause I was too lazy to install a bunch of stuff. In hindsight I could have gotten more lab practice as I struggled the most with the PBQs. * Quizlet sets (free) * DM me if you want a link to them, but I recommend making your own. I studied the terms using ""test"" and also ""write"". I love Quizlet and learn really well through it so I found this to be really helpful for me. &amp;#x200B; I want to thank this community for acting as a big motivation for studying. Whenever I found myself getting overwhelmed by the information or just demotivated in general, I came to this subreddit and saw a bunch of other posts about people passing and the resources they used. While this post is kind of repetitive in terms of resources used or tips for the exam, I hope y'all can get something out of it, just as I got something out of the many posts like this on this sub."

Test day prep: went over my notes, watched some videos, took 1 practice test to find my weak spots, then watched videos on those spots.

While that can be true to a certain extent, when it comes to working on a first-level support team, landing a cybersecurity job comes down to how mature the companys processes and procedures are. In general, the smaller the company, the more talent theyll be trying to squeeze out of each individual. Some security operation centers (SOCs) are an extension of the help desk, or in some security-based companies, the SOC *is* the help desk. Either way, time spent providing technical support to end users is valuable experience for getting into cybersecurity. The ever-so glamorous hacking jobs are no walk in the park. A good [penetration tester](URL is technical, but more importantly, also knows how humans work. Ive talked to many people trying to [break into cybersecurity](URL Some have college degrees, some have certifications, but a lot of people Ive encountered have no experience in information technology at all, and I think this is a huge step that people try to skip ## Communication Skills and Cybersecurity Lets face it: most people dont want to work a [help desk job,](URL and I dont blame them. The hours can be grueling, end users can be rude or frustrating, and the need to keep the call and ticket queues clear adds to the many other factors that contribute to stress. But the help desk, to many, is a steppingstone to a different path. I learned more in my year working the help desk than I did the rest of my 12-year career. Why? Because at the end of the day, the goal is to protect end users, and having an open line of communication with the people who are most impacted by cyber-criminals is crucial. All of the tech knowhow in the world doesnt matter if you cant effectively communicate the [hows and whys of cybersecurity](URL to the true first line of defense  the person sitting at a keyboard with something to lose, a telephone and an ever-flowing stream of email. Learning how to effectively communicate with others is a life skill. No amount of college courses or IT certifications can substitute for real-life experience. Even though many may have poured tons of money into a [bachelors or masters degree in cyber-defense,](URL thats not a ticket to skip crucial steps in the world of IT. ## Balancing Security Procedures and Efficiency Security can surely get in the way of productivity, and its up to the individuals on these teams to take this into consideration. At the end of the day, its the job of the cybersecurity team to keep IT operations working effectively. Just as a cybersecurity incident will slow down a companys momentum, so can careless security procedures, and communication to the end user is key. One seemingly simple change in policy may increase a companys security posture, but it can just as easily kill productivity. If a change means making a login procedure more convoluted than it should be, it will take up more of the end users time, resulting in lost productivity. The bigger the company, the more impactful a change can be, since a loss in productivity can be multiplied for each employee. Worse yet, if an end user finds a way around the security control just to get their job done more quickly, then the simple change will invoke a whole new set of problems. Having an open line of communication to the people who matter is key, but trust is the utmost important factor. If someone finds a way to circumvent a security control, they should have trust that they wont be punished and that another solution will be considered. ## Making Cybersecurity Decisions That Support the Business So, what does all of this mean for getting into cybersecurity? Knowing how a company runs from a different viewpoint is extremely important. Knowing what is valuable to the end user should shape how security procedures are formed and how security incidents are handled. For instance, say that a server has been compromised, and a decision was made to shut the server down immediately and analyze it offline. After all, this server is only used to control printers. Unbeknownst to the cybersecurity professional, a production line is now backing up because that server controlled printers that print serial number labels for the parts that are being manufactured. Every minute these printers are offline, the company is losing tens of thousands of dollars. If this security professional had worked on the help desk, then they may have known the importance of the printing process, because every time it broke before, they would get a phone call from a frantic worker. Ive seen similar situations before, where someone in cybersecurity, who has worked in a bubble for all of their career, has no clue how their actions impact the business. Working in other departments makes an individual better at their job because they can put context around scenarios. Dont discount working your way into the position you want. Just as a surgeon doesnt start performing open-heart surgery right out of college, one doesnt simply start as a [cybersecurity engineer](URL as their first IT job. Education is a steppingstone, but every day of experience is another step toward a successful career. [Getting into Cybersecurity: Why Its Great to Start at the Help Desk](URL"
272,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed Security+! Here are my thoughts.,1,fb4e02,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/fb4e02/passed_security_here_are_my_thoughts/,2020-02-29 11:31:18,"Passed Security+ this morning! This was my first attempt at any certification test, and man, it was a BEAST of a test. Definitely doable, though! Here are the details of my background, study tactics, and my unsolicited advice for preparation. **Score:** 837/900 **Background:** I have a B.S. in Information Security and work in CyberSecurity in a very basic role. To be completely honest, my four year degree taught me far less than I learned while studying for this exam. Don't go to a degree mill, kids! That's a rant for another time, though. **Length of Study:** I studied lightly for probably three weeks, then for one week with 12 hours a day of constant immersion. For that week I ate, slept, and breathed authentication and encryption methods. I'm fortunate the my employer pays for and supports certs so I was afforded time to focus JUST on this exam. **Methods and Materials:** Here are the materials I used including a review of how beneficial I felt they were: **Darril Gibson's CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead** This. Thing. Was. Amazing. It covers all of the topics in a brief but concise way. The end of chapter questions and exams will absolutely kick your butt and make you think in a way that I feel mirrored the difficulty of the real exam. I took the final exam the night before my test and scored an 88%. I purchased the hard-copy book which was nice because I was able to write in notes and physically highlight things. Highly recommend. Though I didn't purchase anything extra, the extras he has available on the GCGA website are supposed to be helpful as well. **Jason Dion's CompTIA Security+ (SY0-501) Complete Course &amp; Practice Exam** This was a great course that I was able to watch at the gym and listen to during work. For the more complex topics, it's nice to have someone explaining them to you in an audio format. The practice exams are awesome and, again, I feel mirrored the difficulty level of the actual exam. I averaged 85-95% on these exams before testing. **Professor Messer's Security+ Practice Exams** I bought these on a whim two days before test day after reading that they were beneficial to other successful candidates on Reddit. The tests are 90 questions with 5 performance based questions. They are a great way to test your knowledge and ALSO your timing as they are almost the same length question-wise as the real thing. The questions were challenging and tested how well you knew each topic. **Other Resources:** I took a one-week in-classroom course that was a basic overview/refresher. It was nice because it made my squirrel-brain focus better on the content, but I don't think it was necessary to pass the exam. I only took this route because it was paid for by my employer. If I had to choose between allocating funds to self-study materials or a course, I'd choose the self study route. That's my personal learning style, though! It could be the best route for others. **My thoughts on the test:** I was absolutely, 100% sure I failed the test. I spent the last four minutes of the test imagining how I was going to break it to my boss that I failed. When I finished the demographics survey and saw a ""Pass"" I was first in denial, then in shock, and then ABSOLUTELY ELATED to have it out of the way. In terms of difficulty, I would say the test was more difficult than I expected but certainly not unreasonable. **Unsolicited Advice:** **Do's:** Do take the time to learn not just what an acronym means and generally what it does, but how it performs that action and when you would use it. For instance, knowing that PKI stands for public key infrastructure and that it deals with digital certificates is great, but knowing all of the components, how and where they fit in, what they do, and how to protect them is the level you should be at. Do read the entire question and **know the objective of the question**. In fact, I started reading the last sentence of the question first so I could filter the rest of the question accordingly. The questions are wordy and include a lot of information they isn't important to the context of the question. Knowing what the objective is first will help you weed out what is important and what isn't without taking too much time. Do eliminate the obviously incorrect answers first. Each question seemed to have two possible answers and two unrelated ones. For example, if they question was which type of pasta dish is typically served with red sauce, the possible answers might be something like ""Cheese Puffs"", ""Fettuccine Alfredo"", ""Spaghetti"", and ""The state of Alabama"". Two of those are unrelated to pasta entirely and can be easily eliminated if you know your stuff. From there, because you have studied and know what each type of pasta dish is, you can arrive at the correct answer. Pick the best answer of the two, and if you don't know, you're at good odds with 50/50! Do use the ""Mark for Review"" feature. Seriously. I flew through the first round and just marked everything I wasn't sure about for review. I finished with 28 minutes to spare and spent the rest of time going through and reviewing the ones I needed to think on. I skipped the performance based questions entirely to make sure I had enough time to answer the less labor-intensive multiple choice questions. &amp;#x200B; **Do Not's:** Do not change your answer unless you are absolutely sure you made an error. If you know your stuff, chances are your first instinct is the right one. Do not leave questions unanswered. You have a 100% chance of getting it wrong if there's no answer! Do not overstudy and overstress. Seriously. Hard to do, but try to stay calm before and during the test. I slept 4 hours last night because I was so psyched up about the test. If you're overtired and overstressed, it's easier to lose your confidence and start missing the simple questions. If you feel yourself starting to get worked up during the test, take a deep breathe and still yourself before you move on. **Conclusion:** There you have it! I hope this helps anyone studying for the test/testing in the near future. Sorry for any grammatical errors, it's been a long day!"

But the others weren't bad if you just thought through them. It helped for me to think of how I would address the problem in the question as if it was occurring in the real-world. As other posters have mentioned, you really need to be comfortable reading and interpreting different kinds of logs and reports. For example, ACLs, packet captures, firewall logs, netstat output, SIEM output, and vulnerability scans were a recurring theme in the questions. If you can master those, you will be golden. Items I used to study: Video Courses * Jason Dion's CySA+ Udemy Course (watched the whole series twice) * TOTAL: CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Udemy Course (watched the whole series once) * Cybrary's CySA+ Course (watched the whole series once, this one was probably the least useful to me) Practice Exams * Jason Dion's 5 CySA+ Practice Exams (many of the questions on the exam also appeared in the app I mention below) * Kaplan Practice Exams through Cybrary Apps: * CSA+ Study App by Magic Bytes Soft (the paid version gives you access to over 900 questions, and from other reviews, they appear to mainly come from the Sybex book) Books: * CompTIA CySA+ All-in-One Exam Guide - Kindle Version (I mainly just used this to reinforce some concepts, I didn't read it cover-to-cover) I also referred to YouTube a lot for topics I was unclear on. In total I studied for about a month. I already had Security+, an MS in Information Science, and experience in web application development. I will say that having Security+ probably helped tremendously. So if you're wondering if you should skip Security+ and go straight to CySA+, I'd suggest getting Security+ first (unless you have lots of experience in the exam domains). I'd be happy to try to answer any questions you might have if you're preparing for this exam. Good luck!"
276,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed CySA+ today...2nd Try,1,ekk614,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/ekk614/passed_cysa_today2nd_try/,2020-01-06 09:33:16,"I passed the CySA+ exam today with a 766, this was my second attempt. I took the test a week ago and failed it, 714. I already have the CASP+ so I wasn't going to bother taking the test again. But my husband made me take again and I am glad he did! I found the CASP and the CySA exams to be hard. If you failed it before, don't get discouraged, just tweak your studying, try again and accomplish your goals! I am going to keep it real, I used prayer to pass the CASP and I had to use prayer to pass the CySA and it worked. I believe in God and I had to use that higher power :-) I took a classroom course, 2 Udemy courses and practice questions from various sources. What I had to add to my study in order to pass the test was Google and YouTube videos. I recommend Googling and YouTubing how to read server logs, web logs, vulnerability scanners, linux commands for cybersecurity, tcpdump, cyber forensics and whatever else you are not familiar with. Use the practice exam questions to get an idea what to search for. The various courses I took helped me actually understand concepts and theories, so repetition of material helps a lot. But you will ""need"" to understand how to read and analyze logs. It is better to see the actual pictures of tools or a live demo of tools and commands to really understand. PowerPoint with just text is not going to help you pass the exam."

I required a DoD 8570 IAT Level II certification for a new job. I started studying in earnest about 10 days ago. I used Professor Messer's videos and notes, Jason Dion's practice tests, Mike Meyers' practice tests, and the study guide that u/ASentientToaster posted in this sub yesterday. Of these resources, Messer's videos, Dion's practice tests, and aforementioned study guide were the most useful. I didn't find the Meyers tests helpful, and the Professor Messer notes were pretty much the bullet points from the videos, which I already had pretty good retention of. I took the first Dion practice test when I was about halfway through the videos and got a 68%. Not surprisingly, my weakest areas were the ones I hadn't watched the videos for yet. Finished all the videos, and when through all six tests. Second attempt at the first test was a 94%. Initial score for the remaining tests were 87%, 80%, 84%, 85%, and 80%. Not great but all passing. Woke up the morning of the test and re-took the second practice test, and got 98%. That gave me a bump of confidence heading in to the exam. The test itself was a bit different than what I expected. I initially flagged the PBQs to come back to later. The remainder of the questions I felt were pretty varied in terms of difficulty. Some I knew right away, and some were very ambiguous. I flagged those I didn't know right away. Finished the rest of the questions, went back for the PBQs, and then the rest of the questions I had flagged. Once I had answered everything, I had about 45 minutes left so I decided to review every question. I'm glad I did this, because there were some answers I changed. Submitted the test, and got my results: 846/900. Overall, my biggest piece of advice is to stick to what seems to work for most people in this sub (Messer and Dion). Take advantage of u/ASentientToaster's study guide, it's great. If you have a way to get some hands-on experience with the tools mentioned in the objectives, do so. My work experience was a definite advantage. Best of luck!"

Background: Cybersecurity student with about 2 years of general IT experience, no experience in the information security field. I studied for 2 weeks, using Jason Dion's videos on Udemy while taking notes the first week, and for the second week, reviewing the Sybex 1000 Practice Question book. I found both CySA+ and PenTest+ to both be fairly similar in terms of difficulty. A good amount of information from CySA+ carried over with me to PenTest+ however because the aim of the PenTest+ exam is different from CySA+, the questions you get ask you to recall and use the information in different ways. If you have taken CySA+ do NOT expect the questions to be at all similar, just do your best to retain the relevant information. I had 65 questions, 5 PBQs. Finished with about an hour left. Surprisingly, it didn't feel like I was bombarded with nmap questions. I had a few, don't get me wrong, but I felt that the questions as a whole covered the material and exam objectives pretty well. **TIPS:** * Know and understand Python &amp; Bash * Know how to spot and remediate browser, web application vulnerabilities, etc * Know Nmap flags &amp; other tool flags and how to read the output * Have a strong grasp of Pentesting methodology and thinking just in general, a good amount of questions were phrased similarly to (as generic as I can describe it) ""A Penetration Tester successfully compromised Target X, using Tool/Exploit Y, but ran into Problem Z, what would be his next step?/what went wrong?"" To anyone else planning on taking PenTest+ or CySA+ here in the future, I wish you the best of luck!"

The Net+ was much more challenging than the Sec+ in my opinion, for anyone who might be wondering. That being said, I didn't find either to be particularly hard, granted I have a BA in Security Management and work in physical security and executive protection, and conceptually, security is security.. so that made a big difference for me also. Now, Im at a point where I can choose any course I want on InfosecInstitute.com, and it's completely paid for. I enjoy the security side of things thus far, but I don't think I can say where I want to end up professionally, as I don't have tangible experience in the field to say ""I like this, but not this"" regarding certain job aspects. With that said, I have an opportunity to take one of two positions in my agency: One is a cybersecurity analyst (hence CySA+), and the other is a networking heavy position dealing with Telecom stuff. I think Ive boiled it down to three of their bootcamps (but if you think theres something more relevant, please let me know!): GCIH bootcamp, CySA+ bootcamp, or the CEH/Pentest+ Dual Cert Bootcamp. I initially thought GCIH, as the vendor is well respected, and the cert itself offers quite a bit content wise; but I don't see any dates for that bootcamp listed, and a rep is checking on whether that bootcamp has no dates due to the new year, or if it's being discontinued, so thats on the fence. CySA+ and the Pentest+ are obviously a same level cert, just a blue vs red scenario. But the Pentest+ also comes with the CEH.. Im well aware of the way the CEH is viewed among the community, but again.. this is a zero out of pocket expense on my part, so it could be good? From everything I read.. Im sure it's a Pentest+ bootcamp, and the CEH is thrown in as almost a ""lesser included"" cert that is purely to satisfy an HR metric.. Having the most relevant cert for a job is not necessarily what Im after.. I can learn additional stuff as I go. Im more interested in what is going to give me the best bang for my buck from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. Hopefully this makes sense to everyone.. yeah.. sometimes I miss my mark ha!"

I'm not interested in the hardware aspect of anything, so Network+ seems to be kind of redundant in terms of what Security+ and Network+ offer based on what I've read here.

I am in my early 40's and have no IT work experience. In fact I have not worked in a long time due to health problems that have been recently resolved. My educational background in college was mostly in mathematics. I need one or two courses for an associates degree, that will be finished finally at the end of this year. All classes completed beyond a sophomore level were theoretical math courses. For the A+ certification I took a prep course at the local junior college. About 56 contact hours, a Mike Meyers book that included the practice tests and a great instructor. After the two month course I studied for three weeks and took the core 1 exam. I studied about 6 hours a day all together, every day and took numerous free online practice exams and it payed off, I passed on my first try. Six days later I took the core two exam and got a much higher score than I did on the core 1. The whole process took 91 days. Onward now, I start a similar class with the same instructor on Monday for the Network+. This year I plan to finish Net+, finish my A.S., take courses in cybersecurity and python and tackle the Sec+. If everything goes as planned I will start the OSCP in January 2021. Then I will need to find a job after a long time of not working, obviously I am leaning toward security, but I imagine I will have to put my dues in somewhere first.

I was nervous and almost forgot few terminology. However I kept my cool and read each question 3 or 4 times before proceeding to read the answer. I failed twice prior to this. Finally passed on my third try. I have only been in IT for about a year, more of help desk related. I started studying since near end of November 2019. Things I used for studying was Professor Messer videos that are free and I have watched them twice. I also bought both of his books, the practice exam and his booklet. Although I skim through the booklet, I used his practice exam book more. As it made me think a lot harder on why it was this particular answer and not the other. I also bought Darril Gibson CompTIA Security+ book and read that first time just skimming, 2nd and 3rd time I read in depth while taking bits of notes here and there. Then the final time to get a clear understanding. I also used Jason Dion's practice exams that people have mention. The question was a lot hard and I only used it once. But it gave me a strong understand of how to carefully take bits and piece of the question in order to pick the right answer. I wish and hope that they would at least include on several things that I saw on the exam that I could not do. An example, one of the performance based question was to configure a WAP that is connecting to 4 server. I could only figure out 2 or 3 of the fill-in boxes. Now that this is over I am finally going to take a 1 month break. Then move on to my next certification. I am hoping to ask the community advice on this. Should I take Network+ cert or Pentest cert? I am aiming towards Cybersecurity field and wanted people who are heading or in that field to guide me. Also, how do I renew my certification? I heard you would have to keep taking higher or equivalent certification to renew all your cert. And each cert is valid for 3 years. But I heard there is an alternate and I wish to learn more about this. Thanks."

It was more difficult than I expected. I honestly thought I failed it when I finally submitted my results. I was presently surprised when I saw that I did decent on it. As for my background, I have an associates and bachelors in cybersecurity and will be finishing my masters in Cybersecurity this August. Ive also worked in IT for 5.5 years, 1.5 of which are as an Information Security Specialist at a financial institution. To me, the hardest part was the performance based questions. Not even because they were difficult, but discerning what the question was actually asking was kind of annoying. As for resources, I read the Security+ book by Packt, the Security+ book by Darril Gibson, and watched some of Mike Meyers videos to fill in the gaps. Some tips for the exam: skip the performance based questions at first, then when it comes to the multiple choice questions- if you have any doubt just mark the question for review. Once you finish the multiple choice questions, complete the Performance based questions then go through the multiple choice questions you flagged for review until youre satisfied with the results. Then deal with the anxiety and adrenaline while doing the post-test/pre-result survey and hopefully youre greeted with the Congratulations page."

298,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Did earning your IT certifications help you land a job and a decent wage? What is the minimum wage that you should expect for Net+ and Sec+ certs + some experience? Please comment below.,1,ea5h3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/ea5h3u/did_earning_your_it_certifications_help_you_land/,2019-12-14 02:35:40,"Warning: Decently long post, sorry in advance and thank you for reading I am studying for Net+ right now and I will be taking the Net+ exam in the first week of January. My plan is to take and hopefully pass the Net+ exam in the first week of January and then study and take the sec+ exam on my birthday in February. I was wondering what security+ jobs should I be aiming towards and what wage should I be looking for so I do not get screwed over. I have IT experience in the form of a high school summer IT internship (which was 7ish years ago) and a summer IT internship from last summer (They had me doing help desk, networking and teaching me security, however, they also had me doing backup plans in case something goes wrong and well as making budgets for the IT department which I thoroughly, so I'm not sure what to exactly title that on my resume). If I was to get hired by a company I think I would ask for a wage somewhere between $18-20 but I'm not sure if that's too high for someone like me with limited experience. My last internship boss told me I can extremely use him as a reference because I did a really good job. Oh sorry, I forgot to mention that I am a computer science major who is a junior with a concentration in cybersecurity so getting these certs will actually help me in the future. In your guys' experience, how much would you ask for in an IT job with two certs and limited experience? Thanks for reading this post and commenting."

I've studied Daril Gibson's book, watched professor messer, took practice tests on Udemy but failed once again today. I've been studying for this exam long hours.. like 8 hours a day. It's just draining me to the point where I feel I should quit on Cybersecurity and try to get my bachelor's in something else just to make a decent salary. I have an Associates in Information Technology along with A+ Certification but no interviews yet. This exam is so tricky.. I do not know if it's cause I'm just not good with tests.. I've read the whole book by Daril Gibson and fully grasped everything in the book. Took practice exams and did pretty good. How is this test even graded? How much are PBQ's worth? And I've concluded to leave this cert alone because it has wasted a lot of my time and money that I've could of put towards advancement to a Bachelor's degree. I need advice on what to do from here because I just don't know what to do as far as my career goes. Should I obtain a Bachelor's in something else or try other certs"

Still no job yet, but getting phone calls and in-person interviews - learnt I need to get experience working with Microsoft 365 and Azure. Thus now working on the two MTA of M365 and Azure fundamentals (I need experience in Microsoft exams before doing the MCSAs). My long term goal for this decade from 2020 to 2030 is work to becoming a cloud administrator, architecture, and cloud security. The path of certs I think will help to do this is: Diploma In Information Technology --&gt; CompTIA A+ --&gt; CompTIA Network+ --&gt; Microsoft 365 Fundamentals + Azure Fundamentals--&gt; O365 Modern Desktop Administrator --&gt; Azure Administrator--&gt; CompTIA Security+ --&gt; CCNA (New) --&gt; CompTIA Cloud+ --&gt; SSCP --&gt; AWS Cloud Practitioner --&gt; AWS Solutions Associate --&gt; O365 Enterprise Administrator --&gt; CCNP Enterprise --&gt; Azure Solutions Architect Expert --&gt; AWS SysOps Associate --&gt; CISSP --&gt; CCSP --&gt; CCNP Security --&gt; AWS Solutions Professional CompTIA stalkable titles I want (because compTIA marketing worked on me):  Infrastructure Specialist --&gt; **CompTIA IT Operations Specialist** (A+ / Network+) = **CIOS**  Cybersecurity Specialist --&gt; **CompTIA Secure Infrastructure Specialist** (A+ / Network+ / Security+) = **CSIS**  Infrastructure Professional --&gt; **CompTIA Cloud Admin Professional** (Network+ / Cloud+) = **CCAP**  Cybersecurity Professional --&gt; **CompTIA Secure Cloud Professional** (Security+ / Cloud+) = **CSCP** The last two cloud ones are the best!!! One resource that I would recommend it IEEE membership --&gt; less than 250/yr you get access to Skillsoft library of training materials = Video series for every cert, Practise exams for most certs, and access to over 30000 eBooks.

I am about to PCS to San Diego, put in 3 more years landing me at at a little over 10 years of IT experience. After that I'm ready to bail out to the civilian world and be treated like a human again. What should I accomplish in those 3 years while I have the luxury of someone else paying for it? (1rst attempt at certs and set number of credit hours/year are 100% covered.) UMGC has told me I could do their Master's course in a year and a half, but that I could also finish a Masters at another college easily (its not like I have to worry about transferring credits at this point, I didn't know before. I assumed I'd be stuck following it through with them.) I'm primarily interested in Cybersecurity, information assurance, that kind of stuff. . . So, the questions: 1) Should I finish my Master's at UMGC, or look for a more prestigious-less on-line college to do my Master's at? 2) Should I pick up Net+ to round out my triad or move on to the next tier? 3) I've been planning to pick up CASP, didn't even know CySA was a thing until I was browsing this sub tonight. Which is harder? which should I get first? My vague plan has been to get CASP and CISSP to set myself up for the right tier of work, and polishing off the Masters as a finishing touch. But I realize I'm not to sure what the weight are of these things, I saw someone say early that its certs or degrees as requirements, not both?"

I finished the classes and passed my A+ 1001,1002, and Net+ it was a rough road of nights and weeks of sleep deprivation and oversaturating with the learning materials, yet I've felt like ""did I just really passed these test"", I've felt like this cause it seems like I've gained the knowledge as wordings/bookwise yet I am not really sure if I can imply these skills in the real world as the program did not offer hands on experience (except for A+ hardware). Earlier Today as I chickened out of taking my Sec+ test, I've decided to reschedule my appointment to take the test Monday next week instead as I felt like I am too sleep deprived for weeks and I need to study more cause the feeling of **""can I really perform this in the real world""** started to strongly linger in my head again.

Now that I decided that I want to step up my game and enter the corporate world of IT industry, I started this program and gotten my A+ and Net+, but here I am overthinking everything due to the fact that there was no hands-on experience to the program I feel like I would not know how to perform/imply the knowledge that I have learned into action, and since the program feels like it flew by really quick, I am afraid that hence, not being able to use this knowledge in action, by the time I luckily land a job I wouldn't know what to do and perform poorly. I've always kept a positive mind throughout this program cause no kidding it is ""**HOLY CRAP HARD**"" but Sec+ finally did it for me, I broke down this midnight crying (I know I'll get over this) due to overthinking of how I have all this knowledge/certs yet would I really be able to imply this to my future job (I am overthinking cause most entry level out here where I live needs years of experience in the IT Field - however my 10+yrs of experience are unpolished knowledge/google knowledge/simply basic). **Here's Some Resources that I have used since the program:** **Mike Meyers All in One A+** **Mike Meyers Passport Net+** **Mike Meyers Passport Sec+** **Youtube and Quizlet - for practice tests** **Professor Messer A+, Net+ Live Study Sessions** **Days, Weeks of Oversaturating Late Night Self Study** &amp;#x200B; I made this whole post to ask you about your experience. **Did you feel the same way/Do you currently feel the same way?** For people who are experienced in the actual IT corporate/office operations. **How did you start your career?

I understand the CompTIA Cybersecurity path I need to take. I dont have any prior IT experience other than Completing Microsofts IT support professional courses on Edx.

I dont see myself troubleshooting any Windows/Linux issues in this role.

Exam feedback 1. Just by reading and watching lesson videos won't be sufficient. Hence ,you would need to go online and do a lot of research and watch a lot of application video based on the syllabus for this exam. Working experience will definitely help here (depending on the field of exposure). 2. Just have to read carefully the questions, put yourself in the shoe and what will you do given the scenario based on what you have learn and experience. &amp;#x200B; Now that I'm done, where do I head next? I'm thinking the following : 1. PenTest+ - just to complete the security path. I have Sec+ and CySA+. 2. CISSP - I'm not sure whether do I want to pursue this due to 1. CompTIA is not well recognised in Asia country (sadly this is my fault as I didn't do a proper research before attempting). Hence, most employer here recognised CISSP, so I might have to take it (probably requirements of employer) if I do get a job. But... 2. I couldn't get a job (was applying for a CyberSecurity Analyst entry role for a year now). It's probably due to my age (I'm at the early 30's) and the recognition of CompTIA paper. I may not want to commit anymore time and money for the paper (since I have already self-funded for all the 3 paper). 3. I understand this paper require working experience in order to fully complete the paper. &amp;#x200B; Ultimately, I hope I can get out of my current field of job and start from scratch and work my way up again and to do finally something I liked. Appreciate if those who are currently working in the Security field would give some career advice."

There were probably 5 or 6 questions with specific Linux commands that I had no clue about. I might have gotten some of them right by process of elimination and making lucky guesses but they definitely hurt my score. Got a fair number of SDLC questions despite reading other testers getting none. On the other hand, I had 0 questions about any security frameworks (which I spent a ton of time drilling down) or regulatory agencies. The test sucked. My first time through I was sure all my answers were wrong.

I just wanted to give you all an idea of how I studied and what exam was like so it can help this community that helped me study and pass. **What was the exam like?** I had 70 questions, 4 were Performance based questions. The first PBQ question I got had either a typo or was just trying to trick me, it got me real nervous on how the rest of the test would be. I decided it was trying to trick me and answered the question to the best of my ability. The rest of the PBQs were right after, my advice would be make sure you are really detailed and confirm all IP addresses and logs match up to the right host you are looking at. They will try to trick you. Make sure you know your port numbers and how to look for malicious activity. This came about 80% from my professional experience and 20% from what the book/course taught me. **Types of questions:** * There were no questions on specific frameworks and regulatory policies/frameworks, I had spent a ton of time memorizing these :\\ * PBQs were very detailed and purposefully tried to confuse you, make sure you pay attention. * nmap questions * A lot of questions that gave you a scenario and asked you to pick the BEST remediation action. (lots of questions like these are on the AIO book practice tests so I had a ton of practice on these) **Study Materials used** I used the following study materials (provided with ratings that helped me most): * Jason Dion Udemy Course (8/10 great video series, learnt a lot but some of the dry in depth stuff (frameworks and policies, using certain scanning and pen test tools the series did not go over well) * Linux Academy Video series by Bobs Salman (7/10 better than most video series, the labs in here I found useless and I skipped the last few because it was terribly basic and I would not learn anything and it was a waste of time) * Linkedin Learning video series by Mike Chapple (No rating as I did not go over these in detail just watched specific videos where I felt I was lacking, it was still useful) * CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst AIO Certification Bundle (Exam CS0-001) Book with Practice test [URL 10/10 in depth book that goes in detail and the end of chapter practice quizzes are great. The practice test questions that came with the book are also very similar to the ones I got in the exam. The extra practice test questions in this bundle also helped greatly as I was able to successfully gauge my preparedness level using these practice tests. **Study journey** I booked the exam for Oct 31 back at the end of July. I did not start studying after coming back from a vacation on Sept 22. I would study for about an hour a day in the beginning watching the Jason Dion videos at 1.5 speed. Once I finished the video series I did the Jason Dion practice test and scored 85%. I didn't think this was enough going by how a lot of other people in this sub have mentioned these questions are way easier than what will be on the test. I moved on to watching the Linux Academy video series by Bob Salman, I found these video series OK, I didn't learn much new information that was not in the Jason Dion video series, I would only do the Jason Dion series if I had to do this again. The labs in this series I found were useless and a total waste of time, I would skip them. I had access to LinuxAcademy from work so I decided to take advantage. I did the practice test again and I scored about 81%, I looked at the questions I was getting wrong and there were specific areas where I was clearly lacking (Frameworks and Policies, Incident Response process, vulnerability toolsets) At this point it was Oct 25 and I was stuck at this 85% level on the practice test in the AIO books, I decided to just power through and started studying about 3-4 hours a day before the exam. I decided to brush up on my weak objective areas by viewing the Mike Chapple video series on Linkedin Learning again provided by work. I only focused on the videos that covered my weak objectives. Took the test again and I got about 75%, I was getting even worse. Same objectives, the material just wasn't sticking. I don't know why I focused on the videos so much, I am a book learner, I decided to read through the book and reschedule the exam to Nov 10. I powered through the book studying about 2-4 hours a night. I didn't get to the last 2 chapters but I skimmed them and did the chapter end practice quizzes. Now I did the practice exams and was regularly hitting over 90%, I was prepared. Even got some 100% quizzes. The only part I wasn't sure about were the performance based questions. The PBQs provided by the book didn't look advanced enough to be the ones on the real exam. I asked some friends who had taken the test and they provided some good feedback, I still wasn't sure what I would run in to. Without breaking the NDA they are pretty simple but make sure you look for trick questions and be detailed going through the logs. Studied for 8 hours on Saturday and about 2 hours before the exam today, went and wrote it, was nervous about the result, I did way better than I thought I would. I like that CompTIA tells you what objectives you got questions wrong in. In the future I will just zoom through a video series to get a good overview and then read through a book. Practice tests really helped me gauge how prepared I was. **TLDR: Make sure you understand remediation actions, AIO practice test and book are amazing, make sure you are gauging how prepared you are using practice tests. Test will actively try to confuse you.** Good Luck!"

When going over the objectives, many of them are the same as S+, though viewed through a different lens. Part of me wonders if I could've passed this exam right after passing S+, but that probably wouldn't have been the best idea. I took the past 3 months to study at a leisurely pace as part of an independent study for school. To be honest, I felt kind of underprepared going into the test today, and I wasn't incredibly confident in a lot of my answers. I think I lacked practical application of the exam objectives. Despite this, I made it out with a score of 801. To anyone studying for this exam and feeling as though the info is redundant to S+, focus more on how everything fits into the bigger picture, the processes a security analyst deals with, and the tools you'd use on the job/how to interpret logs. It may seem obvious, but this exam is trying to get you to think like a security analyst, so understanding an analyst's role in a company will get you a long way. The materials I used were: [The Official CySA+ Student Guide](URL and labs: these were provided for me by the professor that oversaw the independent study and they were okay. The labs didn't really help that much and the book didn't follow the format of the objectives, but I think I benefited overall from using it. [Pearson's CSA+ Cert Guide](URL it doesn't go super in depth, but this was really good for making sure I knew what each objective was. It goes mostly in order of the objectives, breaking down each one. [This practice exam book](URL this gives you a ton of questions to practice with. Not all of them were good, but as long as you can recognize the bad questions, it's a helpful way to practice. [Udemy practice tests](URL I was sad it didn't come with four like the Security+ one did, but these were still useful to have. None of the study materials I used really prepared me for the performance based questions, so I had to figure them out as I went along. However, none of them except one threw me off that much (I had 4). As long as you understand the concepts that they're going for, you'll be fine, even if you've never seen questions similar to the ones on the exam. I'm happy to have this test over with, and I'll likely either be moving on to CASP+ next, or expanding my horizons a bit with CCNA."

I recently completed A+, N+, and S+, and Im going to complete CySa+ sometime in December. Im looking to specialise in cybersecurity in the future hence the CySa+ route. Taking N+ was enough to let me know how much I hate networking... So what should I do next? I feel like CASP+ would be one of the goals, but Im not sure if I should do Pentest+ as well. Any other suggestions would be fine too. PS: I hate math. If any of you find yourself needing a lot of it in cybersecurity, let me know too"

336,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed CASP after bombing a lab question,13,dhwjhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/dhwjhb/passed_casp_after_bombing_a_lab_question/,2019-10-15 07:28:32,"Hi CompTIA peeps, After the help from this sub in helping with my pass, I definitely want to pay it forward for anyone else tackling the CASP. I've also taken the Sec+, the CySA, and the CISSP last year in addition to working in cybersecurity currently so I have a pretty good handle on the subject matter and more importantly the real world uses of the information. This is a difficult exam, but if you study the content read the questions, you can pass. Study Materials I used the Sybex for my book with their online questions; there are a couple questions that are incorrect, but I just use those to review concepts. I also signed up for Cybrary as I had used Kelly Handerhan's videos for my CISSP and saw she had a course for the CASP. They also have practice exams and practice labs. The book was $40 and the Cybrary was $50/month then when I was going to cancel they offered $30/month that I got for 2 more months, so total study cost was $150. The Sybex I would give an 8.5/10 for general thoroughness and ease of reading. Cybrary is rough to grade overall, but of the 3 components I used, Kelly videos 10/10 she's a national treasure, Practice exams 9/10, and Practice labs 3/10. I grade the labs that low because it was SO MUCH freaking content compare to what was on the actual exam and none of those labs prepared me for what's on the test itself. The only good thing is you have access to ALL of the Cybrary labs so I was able to use the VMs with Linux and Windows, etc but not in a guided way. I found some Youtube videos and kind of made my own labs with their VMs. The Exam The day before I didn't study at all to make sure my brain was fresh and made sure to get a good night's rest and had a good breakfast. I made sure I had plenty of time to get to the center which was good because there was a job fair going on. The previous posts regarding the labs are great; I checked the 3 lab questions at the start and went through the questions first. I used my CISSP training for the questions and I think that helped. Read the question and note and language like BEST or MOST, read every answer, read the question again. There were quite a few that I had to choose multiple of the choices. The CySA prep definitely helped with different firewall questions and the defensive type questions. You'll also have to not only know your attacks, but who would commit them and why. This is not a rote memorization test, it is situational and you will need to think about the questions and answers. The lab questions were what I was most worried about and I was right. I had seen in a review that if you fail the labs you'd fail the exam so I thought I had put in a lot of effort into making sure I knew what to do when I got to those. The Linux lab, did great. The drag and drop, awesome, Windows lab, I had no freaking clue. I typed in the very limited things I could remember and got nothing back but ""Invalid"" at which point I decided to review my MC questions and come back to that. You're only given a CLI and a website to download from and typing help didn't work like in the Linux lab. Reviewed, came back to it, still couldn't figure it out after getting really frustrated. I still had at least 40 mins left but decided I wan't going to remember and finished the exam with tears building, thinking that I was going to fail so I might as well get over it. I clicked through the survey quickly then got to the last screen...I PASSED! I was so fucking happy I couldn't wait to take my victory lap on social media and at work. I'm so thankful to this community for the help! I'm thinking about the Project+ next to help with my horrible organizational skills, but I'm really leaning towards learning AWS now, either way I'm taking a break until 2020. Good luck to anyone taking this test...you can do it!"

Only other cert before this was Security+ back in December 2018. Was working an internship with a SOC team since March and converted to full-time as an Engineer in September. Company agreed to pay for CySA so I dove right in. No prior IT or security experience beyond that. Been studying since mid-August. I used Jason Dion's course and practice exams as well as the all in one guide from Maymi/Chapman. Used the CompTIA CySA+ practice exams that I had access to through my company. The exam was challenging but certainly passable. Lot's of focus on the IR process and knowing how to read various logs and outputs from tools like Netstat, Wireshark, and NMAP as well as vulnerability scan results (deciphering false positives vs true positives). Overall I liked the process and feel that even though I had a decent foundation coming into it from school and work, it's certainly helped strengthen my skills and sharpen my knowledge more."

All I did was set up the company's laptop by installing windows and install Microsoft Office suite along with security packages and an RFID card authenticator. I have had some hands-on experience in high school, but that was 5 years ago. Built computers in that class, created ethernet cables and other things I cannot remember. But I have worked with computers way before that since I was in middle school. But other than what I would call is basic troubleshooting with both hardware and software in computers and mobile devices &amp; a bit of network. Thankfully I was given the opportunity to take these two-week cybersecurity boot camp at my school (pursuing my AA in computer science, but I have not attended school for the past 2 years) at the end of the course I will receive the Security+ voucher. My problem is that I am 100% not confident in taking it, and that's just because of how fast this course goes. I understand the material but I have to do my own self-study which I will be utilizing Udemy and the camp's material. Currently, I am holding the CompTIA 1001/1002 A+ certification. In addition to this, I was informed that there is another grant-funded program that lasts about 2-3 months. I have not submitted the documents, but I am not 100% sure if I will get accepted. In the case I do I get accepted these are the course I am interested in: Amazon Web Services Network+ Security+ Cisco CCNA &amp; CCNT (two in one course) (other than the Net+ &amp; Sec+ I do not know much about the other 3) I have self-studied the A+ exam and originally planned on doing the same for both Network+ &amp; Security+ But I do not want to be a paper tiger and felt like I should take advantage of this program to get more experience with Security+ since it is a heavier certification. A classmate told me that the program is very thorough and that you have to pass the final in the class to get the voucher) Now I am in a dilemma cause I can utilize this opportunity to get my Net+ voucher for free, but then I feel that I lack experience in Security+ But then another classmate suggested that I take the CCNA &amp; CCNT program cause it's a two in one program I am very confident in my abilities to pass both Net+ and Sec+ before the year ends, but like I said I do not want to appear as a paper tiger. I am not too sure which route I should head right now or what I want to pursue If anything perhaps to become an information security analyst. Right now I lack work-related experience and honestly, a friend of mine suggested to work on selling myself because I have a lot of knowledge than the average Joe."

I have been in corrections for over 5 years and 2.5 as a senior investigator with CPS but I dont see the end game financially. I am moving towards a career change and was thinking of cybersecurity. Wanted to gauge how do-able this is with the community. I have been watching A+ videos from professor Messor and PowerCert taking notes and making my own guides to get a solid base down. I plan on taking A+ sometime next year when I feel ready. Also looking at a professional certificate cyber course taught at a local university in Florida. As well as google IT and IT fundamentals for cyber by IBM through Coursera. Firstly do you think the career change is doable and secondly is this a good start? I've been told by a few to maybe get an entry tech job to better familiarize and then specialize into cyber but I really cant take steps backwards in pay to be honest. Any thoughts/tips would be greatly appreciated

Great resource, try get it when it's on sale, only cost me around 10 2) [Sybex CySA+ Study Guide](URL \- Next I read this front to back, taking the end of chapter tests making sure I was comfortable with the material. The book follows the Jason Dion study course very closely, so it might be helpful to reference it whilst you watch the video course, if you learn better that way. Great resource, I would say this is essential 3) [Jason Dion Practise Exams](URL \- I went through these practise exams after reading the books, on the first attempts I was getting around 60-70%, however after reviewing what I got wrong and why, I was getting around 90%+ on the subsequent attempts. Great resource if you can get these on sale for around 10 4) [Sybex Practise Exams](URL \- Now this one is a bit of a strange one. Some of the questions in this book are completely out of scope of the CS0-001, however it provides a great deal of questions related to logs, nmap outputs, vuln scan outputs, which you will see on the CySA+. If you need help with the log questions, this book will be your greatest resource. As some of the questions are out of scope, it will help tune your critical thinking. For example, eliminating the obvious incorrect answers and then analysing the last two, picking the best answer. I feel this was another essential resource, especially for me 5) [CySA+ All-in-One Study Guide](URL \- I read this book, just because someone at work has it and wasn't using it, it is a great resource, however I do not feel it to be essential if you have the above 4 study materials. If you can get your hands on it for free or cheap, it's still a good read. 6) [Nmap cheat sheet](URL \- Wouldn't quite class this as a study resource but maybe print this out and stick it on your desk at work, so you are clear with your nmap &amp;#x200B; As for my experience I have been working as a SOC Analyst for the last 3 months and I also have my Network+ and Security+, which definitely make studying for this exam a tad easier I studied for this exam for around 7 weeks, only 3-4 of them properly though. I think this exam is slightly harder than the Security+. there are a lot of Security+-esque questions on it, so they're not ALL log/practical questions, but there will be a fair few. I finished the exam with 1:18 left on the clock, Hope this helps. Feel free to ask questions here or in DM and I'll try my best to answer within Comptia's NDA. Good luck!"

I was actually wondering where I should start looking for employment (advise really, not asking anyone to do any real legwork XD). I have started studying my Net+ and am hoping to get that done before the end of the year. All of this has been on my own dime (sadly) and want to ensure to myself that it is all for a good career change. I work Physical Security at the moment and know that I will probably want to continue down the path of CyberSecurity but it will take me a while."

I have some IT knowledge having built my own computer multiple times but was doing the exams for a career change to leave headhunting and move into cybersecurity. I really want to thank this community for advice youve given other users that really helped me too e.g finding Professor Messers video and exam compass. Regarding study materials, for the A+ I used Mike Myers Udemy videos and Professor Messers videos and course notes. For practice exams I used Mike Myers on Udemy and went through every practice exam on exam compass. I also ran through a few Professor Messer study groups. I watched videos at 1x speed at first but then quickly upped it to 1.25x for the remainder. It cuts down the overall hours by a decent amount. To supplement my revision, after doing the practice exams I went back and watched the relevant video on missing knowledge at 1.5x. I gave myself 2 weeks per exams which ended up becoming around 2.5 weeks each and I was studying 6-8 hours per day. For Network + I used Mike Myers and Professor Messers videos as well as Professor Messers course notes. 100% learn Messers 7 second subnetting as that really saved me in the exam and it isnt shown by Mike Myers. I found that overall I needed to know a broader range of information for the Network+ and found it to be the hardest exam I now move onto the Security+ and would gratefully accept any advice on study materials that others would recommend, especially in regards to reviewing security logs that Ive seen others say they found hard on the exam. Good luck to everyone else currently studying, looking to study or who is about to take their exams, were all in this together!!!"

It's very humiliating because my degree was not a walk in the park and I had expected to have a job by now. Currently, I'm turning my attention to getting a certification.

I'm at least pretty close to feeling confident enough to pass a 1001 exam, although I also need the money. Which is part of the problem I'll get into later. But that by itself apparently does nothing for finding a job since you need the 1001 AND 1002. I just want to get started and get in the door, and have job security better than I currently do. Luckily I at least enjoy the material and find it fun and interesting, so I have the passion for this look forward to my daily study times. I got a wife and two kids, and I got laid off from my last job (a temp at a warehouse) and am broke right now, it's frustrating as heck trying to change all of this. And in my situation I generally tend to be busy obviously, so it somewhat limits my study time. &amp;#x200B; Anyway, I also have been thinking, if the cybersecurity avenue is interesting enough to me, maybe a SEC+ and possibly CySa+ would be in the books. How reliable are these certifications in getting jobs? I hear if you have a security+ you basically get a job pretty quick generally speaking. But what I'm running into these days is that ""entry level"" jobs seem to still require 2-3 years of experience because they would prefer not to train new people. Maybe an A+ will help show some dedication is my hope. Which amazes me that they're finding so many HONEST people to fill these jobs at this point. Is honesty my issue when it comes to job apps? Because it seems to me I have no shot at this if I say that I've been working at warehouses and stuff. It doesn't help that a lot of jobs are in undesirable situations, such as basically getting into fights with crackheads and that makes me want to leave, which maybe makes me look like a job hopper...ugh, I just need to go to bed."

I am also CCNA, Sec+ and A+ certified, and I am also an IT technician. I have no formal work experience with security whatsoever, but have had experience with all of the tools covered in CySA because of classes I've taken at school. First, I watched all of Jason's videos on Udemy. I felt that this was a very solid course. After that I read the book by Mike Chapple, which was a great book as well and I felt it covered any gaps that might've existed in Dion's course. I then took Dion's 5 extra practice exams, which aren't really similar to the questions on the actual test, but I thought they were worth getting just to identify some of the knowledge gaps I still had and just to get in the analytical mindset that's required for CompTIA's convoluted test questions. I also watched 8 of the 27 hours of Dale Meredith's pluralsight course, and he is a great instructor but I felt the course was overkill after the previous materials I used. Study materials: 1) Jason Dion's Udemy Course [URL 2) Jason Dion's 5 practice exams on Udemy [URL 3) CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide: Exam CS0-001 by Mike Chapple and David Seidl [URL 4) Dale Meredith's pluralsight course: [URL Final thoughts and recommendations: You really do need to read the test questions carefully. If you're feeling unsure, read the question, read the answers, then read the question again before choosing anything. I ended up flagging about 20 questions that I could narrow down to two choices, and the rest of the questions I felt had a clear enough answer to them and could answer confidently. I felt that the simulations are really what I struggled with the most. You need to be able to read and interpret logs and vulnerability scans and make sure you can identify false positives. Know how to remediate common vulnerabilities. Have familiarity with the syntax and output of tools like netstat, nmap, tcpdump, netcat. Overall I felt the difficulty of this test was about on the same level as Security+, I did not find it to be nearly as difficult as a lot of the posts on here have indicated but I think my schooling helped me gain a lot of familiarity with the material prior to studying for this test."

Almost didn't use this, but after seeing how many people recommended it I bought it. I took notes on paper on everything I was unfamiliar with and highlighted and went over everything multiple times. For books I used: CompTIA CySA+ Practice Tests: Exam CS0-001 by Sybex.

Test scores I got starting from test 1, 91%,70%,80%,68%,70%, and 78%. After each test, I immediately reviewed every question, especially ones that I marked for review.

I am a younger college student with very little IT experience studying cybersecurity and only a semester under my belt. I also had never heard of this certification until May of this year, so this exam was also very daunting as test day came closer. I used Darrel Gibson's GCGA book paired with his test bank, the ExamCram book, Sybex test bank, CBTNuggets, and multiple free tests online such as the ones on ExamCompass. I followed a consistent study schedule, studying no more than two hours a day and taking breaks from the material on the weekends. I, along with many other Sec+ certified people, found that the questions provided by Darrel Gibson and GCGA give you a false sense of confidence as they are easier than the questions you will see on the exam. However, Darrel Gibson's book is a great place to start if you don't know which source to study from. I also personally think the ExamCram book paired the GCGA book is a good thing to invest in. It's good practice to use multiple sources to study from than depending on one source for this exam. For me, I eventually had to move over to strictly doing test bank questions. It helped simulate the testing enviroment and boosted my confidence for when testing day came. The biggest tip I believe others should know is to memorize acronyms. If you know your acronyms and realize what sets them apart (or possibly puts them together), you will be golden. And don't forget all the other test taking tips: eat breakfast the morning of, get at least 8 hours of sleep the night before, don't cram the week (or night) before the exam, and most importantly remain calm. You got this! Good luck to all future test takers!"

It's been quite a journey for a non-IT student, full-time worker like myself. Some background: I'm a handful of years out of university, from a non-IT background, who was getting a little entrenched in a job that wasn't fulfilling. While I'm a fan of where I work, the role I was in was just too small and there were so many times I was off the beaten path trying to find, and being given, work that technically wasn't in my scope. I've fiddled with computers, can work with wireless and mobile, always liked to troubleshoot my own computer issues, and have a huge nerdy interest in internet and information culture. Nothing to hang a hat on for a job, though. I ended up applying to a program at one of the city colleges here for a Cybersecurity class/cohort for the summer; it required writing essays and research, an assessment, explaining why you would fit, etc. I've always been at my best when studying and ended up getting in, mind opened to the wide world of CompTIA, certifications, and subjects within IT. So two things sort of coalesced at the same time - changing roles internally to be an IT Business Analyst, and being accepted into this. For me, this was starting from the ground up to understand everything beneath the ""easy"" things we touch every day, the mobile phones and internet and computers. Studying: * Online class for 3 hours, two weeknights a week, and a 5-hour day on Saturdays that had discussions, activities, labs, etc. With acceptance came enrollment in the college, Certmaster and related materials, and a voucher to take the Security+ exam once all checkpoints were reached. * Printed out the entire textbook and physically wrote and highlighted on the paper (this worked better than reading the eBook copy.) Each chapter is in a folder, now stacked next to my dresser - don't know what to do with all this paper now! * Watching Professor Messer slowly / intermittently when not working on specific assignments. * Followed security / software companies on LinkedIn, and read X number of articles a day. Words would start to make sense in the context of an article and learning about topics. * Our class had a Slack channel to share articles and discuss current events in context of what we were learning. * Things I could have done earlier: Mapped topics out based on the objectives. Purchased the GCGA book to read the topics in a more down-to-earth way. * Holed myself up in library rooms with my good friends, one who was working on her Masters and another already in IT who was at the time working toward an AWS certification. Having people to work around makes a big difference to me personally. Testing: * Tests make me pumped and anxious somehow at the same time. The last week I barely talked to other people and just ate and dreamed material. The building couldn't find me on the list from the testing center AHHH but it all worked out. * My first read-through of the test took about 50 minutes, marking the performance-based questions and also anything that didn't sit right when I answered on the first pass. With about 40 minutes left, completed the simulation ones. They weren't nearly as bad as expected and actually enjoyable with the drag and drop and visuals. * Heart was going a mile a minute during the demographics survey ... * Pass! &amp;#x200B; I'm crazy impressed with people who prep and take this in weeks, and granted my background was lacking, but all the basics of things I know work but never understood (networking, how things fit together) needed time to bake in and the time was spent well, especially networking with others with my interests and working with professors. For anyone who is nervous about approaching something like this from a non-IT background, or any other questions, there's a lot I've learned during this and am happy to talk about it."

I have been working with computers forever. Since I was 13 I started building them. eventually I got a job with Geeksquad which led me to Apple. Currently, I'm a SAFETY (hidden department) advisor for AppleCare but im CAPPED OUT!!! My job has a lot of responsibility and I feel like shit doing it because it honestly feels like I'm royally screwing customers. After being at apple for seven years I got an offer from my father in law to work CyberSecurity for Raytheon making over 100k! But I need to get my security+ certificate and I shall be good to go. I have been reading a lot of post and noticed that people mention a huge range of study time needed. Some people say a day, some a month, others 6 months... My father in law's friend apparently had zero IT knowledge (was a woodworker) and was able to find enough study questions where he could memorize the answers and pass in ONE day of studying. He is not book smarts. Clearly this is not the path I want to take since I will be actually using this information in my day to day work. My family is in the restaurants business and we are incredibly fortunate to have 8 restaurants in Washington DC. It's not about the money but about leaving my comfort zone and the work from home experience. 7 years working from home is brutal and I need change. I guess I'm asking for advice, information, experiences, tips! &amp;#x200B; this community seems awesome and I really appreciate any information. I have already read so many post that give GREAT guides on studying the material. :)"

381,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed Security+ today,63,ctuma5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/ctuma5/passed_security_today/,2019-08-22 18:48:32,"I passed the exam yesterday with a score of 808. I just wanted to share my experience with all of you potential test-takers out there. First a little bit about my history and experience. I work in the software development field, and am looking to make a transition into information/cybersecurity. This is my second certification. I passed the (ISC)2 Systems Security Certified Practitioner (**SSCP**) certification a month ago, and noticed that there was a lot of common overlap between the SSCP and SYO-501, so I decided to give this too. **STUDY MATERIALS:** 1. **CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead Study Guide, 4th Edition by Darrel Gibson**\- Highly recommended. I read this book cover to cover, and it's really good. It covered all the exam objectives, and explained all the concepts in a really good manner. 2. **Professor Messer videos on YouTube** \- I went through the whole playlist once. He explains all the concepts in a really concise manner. The videos are organised in parallel with the exam objectives, which makes it really easy to go and look back. 3. **Gcga Premium** \- The PBQs here were great. Also, the extra practice tests here were worded really good too. The questions here helped me prepare for the way Comptia worded the questions. 4. **Jason Dion's practice exams on Udemy** \- I found the questions here to be slightly more difficult than the exam. But they were really helpful in getting a feel of the real exam. Definitely recommended ( especially if you get them on sale). 5. **SELF MADE RESOURCES** \- I made a set of really compact notes based on every single exam objective. This helped me the most. It put concepts in a really simpler perspective visually, and helped me revise the topics. **Some Exam Tips:** * Know all the acronyms. * Read the whole question first, and identify what they want. * Process of elimination is really helpful - In case you come across a question that is tricky/difficult to answer, remove the options that you know are flat out wrong/irrelevant. * Don't waste a lot of time on a single question. If you're unsure, just flag it, and come back to it later. * Solve the PBQs at the end - Thanks to you guys, I decided to do this in the exam, and it was really helpful. You tend to lose some time solving these, and it can reduce the time you have to solve the rest of the exam. So just flag them, and solve them at the end. Lastly, I want to thank all of you guys. When I decided I wanted to give this exam, I had no idea about where to start studying from. I owe a lot to this community for pointing out various links, study materials, practise exams and exam tips. Thanks, guys. Cheers!"
382,cybersecurity,CompTIA,S+ mile wide inch deep question,2,cucv51,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/cucv51/s_mile_wide_inch_deep_question/,2019-08-23 21:57:41,Ive heard people refer to the test several times as a mile wide and inch deep. I just finished my masters in cybersecurity. I figured next logical step is get some of these certs. I have started watching messers videos and they truly seem just very high level basic stuff. Are all the videos of similar topic or do they get more granular? Is the test just that shallow?
383,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed the CySA+ Yesterday,106,cuf91i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/cuf91i/passed_the_cysa_yesterday/,2019-08-24 01:15:39,"Wow that was a pretty difficult exam. I read through almost all the CySA+ posts on Reddit and many of them said ""I thought I failed halfway through"" and I have to say that was exactly my thought. I thought for sure this was going to be a fail even before the PBQ's. Don't feel discouraged though! Here's what I used to study for the exam: &amp;#x200B; Book: CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide: Exam CS0-001 by Mike Chapple, David Seidl: [URL &amp;#x200B; Videos: CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-001): Complete Course and Practice Exam by Jason Dion [URL &amp;#x200B; Study Guide: CySA+ Study Guide by /u/kamekeisen (Was helpful to follow along through my studies, thank you) [URL &amp;#x200B; \---- Practice Exams \- CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-001) 5 Practice Certification Exams by Jason Dion [URL &amp;#x200B; \- CSA+ Cybersecurity Analyst PRO App on Android (Paid \~$10 for it). App was pretty helpful in reading long scenarios which is what this test basically is. I just got the updated version of the app the day of my exam and it looks like they structured it better, so I would recommend. There are over 1000 practice questions &amp;#x200B; \- GoCertify Practice Quizes (I only did 1-4, 7; Since those were done by Mike Chapple) [URL &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; I studied for a total of 2 weeks. My A+, N+, Sec+ were expiring at the end of the month so it's been some time since I last took a CompTIA cert but I needed to get it done (thanks procrastination). Most days I went to a quiet coffee shop so I can get away from the house and concentrate without distractions. Each day, I at least went through 1-2 chapters, while taking a ton of notes. Even things I heard about in the Sec+, I wanted to make sure I remembered it all. I'd stay there for a few hours then head home. Did a few practice tests before I went to sleep so I can gauge an idea of what the future chapters will be about. On the way to work and back, I have about a 1 hour drive each way. I'd listen to the Jason Dion Udemy course on 1.25 speed and review the chapters I read about the day prior. His lessons did give me a bit more insight than the book for what was on the exam. But the collaboration from both was helpful. So Week 1, I read through the first 9 chapters, taking each practice tests along the way. Week 2, I crammed the rest of the chapters and redid all the practice tests and compared how much of the info I retained. Anytime I had spare time on my phone, I'd take the practice questions on the app. I got through about 750 total, some questions answered more than once. On Monday, I started going through the study guide from /u/kamekeisen and made flash cards. Downloaded Nessus, nmap and used netstat at home every day so I can have a visual of what each did and felt comfortable with them. On Wednesday night, I had my wife go through the flash cards with me and make silly acronyms so I remembered the steps in some of the processes. I made sure to have a good nights rest. Thursday, went to work, studied a bit more. Went through our Syslog server and read through some of our logs. Went to Chipotle to get my belly some food before the daunting 3 hours ahead and studied in the parking lot for about 30 minutes. During the exam, I did what Jason recommended and flagged the PBQ's (I had 4) and went on with the rest of the exam. Flagged about 18 questions and for sure thought I would fail. Finished the PBQ's and went over each question one last time. I had about 50 minutes left before I hit submit. Heart was definitely pumping going through that survey until I saw the Congratulations! Scored a 780. &amp;#x200B; I did find a typo in my exam and reported it to the staff. But other than that, headed out of there to buy my wife some flowers for leaving me stress free (kind of) for 2 weeks by letting me study and helping with the flash cards. &amp;#x200B; I can't speak too much about what was in the actual exam but I can tell you that you should definitely learn your ports and learn to read logs. And as CompTIA loves to do, this exam was almost all situational and not really definition based. But all these materials helped me get prepared for really drilling into the question they were asking. Pay close attention.. you have a lot of time with this exam so don't feel rushed. &amp;#x200B; My experience: I'm a SysAdmin and have been for around 5+ years. I currently work with the networking and systems side so I had experience with making ACL's and working with Syslogs. I also run my own MSP on the side for a few smaller companies and hope to expand in the coming years. I didn't know much about ITIL and NIST so I definitely learned a bit and will incorporate some of these policies."

386,cybersecurity,CompTIA,I passed Security+ today!,18,cx7znp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/cx7znp/i_passed_security_today/,2019-08-30 08:26:00,"This post is probably going to be similar to a lot of other posts on the sub but I still want to share my experience. I'm a cybersecurity major so I knew I would have to take the exam for a few years now, but I kept putting it off. It seemed like a lot of material to go through and I was having trouble figuring out how to put everything together, despite taking classes related to the subjects. Something about such a broad exam was daunting. I finally decided to buckle down and learn all the material at the beginning of July, so I studied for about 2 months. I got a new job in April where I have a lot of downtime and not a lot of supervision, so I spent most of my time studying there, about 1-3 hours a day, 4 or 5 days a week. The materials I used were all typical for the sub: * The exam objectives - I felt lost until I realized these were a thing. Having the material grouped into 6 domains made everything a bit clearer and helped me associate associate concepts with each other that I might not have connected otherwise * CompTIA Security+ SY0-501 Cert Guide (David Prowse) - This is what I started with but it felt a little confusing. I read (or at least skimmed) the whole thing and only really retained general knowledge. * Professor Messer's free videos - These were really helpful for some topics and less so for others. For example, it helped me understand IPsec and how public keys worked, but was too broad with authentication services. I only watched like half of the series too. * Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide (Darril Gibson) - I think this is really what made me pass. I didn't even know about the objectives list until after finishing the Prowse book, but I went through each objective and found the corresponding section in Gibson's book (in order of the objectives, not the book). I don't think I read every single section, since there were some objectives I felt comfortable on already, but it was a big help. * Udemy practice tests - These were the closest ones I found to the real test and were a bit of a confidence booster. * Pocket Prep - The questions on here can be kinda easy but it was helpful to have practice questions so easily accessible * Random practice tests online I was really stressing about it hard for the past few days, especially today. Honestly, I worried too much because the actual exam wasn't that bad. I felt pretty prepared while I was taking it, even if I was relatively unsure of about 1/3 of my answers (and flagged them along the way). I skipped the performance based questions like the subreddit suggests but I don't think it made too much of a difference. The practice tests actually prepared me for the performance based questions really well, so I felt pretty confident once I started them. I had 5 or 6 of them and 82 questions in total. I only had a couple times where I saw things (mainly answer choices) that I didn't recognize at all. The internet also made me worried about questions related to interpreting logs, and I had a few of them, but I was able to make educated guesses about what they meant and I don't think they're worth panicking over. I submitted my exam with 5 minutes left after going back through all my flagged questions and took the infamous survey before getting my score. Knowing that the survey was there beforehand helped me get through it without being too annoyed. I was pretty sure I got over a 700 but wasn't positive I passed. I finally made it to the final screen and I got an 817. There's absolutely no way that CompTIA scores based on percentage, because I definitely didn't get 90% of the questions right. In that regard, some practice tests might actually be harder than the real exam. The next step for me now is CySA+, which I joined an independent study course for and will take in December."

Spent about a month studying off and on. Used Professor Messer of course (Vids and Notes), Gibson's text and GCGA materials, and Dion's practice test. Dion's is the closest thing to the real test and getting those questions wrong helped me. I'd usually complete them in 30 mins and scores ranged from 72 - 84 on all six with only one 80+. Despite that I knew I was ready. My A+ expired in July, I work in tech, and I have a bachelor's in Cybersecurity.

Needless to say working full time and doing grad school takes up enough of my time let alone trying to squeeze a cert in as well. So heres my question: The exam all-in-one guide that Mike Meyers wrote contains both 1001 and 1002 information. I was kind of hoping to approach them one at a time because I am short on mental resources to remember everything at once at this time. Do you guys know of any chapters in specific that can be skipped for the time being given that I can come back to when i go for my 1002? Certain things like the installing Windows information and a lot of this user groups and permissions section seems like it would be a 1002 topic but I'm afraid to skip anything without hearing from other people first. Any help is appreciated!"

I also needed a certification to enroll at WGU. **CCENT** I started my certification goals with CCENT. This honestly took me about 6 months before i felt comfortable taking the test. I used CBTNuggets as my main source with the OCG and Lammel's Deluxe study guide. I took written notes while reading and watching material. I felt grasping information was very slow going, i Couldn't figure out why until i i took my next certification. Scored 844/833 **Network+** Scheduled my test two weeks out from when i passed CCENT, thinking material would be the same and i would have no issue. Used Mike Meyers' study guide along with ProfessorMesser on YouTube. Two weeks came and i still felt unconfident i extended the test out one week. I bought ProfessorMesser's course notes and used it along with the Exam objectives to make flashcards and only used that for 1 week. Scored 740/720 **Security+** Scheduled my test two weeks out from passing Network+. used ProfessorMesser and Mike Meyers study guide once again. I bought ProfessorMesser's course notes and used it along with the Exam objectives to make flashcards. FAILED with a 640/750. This was my own fault to be honest, i didn't spent nearly as much time studying as i needed to. Scheduled a retest two more weeks out repeating study material with a lot more hours. Scored 790/750 **A+ Core 1** I repeated exactly what i did for Network+ and Security+ but scheduled my test 1 week out from when i got Security+. Scored 710/675 **A+ Core 2** Gave myself another week repeating everything i had been doing.

I have been a long time lurker for this sub to help me study and decided to give my story. **Background:** I recently completed my undergrad with a degree in Digital Forensics and Information Assurance. During my time in undergrad I completed 3 entry level DFIA certifications. I have also been working in a entry level IT help desk/database development position at a government organization. In order to obtain a much needed promotion soon they requested I obtain the Sec+ 501 before the end of September. So I began studying. &amp;#x200B; **Studying Material:** GCGA Security+ by Darril Gibson GCGA Security+ Labs Professor Messer Security+ 501 Youtube Series Udemy CompTIA Security+ 501 Practice Tests by Mike Meyers Udemy CompTIA Security+ 501 Practice Tests by Jason Dion ExamCompass Security+ 501 Practice Questions &amp;#x200B; **Study Process:** I first began studying around 4 months ago by skimming through the GCGA book and creating a Quizlet for each of the acronyms that I saw. (Yes I know their was probably a easier way to obtain these) After I skimmed through the entire book and made a massive Quizlet I studied the Quizlet every day for about 2 hours. I did this for about a month for 2 hours a day with weekends off until I was completely confident, obviously if you do this on weekends and for longer you should be confident in about 2 weeks. After learning the acronyms I watched about 5 videos of Professor Messer on 1.25 speed each week and read the corresponding information on the GCGA book, I did this for about a 2 months. The final month of studying I ran through the GCGA chapter review questions, Examcompass, and all of the Udemy practice tests. At this point I was studying for roughly 6 hours a day, completing anywhere from 4-6 practice tests. At this time I was getting roughly 70-80% on all of the practice tests besides Examcompass where I was receiving 90%+. &amp;#x200B; **First Exam Time:** So the week before my first exam I was feeling confident, but my test scores were making me worry because they all stated you should be received around 85 - 90% to pass the exam. But at this point I told myself to stick it out and just do your best. The day before the exam I did not look at any material, besides creating acronyms to put on my test sheet to help me remember my Order of Volatility, OSI model, and Incident Response cycle. The next day my exam was at 10am and I arrived at 9:30. &amp;#x200B; As most people state when I first sat down I skipped the first 5 PBQ questions, and started the multiple choice. At about 10 questions all my confidence was thrown out the window and I believed I was going to fail. I finished the multiple choice with 45 minutes left. Started the PBQ's which were difficult but fair and finished with 20 minutes remaining. The last 20 minutes I went back and reviewed questions and changed answers. &amp;#x200B; I clicked submit, finished the awful survey (just wanted to know my score), and was heartbroken because I failed with a **736/750.** I was upset and immediately rescheduled my exam for two weeks away (today). &amp;#x200B; **Second Exam Time:** I studied my objectives (went through and explained them to my GF) and re-took all my practice exams. The night before my second exam I had test anxiety and studied until very late (I don't recommend this). Went in at 10 am to retake the exam and was so nervous I was shaking. &amp;#x200B; Did the same exact test process except this time I re-read the multiple choice 2 additional times. It surprised me that I had some of the same PBQ questions as the first time. &amp;#x200B; **Passed with a 778/750**. &amp;#x200B; **Recommendations:** Learning how to read the questions and completely understand what they are asking for. Learn ALL of the objectives. Learn your MDM (Mobile Device Management) Learn how to read logs (I struggled with this) Learn how to set up networks with secure configurations. (All of these I learned from using the GCGA Labs) &amp;#x200B; **Thoughts:** **Hardest test I have ever taken.** Even my other 3 DFIA certifications were not this hard and they were all performance based. Do I think I can stop a hacker, or protect a company all by myself? No. Do I think I can be an effective asset to a team with a leader to help guide? YES. I think this certification is a great for beginning a career and allows users to understand what a Cybersecurity team lead would be talking about. &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR - First take = 736, Second Take = 778. Hardest test I have ever taken. Great beginning cert.**"

Here are my study/experience notes for anyone taking the exam: As usual with most of my certification, my first location for information was Reddit for topics on the CompTIA CySA+ certification. I spent a lot of time researching for the best study materials other cybersecurity aspirants and professionals used and the one that populated the most was Jason Dion. I have to say his CySA+ videos are a great resource. I watched all of Jason's videos without taking notes because a lot of the information really builds off of Security+. So I was familiar with the terminology and technology in CySA+. I did some more research and made sure to purchase Mike Chapple and David Seidl Study Guide and Practice Tests. The study guide dug in deeper into Jason's videos and the practice tests really exposed you to the way CompTIA develop their exam questions. Here is a breakdown of my study plan: 1) I watched all of Jason Dion's CySA+ videos without taking notes. 2) I read the entire Mike Chapple and David Seidl's CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide and answered all the end of chapter questions. 3) I answered all 1000 questions from Mike Chapple and David Seidl's CompTIA CySA+ Practice Tests. 4) My next step was to find example of logs, attacks, and tools. I did not do too much hands on because the two books have a lot of data that cover these areas. You do need to know the different tools. This is very important! 5) I watched a Youtube video from ITProTv on Indicator of Compromise. I do not think this video is available on Youtube anymore but it was very interesting. 6) Re-watched Jason's videos and took notes in areas I was weak in. Here is what I recommend for people that plan on taking this exam 1) Research your weak areas. 2) Know how to recognized abnormalities. If you see .exe files on web servers you should be on high alert. Anything with John, &lt;SCRIPT&gt;, =, UNION SELECT. 3) Learn how to read firewall logs. 4) Learn the concept of everything in your studies. You need to know how to prevent attacks, ie. having backups to combat ransomware. This is a big issue some states and cities are facing. 5) You are not going to be able to remember test questions and expect them to be on this test. If you do, you will fail. Dumps are illegal so don't use them. I studied 1-2 hours a day for month and scored 782. Out of all my certification, CySA+ is the one I enjoyed the most and scored the highest. I truly do enjoy the defensive side of cybersecurity so I will continue on the blue team path for now. I have A+, Network+, Security+, Cysa+, and CISM in my portfolio. My next goal will be either GCED or GCIA. Happy studying everybody and good luck!"

Today ~~~~ I just passed my Sec+ tonight and thought to post. I enjoyably read all the other posts when people passed and read all the tips they offered. So if you have any questions, feel free to ask however, I don't think my results may be relevant to most people. I have a bit of experience with these certs from my community college days, as well as job experience. A lot of the material was bread and butter for me from my education and work place. Anyway here is a decent breakdown of my studying before the tests. I have been reading the Darril Gibson Sec+ book for a while and I actually did read all the chapters. However even when I read the book, it was review from my CC days. I am currently enrolled in WGU in the BS cybersecurity information assurance degree so all my cert fees were paid for which finally made me commit to scheduling and taking the CompTIA exams. WGU's provided study material for CompTIA is essentially Ucertify which I used. Additionally, I watched Prof. Messer's youtube videos on all the comptia exams on 2x speed and heavily skipped topics I knew. I mostly watched the videos I thought I understood the least. Also googling some topics to figure out how exactly how the things functioned together. A lot of topics are actually systems with multiple parts working together to do a particular service. Such examples are, DSL, PKI, Asymmetric encryption with private and public keys, Digital certificates, 802.11x, RADIUS(AAA), MPLS. All of those topics are multi part systems that have distinct names and functions. Drawing out a diagram with directional arrows helped me drill down wth these things are. ~~~ Sadly, 90% of the garbage I studied was not on the blood tests. I think a lot of the test follow the 80/20 rule ( may be closer to 70/30 ) where 80% of the content is really focused on 20% of the material. Therefore, the comprehensive study guides hitting every single topic is hardly ever relevant. Every time I left the testing center, I also felt that everything I studied was pretty much useless for the CompTIA exams beyond may be 20% of it. The main reason I was able to pass those tests, was because I have pretty decent fundamentals from working with all of these things for so long in school and work. I personally didn't take any practice tests that I could confidently say was similar to the actual test ( besides the one off questions where it was pretty much dead on. may be 5-6 per test ) Anyway, I completed all the certs and I plan to finish WGU by completing the SSCP, CCSP, CISSP, and probably dip into cloud with AWS. Those are the long term goals. My upcoming CompTIA cert is Project+ soon, so I'm, not entirely finished yet. ~~~ edit: I posted this pretty near my bed time. So if I don't reply quickly, it's probably because I passed out. I'll reply in the morning if there is any traction"

I recently caught up with a good friend who currently works in the field and recommended I skip A+ and Network+ and instead pursue Security+ since it's where my interest lie. My degree doesn't have us earning any certificates along the way and based on research I've heard strong arguments from both sides; you should get A+ and Network+ because it sets you up for a better foundation for Security+ vs. just go for Security+ because there have been plenty of individuals to do so without obtaining the previous two certs. I can see an argument about skipping the first two since a lot of my upper level classes cover the material that would be the foundation knowledge base in A+ and Network+. Thoughts?

Like many others have said, during the exam I felt like I was not going to pass. Even as I was doing the post-exam survey, I was sure that I'd see a fail message. My preparation for the exam starting with an associate's degree in Cybersecurity which included a Security+ course. That course used the Security+ book written by Mark Ciampa. I had another semester and a half of courses left and decided to wait until after graduating to take the CompTIA exam. That proved to be helpful as the other courses also helped with the Security+ exam. After graduation I used these resources to make sure I was fully prepared for the exam: Mike Meyers' Security+ on Udemy Jason Dion's Security+ practice exams on Udemy Darril Gibson's Security+ Study Guide (bought the Kindle version) plus a subscription to the extra content at [URL At first I was studying just an hour or two each day but in the last week I was spending six hours or more per day. I did the practice tests on all three, with Dion and Gibson's being the most useful. The practice tests allowed me to see which areas I needed to focus on more. All in all, it was worth spending the extra money on these resources."

I only had 7 full days to prepare because of work, illness and my laptop finally dying on me (RIP). True, it was the easier exam because you dont have to memorize anything as long as you understand most of the concepts. I spent most of my time understanding 1.0 with Professor Messer and Mike Meyers videos then breezed through 2.0 to 5.0 because Mike Meyer is really really good at explaining and keeping me interested. Felt really really relieved mainly because I dont have to waste my limited income on rushing another 902 or taking 1001 and 1002 lmao I spent a little time preparing for the 4 simulations people keep bringing up about the 902 but i only got 1 simulation about partitioning.  However, the Mike Meyers and Crucial Exams tests paid off because some of the questions (especially the more annoying ones) came out nearly word for word on the test. For sure i would have failed 902 if i didnt do the assessment tests because those were straight up curveballs to me. Idk if i can reveal the questions or not so anyone can PM me if they wanna know.

My test had like three simulations with 68 questions in total. I left the simulations to the end and answered all the questions and then went back before checking the multiple choice questions. I decided to take the test since I felt that Security + wasn't enough and to cover the DoD Certification requirements as I am primarily looking to get a job in the Federal Government, ideally in Information Security. I took almost all the allotted time and took my time reading the question carefully and eliminate obviously wrong answers. I have a master's degree in Information Technology Administration and Security. When I took Security +, which I needed for the job I had, I scored pretty high (probably around the 800 range). While the questions are worded tricky, I mostly found the test easy. I used the following: * CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Certification All-in-One Exam Guide - Fernado Maymi, Brent Chapman - Contains most of the basic information, but reading the book alone won't be enough to pass the exam. The simulator is inaccurate. * Pluralsight CySA+ (CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst) CS0-001 course * CySA+ (CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst) CS0-001 Transcender Practice Exams (Included with Pluralsight Premium) - I felt this practice test simulator is closer to the actual exam than the one included with the exam guide. It's included with some online training subscriptions for free in the higher tier. I don't study the answers for the questions I get wrong. I study the explanations. Eventually, I got average scores of above 90% * CySA+ Practice Labs - While not necessary, it will get you familiar with the tools mentioned in the exam guide, which is $100. If you have a powerful enough machine or a home lab, you should probably install some Windows Server 2016 virtual machines and install and run nmap, Nessus and other related tools mentioned in the study guide. Most of the software have free versions or a trial version. Also, spin up a Linux virtual machine, set up a firewall and then read the logs, which is usually located in the /var/log. I have a virtual private server that hosts my websites and such, so that is the source where I can get used to reading the logs. As for now, I probably going to take a break and continue my job search. Eventually, I plan to start studying for MCSA Windows Server 2016 next."

I am a 26 years old dude and I have been working as ""System Technician"" the last 4 years. I studied ""Higher Technician in Computer Network Systems Management"" is like an Associated Degree in USA or a Higher National Diploma in UK (Level 5 in ISCED). In my job I have worked with basic networking problems, troubleshooting Windows Server (DHCP, DNS, IIS), Help Desk, basic scripting, some database administration, deployement of virtual machines... My problem is I feel stuck doing a little of everything, which is cool, but I can't go deeper in nothing. Also another ""problem"" is the 80% of the time I am just troubleshooting the problems of my company's product (A reporting software) that we sell to our clients. I have thought in searching for a better job... But I thought... If you are going to search for another job... Why not trying to do something better and go for the next step. So, my first idea was to go for a bachellor degree but is out of my scope (Too much time and working I would spend years). That is the reason because some months ago I decided to go for the CyberSecurity Path through CompTIA. I have always liked CyberSecurity but I have never been able to focus in this path and I saw in CompTIA a good plan to learn about this. My goal is to get Network+ (To reinforce my knowledge in Networking), Security+ (To learn the basic of Security) and CSyA. I have my first test for Network+ in one week (And I feel positive about it) and then in the next few months I would like to get the Security+. With that I would like to start searching for a better job as CyberSecurity technician while I study for the CSyA. I just wanna share my plan with you guys and to say that even if you are confortable where you are working sometimes is good to boost yourself. I will update this post. First stop. Network+ :)"

So Im a transiting veteran who was trying to figure out what I wanted to do now that Im out the navy. So I decided I wanted to break into the IT field. I had no prior experience couldnt tell you the difference between a desktop and monitor. So I enrolled in LeaderQuest to get my ITIL, A+, Network+, Sec+ and used like 9 and half month of my GI Bill. (Not a fan of college) btw thats why I joined the service. Anyway long story less long I passed on the certs using test out and the professor messor study guides that was free the courses. Each course was a weeklong 5 days 8 hours. Methods for studying. ITIL - instructor led came with ebook. Material was so boring and dry wanted to poke my eyes out. Just studied the ebook wrote notes after each chapter and tried my best to memorize terms. Passed the test that Friday of the same week studied probably 2 hours at home. A+ - was a two week course broken into 1001/1002. Used testout the labs helped a lot the questions not so much. For 1001 I tried to watch professor messor and mike Meyers videos. I prefer Meyers because he broke the material down to a dweebie level for a newbie. Study for like 24 hours that weekend a tested that Monday and passed with a 675/900 by my Chinny chin chin lol(changed like 15 questions I had marked for review not a smart idea). 1002 to same concept used Meyers study that weekend and passed the exam that Monday night 735/900. This time I took apart my old desktop and actively touching all the parts, removing CPUs installing ram messing with the BIOS and all that good stuff. Network+ - used Jason Dion Udemy course what the videos, on 1.5x speed. Used professor messor study notes, subnetting in 7 secs on YouTube. Also testout labs was very necessary in understanding networks. Study for like a good week as afraid of subnetting. Passed the exam that following Thursday with 770. Only had like 5 subnetting questions was easy. REMEMBER PORTS #s and Acronyms. Security+ - only resource I used was Darril Gibson book and his app in the App Store. The book is really all you need he breaks down everything you need to know for the exams. I downloaded wireshark and virtualbox to get better understanding of concepts. I passed with 794/900. The test was actually easier than network+. I studied for like a week. I found all the topics interesting so I figure this aided in my ability to retain the knowledge. Darril Gibson was highly recommended from this tread. Know that Im down with everything I would say I probably couldve got this without LeaderQuest but ol well. I did all this in about 6 weeks. I got offered 2 DOD contractor positions that required no experience just a clearance and security+ one for $40,000 and another for about $42,000. (I have an active clearance) I declined both and I start the Microsoft MSSA for active duty and veterans program July 1. Im in the one focusing on CyberSecurity.

I passed Network+ 1.5 months ago with an 812, and will now begin my search for an entry-level role. With both of these exams under my belt, I have to say that CompTIA's exams are seriously frustrating. I knew the material inside and out for both exams, but like many others in this sub I felt like I had absolutely failed both of them before I hit submit. I studied for Security+ using Darril Gibson's GCGA book exclusively, wrote my own study guide based on that book, and by the time I went to take Jason Dion's practice exams on Udemy I felt very comfortable with the material and passed all of his exams with 85%+ in under 40 minutes. Fast forward to the actual exam, where I felt completely lost on over half of the questions, stumbled through it and somehow managed to pass with a pretty solid score. During the exam I was thinking that if I did end up failing I would have absolutely no idea how to study more, because I felt that I had a really firm grasp on all of the concepts already. Luckily I don't have to deal with that issue - but after Net+ and Sec+ I am perplexed by the methods that CompTIA uses to select their questions and format their exams. I had no real hands-on experience in IT/cyber before these tests, and am coming from a background of sales and marketing for big tech companies. I currently have a side-gig with an early-stage cyber startup in a project management capacity, and am now trying to figure out how I'll go about landing my first full-time gig in the industry. I'm going to start learning some Python (got the ""Automate the Boring Things"" book) while I job-search, and would appreciate any advice on getting that first role!

In your personal experience, are [Stackable Certifications](URL worth it for job hunting? 3. Would you recommend multiple CompTIA Security Certifications (CySA+, SASP+, PenTest+) over CEH? Is a matter of Diversification vs Specialization or there is a clear winner between them? Thank you for your time."

Background: 20+ years in IT and currently working in banking/finance. Used Mike Chappel's course on Lynda.com, Professor Messer's course on YouTube as well as his course materials. Test was difficult but I knew I had passed before pressing the submit button. Performance questions weren't actually that bad but I had flagged them and saved those for last before review. Wasn't required to take this exam as I did it for personal reasons. Cybersecurity is a national security issue and I want to do my part in helping keep everyone safe by having the ability to teach the public how do develop a good security posture. I want to thank all of you who have shared their insights and gave the community your knowledge. It's much appreciated!"
418,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed CySA+,62,c0ynlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/c0ynlz/passed_cysa/,2019-06-16 01:44:43,"Took and passed the CySA+ exam on my first attempt yesterday. The exam was more focused and with some hands-on work-type questions, not as many theoretical questions like the Security+ exam. I'm impressed by everyone who passes this exam with no work experience. I'm currently working in a SOC as an analyst, and some of these questions, even after reading the two textbooks I used, and the Jason Dion course, I don't think I would've known without the work experience. So, to everyone who's passing this from textbooks and videos alone, I am impressed. The textbooks I used were: [CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Certification All-in-One Exam Guide](URL [CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CySA+) Cert Guide (Certification Guide)](URL I would also recommend Jason Dion's course. It was useful to listen to while at the gym, or driving. If I could do it all over again, and if I was coming from a position of no work experience, I would invest in some practice exams too. Having only the end of chapter exams, the one provided by Jason Dion, and the All In One CD for (I think 25 simulation questions, and 100 multiple choice questions), I was feeling like I needed more. I didn't have much confidence going into the exam. Before the exam finished, I felt like I would pass, but just barely. I was surprised to have gotten an 821. The questions I got wrong, I'm pretty sure, were the questions I'm not necessarily concerned about while I'm working. For example regulations, who gets notified of what and when, etc. I'm confident I got the simulations correct; the hard part wasn't the problems presented but how they were presented. You'll spend a few minutes trying to read the question, and then work with the window space provided and the drag/drop, pull down, open, close, things you have to do to just understand the question."

I'm a IT undergrad and taking cybersecurity subjects provided much of the BG knowledge needed to help with this cert. I studied for about 2 weeks, 1-2 hours a night. ## Resources * Professor Messer videos throughout this period. Watched it whilst falling asleep, just daydreaming, or for some background noise. * Professor Messer course notes - used this for the last 1-2 days before exam * Udemy practice exams (Dion, Meyers) * Boson testing environment - Security+ * **Get Certified Get Ahead textbook** - would not have been possible without studying this resource ## Tips * I accelerated learning by handwriting my notes and then reading them back. A nice, inexpensive fountain pen with a dedicated muji notebook helped. * Flash cards for port numbers and common things to memorise helped * I used URL to help with interactive mix and match for encryption, hashes, ports etc. * I learn by doing so I did a lot of practice tests to get an idea of the type of questions. Went over what I got wrong and WHY I got that wrong. * Used Trello to organise study times, topics, priorities etc. * Pomodoro technique ### Thanks to the /r/CompTIA subreddit and their users for submitting fantastic resources and ideas to help prepare for this cert."
421,cybersecurity,CompTIA,"I hate exams, so I over-prepared and passed Security+ with 831. Long desciption inside.",110,c4x5y7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/c4x5y7/i_hate_exams_so_i_overprepared_and_passed/,2019-06-25 08:30:08,"It was my first attempt and I spent several months on/off preparing, with phases of daily study and more focused study during the last few weeks. &amp;#x200B; **THE EXAM** They gave me an erasable pad with a marker and the software has a calculator on it. I didn't have to use either one. I was given 83 questions. The exam was not as difficult as many made it out to be. This is either a result of being lucky with the questions I got or because I studied my ass off for a long time. Also, 80% of the questions were not too wordy or ""tricky"". I read every question twice and I read some 3-4 times if they had multiple ""clues"" in them. One PBQ took a long time, so I flagged it and came back to it, but the other 3 PBQ's were pretty quick drag-and-drop. I wasn't a fan of how the exam software was behaving with one of the PQB, because it kept going back to the question every time you closed one of the info boxes, so you had to relaunch the simulation every time, but it did save your work. I wasn't sure about my answers on 2-3 multi-choices, so I flagged them and came back, but aside from that, it was a fair level of difficulty. If you study, you will pass! Two questions were worded differently but had the same answer, which worried me, but I think my answers on both were correct (there's no way to know). Keeping an eye on time is important. I spent too much time on a few questions before snapping out of it and remembering to keep going (flag them). Also, while on the review page, you have to keep in mind that the clock is still ticking. Unflag questions you're done with so they're no longer flagged on the review page. I forgot to do that and returned to the same two questions twice. Some questions took 5 seconds, while others took longer. In the end, I had about 5 minutes left. I remained calm and took my time while keeping a good pace. When done, a survey comes up with about 8-10 questions. After that, it kicked me out of the software and showed a login prompt for the administrator and I didn't get to see my result until they printed it out at the front desk. I was thinking something happened and it was going to void everything or I was going to lose my work, but that's just how it worked at this place. You're not allowed ANYTHING in the exam room, but you can get up and take a break any time (bathroom, drink, snacks), but the clock keeps ticking. I think you can ask them to pause it if you need a longer break, but you can't have access to your stuff or leave the place, you can only go to the bathroom/kitchen. Cameras are watching. I wore the sound deadening headsets they had because other people in the room were making annoying noises. READ REVIEWS about the testing location (some locations sounded awful). I went with the best one in my area (clean modern facilities). They provide training, so they were open all weekend, so I went on a Sunday morning without an appointment and just walked in and was sitting at the exam in 10 minutes. I brought my voucher number and ID and left the rest in the car. Keep the printout they give you. Within 1-2 days, you start getting emails from CompTIA and Acclaim to register online with your ID. You can download your certificate and get digital badges for your resume and social media (LinkedIn). They mail you a certificate after you confirm your address in your profile on the CompTIA site (Must do or they don't mail it to you!). &amp;#x200B; **STUDYING** I followed the advice and study plans of others and it worked out well. I got the **GCGA (Gibson) book** and took about 70 pages of notes and did all the questions in the book. I went through all his blog links and labs. I installed Kali Linux in a VM and played around with the command line and other software. I got the GCGA app and did the questions, tests, flashcards. I used the app to review all the acronyms multiple times while on the treadmill or wherever I was waiting. The questions are almost all the same as the ones in the book, but the questions and acronyms list was helpful. I made my own port and protocol table on one sheet of paper and reviewed that several times. I mostly used spaced learned and a Pomodoro app to keep me awake and avoid burnout. I had bought the **Mike Myer's course** and exams on Udemy before getting the GCGA book, so I went through those videos. I found his mock exams too easy. The most annoying thing about Mike's videos is a volume variance between them; you're always messing with your speakers to get the setting right. I played through these at regular speed the first time, and later at 1.5x speed at the end of my studies just to review things I wasn't comfortable with. **Jason Dion exams** on Udemy were excellent and similar to the level of difficulty you will run into on the real exam. I learned a good amount from these. Remember that you should NOT go through the same mock exam more than 2-3 times, or you're just memorizing questions and answers. Of course, your studies would not be complete without **Professor Messer**. I didn't have much networking in my background, so I also went through all his networking videos and then the security videos. I also watched a few months of study group archives and bought his Security+ course notes (90 pages) which were good. Like Myer's videos, I then played some of Messer's videos that I needed to review at 1.5x speed. **EXAM OBJECTIVES** are important to review! When I was done with most of my studying, I went through every single objective and marked down what I couldn't explain to myself or what I didn't remember well. I had marked about 25 items and I also wrote down some things that were mentioned in this sub and studied up on those. I then went through those 25 items and took more notes about them. I had already taken notes on most of these from reading the GCGA book, but I needed more details on some of them to feel comfortable enough. If you haven't read the exam objectives and feel comfortable with everything in there, then I don't know how you're going to do it. They also listed the software and hardware you should be familiar with, which was helpful. Here's the thing, none of the resources just mentioned have all the answers or cover all the little details individually. They all played a part in filling in some of the gaps. Messer and Myer's have good graphics and their different styles may help you. The GCGA book is excellent and you should take notes, but I needed someone to show me and I needed to get hands-on with the command line. The Messer study groups added a lot of value in that I didn't feel alone and I could hear from others (people call in during the 2nd half) and calm my nerves about the whole thing. I'm the guy who said sucks at exams and I probably over-prepared out of anxiety. What helped me a lot is to **stop being intimidated by the amount of information** and to start organizing it in a way that put it all together, at least the things that need to be mostly memorized. Having it scattered over 100 pages of notes was not helping. I stopped being scared of it and that was the most important part for me. Here's something I had put together real quick, which helped me memorize and group things in a helpful way [URL &amp;#x200B; **Other resources I used:** [Imperva Learning Center](URL [OWASP Cheat Sheets](URL [Log Samples](URL [Examcompass](URL [URL [URL Wikipedia and Google search &amp;#x200B; I took the exam for a job requirement and I don't expect to be pursuing a career in security (I'm a software developer now), but it was good to learn about this stuff and I look forward to attending the live Prof Messer study groups and doing some CE activities."
422,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed the Net+ today!,4,c5fkk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/c5fkk0/passed_the_net_today/,2019-06-26 07:21:36,"It felt really hard and up until I hit submit (and went through the post-exam survey, so much suspense) I thought I could easily have failedbut I came out with a 872! **My background:** Mostly working in the service industry over the last few years, was hoping to move into IT/Security after taking programming, Linux SysAdmin, and cybersecurity classes at my local community college for the last year and a half or so. Last fall I took a course in computer networks (geared towards the Net+), the semester before that I took a course in Linux network admin (was over my head but I managed to pass), and over the last few semesters I've taken a lot of security courses. Together these gave me a relatively solid background but I was not very confident about taking the exam a month and a half ago. I also started an internship doing general IT helpdesk work at a local research hospital a couple months ago. Otherwise I have no professional IT background. I got a free voucher through my school and planned on giving myself about a month and a half to study. **How I studied:** I watched most of the Professor Messer videos and Mike Meyers videos on Udemy while taking down notes by hand. I have an insane-looking notebook filled to the brim with notes, scrap paper, and post it tabs now. If someone picked it up off the street they'd probably think I was trying to find the Zodiac killer. Periodically took a LOT of practice exams to test my knowledge: Mike Meyers's and Jason Dion's on Udemy as well as ExamCompass, KaplanIT (got these through my school), and some Pearson PBQ simulations I got through a textbook bundle from my community college class. This last weekend/yesterday I went over topics I was still struggling on. Was feeling pretty shaky since I couldn't get past the low 80's on the Dion practice exams. Yesterday I went through the exam objectives to make sure I had at least some understanding of everything. I also reviewed all my written notes and highlighted what I felt like I wanted to review in the last minute. Also, last night before going to bed I also put tabs on the notes I'd want to review right before going in. **The test:** Not going to say too much (you know, NDA and all), but I felt like a lot of it caught me off guard. The PBQs were a lot more involved than I thought they would be, and I imagined that I'd found plenty of places to get things wrong there. I was also surprised at how many questions there were on 802.11 wireless (especially wireless security), VLANs, VPNs, but in retrospect I think it was pretty well-balanced through the subject matter. Lots of phrasing that felt ambiguous throughout. I passed through all the questions within 55 minutes, then reviewed my flagged questions, then tried to review everything else before turning it in with 45 seconds to spare. **My takeaways:** Somewhere (I forget where exactly) I read to take the day before the exam off before studying. Maybe I was distracted the day before last because my gf's roommate had some salacious HBO dramas on in the background while I was studying, but in any case I don't think that would work for me. Going over my problem areas before taking the exam was key. Jason Dion's practice tests were really hard (for me at least), but helped me figure out what I had to learn. **What now?** I told myself I'd buy Breath of the Wild if I passed, so I did that right after leaving the testing center. That might keep me busy for a while. I think I may have a full-time job working help desk coming through at a local MSP (lots of tech companies in my city), so I'm looking forward to plying my trade and learning more there. If I get that job they may help me pay to take other cert exams, and other certs I'm interested in getting this summer include the Sec+, RHCSA/RHCE. I definitely need to learn more about Windows so I may look into a Windows sysadmin certification track toodoes anyone have any recommendations on learning Windows (especially AD) if I'm interested in moving from IT help desk toSysAdmin and Security? &amp;#x200B; **TL;DR:** Take practice tests, review the exam objectives, find your weak points and review those until you feel like you can't not get them right. Thanks reddit! This sub was super helpful in figuring out how to study and prepare for the exam"

TLDR Background: Enrolled in BaS program for Information Tech specializing in Cybersec, have A+, Net+, and Project+ already, and will be testing for Sec+, Linux+, and Cloud+ early August. Then in the following two terms, going to be more certs to test for. Currently I'm in a tech support role through a staffing agency in Tampa FL. My question honestly is should I attempt to get into a SOC position with having Net+? Or should I just wait until I at least finish our with Security+ before going hardcore in it. Will I stand a chance? I've seen most Cybersecurity gigs are looking for specifically security experience instead of just information technology, and the work I'm doing in Tech Support certainly isn't helping. Right now I'm revising my resume to be a bit more clean and concise, but I just wanted to see thoughts and get opinions of you all, who are in the field, as to what a good move might be. Thanks, sincerely."

It was significantly different from my first try, and it had double (4) the PBQ's, but I managed a 762 this time. I felt confident until I got to the end and used all but 6 minutes of my allotted time to review my answers. I did it, though! I obviously won't go into the details of the questions, but I will mention this: there was a question (not a PBQ) involving a Faraday Cage of all things. I read Meyers' entire N10-007 book and Messers' N10-007 series, among other study material, and I never read anything about a Faraday cage being used in a networking scenario. The question was pretty straightforward, but be prepared for that. I only really remembered it because played around with electromagnetic concepts in high school, and I've seen my fair share of Mythbusters. Thank you all for the constant encouragement and help!

It helped tremendously so I wanted to relay my experience for the people about to take it. &amp;#x200B; A bit of background about me: I have been in the IT field for over a decade and currently work as a Senior System Administrator. I have a couple years of experience in Information Assurance and about 5 years experience as a Network Analyst. I have a handful of other certificates and also have the Good for Life (GFL) Sec+ Cert from 2010 (SY0-201). However, my employer does not recognize the older versions of CompTIA test anymore and they wanted me to have the CE version. Since I already had the GFL cert, I was annoyed at first that I had to take this exam. However, I began to enjoy studying after realizing there was so much new information and so many things had changed since I last took it. I began to really enjoy learning the new material and refreshing the knowledge already known. Ultimately Im glad I was forced to take it again. &amp;#x200B; I scheduled the test 3 weeks out and studied daily non-stop with most of my free time either at work or at home. I cut out all entertainment and focused solely on studying and work. &amp;#x200B; In chronological order, below are the resources I used and highly recommend: 1. Printed SY0-501 Exam Objectives and referenced them non-stop throughout my study time. [URL &amp;#x200B; 2. I watched all (141) Professor Messer 501 videos on YouTube and watched his last few (archived) study sessions. I also rewatched a handful of the videos on subjects I was struggling to remember mostly pertaining to Authentication Protocols and PKI. &amp;#x200B; 3. I Read Darril Gibsons GCGA 501 book from cover to cover. Beginning with the Pre-Assessment Quiz and scoring an 81%. Then, after reading each chapter, I took the 15 question quizes. If I scored less than 93% I took note to re-read the chapter again after completing the book. In the end, I had to re-read Chapter 4 (Securing Your Network) and Chapter 10 (Understanding Cryptography and PKI). I ended up scoring 88% on the Post-Exam test and felt very confidant I understood the knowledge. The questions I got wrong in the Post-Exam were subjects I understood well, but just got stumped with a few Got-YA questions. &amp;#x200B; 4. I read the below blog and highly recommend the read as it gives you a little insight on the test itself and what to expect: [URL &amp;#x200B; I didn't bother with any performance based labs as I was pretty confident in doing hands-on items regarding the subject due to my experience, but I highly recommend others do some practice labs as there were a handful of PBQs I would have got wrong if not for my experience in IT. &amp;#x200B; As far as the test itself: I got a version with 82 questions in total with 5 Performance Based Questions (PBQs). I used all 90 minutes and flagged about 18 questions I wasn't 100% confidant in. Out of the 18 flagged questions, I had the answer narrowed down to 50/50 and answered the question before flagging and moving on just in case I ran out of time I at least had an answer. After I was finished, I had about 10 minutes to quickly review the flagged questions. I left all of them the same and only changed the answer to 1 question. I would say the PBQs were probably the easiest of all the questions. I initially planned on skipping them and going back to them, but since they were pretty easy for me I answered every question in order. There were a ton of questions concerning the output of logs etc. and honestly don't think I would have passed if not for my experience as a Network Analyst. I highly recommend others search for several output examples and fully understand them before taking the exam. During the test, as others have mentioned, I felt I was failing the entire time. Just keep faith and keep calm as you might be doing better than you think. After I hit the submit button, I was sure I had failed but got greeted with congratulation screen after taking their survey. &amp;#x200B; Again, thanks to the community and good luck to those about to take the test."

Passed my Network+ exam with a 762 (by the skin of my teeth!) after some serious freak out time both before and during the test. Seriously - that was rough. Not just the test itself but the lead up to it were really nerve-wracking. I am happy I dont have to do it a second time. Ive never had to take a certification type test and that tripped me out a bit. I found this forum really helpful in my prep so I wanted to contribute to it. **- Previous experience?** None. I am switching fields and the cybersecurity company I am applying for ""highly recommends"" entry-level hires have this certification. **- Study time and materials?** I work full time, am in school full time, and have to have some semblance of a social life or else I explode like a bottle of shaken up champagne. I studied ""leisurely"" for roughly 2 months and then ramped up the studying in the last month - so roughly three months total. I bought (and read in its entirety) the Mike Meyers book and then enrolled in the Jason Dion Udemy courses/tests about a month or so ago. I also took the Mike Meyers ""Total Tester"" practice exam that came with the book and used Exam Compass. I watched a handful of Professor Messer videos. I should have gotten the Udemy courses earlier and like many posters HIGHLY recommend using study material from multiple authors. The Jason Dion tests prepare you for how to read the exam questions, and this was invaluable. While nothing I took was insanely similar to the test itself, learning to read the questions is over half the battle IMO. The ExamCompass questions helped me with rote memorization which was useful in eliminating obvious wrong answers. **- Test experience?** Like a lot of people who post here I was convinced I was going to fail about halfway thru and started planning my retake. I had 4 simulation questions and 2 of the 4 were insanely rough and I was unprepared for. The simulations were MUCH more involved than I thought they would be. I had a very small amount of questions on straight up subnetting - like many others I feel I overprepared for this. I had lots of questions on record types for some reason. I overstudied cabling. I understudied VLAN's. My number one piece of advice would be to memorize not just the ports but how they work in conjunction to troubleshooting. \-**Overall?** This actually gave me insane amounts of test anxiety. I had to force myself to eat a half piece of toast and a half banana because my nerves just ran roughshod on my body for whatever reason and I hadnt even been hungry for the half day leading up to the test. I kept remembering what my family had told me, that I can always take it again. I repeated it to myself over and over again and that helped. I still was super nervous before and during, as many people have written going ""rote memory"" will only get you so far. Im happy I passed and will be drawing up my resume in the next week :) &amp;#x200B; Best of luck to everyone who is taking this! Thank you to everyone who has posted on here who helped fill in a lot of the blanks about what this experience would be like."

WOOHOOO!!! Background - I'm a 40-ish yo single mom of 2 tweenies, full-time caretaker of my elderly mother and full-time student at WGU (Network Ops and Security). I only have book-knowledge experience in IT, having graduated from my local community college in December with 2 degrees - CIS / Cybersecurity - but no hands-on or work experience besides being Ms. IT Fix-it for my whole family. I also have never sat for an IT certification before, so all this Comptia testing experience was new to me! However, I'm hardheaded and driven (and have a good chunk of time on my hands right now), so when I started with WGU 4 months ago, my goal was to slam out one test each month. My mentor was wary of my plan, but when I scored 820+ on my A+ 901, he got with the plan and pushed me to keep to my timeline. I mainly used information sources outside of WGU's curriculum - udemy, Messer, books, online and book-based practice tests. I'd read through the material and watch the videos, taking notes with the objectives in mind. Once I had swallowed all of that information, I'd start taking practice tests/questions online and in books. Running through the questions would give me an idea of the information that was important and I'd make a list of things I needed to review. The most important thing with practice questions is not just know what the answer to the question is....but knowing what all the other options are about. So a question on WiFi standards might include answers that pertain to network routing too. I'd look them all up and include them in my notes if I didn't know what they were the moment I saw the term / acronym. 2 weeks before the test, I'd turn that list of unknowns into a study guide / cheat sheets (by hand, usually in a notebook). This is when I'd start looking through Professor Messer's notes and the exam cram book's cheat sheet and chapter summaries and see if there was anything that didn't look familiar and include it into the study guide. This guide went into my purse so I could study while on the go. All this time, I'd continue going through various practice exams, google and review, and expand my study guide. By the next weekend, I'd be ready to trim down the study guide. I'd rewrite it, including only the things that I felt I still needed to review. And yes, I'd keep on the practice questions.... This would continue - rewrite / reorganize the study guide, review more questions, google things I was iffy about, all them to the guide - until the day of the test. Usually a day or 2 before the test, I'd be so sick of the material, I couldn't make myself study even if someone put a gun to my head. I'd get to the ""Just let me take the @#$#@ test already!"" point. But I'd still read through my study guide morning, noon and night. So glad this craziness is behind me but thrilled that I made my goal of completing the Comptia Triad on time! I still have a couple months left of my semester, but I plan to stay far far FAR away from certification classes. My poor brain (and body and eyes) need a rest from all that stress. The hardest part of the tests....trying to not FLY through the demographic questions at the end because I just want to see MY FREAKING SCORE!!!! AUGH!!!! The second hardest part....not screaming with joy when I saw my score and realized that I'd passed. A HUGE thanks to everyone that leaves study tips and help on this subreddit. Every time I started on a new test, I'd come here and check to see what the latest feedback was. Many times, it quelled my fears. A few times, you guys stressed me out! But it was nice to know that I wasn't alone in this craziness."

My background is 5 years in IT, Sec+, MTA-Sec, secure|set HUNT program, current Network Admin (glorified tier 2 help desk) for the last 5 months. Study material used: \- CompTIA CertMaster Practice - 6.5/10 - I don't remember getting many if any questions on logs. Not sure if it was worth $200 due to no PBQ's or any detailed log questions like are on the test. \- CBT Nuggets - 5.5/10 - Too much scribbling on the screen which made it hard to follow. The CySA+ course is only 7 hours of material and the related course material through Kaplan is laughable. Luckily, my work has a subscription. \- Sybex Official Book - 9/10 - Skimmed it and only used it as a reference. I'll go back and actually read it now... \- Jason Dion CySA+ Udemy course and practice test - 8/10 - I like his style of teaching and it's easy to follow. Admittedly, I've only done 1 practice test and only scored a 75%. \- LinkedIn Learning/CySA+ - 9.5/10 - I only found this a few days ago and which I had found it sooner. The Course is taught by Mike Chapple, which is who writes the Sybex official books for most cybersecurity exams. Got it free through LinkedIn Premium (which is free for vets) I looked for CySA+ related logs the last couple days, but came up short. I had a ton of server, firewall and ACL log questions. It definitely exposed my weakness. Giving myself less than 2 weeks before a retake. Any tips or log material will be appreciated."

I pretty much used what everyone else used: * GCGA book * Jason Dion Udemy course and Practice Tests * Professor Messer videos * Various practice tests from the net . * Studied a INFOSEC Comptia Security+ PBQ tests pdf that someone provided in another post. An excellent resource for PBQs * I had purchased the SYO-401 Udemy Mike Meyers. I would play that in the background while I was working. &amp;#x200B; 82 questions..with I believe 5 pbqs. Was a really hard test. I can't remember much. I do remember looking at logs to see what happened and should know your acronyms. Like others that mentioned here, I thought for sure I was going to fail the test. Some of the questions were easy, a bunch difficult, some couldn't figure out the best answer for, and it seemed like there were a few that none of the answers seem to fit! Like most people say you have to weed out the ones that are definitely wrong and use your best judgement. Mark the ones that are difficult and go back to them. I went back and changed at least a handful after marking/rereading the questions. Then that dreadful survey uggh.

There's all sorts of openings but most positions seem to require 3-5 years experience so I'm caught in that old issue of how do I get experience? Been looking mostly at glassdoor.

I'm thinking about brushing off my programming skills (particularly C#/.NET) and jumping back into that arena. I don't particularly relish the thought of getting back into programming, but it pays better than a help-desk position which seems to be the only Cyber related position I can get into (I've found that you just about have to come from a NOC background to get into Cyber Security; you'd think software developers would make excellent forensics experts). Quick background. B.S. in Engineering majoring in Electronics Engineering Technology. I spent 15 years as a Software Engineer/Developer (mostly C++ and related Object Oriented Programming technologies dealing with back-end communications/protocols). Last 15 years I have spent running my own part-time Computer Repair/Malware Removal shop. About 1 year ago I wanted to do something different and more exciting so I thought moving into Cyber Security would be a nice parallel move. I have certifications in Security+ (April 2018) and CySA+ (October 2018) and am studying for PenTest+ right now (though with little motivation at this point). I have been looking for employment for a year now with no luck. I either lack Top Secret clearance or actual large enterprise NOC experience. I've been avoiding the help-desk as that is what I am bored with right now and it wouldn't give me any knowledge that I don't already possess, and I feel over-qualified. I do have a job offer on the table for around $20/hr for running around to military personnels' homes to fix issues. It would give me Interim Clearance which would be a step towards Top Secret clearance. But at my age, I don't know if I can start at low-wages doing help desk support/technician roles. I was hoping to jump right into a mid-level Analyst position, go for the CISSP in a few years and be rolling. This help-desk offer won't even apply towards the years required for CISSP. &amp;#x200B; I personally feel Cyber Security in the USA is a flipping (&lt;--substitute your own word there) joke and all these articles about the shortage of Cyber Security experts and the salaries they can expect is a total scam (including all the hype to go along with many of the certification offered).

For studying I used the Sybex and Pearson IT books and practice tests: URL URL I also used Jason Dion and XpertSkills videos: URL URL Jason's videos were a nice overview but for a lot more hands on and in depth the XpertSkills videos were the way to go.

Here's my review and advice.,58,bhho0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/bhho0k/passed_cysa_today_heres_my_review_and_advice/,2019-04-26 13:25:24,"**TLDR**: Passed with 828. Used Dion's Udemy course and Sybex practice test book, about 5 weeks total study time. I'm a web developer doing DoD contract work, and had Sec+ and CEH alrady. Details below - I hope they help! # Study Resources My primary source of study was [Jason Dion's Udemy Course](URL and review of my own notes on the course for about a month. For an additional week I went through about half of [CompTIA CySA+ Practice Tests Sybex Book](URL Jason's course was great for covering the exam objectives to create a good core knowledge core, but I found all the extra stuff covered by the Sybex book gave me an edge. The book covers lots of tools, Linux commands, specific EA framework trivia, and plenty more things you *probably* won't see on the exam BUT each new bit of info expands your knowledge base a little further and gets you in the mode of thought to analyze all the scenarios the exam will throw at you. See something you don't know? Look it up, write it down. I ended up doing 100 questions from each domain, plus the 2 practice exams -- scoring anywhere from 75 to 85% in the domains and \~80% overall. # Exam Details and Thoughts Definitely a big step up from Sec+. Difficulty comes from a heavy emphasis on analytical skills and informed judgment calls. *A lot* of the exam requires you to know both attacker concepts, techniques, and tools, so the knowledge I had from my CEH was instrumental. Makes sense, right? To analyze results of attacks, you need to know how attacks work, AND how to respond to them according to standardized procedure. I know you're probably reading this to learn what to possibly expect, so for your reading pleasure... ** Spicy (ethical) details/advice, based on my experience:** So the PBQs I rolled had drag-and-drop, clicking on things to view reports and logs, etc. -- the usual CompTIA stuff. I'll ask you some questions based on the ones I had: * *Can you identify malware beaconing on one or more network hosts based on traffic analysis AND apply one or more effective firewall rules to block it?* * *Can you identify potential malware on one or more hosts in a network based analysis of individual host processes and their network activity?* * *Can you effectively analyze vulnerability scan reports for multiple network hosts, identify false positives, AND recommend appropriate remediation for true positives?* * *Can you identify what services and applications that network hosts might be running solely based off vulnerability scan reports, AND identify false positives based on your identification?* As far what you should make sure you're solid on overall: * Know all your commonly-seen ports instinctively; no-brainer. Service port knowledge was central to *all* my PBQs. * Get good at identifying suspicious entries and patterns in stuff like vulnerability scans, firewall logs, traffic capture, netstat, procmon, etc. * Get good at making educated judgment calls based on incomplete info in scans, configs, logs, etc. For example, how can you differentiate between a DNS, web server, or file server if their running services are almost all the same? Can you tell a false positive from a true positive in a scan report if the vulnerability isn't obvious or the report doesn't have all its sections? * Know your NIST SPs [800-30](URL [800-61](URL [800-86](URL [800-88](URL [800-115](URL and [800-150](URL processes and standard terminology. Know how to *apply* them, because that stuff most definitely shows up a lot on the exam. * Know your [detailed exam objectives](URL Pay special attention to gaining basic familiarity with all the laws and regs (HIPAA, FISMA, PCI-DSS, etc.) and frameworks in Objective 4.1, and the tools listed in Objective 4.5. ## My Background I'm a front-end web developer by trade, currently team lead/senior engineer on a team doing non-security DoD contract work. About 10 years' experience; nothing purely security-related. Prior certs are Security+ (last renewed 2016) and [CEH](URL (v9, obtained 2016). ## Why CySA+? My team is currently serving the second iteration of a contract, set to recompete for the third iteration later this year. Going from iteration 1 to 2, my position's description was changed to include Security+ and CEH because a single instance where we thought we might need to run Fiddler on the NIPRNet for a task \\\_()\_/. For 2 going to 3, those two were changed to be [DoD 8570](URL baseline certs for IAT Level II and the CSSP roles minus Manager, so I figured I'd get CySA+ to renew Sec+ too. Also not really a fan of EC Council in general, and I'd rather have a CompTIA cert. My CEH expires this fall with 0/120 CEUs -- was planning to retake it, but not for the new $1200 price tag... *maybe* I'll try to get 80 more units (CysA+ will give 40 IIRC) in the 1 year period I'll have after it expires, but who knows."

Background: I'm about to graduate with a BS in CS concentration in cybersecurity. The test itself wasn't difficult, but very tricky. It's more vague than Dion's practice questions. During the exam, some of the questions felt out of context, which made me feel like these were the ungraded questions. Some advice I recommend is to understand all abbreviations. By knowing what thinks stand for, this will help you eliminate 2 or 3 choices right away, leaving the correct answer. The PBQs were extremely tough, none of my resources prepared me well for it, neither did Dion's. My next cert is likely to be CySA."

I am currently going to a community college and aiming for my Associates degree in Cybersecurity and Network Technology. I have also spent the last five years in fast food and retail so I have no real world job experience in IT. I've built two PCs (one for gaming and another for basic office productivity). I have been looking to break into IT and found that the Comptia A+ certification seems to be the go to cert for an entry level desktop support job. I was thinking of studying the A+ over the summer break but I have also considered that the CCENT may be a better choice for a first time cert. I wanted to get your opinion as to whether it would be better to study the A+ first and then the CCENT later or should I just skip the A+ all together and jump to CCENT?

In June I got my A+, in December I got Net+ and now finally (the last day of april actually), I achieved the Sec+ exam. My plan all three times was the same. Pay 10$ for the Mike Meyer's course on Udemy. That was always a good introduction to the major concepts for me and Mike is not as dry as other instructors out there. He likes to keep it light. Then I'll watch Prof. Messer videos on youtube on the topics that I am having troubles with. His videos seem to go more in depth, and cover more information, but they are denser. Usually I would watch a video a couple of times to let every thing sink in. Also through out my day, I would use various apps to take quizzes and keep my mind sharp on the subject I was studying. I found great study guides on here for the A+ and Net+, but with the Sec+ I buckled down and bought the Messer notes. They were well worth it! &amp;#x200B; Now, I'm not really sure what to do. My first thought was to go after a CCNA (I see lots of job postings with this as a requirement or a preference), but also I have been leaning towards cybersecurity, since I just took the test and it seems to be an emerging market. I live in a midsized southern metro and I have seen only a handful of jobs that are in that field (which means if I can get a cert now, I will be in demand)."

I hope you can find some of the following insights useful in your learning process: &amp;#x200B; I would say for the two years I have occasionally browsed this subreddit out of curiosity. When I did browse this community, I often was taken by surprise to see both sides. Some testimonies here are very inspiring with the great news of passing, while others claim how tough the exam was. In all honesty, I thought CompTIA certifications were easy to get... Do a little studying and preparation and you have a certification on your resume. I was wrong. Even though I did pass on my first time, the fear of failing was very strong. After clicking that ""submit"" button this morning, I was fearful that I would fail. This brings me to my first very important note. &amp;#x200B; Even though it sucks to fail: It's a learning opportunity. Regardless of outcome, whether you pass or fail, you learn. You leave the testing center the same person as when you entered. It's a matter of taking the experience and using it as a learning opportunity. What matters is the learning opportunity. If you are ACTUALLY learning, then you are winning, regardless of results. You can put in the effort. You can't directly control the result. I have learned that it is about learning, rather than trying to simply say ""Look I am CompTIA Security+ certified."" This is a lesson I learned, I hope this can be insightful for you. &amp;#x200B; Background: Just turned 19 years old, college freshman majoring in ""Cybersecurity"" (I know already, I will get some flack for that seemingly ""trendy"" degree, in which I would agree to some extent). I have had one summer internship that dealt with the Information Systems Security Management side of I.T. security. Little to no ""hands-on"" experience. Resources Used: * [Darril Gibson's Book - ""Get Certified, Get Ahead"" Book](URL * [PluralSight SY0-501 Security+ Course](URL \-&gt; Created my personal [Quizlet Flashcards](URL Set after every module * [Professor Messer's Security+ Study Group Live Replays](URL * One of Udemy's VCE Collective Exams (with over 300 questions) * [Exam Compass Practice Tests](URL * Quizlet Flashcards &amp;#x200B; I started studying January 1st, 2019 for the exam, starting with the PluralSight modules, then worked my way into Darril Gibson's book while listening to Professor Messer's Live Replay Groups while exercising and commuting. At the very end I used the VCE collective exam using a few Exam Compass Practice Tests. I would say this best advice I would give someone who just started is to break it up. I averaged around 45 minutes to one hour a day of FOCUSED studying, reading, listening, etc, while listening to those live replay groups. The Pressure was on for Me: I have a small YouTube audience of 10k subscribers who I announced that I would be taking the certification the first day I started studying -&gt; I had some pressure on me while I was studying haha! I hope this all helps for those of you who are just starting, are one day away from taking the exam, or who are curious how I did it. Look at it this way, you are learning! "

461,cybersecurity,CompTIA,10 terrible days of studying - I passed the Security+ SY0-501 today,31,b3spwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/b3spwx/10_terrible_days_of_studying_i_passed_the/,2019-03-22 03:37:48,"With 10 days of study, I took the Security+ SY0-501 today and passed with a 775. Its not as high as I wanted, but its still a passing grade. After the first 5 questions I felt like I was over my head and was going to have to retake it after studying way more than I did. **My background:** - 3 years on a Service Desk - 1/2 year on an operations and network team - 1/2 year of field support - 1 year of Identity Management and Access Management - 1 year and counting on a new Security Operations team (no tier system, so we do a wide variety of things) - Current full-time student working towards a Bachelors in Cybersecurity **Materials Used:** - Pocket Prep Security+ - This was good for general knowledge and identifying pain points. These are not great for preparing for test wording. Id recommend it for on the go studying on mobile devices and just hanging out at your computer - CompTIA Security+ Cert Prep by Mike Chapple (Lynda)  These videos were great to get a good working knowledge of how everything works. I ended up writing down a lot of things to learn for the future. I highly recommend this resource if you have access to a Lynda account (Library card usually covers that) - CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead by Darril Gibson  This was the final material and I wish I would have started with this. I was confident in my abilities until I cracked this book open. It unleashed the biggest feeling of uncertainty and I am so glad I had this resource! **How I studied:** I was an idiot and started a lot later than I should have. I blame most of that on my procrastination tendencies, but I also was focusing on my schoolwork at the time. I figured since I work in the field, I should be mostly fine, but that was not the case. I purchased the pocket prep app about a year ago with the intention of studying on and off when I had a moment, then I forgot I had the app. On the first three days, I spent all my free time watching the videos by Mike Chapple and using Pocket Prep to focus on the domains I just learned about. I took so many notes that my hand hurt after that time. The videos continued up to day 6. On Day 7 I cracked the book and was so overwhelmed by what I was going over. The questions in that book are worth looking over in detail. Day 7  9, I spent my time taking every chapter review quiz, then noting what I missed and looking in the text to review it. I was hitting between 50% - 80% on the quizzes and that was not okay. I ran to the store on day 8 to buy beer and my favorite Gin (Monkey 47) as a potential reward if I passed. When I was at the store, I couldnt mentally function because I had crammed so much into my brain. The guy at the checkout gave me look of concern, then asked if I was okay. Once I said I have done nothing but study, he understood since he was a student. **Exam Day:** Welcome to today. Welcome to what I thought was going to be the beginning of a long, miserable weekend. Im normally fairly optimistic, but I was not feeling it today. I woke up at 6:30AM and cracked open the book one last time and took the post-book exam and scored a 73%. I wasnt feeling good about it, but I ran out of time. During that exam, I had 2 cups of coffee, 2 cans of soda water, and some water (didnt think that one through). I showered and went to the testing center sign-in area and almost got denied because I didnt read the email saying what info I needed. Thankfully for some reason I had an extra identification item in my wallet, but I was in full panic mode and the lady could visibly see I was terrified, thankfully I had what I needed for some reason. (READ YOUR CONFIRMATION EMAIL) **The Exam:** I answered the questions as best I could, but I felt like I was getting a lot of things wrong and was becoming increasingly more worried. At the halfway point, all the liquids I drank before coming to the testing center tried to rush the door and I was doing a potty dance in my chair for the last half. The last half of the test was items I was more familiar with, so that helped me as I increased my speed to not pee myself. I finished my test, completed my survey, and saw I had passed. I passed? Holy crap, I PASSED! I walked out of the testing area to the front with a big smile on my face, still on the verge of peeing my pants, but at that point, I could have done it with no shame. **What I would do differently:** - Take better notes - UNDERSTAND EVERY ACRONYM : this helps with weeding out answers that dont fit - Start studying earlier and start with the book, not the videos or app - Dont drink so much liquid before the exam - Find additional study materials These last 10 days were miserable, but now its done and I have a certification. Dont study last minute like I did and dont think you will be fine because its your job. Anyone looking to take the test soon, I wish you the best of luck! "

I'm now officially A+ certified! For studying I watched Mike Meyers' course on LinkedIn Learning (formerly lynda.com) and Professor Messer on YouTube. I didn't purchase a textbook but I did buy Professor Messer's PDF notes from his website and also bought Meyers' practice exams from Udemy - these resources were both assets to me in passing the exams. I also used the Pocket Prep app for practice questions, but Meyers' practice exams were the single best resource for gauging what areas of weakness I needed to go back and review. I printed out the exam objectives for the 902 and used it as a checklist for all the material I needed to cover. I wish I would have known to do that for the 901 as it would have prevented me from being blind-sided on a couple of questions. There were no surprises for me today, just a few questions that I wasn't totally confident on that I flagged for review. As far as test day prep goes, get a good night sleep, eat a healthy breakfast on the morning of the exam, flag the PBQ's and save those for the end of the exam. I didn't flag the PBQ's to save for the end on the 901 and nearly ran out of time, but I did that today and finished comfortably with about 8 minutes to spare. I intend to get my Network+ and Security+ certs sometime later this year, but next for me will be the GRE! I'm going to apply for an online M.S. in Cybersecurity program. The A+ is only the first step in my journey. :D"

I picked it up again about 6 weeks ago in my new term and started studying diligently once again and passed with a score of 788! Here were my methods I used: 1. uCertify - All Labs, all chapters, labs, post assessment and all practice tests - I waited until I averaged between a 85-90% before I felt comfortable 2. Examcompass.com practice tests - I did all 25 and when completed averaged my scores out. Since I averaged 90% I felt that was enough to feel confident. 3. Professor Messer videos - Did not purchase the course notes, but paused and took some of my own as I reviewed them. 4. Pocketprep app for mobile - Purchased the deluxe version and ran through the entire 600 question set 2 times over. Both times I was hovering between 88% and 90% on each 100 question exam I attempted. Altogether in my second stint of trying to get certified I spent about 10-15 hours a week studying (I am a perfectionist and hate failing anything). Scheduled the exam weeks out to motivate myself to study more especially as the exam date neared. I hope this helps! On to my Sec+ next.

Study materials used: Professor Messer. He is the messiah. Couldn't get into Meyers at all. watched a bunch of messer videos on youtube and annotated the exam objectives as I followed along with his lectures. I bought the Certmaster for the net+ and it is so utterly worthless that I should have demanded my money back. They are beyond atrocious. Never, ever ever ever ever buy certmaster for anything ever under any circumstance. Seriously. lab sims: Try to apply as much of the material as you can. Get your hands on this stuff. You will retain so much more knowledge by actually applying the concepts than just reading from a book or listening passively. I enjoy Boson lab sims, but I only used it for the Net+ because I felt so utterly scammed out of my certmaster money that I wanted to find a better alternative. Boson is nice and I highly recommend it. Obviously, spend time in the command line, spend time in terminal, download and use as many programs as you can: wireshark, nmap, zenmap, kali linux distro, etc etc etc. If Messer mentions it in any of his videos, try to at least become briefly familiar with that particular program via usage. Employment: I haven't really seen an uptick in personal interest in me as a potential employee. Employers honestly don't seem too interested in ""the trio"" or my stackable cert title of ""comptia secure infrastructure specialist"" But it hasn't been long that I've had them all done, so maybe i'll update this later. &amp;#x200B; General takeaways: Eh. I definitely know more than I did prior to passing these exams. I don't regret taking them. That being said, I still suffer from imposter-syndrome. If I landed a sysadmin role tomorrow, I would be shaking to my core because I feel so woefully unprepared to actually produce anything of value in the real world. The exams have given me a great foundational knowledge of general hardware, software, networking and security concepts, but that is all. A very broad familiarity with a great deal of content. At the very least I know what kind of questions to ask when I get into the type of role i ultimately want to fulfill. More than half of the battle to finding answers is being able to ask the right question, and that IS something that comptia is able to provide, I think. &amp;#x200B; You will not be a network engineer from the Net+. You will not be a cybersecurity analyst or expert with the Sec+. You will have a vague, general understanding of the state of those two fields upon completion of the certificates, which I do think is valuable. I initially started my IT studies with the CCNA and it felt WAY too focused. I couldn't shake the feeling I was ""missing something"" by being immediately taught the OSI model and then diving into setting up VLANS and subnets. I can definitely appreciate having the ""higher-level"" vendor-neutral perspective on these topics, and I can now resume my CCNA studies without the feeling that I'm not understanding the greater organizational context in which I am creating and troubleshooting network architecture. So Yeah, I don't know if that helps anybody at all, but I hope so. I don't mind answering questions about any of my ramblings and I'll try to help the best I can. I failed at being brief. Sorry. "

I cut off Facebook and as many distractions as I could, and used the printout they gave me of what I missed questions from, matching up to exam objectives, to study where I was weakest. I took the exam again yesterday, got to the end thinking I was going to fail again, and my heart skipped a beat when I saw the just-barely-passing mark. (Btw, CompTIA, why in the world do you not give the score BEFORE making us fill out the damned survey?) Good luck to anyone else taking it!"

As the title says I am looking to make a career change at 26 years old. I have been a high school teacher for three and a half years now and realize I dont want to be in a classroom 25+ years from now. I have always been interested in computers and IT type work. My future brother in law has been trying to help me find all types of different work and just called me yesterday about a job opportunity working entry level Cybersecurity. He told me the only thing I would need is to get A+ certified and sent me a link to UMBCs course listings for obtaining A+. After looking around and discovering this sub I want to take the self study route and save the three grand I would drop on the class. Is this a good idea? I dont have IT experience but I have basic knowledge of how computers and phones work. The part I feel I lack most in is networking and hardware areas. I have been job hunting for about exactly a year and this has been the most promising lead yet so I really dont want to screw this up. Thanks for any advice you all can spare.

But first... Passed Network + in October 2018. Failed the first attempt for Security + 501 in November 2018. Today I passed with a score of 752. Reminder: Passing Score: 750 My score: 752 I had about 4 minutes left after completing all questions. I went back to about 6 flagged questions. 3 of them were the performance-based questions that I just wanted a second look for. The others were just some questions I was not really sure about. I believe I made one change in my answers. I'm super relieved and I'm glad it's over. After submitting my test and review. I had to again go through the survey as to gripping the side armrests of the chair just hoping to see a Congratulations you passed. But after what it seemed like 20 screens. I got my congrats page. And I was like wtf! Has anyone ever gotten my score or lower? I must admit after failing my first attempt it really took me down with not really knowing how to get back up and give it another stab again. In January I started my Cybersecurity journey in school and was really just focusing on my classes. Still, work full time and this certification were just hanging over me waiting for me to pass it. How I studied: I was using the Security + videos from CBTNuggets which really helped. But this was done before my first attempt. Did not really feel like going over the whole course again. My school gives us access to Lynda.com and that's the route I took for my training for my second attempt. I really ground down videos. They have 6 modules kind of mirroring the 6 domains on the test. I really liked this way of studying. I did a bunch of practice exams. Practice exams from GTSlearning.com and those available on CBTNuggets. I think this is Kaplanlearn.com based exam simulations. After a bunch of videos from Lynda.com I switched it up to the practice exams to see if the content I was learning was in fact something I retained in an exam environment. I really recommended a bunch of practice exams and reviewing all questions both right and wrong. I was doing 90 question-based practice exams. I think my highest scoring was 57/100. Which is bad. However after every attempt and reviewing of scores I understood why such and such questions I got wrong. I'm down to share more. But I would love to know how I did on the performance-based questions. PracticeExamEveryDay! "

After reading all the posts on here I thought it was going to be way harder than it was. I studied for 2 months and passed it on the first attempt. Funny I actually got a higher score than with Security+. What I did to study is I watched all the videos that Jason Dion has for his course on it, used Safari Books to do all the questions for Mike Chapple's study guide and practice test books and just did them until I was getting high 80% plus on them. My background is I have a B.S. in Cybersecurity and Security+ before attempting the exam. This was a requirement for my new job so I am glad to have it out of the way.

I am currently working on a bachelors degree in IT with a focus on cybersecurity and information assurance. I had been thinking about changing my degree to cybersecurity but decided against it because it seems like IT would have more options. I was looking at the CompTIA Security+ certification and am thinking about taking it. However, after reading through the cert objectives, I saw that it is supposedly geared towards those who have a minimum of 2 years experience with cybersecurity and a general knowledge of the topics presented. I have not yet begun the courses in my degree that teach those things. I wanted to take the Security+ cert because it would give me that edge regarding cybersecurity instead of changing my entire major. So my question is, would it be smart for me to take that test? Or should I start with the A+? If I take the A+ now, financially I won't be able to take the Security+ until much later. My goal is to get an entry level IT job before I graduate. Thanks guys!"

Once I graduate, I'll have 2 years of full-time job experience and should be able to easily land entry-level IT jobs with higher pay. My goal is to get into Cybersecurity so I'm heavily considering pursuing a masters in the field which puts my goals more in line with accquiring Network+ and Security+. In an ideal environment, I would try to accquire all 3 but this is time consuming. My company has offered to cover a majority of the certification's cost so money is not the issue.

Out of all the exam questions, there was only about 10 that I knew the right answer right off the bat. Most of the other questions I made ""educated guesses"". The problem wasn't lack of study, I studied every day for at least 2-3 hours by either reading the GCGA textbook, or doing practice tests on the GCGA premium website or mobile app. The main problems were how the questions are set up: Most of the questions were quite straightforward, but most of the answers had more that one ""technically"" correct answer. This made picking out the right answer quite tough, since they could all be correct. You need to remember that this is a ""security"" exam, so all the answers should be answered from a security point of view. What was weird is that I had no questions regarding ports, and maybe 2 questions regarding encryption or hashing protocols. About 12 of my questions were looking at a log, and finding out what went wrong. I also had a large number of questions relating to time offsets, permissions, and vulnerability scans. The Performance-based questions were the easiest part of the exam, they were drag and drop and took no longer than 3 minutes. IF you do the practice performance-based questions on GCGA premium, you will be well prepared for them. Overall the exam was very difficult, the biggest tip I can give you is to know all the acronyms like the back of your hand, as many of the questions have more than 2 acronyms in them, and to flag and skip any questions you do not know, as some of the other questions will refresh your memory on them. I highly recommend buying the full ""GCGA premium"" package, as it has just about everything you need to look over and know for the exam, but be warned, the practice test questions are much simpler and easier than the real exam. Good luck on your exam, and ask me any question you have."

I received this email yesterday: *Hi, Since you expressed an interest in getting the CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner certification, we want to let you know the acronym is changing from CASP to CASP+. As you prepare to gain in-demand cybersecurity skills, this distinction will provide greater clarity and enhanced branding around the CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner certification that you will soon hold. How does this change affect you? Rest assured, the acronym change does not affect the practice questions or exam objectives you may have downloaded from our website. If you have been busy studying for CASP, carry on. The CASP+ exam is the same. Just as before, this certification will maintain the advanced-level credential that validates enterprise security and risk management skills. CASP+ still completes the CompTIA Cybersecurity Career Pathway and is a step up from your cybersecurity analyst skills ensuring that you stay hands-on, immersed in technology. What should you do?

It's nice to have them, but I have yet to see a job listing asking for A+, Network+, or CySA+. Only Security+ and maybe CASP+ seem to hold any weight. Also, CompTIA publishes lots of articles about the average **entry-level** salary for a holder of any of their certificates; usually from $70K -$100K depending on the job title. I'm not seeing it. I still like CompTIA certifications, but I have yet to see any entry-level job listings starting at that kind of salary. Thoughts? [CompTIA Trifecta](URL [CompTIA career pathways](URL &amp;#x200B;"
503,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed the CySA+ yesterday,1,abkvwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/abkvwa/passed_the_cysa_yesterday/,2019-01-02 06:10:25,"I work at a cybersecurity company and get bonuses for certifications and reimbursed for the cost of the voucher. My background is in networking and network security and more recently security auditing. I passed the Sec+ in 2016 and passed the CISSP exam in August. I got the go ahead to do this cert in September, but I was still brain dead and on my CISSP victory lap. &amp;#x200B; I looked at the end of November and saw a few spots open for the Saturday of the holiday weekend before the end of the year but I made the mistake of paying bills instead of getting my voucher, thinking I could stay in my local area to take the exam. I did start to really get my study on at that point, however, and I feel even with the CISSP studying this was a difficult exam in a different way. On to my test prep. &amp;#x200B; I bought the hardcopies of both the Sybex Study Guide and the 1000+ question Practice test books. It was a great decision as I don't have a lot of hands on as I'm in more of an analyst role day to day. I added both books to the online service and the Practice Question book had really great questions that I would not have passed without seeing. &amp;#x200B; I was definitely tested on all domains including SDLC which I had taken a deep dive on previously so I briefly reviewed that area but felt solid. If you don't have Software Development Lifecycle knowledge, this was a great quick intro for more advanced certs later, IMO. &amp;#x200B; The Day Of: I made the mistake of not booking my exam previously at a local exam site, so when I went to purchase, the only place I found was 2 hours away on New Years Eve. I promised to get myself a special gift if/when I pass, and my boss is super chill and let me have the day off to test so I booked it for 1 pm figuring I'd have time to gather my thoughts and avoid rush hour traffic. &amp;#x200B; On the way I set my cruise control and jammed out to some Eye of the Tiger before getting to the testing center and having a quiet minute to myself the get my thoughts together. I flipped through the study guide for about 5 minutes then sat in my quiet car for a few minutes after. I think this is very important; I'm an excellent test taker in general and I think this is one of the contributing factors is quieting and focusing the brain right before. &amp;#x200B; The Test: I had watched Prof Messer videos for my Sec+ and he recommended to pass the performance based questions and go right to the multiple choice, so I did. This exam was difficult in it's specificity. If you read and understand the study guide and practice tests, you will be fine, but I do think my CISSP studies helped as I could concentrate on things I didn't have every day experience with. &amp;#x200B; When I finally ended the test it was torture to go through the end of exam survey. I finally got to the results page: 790! Higher than my Sec+ score of 761, so pretty proud of that. &amp;#x200B; I was surprised by the amount of pentest questions, so I thought that was interesting. Know your CLIs! I felt CompTIA did a great job asking field experience related questions, and I feel like I could go to any SOC or infosec team and jump right in and contribute after studying for this. &amp;#x200B; After and going forward: My gift to myself is a helmet signed by my favorite football player (Patrick Mahomes) and some sound cancelling headphones. Career wise, I'm still deciding on my future; I want to stay at my current company but possibly move into a pentesting role. The next certs I'm looking at to complete for this year are the Pentest+ (saw a good review of it on this sub), the CASP, the CEH, and a basic Amazon one. &amp;#x200B; Final Thoughts: I really enjoyed this exam and am looking forward to the Pentest+ and CASP! &amp;#x200B; Oh, I love the stackable badges on Acclaim, they make my LinkedIn really sexy. About to get a deluge of recruiter messages! :) &amp;#x200B;"

I see a ton of people wanting to get into IT or Security. This is a great field and its what I've built my career on (8 years, BS Computer Information Science, MS Cybersecurity, Net+/Sec+). Here is what I want you to think about. First, certifications are a requirement in this line of work. Any government security work will require Sec+ if it's a true cybersecurity role (not in title only). You dont have to do A+, Net+, and Sec+. If you've got a ton of time and money then do it. I had neither what I got started and now that I have Security+, Network+ never comes up. The only people that ask me about A+ are people that have it and took TWO exams for the ""lowest"" cert. Think big picture. CompTIA recommends all these certs because they are a company and they want you to spend hundreds of dollars and retake a few exams. Help Desk is a good starting point but if you're older and/or need more than $35K a year then look at Network+ or Security+ first. Lastly, feel free to ask me any questions about the field. Yes this is all opinion but I've also seen what works and what doesnt."
508,cybersecurity,CompTIA,I passed Sec+ without a networking background,1,9xojre,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/9xojre/i_passed_sec_without_a_networking_background/,2018-11-17 05:03:24,"Hi everyone, I passed the Security+ exam yesterday with a score of 776/750. I was in a bit of a rush due to a deadline and had to sit for the exam in November. I found out about that deadline in early October. Cue panicking. I used the Comptia CertMaster full blown version at first. I went through every single module and realized I was way in over my head. I was constantly googling the acronyms and concepts because I didn't have background in 80% of the material. I am not a cybersecurity expert. I finally finished CertMaster and had put in about 16 hours total over the course of a month to complete all of the objectives. Then I read this sub, and saw some comments saying it wasn't going to get me to pass. Cue more panicking. With one week left before taking the exam, I bought Darril Gibson's Sec+ book on Amazon per the recommendations here. All I can say is, this is the book you need to pass. I read the entire thing cover to cover, took every single practice question multiple times, and completed the full test assessments 3 times each. The most important part to passing your cert if you don't do this kind of thing every day is understanding the concepts. Once I understood the concepts, I was able to put them into the context of the question. Comptia will try to trick you with wording, and books like Darril Gibson's give you practice navigating tricky question wording. Generic study guides may not prepare you quite as well for that. Comptia's CertMaster didn't help with it, because they just guide you to the right answer and make you more likely to memorize answers, which is not a good practice here. In addition, ACRONYMS! I thought they would be the death of me. It took me so many notes and highlights to figure out some of them. I strongly recommend you learn every acronym you can. Make flash cards. I spent every free moment studying for the exam and I still had acronyms come up on the test that I didn't know. Not sure how, but because I understood the other options, I was able to eliminate them and assume it was the one I didn't know. I'm so, so relieved that I was able to pass. I almost ran out of time and got very concerned I wouldn't finish because of the performance-based questions at the beginning. Those were tough and didn't make a lot of sense to me, and I had about 10 minutes to finish my last 15 questions. I was sure I'd failed, but.. knowing the concepts saved me. Buy the book. And good luck. Happy to answer any other questions. "
509,cybersecurity,CompTIA,CompTIA &amp; general IT Certifications.,1,9zk593,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/9zk593/comptia_general_it_certifications/,2018-11-23 13:09:48,"Hello to the most impacting community here on Reddit. This sub has been a blessing to me and I give it to its subscribers and everyone that continually makes it so helpful. I have a couple of questions as regards certifications and general IT topic and I'd be obliged if all of us could contribute to this, each and every comment would be valuable. So, I was a B. Tech. graduate in Accounting, but have since switched career to IT and currently working as a Web Developer and Programmer, even though things are rough concerning my working environment, but I've been focused and always committed to the dream that got me there. It was very easy for me deciding a career change, but delving into IT was a heck of a time trying to step in the right direction. The former was because I love computer and the internet right from my tender years, and the latter because the field is incredibly large, so choosing an area of specialization didn't come easily. &gt;Long story short, I finally opted to follow the security branch of IT. That, of all my decisions, is one I'll be forever grateful for. A mentor suggested that I take CompTIA Security+, learn Linux OS distro (Ubuntu Server), up my Python and AWS skills going forward, which were a beautiful set of ideas, if you'd agree. I started doing all of that, but with little progress. So, I focused on Security+, but failed the exam with 50 points short the pass mark, which made me come up with a new strategy: To get the CompTIA's trifecta in the correct order. I simply thought the reason I didn't do well in Security+ exam was owing to the fact that I lack prior knowledge on the basics, and it became obvious that I have to know how computer really works if I have to secure them. So, I started the trifecta journey. Here come my questions: 1. Many have debunked the significance of the CompTIA's trifecta certifications. Do you think it's worth it, **ESPECIALLY** for people from an educational background other than Computer Science? 2. I'm considering going for a Master's in Cybersecurity, joined with the trifecta, to beat the conventional requirement by Hiring Managers demanding academic qualifications focused on Computer Science or other Engineering related discipline to get a job in the field. Do you think that's a **GOOD** idea or would you suggest somethings else? 3. After getting my CompTIA certifications, which are good for three years from the day of my exams, does that means I am certified for those exams **FOR LIFE**, even if I don't renew them? Would renewing just Security+, which is the highest of the trifecta category get Network+ and A+ renewed altogether? If not, is there any point in renewing A+ and Network+ since I'd be focusing on Information Security? 4. As a person, getting certified is not just enough for me, I really want to have full understanding of these things such that I can explain them in simple terms, and even a child, who is unfamiliar with the topic can understand them. So, I'd like to get my hands dirty and build a repository of projects in advancing my career after getting my Security+. Which resource (Online/Offline) that explain concepts, in a way that make them obvious; professionals on Twitter; ideas would you suggest to me in building a successful Information Security (otherwise known as Cybersecurity) career? Thanks for taking your time to read though this. If you've made it this far, please don't hesitate to drop your comment and answer one or two, if not all of my questions. Your answer will go a long way in helping me to make the right choice, and many others that will come across this post. I'm glad, very relieved that I finally did this. &amp;#x200B; Thanks very much folks."

I really want to get into IT/cyber security because I've worked with computers my whole life and this is a career path I can see myself genuinely enjoying. But, I have no real IT background as of yet, which means no networking experience. I'm not sure if I'll have the time or money to take A+/Net+ before the course starts, but I may be able to blast through Professor Messer's course videos on both of those if that's recommended. I'm wondering if anyone here was in the same situation as me and passed Sec+ as their introduction to IT. If so, how did you study and how long did you study for in preparation for the exam?

Materials: Pluralsight CySA+ (CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst) CSO-001 Course by Dale Meredith CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst: The Total Course; by Total Seminars &amp; Brent Chapman. ([URL CompTia CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Certification All-in-One Exam Guide by Brent Chapman. ([URL Background: I'm just a normal IT Support guy looking for a Security Engineer job, so I'm taking all security certs. I own A+, Network+, Security+ and now CySA+, also, I have a bachelor on Computer networks and I'm about to finish my Master's degree on Ethical Hacking. 2 years of experience on IT Support. Technique: Alright, so first I watched the entire course on Pluralsight which is 28 hours long, (Dale,(The author) tends to make jokes during the course and talks extra stuff not needed but somehow that technique helps on reminding things) and because the course is so long you will put to practice a lot of techniques and tools during the course. This course includes a Lab with configurations so you can set it up and practice on your own lab. Hands on experience is better than just watching and reading the book. Here I learned most of the tools and content. While I was not watching a course, at work and other places I would read the book but I coudn't finish it, I just read exactly 98 pages from almost 400 lol. What I did use from the book was the CD with the training exam simulator and questions, helped a bit. I went to Udemy after watching the Pluralsight course and got the Total Course by Brent Chapman for $10.99 because this version is short and highlights everything, so I could be sure that I knew everything I needed. This course really helped a lot, It doesn't contains all the content the one from Pluralsight does but I goes straight to the point so you can enforce your knowledge. And last, I slept 3 hours the day before the cert and studied around 14 hours, why? Because you will have your material fresh, people say to get lots of sleep before the cert but that doesn't work for me. I did this all in the period of 1 week. Other recommendations: study the following: Know how to ready server logs, NMAP LOGS, Types of attacks like (XSS, SQL Injection, buffer overflow, Frameworks. I feel like there is no way to memorize stuff because even if you memorize everything you won't be able to apply it since question will be complex. Study all you can in a short period of time and try to keep your knowledge fresh, use the tools, hands on experience will help a lot. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Grateful for the advice I've read on Reddit, so I thought I should pass my knowledge forward. &amp;#x200B; **Test itself:** Throughout the test, I thought I was struggling because there were a good hefty amount of questions that had 2 good answers. I think I had about 25 questions ultimately that I flagged or was unsure of. This kind of echoes what I think other redditors have experienced, so I didn't necessarily panic, but tried to do the best that I could by eliminating the obviously dumb answers and making educated questions. Some other questions were just incredibly straight forwards, so there was a good mix. I had 85 questions total, 5 of which were PBQs. I ended up running out of time. Just be prepared to have to take this dumb survey towards the end when all you want is your test results! &amp;#x200B; The test had a wide variety of questions including log analysis-pattern analysis, mobile security, knowing common ports like LDAP, knowing how to configure a network (this one was tough), understanding basic linux commands (pwd), EAP, CHAP etc. &amp;#x200B; **About me/starting point:** In the field for approximately 1.5 years in more of a support/project management role for cybersecurity companies with knowledge of Windows Server 2012, PenTesting, vulnerability assessments and threat intelligence. Before I starting working in the cybersecurity field, I majored in Int. Studies/Econ. So, if you aren't sure you can do this..you absolutely can! I think having some sort of relationship to Sec+ at work was helpful, especially when I wanted to ask a co-worker about PEAP or EAP or a Radius server. However, its widely accepted that this is a stepping stone for everything else. Sec+'s material is quite broad in nature, which is why it is challenging in its own right. &amp;#x200B; **Overall Prep:** I studied sort of on and off for approximately 6 months. I took a skillsoft online course first, but it completely went over my head. I think its only through multiple means does the material start absorbing into your head. I then took another online Security+/Network Security course at my local community college using TestOut. Only about a month ago was when I started taking this certification more seriously. 2 weeks before the test I started cramming like crazy. I ultimately really relied upon Reddit/Internet Googling, Co-worker knowledge, a little of Professor Messor's YouTube Videos, MeasureUp exam (access given by work), CompassTest, other practice online tests, Darrill Gibson's book, Darrill Gibson's Security+ App and Darrill Gibson's Online portal (extra material and questions included with the purchase of the book). &amp;#x200B; *Editorial note:* I believe that everybody studies differently, so tailor your studying to your own personality! I'm the type of person that only does well in tests with pressure. But, I did significantly absorb the material over the 6 months and through my job to be able to understand the context for the test questions. It was very useful to be able to review the exam objectives/terms. If I didn't understand something, it would try my best to look it up and reinforce memory recall through quizzes. I think when you get to the point when you're hitting 85-90%+ of the questions correctly and where you can explain why the other answers don't work to help your process of elimination..you're on the right track. &amp;#x200B; Test material review: Skillsoft - I think the material has gotten better, but I generally glossed over most of it. If you plan on using it, I would suggest using 1.5x or 2x speed to get through it and use it mostly to bolster what you don't understand. The quiz questions were okay, but seemed off base. &amp;#x200B; TestOut - Overall information was interesting and relevant like Skillsoft. But, again, it was a lot and merely helpful for hearing the information. I took it as part of a community college course, so it was ""class"". The simulation were meh. Its not until I started doing more hand on stuff with Windows Server that I understood how group permissions worked more. The questions are a little bit off base in my opinion. &amp;#x200B; Professor Messor: I went through some of his videos to supplement what I was learning through GCGA. I'm more of a book learner, so this supplemented GCGA's material. I recommend using it at 1.5 or 2x speed. This should NOT be your only material in my humble opinion. Don't just gloss over it, but be an active learner and ask what makes sense..what doesn't make sense. &amp;#x200B; MeasureUp exam - this test was crazy hard and unrealistic at times. I took an exam 5 times until I hit 80% plus. I would say MeasureUp was still more realistic than Skillsoft and TestOut questions though. Just don't be nervous if your test score is lower. &amp;#x200B; CompassTest ([URL Free resource, helped me reinforce terms that came up with Gibson's GCGA. There are no explanations, but generally everything is factually correct, so you can use GCGA to help you with these quizzes. Very good resource that I wished I tapped into earlier on in the week instead of just a few days prior to the exam. There are almost 30 total 25 question tests, so pace yourself in order to absortb the material. &amp;#x200B; Gibson's GCGA 501 book: Great material that covers all of the test objective areas. Just overall good material that flows well and gives you the context in an easy to understand format. Note: In my edition of the book the binary/ASCII description of certificates was INCORRECT. &amp;#x200B; Gibson's GCGA 501 security+ app: I used the quick tests, flash cards and the tests in my free time. Some of this material mirrors the actual book. But, it helps you cycle through the material on your own time. I would recommend buying this. &amp;#x200B; Gibson's GCGA 501 online resources: I only the material that was complementary because I purchased his book. Not bad material, but I wished I used it earlier. He has a few PBQs and updated materials on there as well as a correction to the binary/ASCII mistake. &amp;#x200B; PocketPrep+ Security 501 app: This was not very helpful or accurate for test taking. I didn't learn as much as I did through Gibson's materials or CompassTest. &amp;#x200B; Hope this helps! "

Il be taking the test in three days. I'm pretty confident with my knowledge in the field of cybersecurity but I'm just very curious about the exam so I figure if I fail this will just help to point me in the right direction as there is not that much to go by from anyone else.

Looking at the objectives it looked really similar to CEH so I said what the heck might as well take it since I already got the CEH material still fresh in my mind. Could not find any reliable PenTest+ study material so I just recycled my CEH study material: CEH Certified Ethical Hacker All-in-One Exam Guide, Third Edition 3rd Edition by Matt Walker CEH v9 : Certified Ethical Hacker Version 9 Study Guide CEH V9 : Certified Ethical Hacker Version 9 Practice Tests I thought it would be pretty similar to CEH and was confident I'd pass it. boy was I wrong. PenTest+ had a lot more technical questions, the ones that really caught me off guard was the questions using Python or Bash scripting. Programming/scripting is something Im really weak at so im sure thats where i lost most of my score. Needless to say I'm determined to get this cert so I plan on retaking it, but I may just wait until a good book or some other sort of study material comes out for it. And just some background on my experience; I have a AS in Computer Networking Systems, BS in Information Security Assurance and currently working on a MS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance.

I took the Sec+ twice towards the beginning of this year(failed to my thinking that they would be ""easy"" tests"" and failed both times by about 15-20 points each time. I drug(....dragged?) my heels for a couple months and started my way towards the Net+ around May. Didn't really start studying seriously until September. Then just yesterday, I studied HARD for about 12 hours, going over Practice Questions and self-made flash cards. &amp;#x200B; **Materials Used**(in order): **CompTIA Network+ Study Guide: Exam N10-007** \- I thought the writing is great and used the book up until chapter 9, then I realized I don't learn very well via JUST reading **Professor Messer N10-007 Video Course -** \- I initially bought his course notes to be able to follow along with his videos. I watched EVERY SINGLE N10-007 video he had on Youtube, only took a handful of notes.

Hurray! Next one will be CISSP. I have passed Comptia Security+ end of May this year, read my [other Reddit post]( URL how I passed that exam. **What I think about CySA and the exam** The CySA+ exam for me was more easy than the Security+ exam. Maybe this is because of my ITSM background. I had 3 simulations and 72 questions. I saved the sims to last and focused on the questions first. I believe I only marked 8 questions for review, the other questions I could answer with confidence. The first two sims were not very hard, but third one i struggled with. After the sims I have reviewed the last 8 questions and with almost 60 minutes left on the clock I finished the exam and passed. **How I prepared** I first viewed the whole CBT, than I read the book, than I read the book again and took notes, than I took the CertMaster, than I took all the practice exams and the CySA practice app until I scored near 80%. I also took a special NMAP course and a CVSS course, which are very helpful, although there were no questions regarding them in the exam for me. **Observations** Some of the questions in the exam were outside of the CySA scope, oddly enough, very specific to a certain situation. Not easy to prepare for this except for broad IT experience. Some log questions where you had to analyse NMAP output. Some packet capture questions where you had to determine if the traffic was malicious. One or two questions where you had to know Linux commands For the rest most were straight forwards questions as you would find in most practice exams. **Resources used** * This reddit to research the best approach and any useful online resources * Fernando Maymi, CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Certification All-in-One Exam Guide, read the book twice. Took my notes from it. Seems comprehensive enough. Cannot compare against other books as I have not read the other ones. * CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst CySA+ CS0-001. The Total Course from Total Seminars and Brent Chapman on Udemy.com. Very decent CBT that based off the all-in-one book. I also read good feedback about Jason Dions course, but did not take that one. *I took the CompTIA Certmaster Course, the price difference between one exam voucher and the Deluxe Bundle was a no-brainer, especially with the re-take voucher thrown in. Certmaster was OK, I went through it in about 8 hours and it was just another means to have the study material stick better in my brain. * Udemy.com, Jason Dion's CompTIA CySA+ (CS0-001) 5 Practice Certification Exams. Good value for money * Udemy.com Total Seminar's CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst CySA+ (CS0-001): Practice Tests. Also good value for money. * The CSA+ Cyber Security Pro app in the Google Play store, for 9,95 euro. This one is highly recommended, 1081 test questions on your phone or tablet. You can test yourself wherever you have a few minutes to spare. * NMAP course on Pluralsight. I took this one as part of a trial subscription. Very good to make NMAP stick in your mind. * First.org self-paced e-learning course will specifically help you master CVSS version 3.0. Please be aware the exam uses **CVSS 2.0** so maybe you want to skip this course as 2.0 and 3.0 differ quite a bit in terms of calculations are scoring.

533,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed Sec+ 501 a few days ago,41,9gkieo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/9gkieo/passed_sec_501_a_few_days_ago/,2018-09-17 23:56:11,"Hi everyone, &amp;#x200B; This is my first post on reddit, but I've been stalking everyones posts on their experience with the Security + exam. I am not an experienced IT person, I was told this cert is a good one to have to get my foot in the door. I studied for about 2 months with a minimal background in it. All of your posts about the good and bad, your favorite training material, and least favorite has been the most helpful guide for me. It seems, obviously, that every different product, free or not, was bias toward their own product. What I mean by that is every time I completed a chapter in one book, or did a practice exam, or watched a video on the same chapter, they would all discuss something different. So a variety in training material was purchased and studied. I wouldn't have known about all the different ones or which worked the best if it wasn't for the posts here. So my tips would be this: 1) Watch Professor Messer ( Free and gives you a good base understanding) I did not buy his notes or take part in his groups. Looking back I feel like I should have 2)Buy Darril Gibson's ""CompTIA Security +SYO-501 and SYO-401 Prep"" App for your phone. The two weeks before taking the exam I crammed the content and practice exams. His questions seemed to me to be the closest to the actual exam. Although it didn't cover every question I encountered. 3) CertMaster by Comptia was an ok resource. Not sure I'd buy it again for future certs. I liked the lay out but again I felt it was a bit to vague in what they gave as questions. It was the first resource I used so it was definitely helpful, but it wasn't as thorough as I had hopped. I bought it as a bundle, along with the exam voucher and a retake voucher for I want to say around $450. If you take in to account the cost of each exam I felt it was a good deal. My hope was that it would be the only study material I would need, it wasnt. Also their app would constantly crash on me and got annoying, worked fine on the laptop. 4) Pearsons App and Cram it app for security + weren't worth the time. Maybe if you need something to flip through at work real quick they can help. I didn't feel they were helpful though. 5) Lyndia has a Security + course was pretty thorough if you are a member. I think it is $30 a month. I didn't get all the way through the course but looking back I should have used it as the main source of information. The guy goes into great detail and will show examples which is cool. I found it kind of late in the game and used it as a way to get a better understanding of areas I didn't do well in on the practice exams. 6) Icollege is terrible. They had a massive sale and I bit. Mistake even for $20 for 10 courses. Awful. 7) Crybary is terrible. Free but not updated for the current Certification. 8) Department of Homeland Security has a free cybersecurity program which you can access most if not all of it for free. I stumbled upon it while searching for any information on learning more about cybersecurity. They have a game that I found where you have to protect your network from different attacks. It was actually really fun and gave me a better understanding of how to actually use the security tools. Little did I know at the time that a remarkably similar game would be on the exam under one of the performance questions. If I can be honest this game probably is what saved me from failing the test. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, thats the gist of my trials and errors for the exam. I'm currently talking to a few recruiters now in hopes of getting my foot in the door. If anyone has any advice for next steps, or things to practice, I'd love to hear them. &amp;#x200B; THANKS EVERYONE!! &amp;#x200B;"

PenTest+ exam also includes management skills used to plan, scope, and manage weaknesses, not just exploit them.

Preparation materials: On the job education and experience. Been a security analyst for 13 months where I'm heavily focused on traffic and log analysis. Military IT before that. I got the bundle with CertMaster. I used it for a couple hours before deciding it was garbage. After taking the test, I feel it didn't accurately reflect exam format and content. If you've never done anything with security, this may be useful to introduce concepts and ideas but don't rely on it. I got the [Sybex book by Mike Chapple &amp; David Seidl](URL This book seems like a quality book that's both comprehensive and easy to read. It goes over all the domains that CS0-001 covers and then some. A good book to read if you're new to security, and if you're not new then it will help refresh a lot of concepts that you may not necessarily use on the daily. I skimmed through this and read parts that I wasn't familiar with. Thoughts: CompTIA labels this cert as an intermediate career cert with a recommended 3-4 years in industry. I'm not a seasoned professional, but I am of the personal opinion that this is definitely an introductory certification. Having this cert may demonstrate an understanding of a variety of cybersecurity topics but not necessarily an ability to practically apply them to real world situations. It's a mile wide but only an inch deep in the knowledge it tests for. I would put this in the same tier as CCNA Cyber Ops or the CEH but a couple steps below. I also have the Cyber Ops cert, and the content is not only more applicable/practical but also goes deeper. Don't have the CEH, but I know it's thought of as an 'intro' cert for security. Overall: Not a bad cert, but there's better offerings out there in a similar price range that offer the same amount of recognition. Good for an introduction to a broad range of cybersecurity topics."

I'm going through WGU to get my B.S. in CyberSecurity and Information Assurance and had to renew my A+, and get Net+, and Sec+. A+ was no biggie. Stupid test with loads of outdated information I'll never need to know. Net+ I failed on my first try. I took it on the last day of the semester after not studying because I had nothing to lose by trying. I think I scored a 710? Took it again a few weeks later after studying and stressing out of my mind and passed with an 811. Just passed the Sec+ after being up for like 18 hours with a score of 786. I felt confident I could pass before going in, but like everyone else says, that kind of went out the window once the exam began. I did get the NTP question, the POODLE question, and a bunch of log questions. I had 83 multiple choices and 2 drag and drop sims, maybe 3. A good amount of log questions that weren't too different than what I see at work. I did have a few that were analyzing code? You had to figure out what kind of vulnerability it was i.e. buffer overflow/interger overflow. Anyways, just super excited to be done with CompTIA. A+ I used only the uCertify materials. Net+ I used uCertify, TestOut Labsim, and bought Professor Messer's notes. His notes were by far the most helpful thing in my opinion. Sec+ I used uCertify, TestOut Labsim, and bought Professor Messer's notes. I really only felt like I needed to brush up on PKI and cryptography so I didn't go over his whole pdf but I'm sure its quality."

Wasn't super nervous going into the exam, felt fairly confident I put in the time that was needed. I was actually more nervous taking my Security+ two years ago then I was this morning. Not going to lie... after hitting that submit button, I was shaking a little bit. I credit these types of posts to my success. I personally checked reddit and other forum platforms on a consistent basis to get feedback from others experiences. I usually don't post stuff, but figured maybe my post might help someone in the same boat as me. My background is pretty simple: I did IT in the military for about 7 years I have worked in a Help Desk role and Network Infrastructure roles. I currently hold a Network/Security position at my currently company. Never truly held a Security only job. After getting my Bachelors in Management of Information Systems and passing Security+ back to back, I took a small break(months....) from studying hardcore. For the CySA+ I studied religiously for three months about 1-2 hours a day. **These are my study materials I utilized during my preparation:** **CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst (CSA+) Study Guide: Exam CS0-001 by Mike Chapple, David Seidl -** I read about 75% of this book and skimmed the other areas I did not fully read. I also utilized the practice quizzes at the end of each chapter. Any questions I would get wrong, I would go back in the chapter and reread until I grasped the concept. **CBT Nuggets -** Watched the full CySA+ video series by Keith Barker. I would listen to this on my drive to and from work. Also would sit down and draft notes from these videos. Really liked these videos. Short and to the point. **CompTIA CySA+ Cybersecurity Analyst Certification All-In-One Exam Guide (Exam CS0-001 by: Fernando J. Maym, Brent Chapman -** I read this book about 75% of the way through as well. I really liked the material in this one. I would choose this book over the option above. **CompTIA Cybersecurity Analyst CySA+ (CSA+): The Total Course -** This video series had good information in it. Wish the end of chapter quizzes were harder on this, but overall worth the $10. I purchased this on Udemy. Also purchased **Jason Dion's CompTia CySA+ 5 practice exams**. Minus of the typos, this test bank was helpful. **Transcender exams were my main source of test banks via CBT Nuggets.** This was a difficult exam in my opinion. I am fortunate to have some experience in the security realm. You really have to just take your time and dissect what the question is asking. Utilize the process of elimination. I did not know every single answer on the test, but I did my best to narrow down the answers and try to choose the best one. Following CompTIA's exam objectives helped me solidify my knowledge in each area. I made sure I looked at each one and could recite what that specific item was out loud. I used to think it was cliche that people would post that, but after passing the exam, it really does help. Next up is getting my MS in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance and CASP! Good luck to everyone that attempts this exam! Hope this helps."
553,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Trifecta in 2 months (sort of)!,30,908hdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/908hdb/trifecta_in_2_months_sort_of/,2018-07-20 04:34:45,"Long time lurker on this sub, first time posting. Apologies for any grammars, this got hella long. I'm going in to my sophomore year studying cybersecurity in New York and have both worked part time and been contracted for IT-related jobs, so I had a good amount of experience coming in. I started studying for CompTIA certs during winter break in January, then the spring semester started and I was way too busy to juggle classwork and normal exams along with certification exams, so I ended up taking all that time off. As soon as June rolled around I started studying again and finished the Security+ today, so this is my obligatory post with tips/advice/study materials. I hope you find it helpful. Without the gaps when I wasn't studying, the time I spent was about 2 months. I passed all the exams on the first try, and you can too with good prep. **The Pearson VUE testing centers:** They vary widely in terms of comfort and noise. You might want to visit them before the exam if you can. My first two times the center was in a quiet rectangular room with 4 cubicles and office chairs, which was perfect. The third time I was in a room with a glass wall and no audio/visual protection from the activity from the normal business operations in the rest of the building, which was awful and distracting. The chairs were also noisy and uncomfortable. The fourth time I was in a very dim rectangular room with 2 cubicles and nice chairs. It was kind of hard to see, but I wasn't writing so that didn't matter. However, the AC system kept making this really annoying ticking sound which was irritating to listen to. Schedule a time you know you will be not tired and can think clearly. For me that's usually in the morning, but the time also depends on availability. You may only have one choice to schedule a time (like at 8:30 AM once, for me), especially the closer you are to the date you are taking it. At every center you need **2 forms of ID** (a primary with name, photo, and signature and a secondary with name and photo or name and signature), you are asked to sign the candidate agreement, they check your signature by having you sign a black pad, take your picture, and have you initial on a sign-in/out sheet that you got the flimsy legal-size dry-erase paper and a fine-point marker they provide with every exam (don't initial until you get them!). They lock up all your personals in a box and give you the key. They offer earplugs, too. The computer also has you agree to terms before you start the exam. At the end of the exam they make you take a survey and it tells you if you passed or not. You get a printout with details on how you did and a digital embosser code that lets you view your score online. Sign out and return the whiteboard (don't erase it!), and you're done. I'd also like to point out [this thread](URL and mention the [CompTIA Academic Marketplace](URL Now, exams in the order I took them: [**A+ 220-902**](URL **- 810/900 (700 passing score) - $97 - studied from 1/4/18 to 1/12/18 (test at 11:30 am on 1/12/18)** 80 Questions, 3 Performance-Based Study materials: * [Professor Messer's 902 Video Series](URL (free) * [Professor Messer's 902 Pop Quiz Collection PDF](URL with 600 questions ($15) * Quizlet flashcards for acronyms, port numbers, command line flags, and network speeds/types (any Quizlets I don't post are because they are copied verbatim from a copyrighted source, so I don't want to violate that) Performance-based questions: * Match ports * Startup troubleshooting * Partition management As I mentioned, I had quite a bit of experience coming in for this exam, but in my opinion even if you don't you really don't need anything other than Professor Messer's videos and pop quiz collection to pass this exam. Messer's videos are short, to the point, and cover everything you need to know (but yes, he can be very monotone, which doesn't work for some people). His Pop Quiz Collection is spot on and in my opinion slightly more difficult than the actual exam, which is what I was looking for and made taking the exam a bit less stressful. I tried Mike Meyers for a few days on Lynda from my school, but I found his videos very drawn out and covering things that weren't relevant to the exam. Any technical details or comparisons that I had difficulty remembering or had to memorize I put in to Quizlet and cycled through the Learn mode until I felt confident enough that I knew them. On test day, I was really nervous. I started out feeling like I was doing poorly, but felt confident in my answers at the end. I skipped the performance-based questions, flagged a ton of questions, went back to do the performance-based ones, did any incomplete questions, and reviewed the flagged questions. I finished with about 5 minutes remaining. After the gut-wrenching survey they make you take at the end, the computer reported I passed!

He didn't have questions for the 006 so I looked around and had trouble finding materials that most people seemed to agree on, but finally I settled on AlphaPrep with the student discount, which I liked. There are some questions that cover stuff beyond the exam and into Cisco exams (their main prep business), but for the most part it was accurate and slightly more challenging than the exam itself, which again was what I was looking for. I also gave myself more time to study. **Most importantly, I followed Professor Messer's advice and used the half hour they give you to read the candidate agreement and instructions to write out his** [**7-Second Subnetting**](URL **chart from memory on the provided whiteboard .** This is the only exam I actually used the whiteboard for. I'm certain I passed all my subnetting questions (3 and one PB) with it. I felt like I performed worse on this exam compared to the A+, but turns out it wasn't by much. I passed anyway with 5 minutes left, using the same skip performance-based, answer questions, answer performance-based, answer questions I left blank, review flagged questions strategy. [**Security+ SY0-501**](URL **- 799/900 (750 passing score) - $210 - studied from 7/10/18 to 7/19/18 (test at 9:00 AM on 7/19/18)** 83 Questions, 4 Performance-Based Study materials: * [Professor Messer's 501 Video Series](URL (free) * [Darril Gibson's GCGA SY0-501 Security+ Study Guide](URL ($10, Kindle version) * [Darril Gibson's GCGA SY0-501 Security+ Practice Test Questions](URL ($50) * Quizlet flashcards for acronyms, access controls, hashing and encryption algorithms, certificate types, and ports Performance-based questions: * Match security concepts * Secure a physical environment * Compare/contrast security measures * Identify attacks I went for the 501 because I didn't know if I'd have time to study again before the end of the month if I failed. Obviously, I used Professor Messer's video series again, which are still great. As he doesn't have practice questions for the 501 either, I bought the GCGA study guide and practice test questions by Darril Gibson, which was consistently recommended on this sub. Although they aren't as fancy as AlphaPrep, they are still slightly harder than the actual exam and a very good resource nonetheless. I got the exact same score as on the 006, which I thought was interesting. I felt like it was easier than the 006 but harder than the 901/902, and with the amount of time I had I think my score reflects that. I was still nervous and felt like I was doing poorly to start out, but at the end I became confident and am very happy I passed. **All in all, know your acronyms and ports and be able to troubleshoot. Use the exam objectives! Don't stress as much as I did and give yourself plenty of time to study. Everyone says something along the lines of ""be sure you score at least 90% on your practice exams before you take the real exam"", but I was pressed for time this summer and only got to scoring around the level needed to pass the exam before I took all of them, and I still passed well above that score. The questions aren't as hard as they seem, and all the practice tests I used seemed harder than the actual exam to me.** Good luck! I did these to hopefully help differentiate myself a bit more at my university's career fair. I think I'm going to go for PenTest+ or CCNA next this winter break as I work my way to CASP/OSCP/CISSP. If anyone has any other recommendations for a cybersecurity student I would love to hear them. Thanks!"

I also earned my BS in Business leadership 2 years ago. I'm 23 and have very little experience working in IT. I have been working as a desktop support at a local law firm and driving delivery trucks to help pay for schooling. I recently met with one of my old professors and she told me to submerge myself into the IT field because its the highest paying and where I'm located (New England) has the highest demand for cybersecurity experts. She suggested I read ""Cyberethics"" by Richard Spinello to help understand the terminology and that I go get the Security+ certification from CompTIA. I'm also learning how to code in my free time by using codecademy. I'm looking for some more information on how to prepare for the Security+ certification and any insight someone can give me that has been in my position. Also, I would appreciate any suggestions on additional reading/podcasts/videos you believe would be helpful in helping me become more familiar with IT. Thanks for the help"

This is a huge burden off of my shoulders, a massive confidence boost, and hopefully I can provide advice to those about to take on the SY0-501. I am a 24 year old PC Tech, freelance electronics repairman/IT guy, and part time staff at a gym. This year I finished my M.S. in Cybersecurity. Besides that, my technical knowledge is entirely self-taught, outside of a few small IT jobs and internships (mostly helpdesk/PC tech related). I'm currently looking for either an entry-level cyber position, or a higher-level IT job. **IF I CAN DO THIS, ANY OF YOU CAN DO THIS.** Now, about SY0-501: it was difficult, but not as nearly as difficult as I imagined. The posts I've read on here are accurate for the most part. The wording can be tricky, questions can be long, and you really need to read into the context of each question. I had 83 questions, 4 PBQs, and I used every bit of 90 minutes. I studied for a month and a half, a few hours each day, and took tons of notes. I found the questions to be a lot less technical than I would have imagined. But I was prepared, and **this is how I prepared:** * [**Darril Gibson's Get Certified Get Ahead SY0-501 Full Security Course**](URL * This was my primary resource. I used absolutely everything available in the full package. I read every single chapter, took notes on each chapter, took the tests after each chapter, and took further notes of the questions I missed on the practice tests to try and understand why I missed them (it's easy to accidentally memorize answers, instead of learning. avoid that.). * I used the flashcards to memorize familiar acronyms. There are **a lot of acronyms** and you should know them all. The exam is brutal about its acronyms. * I used the ""Remember This"" audio files to refresh my knowledge after every day of reading/taking notes. I also used this to cram the few days leading up to the test. I have a great short-term memory, and I felt this was critical. * **Just buy it.** This resource was invaluable. It was like a recap of most of what I learned during my Master's studies. * [**Professor Messer's Youtube Security+ Training Course**](URL * Every night, I would spend about an hour watching Messer's youtube videos, in order. They are ordered identically to Darril's content, and this was an incredible way to reinforce my knowledge. Messer has a great way of explaining more technical topics that may be difficult for those new to IT/security. * They're free. Watch them. * **CompTIA CertMaster.** * Eh. * This was like the online practice exam thing that you can buy with your voucher. * The UI was nice and the competitive statistics were very interesting. * The questions were very, very relevant to exam material, but Darril and Messer described everything much clearer. * Many of the questions are very misleading, and there were a few answers I absolutely did not agree with, even after reading the explanations. Maybe I'm dumb. * I didn't use this very often. Maybe once a week. The questions were easy to memorize. If you miss a question, it just shows it to you again later, and provides a 1-sentence, poor explanation. Lame. * This may be decent supplemental material, but **DO NOT SOLELY USE CERTMASTER TO PREPARE**, especially if you are not familiar with security concepts. * **Google.** * Google is your friend. Research concepts, protocols, and technical stuff that you don't understand!! Memorize port numbers!! I don't know where I would be without Google. * **This subreddit.** * I spent a lot of time reading posts here, all of which pointed me to proper study materials, and gave me extra confidence and drive. What a great community! That's about it. I cannot possibly overestimate Darril's course/book. Many of the questions I saw on the exam felt so familiar that I swear I saw them in this course. Thanks Darril! During my exam, the application crashed, and the test admin was kicked out of her computer, and I had to wait 20 minutes while praying I wouldn't have to reschedule or retake the entire exam. I had 3 questions left. Talk about sweating bullets. They fixed it, thank god.... Good luck guys! Put in the time and you can do it! I'm not that smart, I know you can do it if I can do it!! \\m/"

The performance base questions (PBQ) were annoying because a. The window size was too small which resulted me to go back and forth. b.

For all the books by Mike Chapel, you are able to claim the practice test question from the website which will be easier for you to practice compared from the book. Tips on studying 1. Reading the books doesnt really help much. It tells you what you should expect and to look out for, but it doesnt tell you how to do it as every situation is different and unique. 2. You need to learn to read a log of vulnerability reports, logs, command lines, etc... Its a freaking must!!! 3. The 1000 practice questions help a lot as you would learn how to read the logs and gives you a lot of practical situation. I would suggest google the CVE to understand it better as it helps instead of just looking at the answer. 4. You must know how to co-relate events from one log to another and interpret the outcome. 5. If you are lazy to build a server and produce your own logs, you can always google it. There are many out there. 6. Know what the tools are (i.e Nessus, Splunk, FTK, etc.) out there and what it does. Dont worry too much on how to use it. I got lucky this time as I only took a month to prepare. My next attempt will be CompTIA CASP. Just keep trying and never give up. If I can do it, so can you. All the best and good luck. "

Pretty sure I want to go the cybersecurity route, but I dont have an idea on what I want to do next. I have begun reading the Sybex CSA+ book, but it may be more prudent to just make the jump to CASP. Either way I dont want to let the knowledge that I have built up go to waste when I could just keep moving forward. Didnt use Messer videos or his book - I was 7 in line on a wait list at the library and wouldnt have gotten it in time because they didnt have the 501 version.

I plan on taking the SY0-501 here in June, and I've been reading the 401 book from the All-in-One series (it's the most recent book the school I attend has at the moment) and I figured that since the trifecta is usually conceptual and the fundamentals, the book I'm using would be at least enough to work with as long as I supplement it with other resources. Is this a decent plan in your opinion? Also, I do plan on pursuing the cybersecurity pathway that CompTIA offers, which include the CySA+ and CASP. Should I also pursue certifications that are also a part of the Infrastructure pathway, as well? I know each CompTIA cert has high employment value, but being new to this industry (in a professional sense, I am quite the security enthusiast) would employers look at my resume and think that I'm too well-rounded? I've always been taught from family that there is such a thing as too much knowledge when it comes to things like this. Plus, the University I will be attending will be offering a ton of certifications as part of the curriculum. P.S. I go to a trade school (Job Corps) and I am surrounded by different fields, who are constantly bragging about the tons of certifications they have obtained. Like Building Construction Tech (professional plumbers and electricians), they have (I think) 10 certifications offered for their program, but they are divided into lesser subjects. I feel like the number of certs doesn't matter at it's most basic level, but what you're certified in. Is this logic flawed? Or am I just going about things the wrong way? P.S.S. I'm not meaning to sound like other industries are less significant or easy, as a matter of fact I don't think I could do what my girlfriend does (BCT). Although, it just seems weird having a bunch of certifications instead of being grouped up into one big one. Maybe CompTIA has just spoiled me in that regard... One last thing, for reference.

There is a program being offered by WGU right now that I can take to pursue a career in computer security, something I always wanted to do; but the felony holds me back, and theres no way to erase it. So my question is: 1. Do I try going for a BS cybersecurity --&gt; MS information assurance degree offered by WGU, and risk spending years training for a career that will be sunk from the dock? OR 2. Do I pursue a BS in Cloud &amp; Systems administration, and follow it up with a Masters in Cloud Computing/Artificial Intelligence and chunk it in the fuquet bucket? Before you answer, know that I've been working with 'sploits since the first win-nuke OOB attack in the mid 90's. I've seen so much, and I know my way around kali very well. I was using linux back when you still had to compile your own kernel, ala Slackware 8.0, and I was using windsm32 and SoftICE to manipulate software in windows as well. While I haven't touched that in years, it still rattles around up there. So there is a deep familiarity there, and a sense of destiny. Which brings me to the second part of this: Money. It doesn't take a Rocket Surgeon to figure out a Cloud Architect can enter the field with double the base salary. That's pretty big, considering it also doesn't take security clearance to land this job either. To be completely honest, I've already been working towards getting the AWS and GCP certifications as it were; and the BS / Cloud Administration degree offered by WGU puts me right where I'd need to be to do it. My enrollment counselor says the Cloud degree is a much less-chosen course by students also; mostly for people who are already heavy in that field. She said that virtually every entry-level student coming through is going for the BS/ Cybersecurity course, which can then be followed neatly by the MS / Information Assurance degree they offer from the same school. So you see my predicament; With the more popular Cybersecurity, with job growth forecasted at 35%+ by 2022, but you may risk never getting past a 100k salary cap. I've looked, the MS degree plan offers you the CEH certification, which lands you a job at less than 100k. Meaning only upper management is going to see numbers past the 150k cap. I'd have to be damned good to be picked over others just as qualified with no background. You see where I'm going. Do I go for Cloud Administration and try to fulfill the security aspects later on, once I'm already established in the field? What if I went with the security course and just grabbed a Cloud Architect certification on the way? Easy enough right? I am torn, and I'm looking for some industry pros with some insight. Thank you for reading my wall of text. Here are some links to the courses that I can choose from at WGU, and mind you I already have the CIOS, and the felony is officially over 10 years old. URL URL"

577,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Security+ and CySA+ Comprehensive Study Review,37,86moq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/86moq5/security_and_cysa_comprehensive_study_review/,2018-03-24 04:59:37,"**I passed Security+ SY0-501 and CySA+ CS0-001** ###Study Methodology Consume one source and take notes, Consume a second source and take notes. Spend a day merging those notes into an optimal set. Review my notes and take notes on things I didn't remember writing down, or am having trouble remembering. I do this only if that thing is listed on the CompTia Objectives for the exam. ###General Notes about the exams - Do read the CompTia Objectives document, and refer to it while studying. Most books/videos have a lot of good/important info for the field, but you need to be sure to focus on objectives. - Skip and come back to the performance-based questions (ie. first 3 - 4 questions). Use your remaining test time at the end to ponder these ones, don't try to bang them out at the start. Don't even read them. - If you keep hearing performance-based, and just don't understand what that entails. An example of a question may be an image of a network topography, and you would have to identify perhaps a firewall, router, IPS by selecting the drop down menu under the picture. That's an easy one, but these aren't anything to be afraid of for this exam. ###My Background I'm a full stack engineer, cloud networks experience, lots of interest in information security. Scored under 850 on each exam. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ##Security+ SY0-501 ###Materials Used **Professor Messer SY0-501 Video Series** (free) URL - This is by far the best coverage of the exam materials I found. - The series covers the material in the same order as the exam Objectives Document. I find that to be a plus, and helps with referencing the Objectives Document while studying. - This series is laser focused as a study guide. It covers everything I found in the objectives and in writing the exam. Nothing more nothing less. Please turn off your ad-blocker while you watch these and help generate a little revenue for the guy that's putting this out there. You may also consider buying ($20) the Sec+ notes for review from professormesser.com. Money well spent there. Direct link URL &amp;nbsp; **Darril Gibsons Book - CompTIA Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead: SY0-501 Study Guide** Gibson's Site URL Book Link URL - Covers exam objectives with good explanations. A lot of topics can be learned here with zero previous knowledge. - Great practice exams! Better quality than average. These don't really replicate the feel of the actual exam, but do a great job of pounding in the knowledge you need for the actual exam and/or identify stuff you're not soaking up. - Practice tests come in the forms of a pre-assessment (75 questions), end of chapter practice questions (15 questions X 11 chapters), and then a final practice (75 questions). - End of chapter Reviews. The value of this can NOT be understated. End of chapter reviews are typically so useless in books; Not the case here. Gibson reiterates the exact knowledge you needed to pick up from the chapter you just read and serves it up extremely distilled. These are great to again use as a final review once you've finished book completely. Don't skip these, really! - Lots of ""real world"" examples for concepts covered, but I didn't find that particularly useful. - The book has bonus online materials, I didn't find much value in these. (I gather that the SY0-401 offering is more robust, so perhaps better online stuff will come for SY0-501). There are a couple of step-by-step labs on using a few tools like nslookup; These are worth doing. ###About The Exam - The questions on this exam are long and unnecessarily winding. A lot of the questions I received were three to five sentences long. They may insert something about what *Jack had for lunch* in the middle. - A good strategy, if you struggle with long confusing questions, is to first read what the options for answers are. If you know what your answer choices are first, it can often help you dissect a complicated question. - Questions often have what seems to be more than one correct answer. In those cases I found there is often a single *keyword* in the question you need to catch in re-reviewing what was asked. - CompTia has a practice of sometimes using similar words than what is common place. I suppose this is done to make sure you really understand a topic, not just something committed to memory. I had a few cases with this. For example you may read ""probability of a threat"" 10 times in materials and in the objectives, then you'll get a question where ""likelihood"" is the correct answer. This is a basic example, but illustrates my meaning. - The performance-based questions, in my experience, were not especially challenging. They aren't asking anything you don't know, and for me were simple drag and drop scenarios or pick from a droplist. I'd say 5 min time a piece is lots. Still save these for the end, don't even read them. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ##CySA+ CS0-001 ###Materials Used **Jason Dion Udemy Video Series** URL - This series is worth the money -&gt; often on sale. The quality of the videos is good, pretty clearly covers the material. - Jason covers the objectives in a very hard to follow way (ie. he doesn't cover the material in the same order as the Exam Objectives Document). And further seems to mix and match from different sub domains. This made it harder for me personally to learn from purely based on my studying methodology (see *Study Methodology* above). Some people may like the way the material is presented, and I'm sure JD has solid reasoning for presenting it this way. - The series covers material important to know, but not necessarily on the exam. So more than needed to pass, but not more than you need to know if you didn't already. &amp;nbsp; **CompTIA CySA+ Study Guide: Exam CS0-001** Sybex Book by Mike Chapple, David Seidl - This book does a good job of explaining concepts that you may not be familiar with. I appreciate the concise way it covers the material. - The book has a lot of typos/clerical mistakes. Even a few practice questions that have the wrong solution. Some people might point to the online errata, but I don't like the idea of paying for a book with so many mistakes. This book should have been reprinted with the fixes by now. - The review sections (dubbed ""exam essentials"") after each chapter are not very good. Compare to the Gibson book mentioned above and it blows these away in terms of usefulness. Similarly the chapter introduction and conclusion are just filler content. - As a bonus it compiles learning resources for Cybersecurity in general. For example introducing readers to Webgoat, Exploit-Exercises, OWASP Lab, or Metasploitable VMs. And has some end of chapter ""labs"" worth doing like running nmap, wireshark, and dd. - Also to note, it covers material in roughly the same order as the Exam Objectives Document. - It has 20 practice questions at the end of each chapter relevant to the material covered in the chapter. - Haven't used this before, but the Sybex/Wiley online portal is pretty good. There are 150 practice questions, and you can also do the chapter questions (20 questions x 12 chapters). The portal allows you to compile your own quizzes mixed from the chapters and practice exams, and also the ability to quiz just on the questions you get wrong in previous attempts. ###About the Exam - I found the questions on this exam to be much more straightforward. Not nearly as many of the long windy questions I found on Sec+. The answers were typically more clear cut as well. Rarely was there more than one answer that made sense. - I found that the materials I reviewed for study covered way more depth than the exam was looking for. I'm comparing this to my experience with Sec+ where my feeling is that the study materials covered things 1:1. In the case of CySA there is a ton of emphasis on stuff that is more just peripherally asked. This statement isn't specific enough to help you save time and energy, but just fyi. - The performance-based questions were very involved. These are not at all the same pace as the Sec+ ones. Questions may require analyzing the log outputs and command outputs of several servers/systems in order to answer a question. Compounding that difficulty, the display setups in the testing centers I visited arent typically conducive to reviewing a bulk of material like that. So strap in for some serious window dragging and management. Again these questions arent asking anything you dont know, but make it there business to create more of an exercise than really ask a question. I spent 20 min on a single performance-based question in this exam. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ##Whats the difference between Security+ and CySA+ Low Level, read the Objectives Docs. At a high level Security+ is extensive security training for an individual who is responsible for a network, system, or service at an organization where security is important, but that individual doesnt necessarily have Security in their Job Title or Description. The CySA+ is for an individual that does have security in their title and job description, and whose day to day focus and responsibility is cybersecurity. While I think these certifications are really two sides to the same coin, they dont necessarily follow one another as a progression, and aim to qualify different roles. ##The End This is the type of guide that would have helped me when I was deciding how to tackle the Certs and what materials I should use to study. Hope someone else gets value out of this. All opinion and personal experience, not necessarily facts. Good luck out there. "

I took the exam today and scored a 756. I do not have a strong background in IT. The most I have done is worked as a ScumCast (Comcast) installer. That doesnt take much brains. However, I am in school for Cybersecurity. I am 39 yrs old and trying to keep up with you youngsters that have been doing this type of thing for more than half your lives. The schools know this and expect it. This makes it tough for old people, as the beginner level is now well above my skill set, and I am now in my third term. Last term I started learning A+ material on TestOut. TestOut is ok, but I wouldnt use it exclusively. But, I did watch all the videos and take all the quizzes and do all the labs. Its overwhelming. What the school did not tell me was that there are two parts to the CompTIA. I really wish they told me that last term. I could have studied during my three-week break and taken the first part then focused this term on the second part. I did not learn this until a little over a week ago. We are now in week 8 of the term and the testing center does not allow computer based testing during finals week (I lose another week!). Here is what I did: I hopped on the internet and started finding forums and places for recommendations. Reddit served me well! I IMMEDIATELY bought Professor Messers notes and quiz for A+ 220  901. I did all of the questions and took notes on where I was weak and utilized his videos (which are great in comparison to TestOut. Clean cut and to the point). I also bought Mike Meyers CompTIA A+ Certification Exam Guide. I then used the TestOut facts at the end of each section to help focus on certain areas and used Professor Messer's notes as guide when using the Mike Meyers book (I skimmed through and only took time when I found areas I thought would be useful and/or were weak areas for me). I also made flashcards for the memorization portions i.e. port numbers, connector types, 802.11 specs, USB specs etc The exam wasnt that bad. 83 questions and I finished in plenty of time. Only two of the questions were labs and they were super easy. One was something like Mary wants you to connect her home network and only.blah blah. It was basically set a SSID, disable SSID broadcast, set password, set PIK, enable WPAS AES, filter MACand the platform makes it incredibly difficult to screw up! There were A LOT of printer and printer networking questions. Do know that stuff! A bunch of troubleshooting things, but kinda basic stuff. It was pretty straight forward. I hear a lot of what people say about get sleep and drink plenty of water. I recommend that too! During the exam I did not waste any time on questions that I KNEW I did not know the answer and some I didnt even really understand the question. On these questions I took a shot at the answer and THEN flagged it for review. Now, if I understood the question but wasnt sure about the answer then I flagged it and DID NOT answer the question. This proved to be a good time saver. At the end it will show you all the questions that are flagged and all the questions that are UNANSWERED. I hit the unanswered ones and had plenty of time to really think them out. I didnt even bother going back to the ones that I had no clue! Now, yes I did have a slight advantage having done the TestOut course. But that was months ago. Consider also that this term I am also studying for the 220  902, Linux+ LXO 103 and LXO 104, Swift XCode, and starting my CCNA studies. All of them require certification. I also am a single daddy of an awesome little 2 yr old boy that I raise on my own. However, I have military benes so I dont need to work. If you are serious, you can earn the A+ in a month. Be focused and resourceful. And DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT FAILED THE EXAM!!!!!! Listen to those that passed it. I hope this is helpful to at least one person. Good luck all! Put in the work and you will be happy you did. "

591,cybersecurity,CompTIA,CSA+/CySA+ Passed,27,7vqz1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/7vqz1n/csacysa_passed/,2018-02-07 08:53:08,"Passed the CSA+ (I hate calling it the CySA+, so I'll continue to call it the CSA+) with a 772/750. This exam was a good deal more difficult than I expected (I felt the same with Sec+). Background: I've got a few years of help desk experience, Sec+, and CCNA. Study Materials: I used The Sybex CSA+ Study Guide by Chapple and Seidl and Jason Dion's CSA+ Udemy course. As for the book, I think it is pretty good and covers most everything it needed to cover. The practice questions that come with the book are okay. Jason Dion's video series is a perfect companion for the Sybex book as he teaches the *exact same material* the Sybex book does, nearly word-for-word. This was nice as his slides helped me take notes (I find it more difficult to take notes out of textbooks without big headings, bulleted lists, etc.). Dion's course has a lot of grammatical errors, and he truncates some of the information on the slides, so having the Sybex book was beneficial to follow along with. I'd recommend both the Sybex book and Dion's video course. Lastly, I also bought Jason Dion's practice tests on Udemy. I would *not* recommend these. They are 5 practice exams with 30 questions each. Many of the questions are recycled and are far easier than what you will see on the exam. If Boson Ex-Sim is a 10 (comprehensive explanations, tough questions, solid product), I'd rate Dion's tests a 5. Exam Prep: I read the Sybex book cover-to-cover, watched all Dion's vids, and took all the Dion practice tests. I do not have any in-depth knowledge of or experience with the tools mentioned in the book (Wireshark, nmap, Splunk, Bro, etc.). Studying a few hours a day, I finished all the materials and took the test in about a month. The Exam: Like I said before, I felt this exam was tough, especially for those of us without any formal security experience. Most of the questions were situational (again, much like Sec+), and tricky--many times I felt there were two theoretically correct answers but of course CompTIA wants the ""best"" answer. There were some questions that require you to actually know linux commands (more than what were taught in the book), and commands/syntax for other tools listed in the exam objectives. This caught me a bit off guard, all the practice questions I had taken (from Dion's practice exams and the practice questions from the Sybex book) didn't require you to know exactly what a command meant and did in order to get the question correct--the question threw you a bone (this is a little tough to elaborate on without an example on hand--just know that most of these practice questions you can answer correctly if you just use your inference skills and know your common port numbers). On the test however, there were questions where you could not guess the right answer if you hadn't learned the specific tool or common commands. The simulations were pretty easy, don't fret about these. HOWEVER, I did have one sim that I believed was lacking a log report of some kind--there was definitely some information missing that I needed to answer certain questions about the sim. My proctor submitted an inquiry (or whatever) with Pearson about it when I brought it up during the exam. Finished the exam in two hours, about an hour longer than I thought I'd need. Advice: For those of you, like me, who have limited or no security experience, I would highly recommend taking a significant portion of your study time to learn Linux commands, nmap, Wireshark, and a few of the other tools that are mentioned (and we are talking about how to use the programs from a command line, none of that GUI stuff). Also, know how to read and interpret firewall logs--I didn't have a problem with these after the CCNA. If you fit the above category (limited sec exp), I'd also recommend using more than just one book and investing in some good practice tests. There isn't a ton of awesome study material out because the exam hasn't been around long enough to be vetted by thousands of test-takers and for authors to get a better handle of how to teach the content (or perhaps how much depth to go into). Thoughts on the exam/certification: Let me begin by saying that I have learned some useful things from studying for this exam like: How to read and interpret CVSS scores, the forensic process and tools, what do you do (formally) when a data breach happens and how to clean up the mess, and so forth. As many have said before, this like many of CompTIA's exams go a mile wide and an inch deep. This can be beneficial as it provides you with broad set of knowledge about security and helps you understand how all the ""pieces"" of security fit together (where do pen-testers come in, what sort of problems do Cybersecurity Analysts deal with, what is the boss's/sysadmin's/CEO's perspective on security, etc.). However, I had been hoping the exam would be more focused on the *analysis* of how to find threats, parse logs, etc. etc. Basically everything an aspiring Security Analyst would need to be successful at his or her job. But because CompTIA placed the CSA+ in between Sec+ and CASP, it had to have a lot of management-material to help bridge that gap. Who this exam is good for: This exam is great for the following groups of people: 1. The people whose Sec+ is getting ready to expire and you'd rather get the next cert in the Security track than spend $100 to recertify. 2. The people who want to take an intermediate step before taking the CASP/CISSP (though the SSCP might be a better bet if finances allow and you are wanting to take the CISSP). 3. You need a cert to get a gov't job due to the DoD 8570--I'm pretty sure the CSA+ is the cheapest cert (by a fair margin I'd add) in its class (CSSP anything other than Manager). Lastly, I have seen some questions about whether or not to skip the Sec+ and go to the CSA+. I would say no, do not skip the Sec+ as it covers some important topics not at all discussed in the CSA+. TL;DR Tough exam, probably harder than you'd expect unless you have security experience. More focus on the managerial side than analysis. Feel free to ask any questions, I will answer them to the best of my ability. "

I had until the 20th of this month before my trifecta expired. Like I tend to do, I started to freak out about the exams due to the Practice tests, but honestly it wasn't that bad. The worst part of the exam was the simulations, which I am pretty sure judging by my report, are what I missed on. What I used to study. My first resource that I picked up was the GTSLearning CSA+ Printed Courseware ($65). I do think this is a good resources, but if I pick up a GTS resource again, I will most likley add the live labs to go with it. The book is designed around a 5 day bootcamp. I think it covered most of the material pretty well. As my time grew closer and feeling that I didn't know the material enough, I picked up the [CSA book by Fernando Maymi and Brent Chapman](URL I really liked the way they presented the information. I read about a chapter or two a day and did the questions at the end of each chapter. This book made me feel more confident in my knowledge. I also downloaded the CISSP videos/mp3 from [Cybrary.it](URL and listened to those while I drove around for work. I'm pretty sure most of this is way over the knowledge base for the CSA. Things to really make sure you understand... * Logs, LOGS, LOGS!!! make sure you know how to read firewall logs, syslogs, event logs, etc. I think the Fernando book does a good job on this. * While Section 1.0 Threat Management claims to be 27% of the exam, I think I saw more questions dealing with Section 3.0 - Cyber Incident Response.

Thanks Prof. Messer! I hope this isnt too long, but these sorts of Meta/Macro level posts helped me as Im getting ready for the test so Id like to return the favor. First, Im glad its over. It was a tough test and like many others I felt like I was failing the whole time. I had about 3 minutes left on the timer after my review. I wont get into specifics about the test but I only had a couple sims and they were relatively easy. I flagged about 11 questions and made educated guesses on those. I only really blindly chose on 1 or two questions. I was worried about subnetting but the questions on the test were pretty straightforward. A bit about me and my background: Currently enrolled in a Cybersecurity program at a local college. I have my BA in a non-IT field, but for the past 4 years Ive been working in IT as a hybrid Desktop Support/Jr. Sys. Admin role. I took (and passed) the A+ back when it was the 801/802, though its now expired. I have only had a bit of networking experience, but my experience in day to day IT work gave me a bit of context. I will say studying for the test really pointed out the things I didnt knowand there was a lot of stuff I didnt know. Over the past 2 1/2 months I used Network+ Guide to Networks (read more than twice, good book IMO), Transcender Labs (very good, difficult), Pocket Prep (good for narrowing down your weaknesses), Professor Messer Videos (listened to on 1.25,1.5 speed), Professor Messer Study guide (very good for a last week refresher), Professor Messer Pop Quizzes, random Google searches on things I needed real world context on. Then Quizlet for flash cards. Probably took around 1000 practice questions in total. With a baby, full time job, the holidays and other obligations it was pretty difficult to find time to study during this time period. Id read a chapter or two a day/watch a couple videos at work, try to carve out some times on the weekends. Even so I couldnt really say how many hours I spent studying, although if I had to guess it would be around 70-80 hoursso close to an hour a day. Tips There really are no shortcuts. You need to know your stuff. The goal of the exam shouldnt be just to pass, but to understand why; how the OSI model works and how data moves/flows through it. Second is you have to memorize a LOT of stuff through the entirety of networking. As others have pointed out, inch deep, mile wide. This is where things like Prof. Messers Study Guides are invaluable. You just need to bear down and do it. Things that you dont know, you need to go back and try to get it to stick. This is where practice tests are invaluable, to show you where you need to improve. Next, multiple choice tests, especially CompTIA tests can be broken down a bit with a few strategies. A majority of the questions are wordy, so slow down and break it down. Usually the answer is within the question... or a question later in the test. Some of them might seem tricky, i.e., the MOST correct answer might not even be listed in the list of answers, but it asks for the BEST. But none seemed confusing as far as I can recall. You can also usually get rid of one and, most times, two questions leaving you with a 50/50 chance. A good percentage of my questions had me taking the test in this way. I only had a handful of questions that were obvious and quickly answered. If a question was wordy or I was not sure in a decent amount of time, Id flag it and move on. Lastly Id like to thank Professor Messer as I know he comes around here from time to time. The guy is a machine and his videos and study guides helped me back when I took the A+ and now the N+. It made it that much easier to pass, and I plan on using his materials along with others when I get my Security+ in the coming months. Well, it looks like this post is a bit longer than I would have liked, but if you have any questions let me know. Good luck to anyone taking their test soon! "

I figured I would share my study tools for anyone else that is looking to change careers, or get a start in IT. I passed each exam on the first try, and I'll list what I used to study for each exam. For A+ I used the Mike Meyers book, Professor Messer's youtube series, and the practice tests from Get Certified Get Ahead. For Server+ there wasn't a lot of material available, but the All-In-One book by Daniel Lachance was great and was enough to get a pretty high passing score. For Security+ I used the materials that most people recommend here for it. I bought the Mike Meyers book, watched Professor Messer's youtube series, and I used the GCGA 100 question practice tests, flashcards, and performance based practice questions. I studied everyday for about 4 hours each day to avoid burnout, and I made sure to take practice exams each day for A+ and Security+ to gauge my progress. For Server+ I did all of the hands-on exercises included in the book. I am hoping to get a position in Cybersecurity, so CSA+ is my next cert. I'm hoping to be ready to test in a month or so. I welcome any questions that won't violate the NDA, and I would be very grateful for any tips, advice, or good study tools for CSA+."

I searched past posts and the wiki for answers about someone looking for a job that already has a Secret Security Clearance (as that seems to be a big deal), but I was unable to find any. Currently, I work armed security as a security guard. It's easy work but it's not fulfilling at all. I love computers and I've always felt I would be happier working in an IT capacity (specifically cybersecurity or networking/servers, but at this point I'm not picky). Because of this, I have decided to start preparing for the Sec+ cert. This sub has been an amazing resource for me as I've researched how to study and what materials I should use. My issue is I have technically no experience working in IT that I could put on a resume. I have a BA in Liberal Arts with a concentration in Criminal Justice. I have military experience (still in the National Guard actually), some of which I've worked with Army computer systems, just nothing that would transfer over to the civilian world. I have experience working in physical security, most of which I was armed. And I've also held a Secret Security Clearance for over 6 years. Assuming I get my Sec+ cert in a month, what sort of jobs should I look into if I want to make IT a career and how well do they pay?

My background: I am currently a junior in a five year program at a public university majoring in IT with a Cybersecurity track. I also am a member of rotc there and am in a cyber unit with the national guard as a cadet. I have gone to a couple of Army based trainings including Advanced Cyber Education at Wright-Patt and Introduction to Cyber Threat Analysis. I am also interning at a large appliance manufacturer doing IT project management. I received my Sec+ back in February and am in the middle of working on OSCP. I found a voucher on a site called getcertified4less.com that was around 270 so I figured why not. To study I watched some videos on plural sight related to the [exam objectives outlined by CompTia](URL used a hefty amount of Google, and then also studied the acronym list CompTIA gives to you. (I should have studied the acronym list more, as not knowing some of them came back to bite me during the exam). The practical experience from OSCP and my other courses helped a great deal, knowing how to break things is the best way to know how to fix them. Since CSA+ is fairly new, there are not too many sources for studying the exam material specifically out there. I was unable to find any (free) practice exams. On to the actual test, this was more difficult than Sec+ (as is expected). I enjoyed the test and the practical applications of it. The simulations were well made, and challenging. I don't want to get too specific for fear of divulging exam details. Just make sure you know what things look like when you would see them in the real world, rather than just what they would do. This is very much a practical application based test, rather than a vocabulary test. Understand incident response. Since this is a cyber analyst course, looking into analytical skills will also benefit you. Think about how you would logically prioritize things if something went down. As with any test, I recommend going in calm and cool, it won't help to be nervous. If you guys have any other questions feel free to ask, I apologize for the vagueness, don't want to divulge too much and get my cert taken away haha "

My advice is to memorize the Windows command line tools as well as the Linux commands; you will definitely need to know them (switches are pretty important too). I used Professor Messer's videos and notes, the Jean Andrews A+ Guide to IT Technical Support book, and the Mike Meyers All-in-One. I only used CertMaster this time for practice tests, as it is designed by CompTIA and is the closest you will get to the real deal.

I am currently an 11th grade student, and I attend our districts Career Center for Cybersecurity. We have the opportunity to earn up to 9 certifications over the two year course period. Currently I am the only one who is even near getting their A+, and that's due to two things, one, the other students don't care, and two, because I have been working hard, and have been doing computer repair and building for about 10 years. So I have a bit of a head start in a sense. Anyways, I currently have access to the following resources through my program: Lynda.com, TestOut, Professor Messer(of course), Cisco Netacad, and Cybrary (another well known free resource). I have finished the Netacad IT Essentials with a 92% on the final, and have taken the two practice exams for the 901 and 902 without any issues. I moved on to using TestOut as well (I've been using it off and on, because of all of the competitions we have done), and have been taking the practice exams on there as well through the PC Pro course. Because of the nature of the TestOut exams being random and not as easy as the Netacad ones, naturally I scored lower than the ones on Netacad. Here are the results of some of the practice 901 and 902 exams on TestOut: URL and URL (Those are links to google drive copys of the exam results). My weakest point on the 901 seems to be networking, so I have been watching Lynda.com videos by Mike Meyers on the 901 and 902 exams, and feel like I have gained a bit more knowledge, but most of what was taught, I already knew. So, I went to TestOut, and have been watching the videos for networking, and they go a bit more into detail, but I still feel like I'm not confident in my knowledge in that area. I want to know what the best way is, that you have found, to study and learn new material, or at least polish up your knowledge? I am almost there, I just need to polish up a few of the areas, and then work on studying the 902 material, and I will be ready to take the A+. Thank you all for any feedback!! ~Kalil "

627,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Passed Sec+ and Net+ this week,11,5hecpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/5hecpf/passed_sec_and_net_this_week/,2016-12-10 02:31:54,"I have the triad now! :) Skip down to the study materials if you dgaf about my story. I have no professional IT experience. I enrolled in community college last year, and didn't transition into the IT program until this past January. I took the 801/802 in May. Because I've been taking college courses, the biggest chunk of my study materials aren't free. I spent the 16 week semester lazily reading the textbook for my Sec+ class, and doing the TestOut coursework for Net+. One week before my exams, I sat down and REALLY started studying. It was basically a 7 day cram-fest with a day or two for a brain-rest. I did **practice tests &gt; study wrong answers &gt; repeat.** If I could go back and change anything, I would try to schedule my exams further apart. I had one on Wednesday and the other yesterday. It's nice to have them out of the way, but I would have liked to give each more attention. I only passed by 20-30 points, which is too close to failing for my comfort! Apparently December is a busy time for Pearsonvue testing centers. Availability was either this week, or mid-January. Yikes. I have classes next semester, and that would be too much for me, personally. Here are my study materials: **Sec+** * **Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals--** covered a lot of material I saw on the test. I made sure to do the chapter review questions. * **Certblaster--** I used this for my practice tests. It was alright, but I felt like it wasn't similar enough to the exam. I thought for sure I failed the exam because a lot of the questions were unfamiliar. It could use more simulations for sure, but I guess it was enough since I passed! * **Professer Messer videos/notes--** I didn't have enough time to watch a lot of videos, and I only read through his thirty-something page notes once. In my opinion, these were only good for supplemental help, not primary study-resources. * **Darril Gibson Security+ app--** I panicked and bought this for flash cards and practice questions while I was on-the-go. Again, supplemental, don't use this as your only source of practice questions. * **Testout Network+ --**One thing I've learned from taking all these college courses is a handful of information between these CompTIA exams overlaps. I re-did the Network Security section of Testout to help review. My advice for Sec+ is to buy a textbook and give yourself time to read it cover to cover. There's not a lot of straight-forward material to memorize like there was for A+. It was almost ALL situations where you need to know what the BEST thing to do is. I can vouch for the textbook I read to prepare, but I know I've seen other books mentioned around the sub. **Net+** * **Testout--** By the end of the semester, I definitely needed to review some earlier sections...This is the practice exam QUEEN. I wish it wasn't so damn expensive. The domain tests and practice exam were a lifesaver. I also didn't realize how much I missed Rob Tracey until the lady in the red shirt was given all the hardest sections to cover, lol. * **Darril Gibson Net+ app--** Also a panic purchase. The questions are simpler than the ones on the exam, but more helpful (I felt) than his Sec+ app. You can find comparable flash cards for free on quizlet. * **Professer Messer notes/videos--** My poor notes were flimsy by the end. I used it a LOT. I also used the back pages to write down my own notes from Testout, and used it as my main study guide. Of course, there were things on the test that either weren't mention in his notes, or were very vague and I had to look it up online anyway. Use Messer as a supplement, get a variety of practice tests. For those looking for tips on Net+, all I can say is memorize what you can and make sure you're comfortable with troubleshooting :) I honestly can't say which I thought was easier between the two, but I can say that I found Net+ to be a little more straightforward than Sec+. Hopefully this helps someone. I know I browse this sub before my exams to ease my own stress. Good luck!! I would relax now, but I was accepted into Cisco's Cybersecurity scholarship program, and that starts...today. Oh boy "
628,cybersecurity,CompTIA,Just passed Sec+ SYO-401...my thoughts,12,54l8ns,https://www.reddit.com/r/CompTIA/comments/54l8ns/just_passed_sec_syo401my_thoughts/,2016-09-27 01:49:10,"Background: used/built computers since I was a kid (23 now), took IT courses in high school and I have a 4 year degree in cybersecurity. What I did to study: Read a [study guide](URL from cover to cover and then skimmed it again. Did the quizzes in the book and some practice tests online. Watched professor Messer during my lunch breaks. I passed the sec+ test over the weekend, and I have to say, the performance based questions suck. Not because they are difficult, but because they are structured terribly and the UI is garbage for the more technical questions. The 'regular', non performance based questions, are pretty decent. I like how almost every question is a mini scenario and you have to apply what you know to figure out the best answer. There may be multiple right answers but you need to pick the best answer that fits best security practices. My advice: Really learn the material. Don't just memorize the ports, protocols, etc., because you might not be asked just to spell out an acronym. I did not get a single basic question like that. You really have to know the material and be able to apply all of the objectives to a given scenario. Examcompass does a good job of this. Also, don't pick a testing center in a low income area. I unknowingly did and the chairs were pretty bad. Not sure if this is common for all testing centers, just a thought. Finally, believe in yourself and you will succeed."

Did OK on 901 and 902, but I finished Security+ feeling like I had failed. I was shocked when the computer revealed my score was an 856. Any ideas what to do next to get started on a Information Security career? I don't have an IT background, I'm taking these certs as part of a career shift from Army Infantry to Information Security. I am also working on an Information Security graduate degree (University of South Florida CyberSecurity degree with concentration in Information Assurance), and I expect to graduate by December. For A+ Professor Messer was a god-send. I also took the crucialexams.com and examcompass.com practices tests over and over again. Total study time for both tests was just under two months. When I took Security+ I found that Professor Messer wasn't very helpful, he gave an okay general background of most topics, but he failed to deliver the level of detail needed for the test. I think if you have experience in the field you don't really need to bother with his video course (though his study groups probably would be helpful, there were some good questions and explanations in them). For this test I signed up for CertMaster, and I felt it was helpful, it really let me know to what level of knowledge and understanding the test would require. Because of my lack of IT background I was hopeless with questions that would ask which was the BEST option or other similar questions. I went through all the sections, then the day before the test I hit them again with the ""smart refresh"" which only gave me the questions I had missed previously. I also looked through Darril Gibson's Security+ Get Certified Get Ahead. That was a much better reference than Professor Messer, and I went through most of the practice tests at least once. And again I made use of examcompass.com and crucialexams.com. Total study time, about two and a half weeks. Will these certs help with getting employers to ignore the gaping hole that is my IT experience? I would really appreciate any advice for a guy that has zero IT experience, a masters in cybersecurity, and a couple of certificates. I really need to get a decent job by the time I graduate in December. "

Would it be realistic or useful to get some certs right now? I feel like they would be a boost to my resume and provide me with some useful information, specifically Network+ and Security+. As of right now, I'm in my sophomore year. Is it possible to study and pass these with no experience and little formal education (so far) on networks?"

I thought that the experience would be able to pull me through, but applying out to summer internships many of the applications have required boxes that ask for certifications, thus essentially preventing me from really applying to these opportunities. So I was hoping I could take some time during this semester to sit down and study for like a month or two and try and get A+, Sec+, Net+ as a cert spree... is that logical? possible? I'm familiar with most of the concepts as I have taken some introductory networking classes, hardware classes, and I'm finishing up this cybersecurity class on technologies and policy management. I've found some great resources here as well as Messer and Mike Meyers that I do plan on going through over the weekends. I'm sure I could get A+, but I'm not sure about Sec+ and Net+ because I see there are people here that have been in the industry longer than I have and still struggle so I'm not sure if it's even worth the money if I'm probably going to fail. Considering CompTIA are typically the gateway and lowest tier cert, I might as well be getting them eventually."

My teacher said I could probably pass A+ with the knowledge I gained from doing that for two years, but I decided to join the Army Reserve and major in computer engineering at my state university instead. After graduating and being deployed for a bit I went to college. My third semester, I flunked calculus 3 and changed my major to general education while trying to figure what I wanted to do. While I was doing this, I also had a part-time job at a small tech startup that did physical network security, like making devices that monitored the temperature and humidity in server rooms. I got fired from that job for forgetting to show up for a shift. This was in 2006. After that, I worked food service for five years until I got my ""big idea"" of following a dream of getting into the film industry. I graduated from a fancy for-profit diploma mill with a bachelor's in liberal arts, and got a job as a video editor with awful hours that paid barely above minimum wage. This was in 2013. Seeing no room for advancement and having student loan bills pile up, I went back to food service, where I am now. Looking back, I regret not taking my high school teacher's advice and just getting certs and trying to find something in an IT entry-level job and work up from there. I bought an A+ study guide (Mike Meyer's All-In-One) and a lot of it was coming back to me. I also watched a few of the Network+ and Security+ training videos and they looked extremely interesting as well. So here are my questions: What sort of entry-level jobs can I expect with a Bachelor's in liberal arts and A+, Net+, and Security+ certs? What is the pay like? How difficult are these jobs to get? What is the interview process like? What's it like moving up? How hard is it to move up? When do I get a six-figure salary doing cybersecurity? ;) I would love to hear personal anecdotes of how people got into the IT industry, especially in security fields, and what their career experiences are like. I have a knack for technical stuff, so I feel like I am going to go insane if I stay in food service for much longer. EDIT: If this is the wrong place to ask, if someone could point me in the right direction, that would be super."

My questions are, for the I.T. professionals of this subreddit, how do you feel about my choice of degree in the long term, and how you feel about me pursuing a cert or two before my classes begin? I'm currently studying the material for Security+. I know I directed my questions for I.T. professionals, but I would appreciate the opinions of anyone at all. Thanks, folks :) "
