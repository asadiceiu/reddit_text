Let Buglab Rescue You!,50,970we8,https://www.reddit.com/r/buglabProject/comments/970we8/worried_about_cybersecurity_let_buglab_rescue_you/,2018-08-14 04:38:26,"*The 6th largest crypto exchange Bithumb was hacked and $30 million was stolen by the hackers*. Sounds familiar? Most probably, because this just happened a few weeks ago. Companies, both large and small are at a risk of being hacked. Even if as an individual, you do not own a company, you definitely do use services and products offered by these companies that are at risk, so this concerns everyone. This is because the demand for cybersecurity professionals immensely exceeds supply as hackers are advancing minute by minute. The Global Information Security Workforce Study 2017 report from Frost &amp; Sullivan and the International Information Systems Security Certifications Consortium Inc. states that unfilled jobs in Cybersecurity will be over 1.8 million by 2022. This should worry you as every company will be at risk as personal data, even customer data will definitely be vulnerable as by 2025, it is estimated that there will be 50 billion devices online. The security issue is not even farfetched because just two years ago, there was an email leak during the U.S. presidential elections that portrayed the Democratic party in a negative light. This shows that hacking is a problem, not only for existing software companies, but also for blockchain companies. This is a problem, but Buglab has a solution! **Buglab?** According to the Founder and CEO, Reda Cherqaoui, Buglab is *An affordable penetration testing for small and medium businesses. We are proud to say cybersecurity. What we are doing is that we are connecting a community of cybersecurity researchers which are certified and hand selected with customers who have needs in cybersecurity*, he added during an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. In essence, Buglab aims to helps companies in different fields such as IT, financial services, or retail to identify and mitigate cybersecurity gaps in their systems. The platform is meant to detect vulnerabilities on these companies websites, smart contracts, IoT devices and mobile applications by performing penetration tests. **How do they do this?** Whoever said cybersecurity penetration is not fun, definitely has not heard of Buglabs penetration testing contests: *Typically we are turning penetration testing into contests. We are creating a competition whereby the cybersecurity researchers challenge each other in order to be the first three with the highest score in vulnerabilities reported. Those top 3 researchers get awarded 70% of the contest prize. The first one will get 40%, second will get 20%, third gets 10%. The platform also enables clients to give some customer rewards to those researchers that did not win the contest who may have found critical vulnerabilities that were not found by the top three.* Reda Cherqaoui at the Blockchain Economic Forum in an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. The Buglab penetration contest enables all companies to use the platform work with a community of certified cybersecurity penetration testers who get incentivized for it. This is done in a form of a race so the clients are sure to receive fast and credible results. The testers can be independent or a group of less than five from a validated company. **As a Company, how do I go about this?** No matter how big or small, all companies are welcome to use the Buglab platform. The following steps show how easy it is to get your company pentested by cybersecurity professionals: 1. Sign up on the platform and provide information about the company; goods and services it provides then subscribe to competition contract choosing personalized rules the company would like to set. It is possible to customize competition confidentiality, type of management wanted, contest cost depending on the chosen plan and an option bonus. 2. Based on the set confidentiality, the client chooses from a list of pentesters in the community and the Buglab recommendation engine helps to assign a proper match. 3. Chosen pentesters test the companys system and submit a report. The scoring system encourages pentesters to be the first to submit vulnerabilities as the maximum amount discovered gets the highest score. **What are the core features behind Buglab?** * ***Public Contests:*** After the company provides required information and launches contest, the community receives an invitation to participate. * ***Private Contests:*** Clients can choose pentesters from the community or a team from a validated cybersecurity company to solve their problem. * ***Selection features:*** Clients can choose pentesters using different filters like country, skill set, scores etc * ***Triage System:*** *Reported vulnerabilities go through a sorting system on the platform to identify duplicates before reaching the client. This reduces redundancy and gives the client relevant information only.* * ***Reports*****:** The clients receive reports on the security contest with summarized performance. This will help the client compare security status and assets progress. * ***Client-Managed:*** Clients can choose their own contest management from Basic, Pro or Enterprise. * ***Mediation***: In the case of a client managing the contest themselves, they may ask for mediation from Buglab. This happens if a pentester feels that the score or evaluation was unfair so Buglab will mediate the situation. * ***Leader-board:*** This shows a ranking of pentesters according to their scores and experience. This makes it easier for clients to pick star pentesters. * ***Chat:*** Every report gives a chance for clients to chat with pentesters to get help fixing the vulnerabilities. * ***Fix Companion:*** A company that chooses Enterprise level has the opportunity to let Buglab verify whether the fix has been implemented. The Buglab pentester contest is just one offering from the company. There is another offering, specifically for Whitehats under the Vigilante Protocol. **Vigilante protocol?** The Vigilante protocol is an integrated hacking prevention program. Under this, whitehat researchers report vulnerabilities about companies that are not on the Buglab platform. Companies are then invited to reward the whitehats for the discovered vulnerabilities. Essentially, companies get to know their flaws at a minimum cost. The way in which this works as explained by Reda Cherqaoui is that: *It allows whitehat hackers globally to report vulnerabilities to Buglab. These vulnerabilities are of companies that are not on our platform and in partnership with Cert and CSirt they contact those companies to help them fix their vulnerabilities.* Buglab also recently announced that they plan to secure cryptocurrency exchanges by hosting contests with a reward pool on $2 million. ***Why partner with Cert and CSirt in the first place?*** *When a white hat reports a vulnerability to us; if we check if this vulnerability exists or not, we need to test it by exploiting it and if we do that its illegal. So if they do that, its legal and thats why they are in partnership. So when the cert and CSirt confirm that the vulnerability exists, the whitehat hacker receives some tokens from the vigilante protocol reserve in which the company puts funds.* The company helped can choose to reward the hacker or host a contest on the Buglab platform. Since the whitehat is the one that brought the company on board, they receive 2% of the service fee. The whitehat will be allowed to participate even without a pentester status. **Why focus on whitehats?** Normally, people are not allowed to do this as they have no authorization from the company to perform those tests and find vulnerabilities. When they do it, they protect their identity in many ways like having journalists be the intermediary between themselves and the vulnerable company as they cannot contact the companies directly. There are currently cases of people who have critical vulnerabilities data on really big companies but they cannot communicate with nor contact the companies to help them because they are afraid. Whitehats normally do not get money from reporting this vulnerabilities so they decide to just keep them and do nothing about it. However, if a blackhat discovers a vulnerability, they will just steal the data and sell it on the black market, deface the website or do something bad for the company. There is a gap here and there is something to do for whitehats. ***There are thousands of Russian Companies doing exactly this- cybersecurity penetration tests. What makes Buglab different?*** Currently, available penetration testing services are not viable for small and medium companies. Penetration tests performed by cyber security consulting firms require clients to pay in regards to total billable hours. Moreover, only one or two pentesters do the job. This means that, regardless of the results the company will pay close to $100 per hour with only limited pentesters on the job. The end result is often a report in a PDF format and doesnt facilitate the fixing of the vulnerability or getting more details about the vulnerability from the pentesters. Secondly, bug bounty challenges require clients to pay according to each vulnerability found. Vulnerabilities discovered are sometimes not in the budget of the company in regards to resources. From these tests, the client might get irrelevant results as flaws are researched without deep research. At the end of the day, a client will just receive flaws without any value for their company. Another reason raised by Reda Cherqaoui in regards to bounties is that: *Big businesses can afford to do this because they know their level of security. So, they can afford running a bounty because they know people will not find 1001 vulnerabilities. Small and Medium businesses dont normally perform penetration tests; so imagine if you end up receiving 101 vulnerabilities, each worth about $100. Thats more expensive.* **What is the revenue model?** In Buglab, 70% of the contest fee goes towards the top three pentesters, while 19% goes to the company itself. 1% is for Buglab transaction reserve that is used to pay transaction on the blockchain and 10% is for the vigilante protocol reserve so as to pay whitehats. **What about the ICO?** Status: Whitelist phase with over 1600 whitelisted people Pre-sale: June 30th 2018 High target cap: 20,000,000 Soft cap: 6,000,000 Total tokens: 425 million tokens and 40% dedicated to the token sale. **Any final words for the Buglab community?** Reda Cherqaoui has very short but powerful words for the Buglab community: *Something good is coming. Check the website and be updated* If you still have not joined the Buglab community, what are you really waiting for? The future is exciting, but it also seems scary because we dont know whos next in regards to being hacked. In order to avoid being the next future statistic, do the right thing and protect yourself using Buglab. "
1,vulnerability,buglabProject,Buglab protection serves both indiviidual and corporate entities asset : Comcast Xfinity of more than 26.5 million Customers Partial Data Exposed,20,970wka,https://www.reddit.com/r/buglabProject/comments/970wka/buglab_protection_serves_both_indiviidual_and/,2018-08-14 04:38:57,"URL The partial home addresses and social security numbers of more than 26.5 million customers of Comcast Xfinity were exposed due to the companys shoddy security. A report by BuzzFeed News revealed that a vulnerability was discovered within the online customer portal of the high-speed internet service provider. Ryan Stevenson, a security researcher was the individual who discovered the issue. Apparently, this vulnerability could essentially let unauthorized parties determine customers partial home addresses. The in-home authentication page where customers can access their Comcast bills without having to actually log into their accounts was where the flaw was uncovered. The purpose of in-home authentication (aka IP authentication, HBA, or Home-based Authentication) is to decrease the amount of requested password resets and to decrease the amount of friction for Xfinity customers trying to access their accounts. On the webpage, a list of four partial addresses is displayed and customers are requested to select their home address from that list in order to verify their accounts. When the right address is selected, the user gains access to their Xfinity billing account. The correct address of a webpage visitor is determined by the users IP address. Stevenson was essentially able to alter the X-Forwarded-For header in Xfinitys request, thereby tricking the company by spoofing a customers home address. Then, with repeated refreshing of the log-in page, three of the partial addresses suggested by Comcast would actually change, and the only one that stayed the same would be the correct onethe one that belongs to the targeted user. Now, a hacker would have access to the first digit and first three letters of the Xfinity customers home address. They could then possibly use an IP lookup website to uncover the Comcast customers state, city and zip code from that partial address data"

This team must consist of at least five pentestres. The project has the following characteristics: After the general information and launch of the contest, which the firm will present, the community receives an invitation to participate. The clients of the project have the right to independently select some pentester or to attract an excellent team from the famous company that deals with cybersecurity. Including: the state, qualification and so on. Before the presence on the information panel of the participants of the vulnerabilities, which are indicated in the reports, are checked, sorted, and then the repetitions are eliminated. Clients come from the notice only about those reports, which for him are considered the most relevant. Firms receive reports on the bridges of their competitions. As a consequence, firms receive summaries of all competitions, and the client has the right to compare the safety assessment ratings on the schedule, and to evaluate the results. Firms are given at their discretion three types of management of competitions. So, for example, in Corporate, only the client will be responsible for sorting reports. In the event that the client decided to manage his own competition independently, then any pentester can apply to the project so that he becomes an intermediary. This is useful if the pentester considers erroneous points awarded or it seems that the validation results were incorrect. The project team will receive information that relates to the dispute and will be able to evaluate it. In the informative panel, the client can find ratings of pentester taking into account their experience, as well as the results of the project. Thus, the best pentester will be most noticeable, and the selection of participants in a closed competition will be simplified. Due to the vulnerability reports, customers can chat with the pentester, ask them for help in resolving a particular problem."

A new [blockchain based platform](URL is aiming to decentralize cybersecurity, using white-hat hackers to protect small to medium sized businesses. Buglab offers these businesses and organizations a solution that identifies and eliminates vulnerabilities in a wide range of systems, from [mobile applications](URL websites, and business applications, to smart contracts and Internet of Things devices. In order to decentralize this process, Buglab turns penetration testing into challenges, which are referred to on the Buglab platform as contests that are intended to attract independent security consultants that possess certified qualifications. Based in France, **Buglab** is [built on the blockchain](URL and works in a relatively straightforward manner. Instead of waiting for hackers to attack them and compromise their security, users of the Buglab platform will be able to invite white hat hackers to hack them first and notify them of their security flaws. ## How Buglab Works *Buglab* contests work simply by inviting a community of professional cybersecurity experts to [find vulnerabilities](URL in their mobile apps, websites, smart contracts, and IoT devices. Penetration testers operating on the Buglab platform are subject to a lengthy validation and vetting process, after which they are free to attempt to crack the devices and platforms Buglab users make available for testing.

Its done as a race against time. Users of Buglab are able to select from a number of different options when presenting their platforms and devices for pentesting. Its possible to either engage the services of the Buglab community as a whole, or select a validated team from a reputable pentesting company. ## Buglab Features Buglab offers a range of features that make it possible for users to customize their pentesting approach. Public contests are created by companies that outline their pentesting stipulations and invite the entire Buglab community, whereas Private contests make it possible to select a smaller group of testers. The platform also offers selection filters that allow users to filter applicants by country, skill score, area, and overall user score. A fix companion function also allows the Buglab team to verify that fixes created by pentesting have been implemented by further testing of the vulnerability. Buglab also offers a vigilante protocol that enables white [hat hackers](URL to notify organizations that are not using the Buglab platform of vulnerabilities that they may not be aware of. This program is intended to allow white hat hackers to share information in an ethical and sustainable manner. Billing on the Buglab platform is upfront, transparent, and provides fixed-price services for small to medium size businesses and, in the case that no vulnerabilities are found, Buglab provides a full refund. Overall the Buglab platform is set to become the future of pentesting.

Teams must include no fewer than five pentesters. A variety of customizations are available, specific to your organizational needs. Some of the features envisioned are highlighted next. **Public Contest :** Once a company has provided basic information and launched the contest, the community receives a public invitation to participate. **Private Contest :** Clients also have the option to choose a select number of pentesters from the community or choose a validated team from a known cybersecurity firm to complete the challenge **Selection Filters :** Clients have the option during a private challenge of selecting pentesters using different filters. These include country, score, skillset, etc. **Triage System :** Vulnerabilities reported go through our sorting system to identify duplicates before landing on the customers dashboard. The customer is guaranteed to only get notified about relevant submissions **Reports :** The company receives reporting on its security contests. This feature summarizes each contests performance and allows the client to graphically compare the security status and progress of its assets. **Client-Managed :** The company can choose from three types of contest management (Basic, Pro, and Enterprise). In the case of the latter, the client is responsible for sorting, classifying and grading reports. **Mediation :** When a customer opts to manage their challenge themselves, a pentester from the community can ask for mediation from Buglab. This mediation may be required in the event that a pentester deems the score or validation to be inaccurate. A Buglab team can obtain details regarding the cause of the disagreement and evaluate it impartially **Leaderboard :** A dashboard offers ranking of pentesters from the community according to experience and results on the platform. This provides greater visibility for the best pentesters and makes it easier to select participants for a private challenge. **Chat :** Every vulnerability report is a chance to engage in conversation with pentesters and to obtain their help fixing it. Fix Companion : At the Enterprise level, Buglab will verify that the fix has been implemented. # Vigilante Protocol In addition to rolling out contests for enterprises of varying scales, Buglab is introducing a globally integrated hacking prevention program named the Buglab Vigilante Protocol. Its a system that allows whitehat researchers to report on system vulnerabilities of a company that isnt one of our platforms customers. We invite companies to reward the whitehats in the form of optional tips or gratuity when they discover flaws.

These vulnerabilities are of companies that are not on our platform and in partnership with Cert and CSirt they contact those companies to help them fix their vulnerabilities.* Buglab also recently announced that they plan to secure cryptocurrency exchanges by hosting contests with a reward pool on $2 million. ***Why partner with Cert and CSirt in the first place?*** *When a white hat reports a vulnerability to us; if we check if this vulnerability exists or not, we need to test it by exploiting it and if we do that its illegal. So if they do that, its legal and thats why they are in partnership. So when the cert and CSirt confirm that the vulnerability exists, the whitehat hacker receives some tokens from the vigilante protocol reserve in which the company puts funds.* The company helped can choose to reward the hacker or host a contest on the Buglab platform. Since the whitehat is the one that brought the company on board, they receive 2% of the service fee. The whitehat will be allowed to participate even without a pentester status. **Why focus on whitehats?** Normally, people are not allowed to do this as they have no authorization from the company to perform those tests and find vulnerabilities. When they do it, they protect their identity in many ways like having journalists be the intermediary between themselves and the vulnerable company as they cannot contact the companies directly. There are currently cases of people who have critical vulnerabilities data on really big companies but they cannot communicate with nor contact the companies to help them because they are afraid. Whitehats normally do not get money from reporting this vulnerabilities so they decide to just keep them and do nothing about it. However, if a blackhat discovers a vulnerability, they will just steal the data and sell it on the black market, deface the website or do something bad for the company. There is a gap here and there is something to do for whitehats. ***There are thousands of Russian Companies doing exactly this- cybersecurity penetration tests. What makes Buglab different?*** Currently, available penetration testing services are not viable for small and medium companies. Penetration tests performed by cyber security consulting firms require clients to pay in regards to total billable hours. Moreover, only one or two pentesters do the job. This means that, regardless of the results the company will pay close to $100 per hour with only limited pentesters on the job. The end result is often a report in a PDF format and doesnt facilitate the fixing of the vulnerability or getting more details about the vulnerability from the pentesters. Secondly, bug bounty challenges require clients to pay according to each vulnerability found. Vulnerabilities discovered are sometimes not in the budget of the company in regards to resources. From these tests, the client might get irrelevant results as flaws are researched without deep research. At the end of the day, a client will just receive flaws without any value for their company. Another reason raised by Reda Cherqaoui in regards to bounties is that: *Big businesses can afford to do this because they know their level of security. So, they can afford running a bounty because they know people will not find 1001 vulnerabilities. Small and Medium businesses dont normally perform penetration tests; so imagine if you end up receiving 101 vulnerabilities, each worth about $100. Thats more expensive.* **What is the revenue model?** In Buglab, 70% of the contest fee goes towards the top three pentesters, while 19% goes to the company itself. 1% is for Buglab transaction reserve that is used to pay transaction on the blockchain and 10% is for the vigilante protocol reserve so as to pay whitehats. **What about the ICO?** Status: Whitelist phase with over 1600 whitelisted people Pre-sale: June 30th 2018 High target cap: 20,000,000 Soft cap: 6,000,000 Total tokens: 425 million tokens and 40% dedicated to the token sale. **Any final words for the Buglab community?** Reda Cherqaoui has very short but powerful words for the Buglab community: *Something good is coming. Check the website and be updated* If you still have not joined the Buglab community, what are you really waiting for? The future is exciting, but it also seems scary because we dont know whos next in regards to being hacked. In order to avoid being the next future statistic, do the right thing and protect yourself using Buglab. "

In all, the malware campaigns have compromised more than 210,000 routers from Latvian network hardware provider Mikrotik across the world, with the number still increasing as of writing. The hackers have been exploiting a known [vulnerability](URL in the Winbox component of MikroTik routers that was discovered in April this year and patched within a day of its discovery, which once again shows people's carelessness in applying security patches on time. The security flaw can potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthenticated, remote administrative access to any vulnerable MikroTik router. The first campaign, noticed by [Trustwave](URL researchers, began with targeting networking devices in Brazil, where a hacker or a group of hackers compromised more than 183,700 MikroTik routers. Since other hackers have also started exploiting MikroTik router vulnerability, the campaign is spreading on a global scale. Troy Mursch, another security researcher, has [identified](URL two similar malware campaigns that infected 25,500 and 16,000 MikroTik routers, mainly in Moldova, with malicious cryptocurrency mining code from infamous CoinHive service.

Here at Cyber Security Hub, we both track the latest industry news and make it more navigable for the IT professional. Cyber Security Hub coverage extends outwards  as it helps enterprises batten down their proverbial hatches. In this edition of ***Incident of the Week,*** we examine a cyber-attack that hit popular news aggregator and discussion site, Reddit. A hacker reportedly broke into a few of the companys systems, lifting email addresses and a 2007 database holding old salted and hashed passwords. [In an announcement on its site](URL the company noted that the attacker did not gain write access to Reddit systems, instead capturing read-only access to systems with backup data, source code and other logs. The statement reads that Reddit learned of the attack  which took place between June 14- 18  just a day later, June 19. It said an attacker compromised employee accounts with its cloud and source code hosting providers. It reads: Already having our primary access points for code and infrastructure behind strong authentication requiring two factor authentication (2FA), we learned that SMS-based authentication is not nearly as secure as we would hope, and the main attack was via SMS intercept. We point this out to encourage everyone here to move to token-based 2FA. [Reddit also stated](URL that the attacker was not able to alter the companys information, and that it has taken steps since the event to further lock down and rotate all production secrets and API keys, and to enhance our logging and monitoring systems. In a section for What information was involved? the company wrote: All Reddit data from 2007 and before including account credentials and email address, and email digests sent by Reddit in June 2018. Some of the companys remedial steps include: reporting the incident to law enforcement, messaging potentially affected users and taking measures to guarantee that additional points of privileged access to Reddits systems are more secure. On that point, Reddit said it involves enhanced logging, more encryption and requiring token-based 2FA to gain entry. Commenting on 2FA in a post about the incident, [KrebsOnSecurity wrote](URL A more secure alternative to SMS involves the use of a mobile app  such as Google Authenticator or Authy  to generate the one-time code that needs to be entered in addition to a password. This method is also sometimes referred to as a time-based one-time password, or TOTP. [Krebs ](URL discussing the effectiveness of security keys in 2FA: Probably the most secure form of 2FA available involves the use of hardware-based security keys. These inexpensive USB-based devices allow users to complete the login process simply by inserting the device and pressing a button. After a key is enrolled for 2FA at a particular site that supports keys, the user no longer needs to enter their password (unless they try to log in from a new device). One issue in the key-based entry, though, which Krebs points out: relatively few websites currently employ the method. However, popular sites like Dropbox, Facebook and GitHub do accept the keys, and Google is now requiring its 85,000+ employees to use them for 2FA. *While the security keys may help reduce privileged-access breaches on highly sensitive or highly visible platforms, it is clear that hacking antics will continue  until they encroach on the next vulnerability. As such, the Cyber Security Hub will be there to report and offer workable mitigation advice on the many incidents! Stay tuned for additional cyber-attack coverage.*"

What we are doing is that we are connecting a community of cybersecurity researchers which are certified and hand selected with customers who have needs in cybersecurity*, he added during an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. In essence, Buglab aims to helps companies in different fields such as IT, financial services, or retail to identify and mitigate cybersecurity gaps in their systems. The platform is meant to detect vulnerabilities on these companies websites, smart contracts, IoT devices and mobile applications by performing penetration tests. **How do they do this?** Whoever said cybersecurity penetration is not fun, definitely has not heard of Buglabs penetration testing contests: *Typically we are turning penetration testing into contests. We are creating a competition whereby the cybersecurity researchers challenge each other in order to be the first three with the highest score in vulnerabilities reported. Those top 3 researchers get awarded 70\% of the contest prize. The first one will get 40\%, second will get 20\%, third gets 10\%. The platform also enables clients to give some customer rewards to those researchers that did not win the contest who may have found critical vulnerabilities that were not found by the top three.* Reda Cherqaoui at the Blockchain Economic Forum in an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. The Buglab penetration contest enables all companies to use the platform work with a community of certified cybersecurity penetration testers who get incentivized for it. This is done in a form of a race so the clients are sure to receive fast and credible results. The testers can be independent or a group of less than five from a validated company. **As a Company, how do I go about this?** No matter how big or small, all companies are welcome to use the Buglab platform. The following steps show how easy it is to get your company pentested by cybersecurity professionals: 1. Sign up on the platform and provide information about the company; goods and services it provides then subscribe to competition contract choosing personalized rules the company would like to set. It is possible to customize competition confidentiality, type of management wanted, contest cost depending on the chosen plan and an option bonus. 2. Based on the set confidentiality, the client chooses from a list of pentesters in the community and the Buglab recommendation engine helps to assign a proper match. 3. Chosen pentesters test the companys system and submit a report. The scoring system encourages pentesters to be the first to submit vulnerabilities as the maximum amount discovered gets the highest score. **What are the core features behind Buglab?** * ***Public Contests:*** After the company provides required information and launches contest, the community receives an invitation to participate. * ***Private Contests:*** Clients can choose pentesters from the community or a team from a validated cybersecurity company to solve their problem. * ***Selection features:*** Clients can choose pentesters using different filters like country, skill set, scores etc * ***Triage System:*** *Reported vulnerabilities go through a sorting system on the platform to identify duplicates before reaching the client. This reduces redundancy and gives the client relevant information only.* * ***Reports*****:** The clients receive reports on the security contest with summarized performance. This will help the client compare security status and assets progress. * ***Client-Managed:*** Clients can choose their own contest management from Basic, Pro or Enterprise. * ***Mediation***: In the case of a client managing the contest themselves, they may ask for mediation from Buglab. This happens if a pentester feels that the score or evaluation was unfair so Buglab will mediate the situation. * ***Leader-board:*** This shows a ranking of pentesters according to their scores and experience. This makes it easier for clients to pick star pentesters. * ***Chat:*** Every report gives a chance for clients to chat with pentesters to get help fixing the vulnerabilities. * ***Fix Companion:*** A company that chooses Enterprise level has the opportunity to let Buglab verify whether the fix has been implemented. The Buglab pentester contest is just one offering from the company. There is another offering, specifically for Whitehats under the Vigilante Protocol. **Vigilante protocol?** The Vigilante protocol is an integrated hacking prevention program. Under this, whitehat researchers report vulnerabilities about companies that are not on the Buglab platform. Companies are then invited to reward the whitehats for the discovered vulnerabilities. Essentially, companies get to know their flaws at a minimum cost. The way in which this works as explained by Reda Cherqaoui is that: *It allows whitehat hackers globally to report vulnerabilities to Buglab. These vulnerabilities are of companies that are not on our platform and in partnership with Cert and CSirt they contact those companies to help them fix their vulnerabilities.* Buglab also recently announced that they plan to secure cryptocurrency exchanges by hosting contests with a reward pool on $2 million. ***Why partner with Cert and CSirt in the first place?*** *When a white hat reports a vulnerability to us; if we check if this vulnerability exists or not, we need to test it by exploiting it and if we do that its illegal. So if they do that, its legal and thats why they are in partnership. So when the cert and CSirt confirm that the vulnerability exists, the whitehat hacker receives some tokens from the vigilante protocol reserve in which the company puts funds.* The company helped can choose to reward the hacker or host a contest on the Buglab platform. Since the whitehat is the one that brought the company on board, they receive 2&amp;#37; of the service fee. The whitehat will be allowed to participate even without a pentester status. **Why focus on whitehats?** Normally, people are not allowed to do this as they have no authorization from the company to perform those tests and find vulnerabilities. When they do it, they protect their identity in many ways like having journalists be the intermediary between themselves and the vulnerable company as they cannot contact the companies directly. There are currently cases of people who have critical vulnerabilities data on really big companies but they cannot communicate with nor contact the companies to help them because they are afraid. Whitehats normally do not get money from reporting this vulnerabilities so they decide to just keep them and do nothing about it. However, if a blackhat discovers a vulnerability, they will just steal the data and sell it on the black market, deface the website or do something bad for the company. There is a gap here and there is something to do for whitehats. ***There are thousands of Russian Companies doing exactly this- cybersecurity penetration tests. What makes Buglab different?*** Currently, available penetration testing services are not viable for small and medium companies. Penetration tests performed by cyber security consulting firms require clients to pay in regards to total billable hours. Moreover, only one or two pentesters do the job. This means that, regardless of the results the company will pay close to $100 per hour with only limited pentesters on the job. The end result is often a report in a PDF format and doesnt facilitate the fixing of the vulnerability or getting more details about the vulnerability from the pentesters. Secondly, bug bounty challenges require clients to pay according to each vulnerability found. Vulnerabilities discovered are sometimes not in the budget of the company in regards to resources. From these tests, the client might get irrelevant results as flaws are researched without deep research. At the end of the day, a client will just receive flaws without any value for their company. Another reason raised by Reda Cherqaoui in regards to bounties is that: *Big businesses can afford to do this because they know their level of security. So, they can afford running a bounty because they know people will not find 1001 vulnerabilities. Small and Medium businesses dont normally perform penetration tests; so imagine if you end up receiving 101 vulnerabilities, each worth about $100. Thats more expensive.* **What is the revenue model?** In Buglab, 70&amp;#37; of the contest fee goes towards the top three pentesters, while 19&amp;#37; goes to the company itself. 1&amp;#37; is for Buglab transaction reserve that is used to pay transaction on the blockchain and 10&amp;#37; is for the vigilante protocol reserve so as to pay whitehats."

Sounds familiar? Most probably, because this just happened a few weeks ago. Companies, both large and small are at a risk of being hacked. Even if as an individual, you do not own a company, you definitely do use services and products offered by these companies that are at risk, so this concerns everyone. This is because the demand for cybersecurity professionals immensely exceeds supply as hackers are advancing minute by minute.

This type of scoring system encourages the community to act in a manner that is effective, thorough, and efficient. The testers are rewarded based on their collective discoveries in time-limit competitions. Here, pentesters are rewarded as they uncover system vulnerabilities that are ranked by severity and potential impacts. In the other program  Vigilante Protocol, Buglab provides an opportunity for whitehats (security researchers who use hacking skills to identify security weaknesses) to share their own vulnerability discoveries.

This is a problem, but Buglab has a solution! **Buglab?** According to the Founder and CEO, Reda Cherqaoui, Buglab is *An affordable penetration testing for small and medium businesses. We are proud to say cybersecurity. What we are doing is that we are connecting a community of cybersecurity researchers which are certified and hand selected with customers who have needs in cybersecurity*, he added during an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. In essence, Buglab aims to helps companies in different fields such as IT, financial services, or retail to identify and mitigate cybersecurity gaps in their systems. The platform is meant to detect vulnerabilities on these companies websites, smart contracts, IoT devices and mobile applications by performing penetration tests. **How do they do this?** Whoever said cybersecurity penetration is not fun, definitely has not heard of Buglabs penetration testing contests: *Typically we are turning penetration testing into contests. We are creating a competition whereby the cybersecurity researchers challenge each other in order to be the first three with the highest score in vulnerabilities reported. Those top 3 researchers get awarded 70% of the contest prize. The first one will get 40%, second will get 20%, third gets 10%. The platform also enables clients to give some customer rewards to those researchers that did not win the contest who may have found critical vulnerabilities that were not found by the top three.* Reda Cherqaoui at the Blockchain Economic Forum in an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. The Buglab penetration contest enables all companies to use the platform work with a community of certified cybersecurity penetration testers who get incentivized for it. This is done in a form of a race so the clients are sure to receive fast and credible results. The testers can be independent or a group of less than five from a validated company. **As a Company, how do I go about this?** No matter how big or small, all companies are welcome to use the Buglab platform. The following steps show how easy it is to get your company pentested by cybersecurity professionals: 1. Sign up on the platform and provide information about the company; goods and services it provides then subscribe to competition contract choosing personalized rules the company would like to set. It is possible to customize competition confidentiality, type of management wanted, contest cost depending on the chosen plan and an option bonus. 2. Based on the set confidentiality, the client chooses from a list of pentesters in the community and the Buglab recommendation engine helps to assign a proper match. 3. Chosen pentesters test the companys system and submit a report. The scoring system encourages pentesters to be the first to submit vulnerabilities as the maximum amount discovered gets the highest score. **What are the core features behind Buglab?** * ***Public Contests:*** After the company provides required information and launches contest, the community receives an invitation to participate. * ***Private Contests:*** Clients can choose pentesters from the community or a team from a validated cybersecurity company to solve their problem. * ***Selection features:*** Clients can choose pentesters using different filters like country, skill set, scores etc * ***Triage System:*** *Reported vulnerabilities go through a sorting system on the platform to identify duplicates before reaching the client. This reduces redundancy and gives the client relevant information only.* * ***Reports*****:** The clients receive reports on the security contest with summarized performance. This will help the client compare security status and assets progress. * ***Client-Managed:*** Clients can choose their own contest management from Basic, Pro or Enterprise. * ***Mediation***: In the case of a client managing the contest themselves, they may ask for mediation from Buglab. This happens if a pentester feels that the score or evaluation was unfair so Buglab will mediate the situation. * ***Leader-board:*** This shows a ranking of pentesters according to their scores and experience. This makes it easier for clients to pick star pentesters. * ***Chat:*** Every report gives a chance for clients to chat with pentesters to get help fixing the vulnerabilities. * ***Fix Companion:*** A company that chooses Enterprise level has the opportunity to let Buglab verify whether the fix has been implemented. The Buglab pentester contest is just one offering from the company. There is another offering, specifically for Whitehats under the Vigilante Protocol. **Vigilante protocol?** The Vigilante protocol is an integrated hacking prevention program. Under this, whitehat researchers report vulnerabilities about companies that are not on the Buglab platform. Companies are then invited to reward the whitehats for the discovered vulnerabilities. Essentially, companies get to know their flaws at a minimum cost. The way in which this works as explained by Reda Cherqaoui is that: *It allows whitehat hackers globally to report vulnerabilities to Buglab. These vulnerabilities are of companies that are not on our platform and in partnership with Cert and CSirt they contact those companies to help them fix their vulnerabilities.* Buglab also recently announced that they plan to secure cryptocurrency exchanges by hosting contests with a reward pool on $2 million. ***Why partner with Cert and CSirt in the first place?*** *When a white hat reports a vulnerability to us; if we check if this vulnerability exists or not, we need to test it by exploiting it and if we do that its illegal. So if they do that, its legal and thats why they are in partnership. So when the cert and CSirt confirm that the vulnerability exists, the whitehat hacker receives some tokens from the vigilante protocol reserve in which the company puts funds.* The company helped can choose to reward the hacker or host a contest on the Buglab platform. Since the whitehat is the one that brought the company on board, they receive 2% of the service fee. The whitehat will be allowed to participate even without a pentester status. **Why focus on whitehats?** Normally, people are not allowed to do this as they have no authorization from the company to perform those tests and find vulnerabilities. When they do it, they protect their identity in many ways like having journalists be the intermediary between themselves and the vulnerable company as they cannot contact the companies directly. There are currently cases of people who have critical vulnerabilities data on really big companies but they cannot communicate with nor contact the companies to help them because they are afraid. Whitehats normally do not get money from reporting this vulnerabilities so they decide to just keep them and do nothing about it. However, if a blackhat discovers a vulnerability, they will just steal the data and sell it on the black market, deface the website or do something bad for the company. There is a gap here and there is something to do for whitehats. ***There are thousands of Russian Companies doing exactly this- cybersecurity penetration tests. What makes Buglab different?*** Currently, available penetration testing services are not viable for small and medium companies. Penetration tests performed by cyber security consulting firms require clients to pay in regards to total billable hours. Moreover, only one or two pentesters do the job. This means that, regardless of the results the company will pay close to $100 per hour with only limited pentesters on the job. The end result is often a report in a PDF format and doesnt facilitate the fixing of the vulnerability or getting more details about the vulnerability from the pentesters. Secondly, bug bounty challenges require clients to pay according to each vulnerability found. Vulnerabilities discovered are sometimes not in the budget of the company in regards to resources. From these tests, the client might get irrelevant results as flaws are researched without deep research. At the end of the day, a client will just receive flaws without any value for their company. Another reason raised by Reda Cherqaoui in regards to bounties is that: *Big businesses can afford to do this because they know their level of security. So, they can afford running a bounty because they know people will not find 1001 vulnerabilities. Small and Medium businesses dont normally perform penetration tests; so imagine if you end up receiving 101 vulnerabilities, each worth about $100. Thats more expensive.* **What is the revenue model?** In Buglab, 70% of the contest fee goes towards the top three pentesters, while 19% goes to the company itself. 1% is for Buglab transaction reserve that is used to pay transaction on the blockchain and 10% is for the vigilante protocol reserve so as to pay whitehats. **What about the ICO?** Status: Whitelist phase with over 1600 whitelisted people Pre-sale: June 30th 2018 High target cap: 20,000,000 Soft cap: 6,000,000 Total tokens: 425 million tokens and 40% dedicated to the token sale. **Any final words for the Buglab community?** Reda Cherqaoui has very short but powerful words for the Buglab community: *Something good is coming. Check the website and be updated* If you still have not joined the Buglab community, what are you really waiting for? The future is exciting, but it also seems scary because we dont know whos next in regards to being hacked. In order to avoid being the next future statistic, do the right thing and protect yourself using Buglab. "

Firms are given at their discretion three types of management of competitions. So, for example, in Corporate, only the client will be responsible for sorting reports. In the event that the client decided to manage his own competition independently, then any pentester can apply to the project so that he becomes an intermediary. This is useful if the pentester considers erroneous points awarded or it seems that the validation results were incorrect. The project team will receive information that relates to the dispute and will be able to evaluate it. In the informative panel, the client can find ratings of pentester taking into account their experience, as well as the results of the project.

The cost of two common strategies outlined here rapidly becomes out of reach for all but large enterprises. # Penetration tests performed by a cybersecurity consulting firm: Requires that clients pay for the service in terms of total billable hours, regardless of the test results. The majority of penetration tests performed by consulting firms are done by one, maybe two pentesters. This means that the client is only able to take advantage of the methodology and skillset of two consultants. # Bug Bounty challenges: Information security researchers are paid on a per-vulnerability-uncovered basis. Companies often end up getting charged to fix issues not entirely consequential to their revenue or customers. This is described in more detail in the next section. # The Buglab Solution The Buglab platform links organizations that have information security needs, which is just about all of them, with a community of certified cybersecurity penetration testers in an incentivized environment, where testers are rewarded when they uncover system vulnerabilities, ranked by severity and potential impacts. Its done as a race against time. Importantly, finding unique vulnerabilities is ranked above simply producing a list of issues. Core Features of the Buglab Platform The Buglab platform enables customers to either use the mass of pentesters or choose a validated team from a known company. Teams must include no fewer than five pentesters. A variety of customizations are available, specific to your organizational needs. Some of the features envisioned are highlighted next. **Public Contest :** Once a company has provided basic information and launched the contest, the community receives a public invitation to participate. **Private Contest :** Clients also have the option to choose a select number of pentesters from the community or choose a validated team from a known cybersecurity firm to complete the challenge **Selection Filters :** Clients have the option during a private challenge of selecting pentesters using different filters. These include country, score, skillset, etc. **Triage System :** Vulnerabilities reported go through our sorting system to identify duplicates before landing on the customers dashboard. The customer is guaranteed to only get notified about relevant submissions **Reports :** The company receives reporting on its security contests. This feature summarizes each contests performance and allows the client to graphically compare the security status and progress of its assets. **Client-Managed :** The company can choose from three types of contest management (Basic, Pro, and Enterprise). In the case of the latter, the client is responsible for sorting, classifying and grading reports. **Mediation :** When a customer opts to manage their challenge themselves, a pentester from the community can ask for mediation from Buglab. This mediation may be required in the event that a pentester deems the score or validation to be inaccurate. A Buglab team can obtain details regarding the cause of the disagreement and evaluate it impartially **Leaderboard :** A dashboard offers ranking of pentesters from the community according to experience and results on the platform. This provides greater visibility for the best pentesters and makes it easier to select participants for a private challenge. **Chat :** Every vulnerability report is a chance to engage in conversation with pentesters and to obtain their help fixing it. Fix Companion : At the Enterprise level, Buglab will verify that the fix has been implemented. # Vigilante Protocol In addition to rolling out contests for enterprises of varying scales, Buglab is introducing a globally integrated hacking prevention program named the Buglab Vigilante Protocol. Its a system that allows whitehat researchers to report on system vulnerabilities of a company that isnt one of our platforms customers. We invite companies to reward the whitehats in the form of optional tips or gratuity when they discover flaws. Its a way for companies to obtain recommendations for their solutions from watchful guardians at little cost to them "

Any exchanges who offer to run a launchpad, or promote the token sale in some way will be eligible to receive the penetration testing service to detect vulnerabilities and potential threats. Through Buglab, a community of certified and hand selected cybersecurity researchers will summarize the contest, providing a complete report on the findings and draw a complete preventative strategy to prevent such issues in the future. Every participating exchange will get the chance to receive $20,000 as a part of Buglabs enterprise plan, including a $10,000 prize for the top three winners of the contest and $10,000 as a special reward (for example critical vulnerabilities not found by the winners). In addition to offering the contest, if no vulnerabilities are discovered, Buglab will offer 50% of the sum allocated to the exchange, ($10,000 in BGL tokens). This is an excellent way for the exchanges to test the release of future features. When asked about the future of cryptocurrency exchange, Buglab CEO Reda Cherqaoui stated that; &gt;*Cryptocurrency exchanges should be concerned about securing the funds of their traders, as these funds equate to billions of dollars. With new exchanges launching every week and increasing danger of security breaches, we aim to provide the industry with a secure, cutting-edge service to help mitigate against these increasing risks.* **Exchange Hacks** Todays digital financial markets are growing at an exponential rate and hackers now have more advanced techniques and equipment than ever before. Cryptocurrency exchanges should be vigilant and actively monitor and update their knowledge and technical skill to be one step ahead of the hackers and to keep their exchanges secure. [The Buglab penetration testing service](URL and contest announcement come just two weeks after two large South Korean exchanges were hacked and lost an estimated combined total of over $70 Million, in various cryptocurrencies. Leading exchange Conrail announced a cyber intrusion on June 9, with an estimated loss of $40 million and only 11 days later South Koreas largest volume trading platform, Bithumb announced a security breach with a reported loss of $31 million. Despite Bithumbs reassurance of a full reimbursement to all of its affected users, serious questions now hang over the security of these, and all other cryptocurrency exchanges. With this news compounding the current bear market, cryptocurrency platform users are very concerned as to the state of play. Reda also stated that this increase in hacker prowess has created an increased demand for cybersecurity professionals that far exceeds the current supply. This huge demand has pushed specialist towards finding new and more efficient solutions to oppose the growing number of security threats."

The security issue is not even farfetched because just two years ago, there was an email leak during the U.S. presidential elections that portrayed the Democratic party in a negative light. This shows that hacking is a problem, not only for existing software companies, but also for blockchain companies. This is a problem, but Buglab has a solution! **Buglab?** According to the Founder and CEO, Reda Cherqaoui, Buglab is *An affordable penetration testing for small and medium businesses. We are proud to say cybersecurity. What we are doing is that we are connecting a community of cybersecurity researchers which are certified and hand selected with customers who have needs in cybersecurity*, he added during an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. In essence, Buglab aims to helps companies in different fields such as IT, financial services, or retail to identify and mitigate cybersecurity gaps in their systems. The platform is meant to detect vulnerabilities on these companies websites, smart contracts, IoT devices and mobile applications by performing penetration tests. **How do they do this?** Whoever said cybersecurity penetration is not fun, definitely has not heard of Buglabs penetration testing contests: *Typically we are turning penetration testing into contests. We are creating a competition whereby the cybersecurity researchers challenge each other in order to be the first three with the highest score in vulnerabilities reported. Those top 3 researchers get awarded 70% of the contest prize. The first one will get 40%, second will get 20%, third gets 10%. The platform also enables clients to give some customer rewards to those researchers that did not win the contest who may have found critical vulnerabilities that were not found by the top three.* Reda Cherqaoui at the Blockchain Economic Forum in an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. The Buglab penetration contest enables all companies to use the platform work with a community of certified cybersecurity penetration testers who get incentivized for it. This is done in a form of a race so the clients are sure to receive fast and credible results. The testers can be independent or a group of less than five from a validated company. **As a Company, how do I go about this?** No matter how big or small, all companies are welcome to use the Buglab platform. The following steps show how easy it is to get your company pentested by cybersecurity professionals: 1. Sign up on the platform and provide information about the company; goods and services it provides then subscribe to competition contract choosing personalized rules the company would like to set. It is possible to customize competition confidentiality, type of management wanted, contest cost depending on the chosen plan and an option bonus. 2. Based on the set confidentiality, the client chooses from a list of pentesters in the community and the Buglab recommendation engine helps to assign a proper match. 3. Chosen pentesters test the companys system and submit a report. The scoring system encourages pentesters to be the first to submit vulnerabilities as the maximum amount discovered gets the highest score. **What are the core features behind Buglab?** * ***Public Contests:*** After the company provides required information and launches contest, the community receives an invitation to participate. * ***Private Contests:*** Clients can choose pentesters from the community or a team from a validated cybersecurity company to solve their problem. * ***Selection features:*** Clients can choose pentesters using different filters like country, skill set, scores etc * ***Triage System:*** *Reported vulnerabilities go through a sorting system on the platform to identify duplicates before reaching the client. This reduces redundancy and gives the client relevant information only.* * ***Reports*****:** The clients receive reports on the security contest with summarized performance. This will help the client compare security status and assets progress. * ***Client-Managed:*** Clients can choose their own contest management from Basic, Pro or Enterprise. * ***Mediation***: In the case of a client managing the contest themselves, they may ask for mediation from Buglab. This happens if a pentester feels that the score or evaluation was unfair so Buglab will mediate the situation. * ***Leader-board:*** This shows a ranking of pentesters according to their scores and experience. This makes it easier for clients to pick star pentesters. * ***Chat:*** Every report gives a chance for clients to chat with pentesters to get help fixing the vulnerabilities. * ***Fix Companion:*** A company that chooses Enterprise level has the opportunity to let Buglab verify whether the fix has been implemented. The Buglab pentester contest is just one offering from the company. There is another offering, specifically for Whitehats under the Vigilante Protocol. **Vigilante protocol?** The Vigilante protocol is an integrated hacking prevention program. Under this, whitehat researchers report vulnerabilities about companies that are not on the Buglab platform. Companies are then invited to reward the whitehats for the discovered vulnerabilities. Essentially, companies get to know their flaws at a minimum cost. The way in which this works as explained by Reda Cherqaoui is that: *It allows whitehat hackers globally to report vulnerabilities to Buglab. These vulnerabilities are of companies that are not on our platform and in partnership with Cert and CSirt they contact those companies to help them fix their vulnerabilities.* Buglab also recently announced that they plan to secure cryptocurrency exchanges by hosting contests with a reward pool on $2 million. ***Why partner with Cert and CSirt in the first place?*** *When a white hat reports a vulnerability to us; if we check if this vulnerability exists or not, we need to test it by exploiting it and if we do that its illegal. So if they do that, its legal and thats why they are in partnership. So when the cert and CSirt confirm that the vulnerability exists, the whitehat hacker receives some tokens from the vigilante protocol reserve in which the company puts funds.* The company helped can choose to reward the hacker or host a contest on the Buglab platform. Since the whitehat is the one that brought the company on board, they receive 2% of the service fee. The whitehat will be allowed to participate even without a pentester status. **Why focus on whitehats?** Normally, people are not allowed to do this as they have no authorization from the company to perform those tests and find vulnerabilities. When they do it, they protect their identity in many ways like having journalists be the intermediary between themselves and the vulnerable company as they cannot contact the companies directly. There are currently cases of people who have critical vulnerabilities data on really big companies but they cannot communicate with nor contact the companies to help them because they are afraid. Whitehats normally do not get money from reporting this vulnerabilities so they decide to just keep them and do nothing about it. However, if a blackhat discovers a vulnerability, they will just steal the data and sell it on the black market, deface the website or do something bad for the company. There is a gap here and there is something to do for whitehats. ***There are thousands of Russian Companies doing exactly this- cybersecurity penetration tests. What makes Buglab different?*** Currently, available penetration testing services are not viable for small and medium companies. Penetration tests performed by cyber security consulting firms require clients to pay in regards to total billable hours. Moreover, only one or two pentesters do the job. This means that, regardless of the results the company will pay close to $100 per hour with only limited pentesters on the job. The end result is often a report in a PDF format and doesnt facilitate the fixing of the vulnerability or getting more details about the vulnerability from the pentesters. Secondly, bug bounty challenges require clients to pay according to each vulnerability found. Vulnerabilities discovered are sometimes not in the budget of the company in regards to resources. From these tests, the client might get irrelevant results as flaws are researched without deep research. At the end of the day, a client will just receive flaws without any value for their company. Another reason raised by Reda Cherqaoui in regards to bounties is that: *Big businesses can afford to do this because they know their level of security. So, they can afford running a bounty because they know people will not find 1001 vulnerabilities. Small and Medium businesses dont normally perform penetration tests; so imagine if you end up receiving 101 vulnerabilities, each worth about $100. Thats more expensive.* **What is the revenue model?** In Buglab, 70% of the contest fee goes towards the top three pentesters, while 19% goes to the company itself. 1% is for Buglab transaction reserve that is used to pay transaction on the blockchain and 10% is for the vigilante protocol reserve so as to pay whitehats. **What about the ICO?** Status: Whitelist phase with over 1600 whitelisted people Pre-sale: June 30th 2018 High target cap: 20,000,000 Soft cap: 6,000,000 Total tokens: 425 million tokens and 40% dedicated to the token sale. **Any final words for the Buglab community?** Reda Cherqaoui has very short but powerful words for the Buglab community: *Something good is coming. Check the website and be updated* If you still have not joined the Buglab community, what are you really waiting for? The future is exciting, but it also seems scary because we dont know whos next in regards to being hacked. In order to avoid being the next future statistic, do the right thing and protect yourself using Buglab. "

Because it takes the form of a contest, whereby the client has constant access to penetration test results, its real-time and cost-effective. 5. Buglab will verify that the fix has been implemented. Buglab will attempt to verify (exploit) the vulnerability again. When confirmed as fixed, a Buglab team of analysts will update the status accordingly in the platform. A fix can be declined by Buglab to give the company a chance to address the vulnerability again. The company will be allotted up to five attempts to address the vulnerability issue. "

162,cybersecurity,buglabProject,Worried About Cybersecurity? Let Buglab Rescue You!,12,8wpm0e,https://www.reddit.com/r/buglabProject/comments/8wpm0e/worried_about_cybersecurity_let_buglab_rescue_you/,2018-07-07 11:43:27,"**Buglab?** According to the Founder and CEO, Reda Cherqaoui, Buglab is *An affordable penetration testing for small and medium businesses. We are proud to say cybersecurity. What we are doing is that we are connecting a community of cybersecurity researchers which are certified and hand selected with customers who have needs in cybersecurity*, he added during an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. In essence, Buglab aims to helps companies in different fields such as IT, financial services, or retail to identify and mitigate cybersecurity gaps in their systems. The platform is meant to detect vulnerabilities on these companies websites, smart contracts, IoT devices and mobile applications by performing penetration tests. **How do they do this?** Whoever said cybersecurity penetration is not fun, definitely has not heard of Buglabs penetration testing contests: *Typically we are turning penetration testing into contests. We are creating a competition whereby the cybersecurity researchers challenge each other in order to be the first three with the highest score in vulnerabilities reported. Those top 3 researchers get awarded 70\% of the contest prize. The first one will get 40\%, second will get 20\%, third gets 10\%. The platform also enables clients to give some customer rewards to those researchers that did not win the contest who may have found critical vulnerabilities that were not found by the top three.* Reda Cherqaoui at the Blockchain Economic Forum in an exclusive interview with Decentral Magazine. The Buglab penetration contest enables all companies to use the platform work with a community of certified cybersecurity penetration testers who get incentivized for it. This is done in a form of a race so the clients are sure to receive fast and credible results. The testers can be independent or a group of less than five from a validated company. **As a Company, how do I go about this?** No matter how big or small, all companies are welcome to use the Buglab platform. The following steps show how easy it is to get your company pentested by cybersecurity professionals: 1. Sign up on the platform and provide information about the company; goods and services it provides then subscribe to competition contract choosing personalized rules the company would like to set. It is possible to customize competition confidentiality, type of management wanted, contest cost depending on the chosen plan and an option bonus. 2. Based on the set confidentiality, the client chooses from a list of pentesters in the community and the Buglab recommendation engine helps to assign a proper match. 3. Chosen pentesters test the companys system and submit a report. The scoring system encourages pentesters to be the first to submit vulnerabilities as the maximum amount discovered gets the highest score. **What are the core features behind Buglab?** * ***Public Contests:*** After the company provides required information and launches contest, the community receives an invitation to participate. * ***Private Contests:*** Clients can choose pentesters from the community or a team from a validated cybersecurity company to solve their problem. * ***Selection features:*** Clients can choose pentesters using different filters like country, skill set, scores etc * ***Triage System:*** *Reported vulnerabilities go through a sorting system on the platform to identify duplicates before reaching the client. This reduces redundancy and gives the client relevant information only.* * ***Reports*****:** The clients receive reports on the security contest with summarized performance. This will help the client compare security status and assets progress. * ***Client-Managed:*** Clients can choose their own contest management from Basic, Pro or Enterprise. * ***Mediation***: In the case of a client managing the contest themselves, they may ask for mediation from Buglab. This happens if a pentester feels that the score or evaluation was unfair so Buglab will mediate the situation. * ***Leader-board:*** This shows a ranking of pentesters according to their scores and experience. This makes it easier for clients to pick star pentesters. * ***Chat:*** Every report gives a chance for clients to chat with pentesters to get help fixing the vulnerabilities. * ***Fix Companion:*** A company that chooses Enterprise level has the opportunity to let Buglab verify whether the fix has been implemented. The Buglab pentester contest is just one offering from the company. There is another offering, specifically for Whitehats under the Vigilante Protocol. **Vigilante protocol?** The Vigilante protocol is an integrated hacking prevention program. Under this, whitehat researchers report vulnerabilities about companies that are not on the Buglab platform. Companies are then invited to reward the whitehats for the discovered vulnerabilities. Essentially, companies get to know their flaws at a minimum cost. The way in which this works as explained by Reda Cherqaoui is that: *It allows whitehat hackers globally to report vulnerabilities to Buglab. These vulnerabilities are of companies that are not on our platform and in partnership with Cert and CSirt they contact those companies to help them fix their vulnerabilities.* Buglab also recently announced that they plan to secure cryptocurrency exchanges by hosting contests with a reward pool on $2 million. ***Why partner with Cert and CSirt in the first place?*** *When a white hat reports a vulnerability to us; if we check if this vulnerability exists or not, we need to test it by exploiting it and if we do that its illegal. So if they do that, its legal and thats why they are in partnership. So when the cert and CSirt confirm that the vulnerability exists, the whitehat hacker receives some tokens from the vigilante protocol reserve in which the company puts funds.* The company helped can choose to reward the hacker or host a contest on the Buglab platform. Since the whitehat is the one that brought the company on board, they receive 2&amp;#37; of the service fee. The whitehat will be allowed to participate even without a pentester status. **Why focus on whitehats?** Normally, people are not allowed to do this as they have no authorization from the company to perform those tests and find vulnerabilities. When they do it, they protect their identity in many ways like having journalists be the intermediary between themselves and the vulnerable company as they cannot contact the companies directly. There are currently cases of people who have critical vulnerabilities data on really big companies but they cannot communicate with nor contact the companies to help them because they are afraid. Whitehats normally do not get money from reporting this vulnerabilities so they decide to just keep them and do nothing about it. However, if a blackhat discovers a vulnerability, they will just steal the data and sell it on the black market, deface the website or do something bad for the company. There is a gap here and there is something to do for whitehats. ***There are thousands of Russian Companies doing exactly this- cybersecurity penetration tests. What makes Buglab different?*** Currently, available penetration testing services are not viable for small and medium companies. Penetration tests performed by cyber security consulting firms require clients to pay in regards to total billable hours. Moreover, only one or two pentesters do the job. This means that, regardless of the results the company will pay close to $100 per hour with only limited pentesters on the job. The end result is often a report in a PDF format and doesnt facilitate the fixing of the vulnerability or getting more details about the vulnerability from the pentesters. Secondly, bug bounty challenges require clients to pay according to each vulnerability found. Vulnerabilities discovered are sometimes not in the budget of the company in regards to resources. From these tests, the client might get irrelevant results as flaws are researched without deep research. At the end of the day, a client will just receive flaws without any value for their company. Another reason raised by Reda Cherqaoui in regards to bounties is that: *Big businesses can afford to do this because they know their level of security. So, they can afford running a bounty because they know people will not find 1001 vulnerabilities. Small and Medium businesses dont normally perform penetration tests; so imagine if you end up receiving 101 vulnerabilities, each worth about $100. Thats more expensive.* **What is the revenue model?** In Buglab, 70&amp;#37; of the contest fee goes towards the top three pentesters, while 19&amp;#37; goes to the company itself. 1&amp;#37; is for Buglab transaction reserve that is used to pay transaction on the blockchain and 10&amp;#37; is for the vigilante protocol reserve so as to pay whitehats."

The blockchain is a distributed register of records that store different types of data. These registers are located on different servers, it makes easy to verify and confirm any transaction. Thus, there is a continuous computing process, provided with a huge number of participants.
