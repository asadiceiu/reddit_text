I was literally talking to my buddy's gf when after I just told myself *I gotta post this on reddit to see how I can get help.* I have nowhere else to turn to. Here's the problem: when I look at people in the eye, *nobody* wants to maintain that eye contact. Wtf? When I'm at the club, it works perfectly. When I'm talking to my old boss, it works perfectly (I scared a lot previous bosses). When I made sales, it works perfectly. I've been told I have a strong or ""alpha"" personality. I don't know how people come to the conclusion, but I am not really afraid of much and I'm ruled by logic. When I talk to girls (daylight hours), or even most people for that matter, they're afraid. I can tell they're nervous for some weird reason. And yes, I smile. I try to joke *a lot*. Their nervousness makes me nervous and usually sabotages everything. Sometimes I come across girls who are totally confident and unphased and it feels like a normal conversation which normal people should be having. But this is like 1 out of ever 30+. When I talk to friends, they're afraid. Not in the same way though. Still no eye contact. Some of them cope by looking at their phones while talking. I get this vibe where I can't put my finger on it, but they're in some way or form ""trying to impress me"". I knew I had a vulnerability problem in the past, and I try my best to share *everything* but it seems like it's not working. I know it sounds pretty weird but it's annoying me and starting to alienate me from them bc I can't take it anymore. I know you guys don't know me, but all I want to say is that I am focused on my goals and I work hard. I don't even think I'm the most attractive guy ever, but I try to max out my looks, job, etc in whatever way possible *consistently*. Girlfriends in the past we're always assuming that I was talking to other girls. Some girls thought I could get up and leave the relationship at a moment's notice so they refuse to get with me beside either a one night stand or fling. So, I thought taking personality tests to see maybe what my weaknesses were. I took myers and enneagram and got ENTJ, with a 3 enneagram. Thanks for the read. But seriously, wtf is wrong with me? How do I change this? What should I be doing? I ready to just say f-it and focus on my goals full time."
1,vulnerability,socialskills,"Why you hate small talk, and why it's WAAY more important than you think",1,i666rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/i666rr/why_you_hate_small_talk_and_why_its_waay_more/,2020-08-09 06:28:41,"Do you hate small talk? Do you find it pointless? annoying? Shallow? A waste of time? If you do, now is the time where I call you out a little bit, but I want you to know my intention is not to make you feel bad... but for you to be aware of something that can give you more power in your life, your interactions, and your social life. Look, the reason you probably don't like small talk is because of three reasons: Number 1: you're not good at small talk Number 2: You don't fully understand the purpose of small talk Number 3: You don't know how to transition out of small talk into deeper more connected talk that can actually lead to a feeling of connectedness Because you see, your dislike of small talk is actually just a symptom of a larger problem. So let me break down small talk to you so you understand why this is a VITAL skill that you need to develop for you and your social life, and your interacting with people in general! And what it means about your social skills. First of all, why do humans need small talk? Why is it so important? To put it simply, small talk builds TRUST. You are literally giving the other person TIME to build rapport with you, to let down the emotional walls that we hold up to protect ourselves from the dangers of the world. We can't just throw ourselves fully at everyone we meet, we need to make sure we're safe. Now as humans, we are incredibly emotionally intuitive. Small talk gives people the TIME to pick up on the subtle emotional cues of the other person. So our job, through our small talk, is to COMMUNICATE to the other person that we are trustworthy, that we are friendly, and that they're safe around us (this is all subconscious by the way ) You see, the deeper, more emotional talk exposes who we are as people. It leaves us vulnerable. And obviously, you don't want to show your vulnerability off to just anyone, right? You have to know you're safe with the person you're talking to before you can be vulnerable. Which is why small talk is so important. It is essential for trust building and you NEED to have this skill in order to do so. The thing is if you don't know how to have effective small talk, it means you haven't developed a good sense of emotional empathy with people. OR, you're so stuck in your head, that you can't put yourself in someone else's shoes. So if you want to know how to master small talk, as well as how to properly transition from small talk into deeper, more engaging, emotionally enriching talk-- the kind of communication that can lead to real connection-- then leave a comment or message me. I would be happy to see what kind of specific struggles you're facing when it comes to this very important issue.  So remember. Small talk is so important! It gives the other person TIME to feel your energy and TIME to open up to you! And to EXPERIENCE you! So it's time to stop hating it and start using it."

3,vulnerability,socialskills,How do I stop myself from feeling pressured by the expectations of people I like and admire while doing things?,1,ia7icy,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ia7icy/how_do_i_stop_myself_from_feeling_pressured_by/,2020-08-15 23:39:29,"I have realized over time that I am a people pleaser. I am also not very good at focussing on things although if I do put my mind to it, I can get better faster than most people. I also lack a lot of common sense. Having said all that, I love it when people I like and admire see me as someone with potential. I have been told I have potential since I was a kid (although the older I get, the lesser I believe this). Lately, I have shown work and raised expectations of two professionals in my field and on both occasions ( 2 years apart) I have fallen and disappointed then to a shocking level. I have never thought of myself as insincere or undependable but both of these times I was so much more focussed on what they thought and how much I'm disappointing them than focussing on my job and finishing it that I ended up getting a panic attack and swellings due to stress. I have this toxic trait of not asking for help even when its in front of me and waiting for me to just ask. I need to have this facade of having my shit together but I rarely ever do. I cannot keep living like this, fearing disappointments and vulnerability. Currently, also, I am avoiding what to do because ""what if I *am* really awful at it and people figure out I'm just all barks? I know it is just the imposter syndrome but I can't stop feeling like everyone is waiting for me to fall and confirm all that they thought about me?"

There's one person I want to reach out to, because he's opened up to me about his stuff. But.. I just don't k ow how to have that conversation. I sit here and desperately yearn for human connection, to not feel so lonely, and to feel like I can be transparent and open about what I'm feeling, but doing so makes me feel like I'm ""seeking attention"". I don't want to be that person that's always dramatic. In the past, my bipolar episodes have led me to pushing some friends away and burning bridges, and I regret it now and I see that I wasn't in my right mind.

5,vulnerability,socialskills,"10 months ago, I asked this subreddit if I should give up on trying to date. I've gone on my first date since then. Here's what I've learned.",1,iggtgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/iggtgj/10_months_ago_i_asked_this_subreddit_if_i_should/,2020-08-26 03:31:53,"10 months ago, I wrote a long post in a fit of despair, under an account I've since deleted. I'm not gonna link you guys to the main body of the post, as I am a bit embarrassed about it. But I will link to the [top response](URL I got instead. To summarize my post, I was nearing 30 and despairing because I'd never been on a date, I'd barely ever flirted with a woman, never held hands, let alone kissed or had sex. For a long time, this situation hadn't bothered me, and I just listened to people when they said ""just be yourself"" or ""it'll happen when it happens"". But eventually, it all came crashing down and I started to feel like the most undesirable mofo on God's green Earth. I started to look for advice. This ended up frustrating me more, because the advice usually was of one of three varieties: * Platitudinous: ""Just be yourself"", ""it'll happen when it happens"", ""love yourself before you can love someone else"", ""work on yourself"". All well-meaning and not necessarily untrue, but for some people, this advice simply doesn't make sense until they overcome some other mental or physical roadblock. How can being yourself help if you identify as a nervous wreck? * Way too aggressive or manipulative: RedPill and shadier parts of PUA. The good: it teaches men to be more proactive. The bad: where to start? Treating dating like a zero-sum game, feeding insecurities about not being ""alpha"" enough, treating women like objects whose emotions can be toyed with, etc. * ""Feminist"" ""dating advice"". The good: empathizing with women's experiences can help men navigate dating better. The bad: often focuses more on avoiding the bad things that men do rather than on good things you *can* do. Can make already shy, considerate guy feel even more inhibited or terrified of making women uncomfortable. My frustration with these 3 types of advice left me feeling hopeless and culminated in me writing the rambling, venting post I linked to above. I wanna thank everyone who replied, but specifically /u/PM_me_goat_gifs for his [epic 10-part comment](URL His advice may not be applicable to everyone struggling with dating, but it was perfectly tailored to me, and it was mostly the fact of feeling understood and feeling like my situation wasn't hopeless that lifted me out of my pit. Now, it's 10 months later and I've since gone on my first date with a lovely woman. I asked her if she wanted to hold hands while we were walking on the beach, and we did. Later on I told her I'd like to kiss her, and she said she didn't feel ready yet. We've kept in touch and met afterwards. It all might seem quite unconsequential to some Casanovas out there, but these are all things that seemed unthinkable 10 months ago, as a guy who was terrified of making any move whatsoever, out of fear of creeping out a girl. Holding hands while looking at the sunset and laughing felt magical, but in a down-to-earth way. Mostly, it made me feel alive, like I was part of humanity again. Also, asking for a kiss and getting rejected wasn't as painful or stressful as it might have seemed. The awkwardness was dispelled pretty quickly. Now I know I am able to do this, I feel a lot more relaxed. I feared dying without ever going on so much as a date, and that nightmare is now officially over. But it wouldn't have been possible if I hadn't congratulated myself for the tiny bits of progress I made instead of focusing on the negative all the time. Flirting over text over the first time, flirting over the phone for the first time, asking someone out, etc. ~.~ I've learned a lot since I made that post (too much to put in here), even though I'm obviously still at the start of my journey and clueless about many things, and I'm happy to answer any questions in this thread. But here are some things I want people in a similar situation who are stressed out about it to hear; here's what I would tell my younger self: What causes a lack of dating success is a complicated, multifactorial thing. There really is no one-size-fits-all advice. A lot of advice you will find online is not going to applicable to your particular situation. But that doesn't mean that it's hopeless. Neither does it mean that dating is some nebulous, mysterious, serendipitous thing and the only thing you can do is just wait until the stars align and that bullshit. Whatever you have going on, there is concrete stuff that you can work on and fix. There is absolutely no shame about making dating a goal in your life, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Intimacy is a need for so many people. Maybe it shouldn't be the number 1 goal, but it can be number 2 if it's important to you. There are plenty of people out there who are perfectly content, happy and confident with all facets of their life, except dating and romance. It's very strange that we don't recognize that dating often involves a very particular set of interpersonal skills that can be worked on. There's different love languages, there's attachment theory, there's a shitton of knowledge out there about how people intimately connect, all shit that I didn't know about before I embarked on my journey and has made a lot of things make a lot more sense. But a lot of the more valuable stuff I learned, I had to dig to get to it, whereas toxic redpill, blackpill and pinkpill shit is everywhere on the Internet it seems, and unfortunately, that's what a lot of lonely misfits are turning to. Once you can reach a mindset where you can bear to take a look at yourself without beating yourself up for whatever your flaws are, you can get to work. Baby steps. While looks do count and I've changed some things (haircut, wardrobe choice), I was surprised by how much emotional baggage I had that I hadn't even noticed or considered, because I was pretty content with everything *except* my lack of dating experience. A large part of finding this out is talking to guys with similar experiences online (not incel or ForeverAlone subreddits, as in clubs where the goal is to eventually leave, it's the members with the biggest crab-in-bucket mentality who gain the most influence). Some guys would send me PM's on Reddit commenting on something I said in a comment or a post to commiserate about it. I found out a lot of commonalities with guys in similar boats like this. So many guys struggle with Autism Spectrum Disorder (I don't think I have this), Highly Sensitive Personality (I think I have this), social anxiety. Reading more about HSP and how people with it tend to relate to dating and sex made me learn a lot about myself and what I wanted in a partner; this info came in useful when crafting a dating profile (not on Tinder obviously, since this stuff can't really be conveyed in 10 emojis; if you're gonna use the apps, pick one better suited to your needs). As you gain a bit of confidence, learn to recognize your assets and capitalize on them. I love learning languages and I had great times with a girl trying to learn her language and impressing her with how fast I picked it up. I've also gotten compliments on my voice, so I tend to prefer getting to know someone over the phone to texting. You've gotta learn what kind of person you are looking for. This can be hard, as when you start out you think ""I can't afford to be picky, I have no options."" This is something you've gotta struggle through and think about, and you will change your mind. One piece of advice that many guys (and girls) can use is: when talking to someone, spend at least as much energy on vetting them as you normally would on impressing them, if not more. (Vetting in a playful way, of course - not like it's a super-dry job interview. But that's only *my* preference. If you want a date to be like a stern HR person grilling a candidate, be my guest!) As I already explained, ""be yourself"", just said like this with no context, is pretty damn useless advice. But there is a kernel of truth to it. [Craig Ferguson](URL explains it much better. It's what Mark Manson calls ""vulnerability"". Finally, I'll share the piece of practical advice that has personally helped me the most: **ask them out**, after you have gotten to know them a little and you seem to get along. A lot of people who struggle spend worrying a great deal about how to flirt without being creepy, but asking someone out on a date is the best way to clearly and unambiguously communicate that you are interested in them. This may seem like 1+1=2 level common sense to some, but one of my problems is, I've always liked to overcomplicate things =) Also, how do you ask someone out? You state your intention (""I'd like to get to know you better"" is one that works well), you invite them to whatever first date idea you've cooked up in your head (""Would you like to go on a date?""). You propose a time and a date (""Let's say Thursday at 5PM"". If they like you but it conflicts with their schedule, they'll propose an alternative.) And you convey that you won't freak out if you're rejected (""No pressure."") This model also works for proposing to exchange contact details. Hope this helps some lost souls out there. And if something in this post somehow offends you, bums you out, or doesn't seem to gel with your reality, then I'm sorry and I hope you find something that does help you elsewhere. Peace out!"
6,vulnerability,socialskills,"Um, uh, like, you know. Let's figure out filler words.",1,ighmed,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ighmed/um_uh_like_you_know_lets_figure_out_filler_words/,2020-08-26 04:10:39,"Hey friends! Everyone uses filler words, and if you do as well that's ok. Hold up, some of you haven't figured out what a filler word is yet, even with the title? That's cool, let's start there then. Filler words are mental placeholders. You're talking your way through an idea, and as you talk your way past the many folds in your big wrinkly brain sometimes you have to pause because the idea around the corner hasn't revealed itself yet. Humans across languages have filler words([Spanish example](URL &amp; [Russian example](URL and since I speak base common or English I'm sticking to that. Here are some examples of famous people fumbling over filler words. [Justin Trudeau and ""Umm""](URL [Barack Obama and ""Uh""](URL [Ariana Grande and ""All the fillers""](URL Enough examples; you get what filler words are now. You maybe even use them--often. How do we help you stop? Well first we need to actually confirm your usage of filler words. I highly recommend a moment of vulnerability, but you can also do this on your own. Record a session of conversation between yourself and someone close. Have your ""someone close"" record you on your phone as they ask you some questions that you need to explain a little. Then rewatch the video. As you do tally your filler words. Try this between both of you, and across a few topics (try a topic you're passionate about, and a topic you know moderately). Once you've confirmed your use of filler words stop using them. TL;DR stop using filler words. You're probably going ""no shit sherlock"" right now, but saying stop does not really help. Except that is the answer. Now to acknowledge how to stop. First, you need to mindful of your speach patterns. This is why you recorded some of your conversations. Second, instead of saying your filler word of choice take a deep breath. I don't mean a theatrical deep breath; just breath as if you're in full control taking your sweet time to say what's on your mind. Boom! That's it. That deep breath as a pause instead of your filler word of choice is going to change everything about your conversations. Silence is a powerful tool in your arsenal. Use it! If you're comfortable with a moment of silence, and a deep breath as you collect your thoughts instead of putting a filler word is going to make you seem in command of the situation. Here is another example video, [Lady Gaga on her ""drug addiction""](URL it's like 20 seconds in or so. Lady Gaga is being interviewed about a challenging topic. Notice she doesn't use filler words, and is instead attempting to use silence/breaths for filler. She even drags the last syllables of words where she would have used fillers. However, she seems confident even under pressure, and she seems unphased because she hasn't resorted to filler words even as she talks on a tough topic. I think I covered everything I was wanting to touch on. We covered what filler words are, and how even top speakers use them. How to see our own use of the fillers. How to stop using them. Finally an example of them not being used. Feom here; ask questions in case I missed something, and practice makes better. Real TL;DR pretty much everyone uses filler words similar to those listed in the title. Here's some examples, now stop using them."
7,vulnerability,socialskills,Conversation is connection,1,ihaivx,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ihaivx/conversation_is_connection/,2020-08-27 10:00:45,"I feel this subject might split people but I feel a conversation about conversation is terribly needed. This all sounds like common sense but what life has taught me, common sense isn't common practice. I always thought conversations was weird when I got older because many of the natural ways I use to get into conversations was because at a young age it got easy for me. However as we get older our identity becomes more complex and we carry a lot of burden of the past and has become harder and harder to get good conversations due to lack of self knowledge. As I got older, I moved to schools, cities and talking to people got messy. Then I thought, what the hell is conversation for? Why is having good conversations getting harder as we get older? Surprising I learned a lot as I started learning about myself. Becoming more self aware of my feelings towards others and conversations. There's no such thing as a pointless discussion, there's another a pointless connection. Conversation is about connecting others by displaying our feelings towards each even if the topic has nothing to do with you. Rather you value status, looks, intelligence, or compassion and kindness, your feelings towards your values are reflected in conversations. Your willingness to be open about different ideas, opinions and experiences. Some people are not interested in connected with a certain group of people and often display their disapproval by ignoring, mocking, or being overly critical. The bad news is that if someone feels towards you as disgust or anger, they have very little patients towards you, your feelings and your opinions. The good news is that you can spot this in a numerous ways and you don't have to take unnecessary risks to open yourself up to the wrong people. This is my opinion based on my life experience. Here's 5 ways to indicate good conversations. &amp;#x200B; 1. **Eye contact**: This is easy but often the most important. All you need is focus in the conversation while being aware of the person you are talking to. There's very little you can do or say if the person you are talking to doesn't look you in the eye in most interactions. 2. **Openness**: When a person is comfortable with your presence, they are more open to hear your opinions, feelings and exchanges. I use this as my main indicator but often times you are going to have to find some compromises. Not everyone is open to everything in fact you're going to find one or more thing that you don't want to open to. Some might tolerate your presence but that often means they prefer distance due to trust issues or want to check what kind of person you are first. No one likes to find out the person you got buddy buddy too quick is someone you can't tolerate to. Some people have high energy and this could be draining for some people. The reasons are irrelevant but the main focus is to pay attention to their responses as you go. This is important to detect because we often feel or think this requires work when in every case what you need to do is just be aware. Don't add more than you need to because you'll come across as over reaching. They are just as aware as you and it's best to assume the best rather assume the worst. 3. **Responses to Vulnerability**: Being vulnerable is hard and if you had a history of trust issues, your relationship with trusting strangers in conversations will be difficult. As a rule of thumb I like to pick a struggle you are comfortable sharing. Try things like daily inconveniences, stories, or even observations that made you feel a certain way. Trust what you have to say and say it with true authenticity. We are emotional creatures to the core and you can't connect with someone if you can't be vulnerable. Sadly some were ridiculed or mocked to express vulnerability but with practice and time, you'll pick up more and more signs of safe areas to express and learn how to deal with them and pick out who truly feels comfortable with who you are.This is the heart of being good with conversations so trust issues have to be dealt with. You can talk to friends, visit a therapist or practice therapy. Do what you can to embrace trusting others while also embracing mistakes and learning from them. 4. **Teasing vs Affectionate Teasing**: This is what I would say is more sophisticated if you know how to do it right but sometimes you could screw it up and make a mistake and make an insult. You need to know the difference in order to pick out certain kinds of people and learn how teasing works. Teasing can hurt but there's a nuance between someone who teasing to get a small rise and compete with each other and teasing to belittle your sense of being. This should goes without saying, you need trust. My rule of thumb has always been if you know how to tease back and they act upset or act very negatively, then it's possible they didn't want to play with you. Think of it as play fighting and unwanted birthday punches. They both can hurt but there's an emotional context. I find socially awkward people struggle with this because they are using to competing with bigger and harder. Where as affectionate teasing is subtle, witty and requires a creative mind. A good tease promotes a sense of play and the battle of the minds. Think of like DBZ where Goku spares with friends. Everyone is different but there's not much to connect with if one side has the freedom to tease you while you can't. Even if you suck at it, people sometimes can't take a hint and you need to learn the difference. I only recommend this if you know how to handle offence. 5. **Read the Room and Go with the Flow**: The best way to have an easy time with good conversations is learn to read a room and go with the flo. Opinions, feelings and even volume are all sort of like limited resources in a conversation and take up attention. If it's all goes to one side, then there's no room for others. Subject changes are like Segway, they don't abruptly change, they smoothly turn. We don't need to take the wheel of every conversation. You'll find yourself in with a group of people who are already heavily invested and may hold little to no attention to you and that's ok. Someone already beat you too it and everyone is riding along and the great thing about this is that you don't have to do the hard work. You can see everyone's cue's, how they hold attention and how they express. They're telling you a lot you know about them. Listen and enjoy the conversation or don't! Another cool thing about reading a room is that you can decide to join or not. I don't get caught up with everything and in fact I join very little conversations unless it's something I do want to hear. The easiest way to listen to someone is to choose who or what to listen. Sometimes we come across a conversation that you feel upset, disgusted, or even angry about. People say all sorts of things that can offend you personally which is totally fine. No one is forcing you to join, no one is asking you to either. Reading a room can help you navigate like Reddit. You find topics and people to join and share a conversation. 6. **Listening:** A good indication of someone who is a good listener is giving authentic feedback to what you're saying. ""Mhm"" ""yea"" and head nods are ok but if that's all they are doing, then there's very little room to connect. If you're on the listening end and listening is actually hard for you then my rule of thumb is try repeating what they just said and add your own take on it. Reactions, reflections, acknowledgement and opinions are great feedback indicators. They don't have to be crazy but it shows you are being a participant in the conversation. All in all I hope I gave some insight but some might view this as common sense but I feel this attitude should consider the fact that many don't know how to have a good conversation and don't know how to. I feel we can make a difference by sharing and understanding and what better way to understand each other than have better communication. Talking doens't have to be all cool one liners but hey it's up to how you feel. Hope you're all doing well, peace."
8,vulnerability,socialskills,What real manipulation looks like,1,ii7llj,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ii7llj/what_real_manipulation_looks_like/,2020-08-29 00:04:22,"I have noticed that terms like honesty, vulnerability, and empathy are used as if they are somehow incompatible with manipulation. However, they are the very basis of real manipulation. Are there any books (or other resources) that explain the process of manipulation as one of emotional connection and empathy, rather than as a game of chess? Such honest information would probably be labelled as evil and the people who share it ""sociopaths"" by the very people who understand it and feel threatened by it. In reality, people who dont show emotion, vulnerability, and empathy are seen as weird, cold, uncharismatic, and repulsive. People who come across as manipulative and selfish are the ones who are terrible at manipulation. The real manipulators are the ones who can convince you that they truly care about you and that you can trust them. They are the people who seem the most human out of everyone. Any thoughts on this?"
9,vulnerability,socialskills,You want deeper connections ? Show vulnerability.,1,iinrwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/iinrwq/you_want_deeper_connections_show_vulnerability/,2020-08-29 16:32:16,"Being vulnerable is considered a taboo in today's society. It's also hard to be vulnerable out of fear of being ""cringeworthy"" or judged. But as far as I could remember, I always felt gravitated towards people who opened up about their issues, because I was able to relate to them on some level. Also, the fact that they were opening up to me showed that I matter and I was someone that could be trusted. When I mean being vulnerable, I don't mean being a sob story, whining about daily life etc etc. But if someone asks you, how you're doing, I mean really answer them with how you're doing, how you're actually feeling in the present moment. Say not too great because so and so...most of the time, the other person will relate. No one's at the perfect mood all the time. Show some vulnerability by sharing something that makes you human and relatable. What I mean is you don't need to have a perfect response to everything. Say that you are a work in progress and you are following r/socialskills to be better, and if they cringe, chances are they aren't meant to be in your life and thats okay. Because there is always someone who is also insecure and who will be glad that they are not the only ones suffering from a lack of social skillset, they might even thank you for recommending this subreddit. They might be in your debt for life because you changed theirs. The idea, folks, is to have quality connections than quantity. A lot of social advice is about being better listeners, however it goes both ways, when you show vulnerability, you are giving the other person the opportunity to be a better listener. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
10,vulnerability,socialskills,A counterintuitive approach to becoming social,1,ij75nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ij75nf/a_counterintuitive_approach_to_becoming_social/,2020-08-30 14:55:01,"If you're trying to become social, it's no secret that advice such as ""put yourself out there"" or ""talk to more people"" is vague and unhelpful. The counterintuitive way would be to develop the traits that make you capable of being a social person. There are a ton of things you can improve but the main three I can think of are health, vulnerability, and starting conversations. Health: confidence, self-esteem, energy, motivation, and rational thinking is extremely difficult if your health is not solid. Focus on getting the four fundamentals down: good quality sleep, hydration, clean eating, and exercise. Vulnerability: vulnerability can be defined by being willing to overcome uncertainty to live your desire. In a way it's like facing your fears but slightly different. It's more of a focus on being okay with not knowing and doing something anyway. It's best to take progressive micro steps since vulnerability can be difficult for a lot of people. Starting conversations: chances are, the toughest social aspect for you is starting conversations. Once you get to know someone, you're probably fine but starting convos is the tough part. This is why you need to master health and vulnerability. Health will give you the self-esteem and energy to do this and vulnerability will help you overcome the uncertainty. Easiest ways to start conversations without coming off as creepy or threatening is to follow a three part process: 1: acknowledge the awkwardness. Being socially intelligent enough to acknowledge you're addressing you randomly will signal to the other person that you're a socially calibrated person. \- eg. Pardon me, I know this is kind of random but... , Sorry to bother you 2: provide context or an exit plan. One of the main issues with being approached is that strangers can still be threats and you're always looking for a way out. Releving this tension will put the other person at ease. \- eg. Pardon me, I know this is kind of random but I was just about to get a drink and... 3: say what you have to say. Give a compliment, make a comment, ask a question. \- eg. Pardon me, I know this is kind of random but I was just about to get a drink and I noticed you have a really cool jacket. Where did you get it? Most importantly... SMILE!!!! Smiling shows you are not a threat. Happy, friendly people smile. Depressed psychopaths don't.

We met on Instagram and went on a date 4 days later, which was awkward because it was my first one in over 1.5 yrs. Anyway, we got to know each other a little bit better and got closer over time. Eventually, relationship talk started happening and she mentioned how she's been single for about 8 months from her previous relationship (2 yrs). Anyway, to get to the point, she told me she thought I was a fuckboy and that she doesn't ""know"" me despite hanging out for 2 months. Unfortunately, I ended up catching feelings but I have trouble expressing myself fully. I'd say it's gotten better, but there are still some things I have to be more open about. I've been severely depressed since age 10 and naturally became quite emotionally numb/dead inside over the years. All these feelings of wanting to be with someone and longing for connection are so overwhelming that I can't say what I'm feeling. Don't get me wrong, it's not that I can't be without her, I just think having her in my life is a good thing and that it'd be cool to be together if that ever happens. She told me about how when I'm upset, I don't talk about it and that it scares her. She thinks I'm a cold person, which is true sometimes. I'm not used to opening up to others about my inner thoughts, especially if it's someone I'm interested in romantically. Sometimes I feel like too much vulnerability is unattractive and can scare the other person away. I don't know how to be more open without the other person eventually leaving because they're scared of me. I feel lost."
12,vulnerability,socialskills,This week has been amazing,8,hqylyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/hqylyr/this_week_has_been_amazing/,2020-07-14 19:44:31,"I'm terrible at socializing but every day I make an effort towards being better, this week has brought on allot of interesting challenges and lessons. I realized there really aren't any boring people out there and you can have fun with pretty much anyone if you choose to, all it takes is a little vulnerability from your part to make the first move. Realize that socializing is really about understaning the other person. Make it your mission with every person you meet to understand what makes tick, what makes them laugh, what makes them annoyed and you'll quickly realize that anyone who is open enough to share that stuff can be a ball of fun. I used to judge others based on their decisions and my opinion would shape my interaction with them. That's horrible, don't do that. Being in lockdown has taught me the value of the people I had around me and how I really didn't value them at all. Even if life presents someone you typically wouldn't be friends with, realize that they could potentially be the last person you ever see or perhaps your the only person who talked to them today, so connect with them for gods sake. Also stop over-thinking everything, you are who you are and you can't change the fact that everything you do is an expression of yourself. If you try to tailor your messages to sound a certain way, the other person is going to notice. Speak from an authentic place, send that risky text or say how you feel. I'm aware of how I come across to people, that I message too often sometimes with new people, I come off as a little too eager to get to know them but that's far from being something I should hide from the world. That's part of my personality, I love meeting new people and I'm always excited to get to know them more, I'm done apologizing for that."

The problem is since I used to not know how to make friends, most of the people I know today were not people I chose to befriend, more likely it just happened randomly. I realize I dont have much in common with them, and at this point theyre mostly acquaintances then friends. This is also because I had a lot vulnerability and trust issues which prevented me from being emotionally intimate. I could never make the relationship go past acquaintances. I want to know how to start over and finally make friends who ill have real fulfilling relationships with?

Most of my friends have moved away... **1) Be yourself.** It's all about vulnerability. It is less about changing yourself to meet the ideals of what you think someone else would like, instead try to be unapologetically yourself and you will attract people who genuinely value you for you. **2) Be proactive.** Comment on people's Facebook posts or reply to people's [Instagram](URL stories - both great way to reconnect with old friends in a direct way. **3) Use friendship apps.** There are many great apps out there which connect you with new people who are all on there for the same reason. They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values.

I said thank you to my friend for opening my eyes to my own faults and making me realize I needed to fix them. I told them they inspired me to become a better person and actually work on my faults. Their reply was short and said I was not their bro. What came to my mind when this happened - when someone I thought was my friend openly said they are not anymore, was that some friends come for a season and others for a lifetime. I could have been angry and felt betrayed but instead I was just grateful that I actually got something out of that friendship even if it didn't last very long. I know I'm not perfect and I messed up a lot but it motivates me to know I can get better and it doesn't have to be that way forever. To explain this, I have a lot of unhealthy behaviour/habits that come from my upbringing, especially my parents. It's funny how I just saw a post about how having bad parents can make your social skills better - it was a great post, made me cry a little if I'm honest. &amp;#x200B; When I say I'm the common denominator in the title, what I mean is I've only had failed or shallow friendships. And what do those have in common? Me in it. I'm not complaining, I'm just stating a fact. Do I wish things were different? Well yes because I wonder what it would be like, but also no because those experiences helped me grow and in the future I want to have real genuine friendships that I've never had. I've experienced somewhat bullying by my peers (I was about 12 to 14), betrayal by who I thought were friends as in they turn against me, fake friends, friends gone silent (silent as in passive. When we see each other, it's obvious things aren't what they used to be. Nobody is addressing something that needs to be addressed and it just gives bad vibes. Things get passive from there), and many other things. Again not complaining, just giving a little bit of a backstory. &amp;#x200B; Now, I'm halfway through University. I've made some new friendships. But I think it's important to analyse those right now. I thought I valued my friends more than anything because I know what it's like to not have any. It's like, I've done and I continue to do my best to give them the best possible treatment. Like, hey you need a ride on the car? No problem, I'll leave you on the doorstep so you don't have to stay outside in the cold. Wanna hang out? Cool, let's make some plans. Are you free right now? I'm always free for you. But I started to resent people for not valuing me as much as I valued them. I also had started to take out my stress and built up anxiety on my friends which is extremely unfair. &amp;#x200B; I guess I just lacked the social skills I thought I had. Let's talk about my bad social skills and bad/toxic behavioural habits shall we? These are also the things that probably ""scared"" my ""friends"" away. &amp;#x200B; 1. Expecting attention in return when I do something for someone. 2. Being too kind to the point where people walk all over and take advantage of me. 3. Big one: Feeling responsible for, making excuses for &amp; making up for other people's thoughts, emotions &amp; judgment. 4. Always doing things for other people. It got to a point where I would act like a mother. 5. Imposing my values on other people. Being too controlling. 6. Unconsciously manipulating people. 7. Trust issues, not being myself. Not opening up to others, ever. 8. Having ""different personalities'' around different people. I'm definitely different around friends and parents. 9. Not having clear boundaries and not knowing what boundaries look like. 10. Resenting people. 11. Not enjoying the moment and not knowing how. Always rushing towards the end goal and stressing about it if others don't do the same. 12. Suppressing my feelings and wants. 13. Postponing happiness for the future. Not living a life I'd be happy to call my own.7 14. Another big one: Being afraid of vulnerability. 15. Somewhat varying levels of impostor syndrome. 16. Not acknowledging people or giving them feedback &amp;#x200B; (Just realized \^ this list \^ can be a post on it's own and I might do that) &amp;#x200B; That's all I can think of for now but I just wanted to get this off my chest. I'm so imperfect but somehow that just makes me want to try harder. Look, I've had these thoughts in my head for a lifetime and I don't think I can better myself any further if I don't get a different perspective. So if you have anything you want to say or any advice or way that I can deal with any of these things I've enumerated, please feel free to comment. I've done the hard part already which is acknowledging all this shit about myself - and I don't want it for myself anymore, I want to clean it up and be better. The problem is, I don't know how and I'm too scared about trying at all. &amp;#x200B; The last thing I wanna say is that if you have a friend and they are shit, please point out their shit. Odds are they might not be aware of it or they've gone through something and you guys should talk about it or maybe their shit behaviour is actually a defense mechanism. Everyone has their own reasons. One thing that I learned (that previously would have belonged on that list) is that not everything is black and white. There's a lot more grey in this world.

I don't share in a self-pitying way, just trying to be honest. Being open about loneliness is something that have brought me closer to ppl in the past, but maybe I am expecting too much? I don't expect this of everyone, but of people I feel like have the capacity to relate to me. Sometimes I just get sympathetic words back, like ""ah, I'm sorry you had to deal with that"" or smth like that. I feel like I rly stagger at this part of a friendship, maybe I am forcing it? But I also hate the feeling of being able to have a closer friendship with someone and not knowing how to get there. Sometimes with some people it just clicks, but I've met people I like a lot and have so much in common with (not just interest-wise) that idk how to get closer to.

They are open to making friends with you. I have used a lot and my personal favourite is [Serendip](URL \- it cuts through the superficiality and actually connects you with people who share your values. Others include [Bumble](URL but it is more used for dating. **4) Phone calls.** Calling your existing friends is a great way to strengthen your bond. When we can't meet in person due to lockdown, a voice or video call has much more depth than a text message. **5) Just ask.** This isn't dating, you don't need to worry about being rejected to find the 'one'. Ask people you have just met for a coffee or their number. ""I am new to the area and it would be great if you could show me around"". Put yourself at the receiving end of this - it's a very natural message. **6) Join local groups.** This is not advised during lockdown! Whilst we are under social isolation we can fall back on #3 for the meanwhile."
26,vulnerability,socialskills,What I do wrong,1,gsh5hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/gsh5hk/what_i_do_wrong/,2020-05-29 09:15:05,"Wherever I go I'm left aside. People tend to see me as quiet and shy. I'm not even bad looking I saw a lot of weird dudes getting laid. It's always when I don't know where to talk cuz I have no need. They always talk (pathethic and pointless, cringe shit), and get ahead of me. Even at my shitty job. They get more hours, more attention, when they say something ""it matters"", when I say it either means nothing or ""how dare you"". I've honestly seen ugly and retarded people often more succesfully in life than me. Why? When I talk to wherever shit it always seems like the whole point of conversation is to make me feel embarassed (by whatever and insignificant details). Like they ploit against me. Like they want to see vulnerability of any kind. It's not some people. IT'S ALL. That's how it feels. Even if it doesn't seem like that in the begginning at some point, without even talking about anything personal it looks like they just wait: for something to entertain them. I can't get whatever I want never because I have to deal with all peasants. I have also violent intrusive thoughts and hiphocondria (didn't share with anyone). And it still looks like they play with my nerves. Until one day - when my mind turns cold and I blackout.... I honestly don't understand what's happening. It's like my talents, intelligence, attractiveness doesn't hold any value. Why do I tell this? I see daily all the monkeys getting whatever I don't. They're not beautiful, they're unintelligent, they're pathethic in the most genuine sense. Cringe. I'm always left aside no matter what. If I try something I'm welcome with ""hostility"" and mind games. I hate everyone. I don't care about anyone. Why don't they see their bussiness? They play this 'empathy' shit game only to be hostile. I don't fucking care about any alive being, but I'm only keeping this to myself, and my life is ruined."
27,vulnerability,socialskills,Am I just agreeable--dealing with reclusive habits and empathy,2,fvfycf,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/fvfycf/am_i_just_agreeabledealing_with_reclusive_habits/,2020-04-06 01:56:01,"I'm a fairly private person. Don't think it's something I'm going to change soon but I do have quite a few walls up. I'm much better at discussing another person's feelings better than my own because it is hard to pinpoint exactly what I feel usually because they are so extreme. Also just with my personal experiences I have opened up, either through interests or emotions, to be shut down or have had my own personality thrown in my face/told that I'm overreacting/overemotional so I try to just mute that side of myself. The main thing I have going on for me socially is that I can have a decently in-depth conversation with almost anyone. I hate small talk however. I really don't approach people or ask questions right off the bat so I think I have people see me as a trustworthy person (or maybe just a recluse so they know what they tell me won't leave the room) so I hear some really personal things even from strangers. Some people have been really understanding that I just won't share too much of myself and can guess why I have a lot of walls and respect that and we continue doing our thing. Other people have an issue with this and constantly pry into my life and pick fights when I tell them despite knowing them for a year that we don't connect on that level or haven't actually gotten to know each other enough and I don't feel comfortable sharing certain things. And I don't mean in a ""we care about you we just want to make sure you're ok"" it's almost always been ""I want to know your weaknesses"" (mostly because these people pry and don't share anything about themselves). The main thing that helps me with that is I just have an ability to see things from all sides, I can put myself in other people's shoes, if I know them well enough I can tell exactly what their thought process is. I'll usually say things like ""yeah I understand what you mean and how that upset you, like X was out of line doing Y"" or whatever and I'll try to give some practical advice that they would likely go along with. However I've noticed there are also quite a few people who I have had no issue with coming to me saying I'm agreeable, too nice, and just say things to avoid an argument. I was a little shocked (especially coming from certain people in my life). They're right to a certain degree but it's less that I want to be liked and more that I don't want to show any vulnerability/expose myself to the wrong people. I've been thinking about it for a while and I'm wondering if it's something about my social skills. I already know they suck. But I have had some people I would call good friends call me out on this. And I feel like there's no way to really say ""look I just see where you're coming from and can tell how it's affected you"" to certain people. I know that not everyone can put themselves in other people's shoes so it can be hard to understand. I'm not too beat up about it, it happens it happens, I already know most people my own age find me suspicious (i.e. people I graduated with but never talked to but still see from time to time), definitely have a reputation for ""getting into people's business but never exploiting myself"" (even though most things just get tossed at me), it just kind of rubbed me the wrong way that it happened to begin with. I don't have a lot of social grace anyway. But I know you can't change other people so I'm just wondering if there's something I need to change myself. Not sure if any of this even makes sense. Sorry. Feel like it comes off a bit more as a rant my bad."
28,vulnerability,socialskills,Here's how you can improve your social skills during the COVID-19 lockdown.,1,fylmr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/fylmr5/heres_how_you_can_improve_your_social_skills/,2020-04-11 04:32:35,"Hey Reddit. When governments around the world started adopting social distancing, I wanted to fight it really, really badly. (Fortunately, I didn't. I am safely at home and spreading no germs, so don't worry.) I've spent the past two years practicing my social skills *every single day*. I made friends. I was confident and happy. I finally felt like I had just ""made it."" Now I can't see any of the people closest to me, and it sucks. To keep my social skills from atrophying in the meantime, I constructed a ""social lockdown regime"" that I follow almost everyday. I've lurked around here and seen several posts asking about how to improve social skills during the lockdown, so I figured I'd share! I want to stress that these are NOT replacements for real, honest-to-goodness-face-to-face conversations, but they're way better than nothing. Social skills articles and books are fantastic for pointing out your weak areas, but there's no way to grow socially except by practicing. Hopefully these offer decent ways for you Redditors to practice! **Improve yourself.** Use this time to develop your ""ideal skill."" By ""ideal skill,"" I don't necessarily mean a passion or anything like that. Just pick something you find interesting, and work hard at getting better at it. This is a great time to learn how to cook, play an instrument, program, write, and so on. Aside from being fun, this keeps your mind from anxious thoughts and self loathing. How does this translate to having better social skills? You'll come out of the lockdown having a hobby that you enjoy, and it's almost always easier to speak to people about something you like doing (especially if they share your hobby!). It also has the added bonus of making you more interesting. Communities naturally form around shared interests. People like doing things they enjoy with other people. Even if you aren't good at holding conversations, you can still do things with others, and having that human presence provides opportunities to improve your social skills. If you come out of this lockdown having an ideal skill you didn't have before, you have a better chance of finding a good community. **Force yourself to text others.** This is self explanatory. If you have friends/acquaintances, even if they're not close friends, send them a text to just check up on them. Seriously, it's not weird at all and most people will be really thankful you thought of them. Text conversations are different from real conversations, but being proactive in texting others has helped me to also be more proactive in real conversations. **Speak to your family, especially if you're socially anxious around them.** If you're staying at home with your family (and you have at least a half-decent family), talk to them. It's probably the only regular social interaction you're going to have for awhile. Social skills grow through regular, deliberate practice. If your social anxiety is bad around your family, this advice applies even more. Challenging yourself is necessary to improve. Maybe don't put excessive pressure on yourself to have a long, deep conversation with your siblings, but make an effort to say a bit more than you usually might. Keep pressing yourself and progressing. **Set up video calls with friends.** Basically the same as texting others. Video calls are more personal, and they communicate that you're actually invested in the friendship. This is good. You want to show people that you care; it takes vulnerability and creates real connection. Plus, video calls are as close as you can get to a real life conversation. &amp;#x200B; If you don't already have a few friends, these tips aren't as applicable, but I would still say to focus on improving yourself and speak to your family if they're around. Hope this helps!"
29,vulnerability,socialskills,"Looking back to my past friends, I feel like I'm starting to narrow down the root causes of what caused us relate to each other naturally.

The more shared that these were, the closer the bonds and more natural that everything seemed. So it seems like the way to find the people you vibe with on a logical level is: (1) Similar cultural struggles or cultural background. (2) Similar interests or being in a similar field of work. (3) Similar shared ambitions, beliefs, and mindsets. Beliefs not so much, if there was nothing else to support that connection. And then from there, past struggles and similar likes/dislikes would be use as vulnerability to build intimacy."

Obviously, you need to make sure that the struggle isn't a constant complaint or a plea for sympathy because then it becomes a negative, rather than having said nothing at all. Thoughts? **P.S. I know that I made in arbitrary equation, but tell me how it makes a lot of sense when you rearrange the equation... wtf.** More life struggle = more likelihood of relating to others + more likelihood of intimacy in relationships with others + being less open about it Which is true, the more you go through, the more apprehensive that you are about sharing your life struggles because it's a lot of baggage. Being more open about it = more likelihood of relating to others + more likelihood of intimacy in relationships with others + more life struggle. Which is true, revealing more about yourself, also has its own struggles. There's more struggles because now you have to reveal your deepest issues and trust someone not to do anything with the information, or use it against you emotionally. It's the sacrifice for vulnerability."

34,vulnerability,socialskills,Where do your friends fall?,1,fovhr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/fovhr5/where_do_your_friends_fall/,2020-03-26 05:33:50,"**Strangers (lowest level):** know nothing about each other, maybe a very short hi how are you. The birth and progression of a friendship is dependent upon the first impression a person makes on another. If it is a bad impression, then chances are it will not develop. If it is a good impression, then the chances are it will develop. This leads to the next stage**.** **Acquaintance (second level):** occasional contact, not pre-arranged, general knowledge that is talked about, defined by occasional interactions that you experience with a person. CAN have potential to become a casual friend when future planned meet-ups are mentioned, but theres nothing definite, its still just potential. It is important to note that this is the stage where an ""Associate"" falls as well. An associate is defined as a partner or colleague in business or at work. So, an associate is basically like your co-worker or a fraternity member. With an acquaintance, you know of each other because of the occasional high-and-bye situations that you both encounter with each other. Both of you have very general knowledge about each other such as knowing each other's name, major, who you hang out with, or where you work. However, this is about as far as it goes in with this stage. **Casual friend (third level):** most people make it here, more frequent meeting than an acquaintance, not serious emotionally, some common interests and activities. It is the stage where a person can actually say that they know a person. During this stage, people meet more frequently than acquaintances, more than likely, because the interactions are planned. The bonding factor in this stage revolves around the friends' common interests and activities. Additionally, in this stage, people are personally invested in each other; they are aware of each other's achievements and they give praise and support. However, they are not emotionally invested in each other. This is normally the stage where people begin to see each other with their mask offno pun intended; it is an introduction into who the person really is. Sadly, most people never make it past this stage for a number of reasons, but sometimes it's because one person cannot handle the other's undesirable qualities. However, if a person proves themselves worthy, then they can level up**.** **Close friend (fourth level):** similar views, ideals, and worldviews, mutual interests &amp; life goals and work together to achieve them, to an extent can connect in mind/body/spirit. . Once a person has reached the Close Friend stage, not only have both people invested in each other personally, but also emotionally. Because of the level of investment, close friends have shared more information. They are aware and familiar with each other's family members and intimate life. Also, they both know and help each other to accomplish their life goals; hence, the emphasis on emotional investment. I consider this stage to be the connection of the mind, body, and spirit of two individuals because they have shared many experiences together. Both people have seen each other at their best and at their worst, and they have stayed around regardless. **Intimate friend (fifth level):** committed to the development of each other's characters, mutual responsibility of honesty, connected ""soul-to-soul**"".** Its a very close connection with an individual who you are familiar with. This stage is attained over time, through shared experiences, and, most important, through vulnerability. It is through vulnerability that a friendship reaches this stage. At this level, one has shared their deepest secrets such as their biggest insecurities and their biggest fears. It is from this level of intimacy that friends become connected soul to soul, and they commit to the development of each other's character and as people. This is the stage where one is considered a true friend. The saying that embodies the spirit of this level of friendship is by Aristotle in which he states, ""a friendship is one soul occupying two bodies."" These individuals truly understand each other."

Then I see usually extroverted types break that formal barrier kind of an immediately open up and and act close. This catches me off guard sometimes as Im use to the norm of gradually opening up to people. Ive been coming face to face with a lot of people like that lately because of university and I can tell they view me as awkward because Im not open right away. This part is really hard for me because I feel like my introvert qualities express who I really am. For example: my true nature is to just be mellow. I gradually grow closer to people and open up as I deem them trustworthy/not judgmental. So usually when I meet people Im serious in a friendly way I guess. I dont want to lose the undertones of who I really am by being too friendly so sometimes I come off aloof and cold to people. My biggest fear is looking like a fraud. I never want to come off as a way that isnt me but at the same time I cant just be myself around someone Ive just met. Its just not in my nature to do that. I know some people are naturally friendly and thats a trait that I admire. But if I was to replicate it, it wouldnt be true to my nature. So Im stuck between being perceived as awkward because Im staying true to my nature and replicating another personality and feeling misunderstood and not SEEN for who I really am. I want to be friendly and open towards people but I dont want them to misunderstand my personality by mistaking me as an extrovert or someone who lacks substance. I usually substitute openness with my humour to make people laugh as a way to connect since thats always been handy for me. But it makes me feel one dimensional and I dont want to be viewed only in a comedic light. It makes it harder to talk about things I care about with people because theyre use to the surface level conversations/met me in that light. Theres so much more to me that I feel like my introvert qualities express more. When Im serious thats when I feel the most authentic because Im able to tell people things honestly like how I appreciate them, whats on my heart, my worries, what drives me/angers me etc. And I feel surface level conversations lack vulnerability and honesty. People are taken aback by it and are uncomfortable so I cant connect to them if Im only talking to them about surface safe light topics. Its very confusing for me. Im not sure how to act meeting new people anymore. It just gives me anxiety now because I dont want to be fake."

An old friend of mine has been pretty frustrating to bond with. Both of us are 31 and our lives have been coming together in different ways. I was hoping she would be a comforting buddy as I transition back home, but instead she's been passive aggressive and competitive. I've interpreted this as insecurity, so my goal has been to help raise her self-esteem. I try to lead by example showing a healthy mix of vulnerability and self-acceptance. I also avoid talking about the things in my life that could make her feel threatened. However I'm getting frustrated because she has been doing the opposite, and I don't think she is fully aware of it. While it may sound arrogant, the successes I've had could EASILY be used to make her feel small -- I choose not to highlight those things because it would be insensitive. Yesterday at work, her boss pulled her aside to address that she talks down to people and her intonation is sometimes insulting other co-workers. I felt bad for her because she was truly blindsided by the feedback and felt attacked. But selfishly it was also validating for me to hear that I wasn't imagining it. I haven't given up on her as a friend because I think she's lost her way a bit and that's when friends need you the most. But at the same time, I don't want her to effect my mental health or confidence. I'm not so secure that passive aggressive digs don't hurt me -- they definitely do. And now since her boss embarrassed her, I don't feel like I can bring it up with out really hurting her. How can I help my friend but also protect myself from negative energy while she's going through this rough patch?"

I use to have awkward interactions with people in my lectures and as a result would fail at becoming closer with them. Im a reserved and introverted person, so typically it takes me awhile before I can show people who I really am. I would always greet people formally and talk to students I had just met in a formal way since I didnt know them well. It was always awkward and I always thought that it was normal to talk to people you dont really know like that (it is). This past month Ive been intentionally choosing to be vulnerable. Vulnerable in the sense that I feel control in allowing myself to feel in the moment, and open to sending warmth to people before it is given back to me. I have talked to strangers in a way that is coming from a warm and open place. This warm and open place stemmed from me choosing to be vulnerable. To be truly vulnerable you have to be okay with being rejected/accepted. Its a paradox but by choosing to be vulnerable, Ive never felt more powerful. And despite me being introverted, this method made me feel outgoing towards people and they could have easily mistaken me as being extroverted. Instead of having an awkward tone of voice I talk to people as if I am their friend. I dont cross boundaries or anything but just use a natural tone of voice rather than my all polished talking to someone new for the first time voice. I see people open up immediately to that and they in turn drop the formalities! Being authentic is super hard and requires vulnerability but damn connecting to people feels so good."
41,vulnerability,socialskills,What is the best way to deal with people who project their insecurities and ruin the vibe?,1,exbcog,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/exbcog/what_is_the_best_way_to_deal_with_people_who/,2020-02-02 06:37:15,"Last night I was hanging out with some friends and having a good time until a guy that someone invited joined in. The only times he ever seemed to contribute to the conversation was to project his own insecurities on me and just be a dick. It wasn't super blatant enough for other people to realize, and I honestly just thought he had bad social awareness or social skills. At the end of the night, one of my friends was having a bad time and crying and we were supporting him. My girlfriend seemed uncomfortable in the situation and we were getting tired since it was almost 3AM, so we decided to head out since the situation was better under control and he had plenty of friends around to support him through this. I stood up to leave and say goodbye to my friends but they were distracted helping our distressed friend, so I stood there for a moment waiting to grab someone's attention and to quickly say goodnight. At this moment, the guy decided it would be a great idea to sneer and ask if I was ""going to just fucking stand there"" as if I was being awkward or something. It really took a lot for me to not get pissed off in that moment and go off on this guy, considering the situation that was unfolding at the time. In a time of my friends greatest vulnerability, he decided that the best thing to do was judge me and almost backseat drive my thought process. How exactly would you deal with people that project their insecurities and ruin ""the vibe""? That one sentence really agitated me, and it frustrates me that this person is trying to project their insecurities on me, and I feel like he projected some of his bad energy onto me. I'm trying to become a more socially aware person, and I've come a long way. Although the situation is frustrating, I guess the good side of this is that I'm getting better at picking out the people that bring negative energy to my life. I plan to never hang out around this person again and tell my friends about this, and hopefully they will understand. How would you guys deal with a situation like this?"

This is so powerful yet so bizarre. I knew authenticity was important, but this is astonishing. I'm going to start finding ways of calibrating vulnerability and authenticity, while also asking about the other person and getting the information I need. I feel like my EQ jumped a lot. Today was the first time where I asked someone for a favor, and then they asked me for my information and wanted to offer more favors and felt really receptive to me. What the fuck is reality. It's like I'm a sociopath because my existence was so polarizing and charming that I moved someone a lot, but I'm not at the same time because I actually care for the person."

So much hate out there. I've read a few articles on ""how white people can celebrate black history month"", but I want to go deeper. To be honest, I just don't have a lot of black friends. I also grew up in the South so, my levels of woke-ness aren't quite as high as I'd like for them to be. I'm working on this. I run a small business and would like to celebrate Black History Month in my marketing in some way, as well as personally. I'd like to go ahead and start developing content for it. Is there anything I should avoid? Anything that someone who is, to be perfectly honest, just now in her mid-30s, learning about black culture, needs to know? I could give you my full history, but it's not necessary. Just know that I'm, until recently, your typical clueless white person, but I want to be better. I'm trying to be better. I know I'm not going to change the world. I know I'm not going to make the racists go away. I know I'll never know what it's like to be black. But I do want to do my part, whatever that is. Can you point me to, maybe a good book to read? Or to someone in particular to learn about? Someone to celebrate and highlight during February? I'm already planning to read about Howard Thurman. My favorite quote since high school has been, Don't ask yourself what the world needs. Ask yourself what makes you come alive and then go do that. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive. I'd love for this post to be full of love, information and maybe some vulnerability. My questions are honest, even if they are a little stupid. But, we have to start somewhere. I hope my heart is clear, in that I truly want to honor Black History Month in the best way possible. I just don't know how, so I'm asking."
45,vulnerability,socialskills,Losing friends in hs,1,ehpkte,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ehpkte/losing_friends_in_hs/,2019-12-31 05:08:28,"Hi idk how reddit works but its the only place I feel safe expressing my feelings. Back in sophomore year of hs I had what I thought was a best friend. She was so fun to be around and we shared so many unforgettable laughs. Slowly, she began distancing herself from me and my friend group (also her friend group) . At lunch, she would put in AirPods and barely talk to us. She soon began making plans with other people in my friend group, leaving me out of the picture. I dont understand why... what did I do? :( . I began coping by distancing myself from that very friend group and drawing (this didnt rlly work) With time, I eventually got over it but it wasnt the same anymore. Anyway, I am a senior now. The beginning of the year, I had an argument with one of my close friends since freshman year(lets name her Joleen). I made a joke about her boyfriend and she took it as an insult. This spiraled into a big argument and I ended up losing 3 friends because they sided with Joleen instead (this sounds silly be I personally believe its because they think shes badder). Note:, the people who sided with her are known to have no morals (they would steal other peoples phones and get others beat up). However, the rest of the friend group sided with me but I was still broken. I was so hurt that I lost 3 friends over a small joke that wasnt even meant to be insulting! Anyways, after this, Although I was surrounded by friends, I felt like I had no one to talk to I felt more alone than ever. I knew that these friends preferred hanging out with Joleen but they stayed with me because they believed that I wasnt at fault and that I was treated unfairly. I tried to tell my friends that I was hurting but they would just say dude just ignore them theyre stupid or something similar. Although they sided with me, they were still friends with Joleen, which I totally understand because they are entitled to who theyre friends with but I just felt so alone. I wanted to tell my friends how I felt but I was afraid they would see it as a sign of weakness. I like having the appearance of being strong because Im afraid others would hurt me if I show any signs of vulnerability. I would avoid hangouts with Joleen and the 2 friends who sided with her and whenever I did, people from my friend group would just jokingly call me a pussy I know they dont mean to hurt me but it just makes it harder for me to express my feelings. Although its been half a school year since this happened, I was still hurting. Recently, (yesterday to be exact) one of my close friends (one that I looked up to and was very thankful for and one that stuck with me through my fight with Joleen) she accused me of copying a sentence from her college essays. She sent me a screen shot of a line from both our essays and she claimed I plagiarized. I admit, it did look very similar and if I were her I would think I plagiarized too. I was shocked that they were so similar but I was confused as to why because I would never EVER do something like that. So I explained to her that the idea she had mustve stuck with me as I was reading her essay and so when I was writing my essays I mustve unknowingly wrote something very similar. After I explained everything she wouldnt believe me and the rest of my friends probably wont believe me either because Ive been in so much shit the last couple months but it really hurts because everyone thinks Im lying when Im telling the truth and eventually I just gave up defending myself, apologized and although her and I remained friends, I dont think itll be the same when winter break is over and school starts again. Other than her, I dont have many friends that I feel close with. Ive been feeling so lonely and isolated lately, that I started skipping a lot of classes. I also began skipping lunch because I wanted to avoid Joleen as much as possible. But after this incident, I feel like Im going to feel more alone than ever and I dont think I will be able to make it for another half a year before we graduate. Although I have a very strong relationship with my mom, I cant tell her anything about this because then it would worry her. She already has enough to worry about especially my health (because I get cold easily and Im overweight and I stress too much about school). For the last two days Ive been sleeping early and sleeping during the day, crying myself to sleep and trying to sleep my pain away. For some reason my mother got really worried and woke me up and asked if I was sleeping during the day because Im feeling sick. I said no and I tried to act tough and tried my best to hold in my tears. Thankfully, she didnt notice that I was sad and I was able to sleep through it. Anyways, its the next morning and I am still devastated over this situation. I am literally crying as I am writing this. I dont know how depression works, but I think Im depressed. Ive become a homebody, I havnt been truly happy since sophomore year, nothing excited me anymore, I overthink all the time, Im always feeling tired, and Im afraid I wont have any friends in college ( because my friend group applied to very similar colleges and Im afraid that if I get into a college that a lot of my friends are also going to, I will feel left out and be lonely again) . I cant ask my mother for help so I began praying but Im also hoping that you guys, the reddit community, could give me some advice on what to do. Ps I apologize in advance if my story doesnt make sense. Im a horrible writer. But the reason I started distancing myself from my friends sophomore and junior year is because I decided to focus on school. I got straight As and pretty good test scores but it was all at the cost of furthering myself from some of my friends."

A lot of us used to do that as children, but a child's perspective of ""friendship"" is diffrent from an adult's one. Isn't it? And what would be the outcome of that? If the person thought of you as a friend before, it would show your insecurity, which is what you might not want (yeah vulnerability is good but more is less), or it could clear up miscommunication (that's great). On the other hand, if the person did not think of you as a friend, or you said that too early, it would put them in an awkward position, they could feel forced and they could misunderstand and expect from you more than you want to provide..

My whole life I have felt not good enough... for anyone. I felt like a burden on humanity. I feel like every time I make myself vulnerable, I am told it's not good enough. &amp;#x200B; Last year, after moving to a new state and city, I went into an incredible depression due to feeling very, very lonely and very unwanted. So, I got into therapy, got on medications, and have been taking active steps to change my outlook on life. I've been feeling very confident, very whole, and very in love with people again. I've finally felt good enough to start pursuing friendships and dates. My coworkers tell me I'm very likeable, I'm a hard worker, I'm positive, my clients love me and express graditude for having known me... this unsolicited feedback has made me feel that my work is worth it. I am good enough, I am presenting my best face to the world, embracing it with love and vulnerability, and feeling more fulfilled. But when it comes to friends and dates... I just don't know. I'm still being rejected. Most recently I pursued a casual relationship with a girl I met on a swipe app. We talked for hours on our date, went back to her place, and I was having a really difficult time reading what she wanted so I didn't make a move. But, she did, at the end of the night. She asked if she could kiss me, I gave a resounding 'yes', and we made out. It was great, but it was late, so I asked for a raincheck. Over the next week we texted and flirted and I asked her to come out with me to an event on the weekend. She agreed. We went, had a BLAST, danced, got wasted, and hung out with a group of people we came across. We both had our periods so all that was off the table. As I was leaving I realized I left something at her place and I heard her say to another person, ""well, you'll just have to come back..."". I left the night feeling great, but ever since... it's been radio silence. I tried to think well she's pretty awkward/shy, so maybe she needs space... and then I thought well maybe she's shy and needs me to take the lead, so let me text her... and radio silence. It's ben a deafening two days. I feel stupid that I care that much, but I thought we had a connection. I thought I was reading her right... but now I'm left feeling rejected and wondering why I wasn't enough. I had communicated that I was looking for a friends with benefits situation, as was she... and when we kissed I felt things I haven't felt in years. Can those sorts of sparks be one sided? I mean, I guess they can be. I'm in my 30s and I sound like a damn teenager obsessing over a crush. My point of this post is that I feel like I just can't manage to get things right with other people in my personal life. And every time I get rejected, it feels nearly UNBEARABLE. I consider myself an HSP, for sure, and so my highs are high... but fuck are my lows low. I know socializing/dating are a numbers game, it's weird and confusing, I just have to find the 'right' people... but rejection feels intolerable for me. It makes me want to stop trying because I don't know if the temporary highs are worth the feelings that come over me when they fade away from me. Ending a relationship is, 99% of the time, the other person's choice. If it were up to me, I'd have a life FILLED with love and connection. I feel like I love others way more than they love me. I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't try anymore because it's too painful. &amp;#x200B; Thanks for listening."

I thought this would be a good place to get some feedback. I'm an overall extroverted person who actually has pretty good (even great) social skills. I get compliments on my personality often; however, I have a huge amount of trouble opening up to people when I actually get close to someone. For example, whenever I make a new friend, I handle the first part well: getting know them on a basic level and just generally having fun together. When things start to get ""more serious"" though (lol), I begin to have a very rough time. There are certain emotional insecurities I have that seem to be relevant to conversation often, and I get tempted to try to change the subject or just lie to make things go smoother. If I just tell the truth and the person reacts in any way other than total non-judgment or agreement, I can get really hurt. Obviously, it causes me a lot of discomfort to have to struggle with this all the time, and it can actually be quite isolating when I'm able to go to parties or events and have fun, but as a result of my lack of vulnerability find my close friend circle lacking. I guess I'm just looking for input on this. If someone's been there and improved, it would be wonderful to hear the story. I'd like to hear other people's stories too if they want to post them. Even if yours isn't exactly like mine, I think that hearing other viewpoints would be helpful. Thank you"

60,vulnerability,socialskills,Interpreting social situations correctly?,2,cs1y2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/cs1y2e/interpreting_social_situations_correctly/,2019-08-19 00:36:19,"So, I have been asking ""why people reject/ignore me all the time"" in certain places, nobody wanted to give me a direct answer through years. Now, there has been some hint dropping, about me being too serious and proper, therefore boring. Another person also hinted that I'm a bit like ""wet blanket"". Now, I've been through a lot of bullying in my younghood and I've had to rebuild self-confidence many times through my life. Now I'm just going through tons of confusion. In most social settings I can relate to ""failing to join the fun"" type of description. Ultimately *I want to have fun responsibly*. Usually because I don't want to accidently end up becoming an insensitive (or accidently toxic) jerk by making fun at someone elses expense which is very common in social settings.. I can make jokes at my own expense tho. I'm usually concerned what if I accidently enable a covert bully to degrade someone or unintentionally make someone feel uncomfortable. I try avoiding people-pleasing habits, but still, I think it's still necessary to be polite and considerate of others (within boundaries) instead of being too selfish. I also have difficulty to ""catch"" whether something is a fun conversation about serious issue or whether it's a serious conversation about a serious issue. And this is where being too serious and proper comes in. Being a ""wet blanket"" comes in when targeted by jokes at my expense - which I can take from people I know well and trust they mean no harm... but not from strangers. It still makes me question whether someone is directing a questionable/toxic jab towards me or looking for vulnerability -&gt; I assert boundaries, or whether it's honestly just an innocent joke which I should bounce back with wit. Sometimes me finally ""joining the fun"" has also hurt someone and people have told me my jokes ""sting"", and they've tried to get revenge on me for that for years... and it's hard to interpret as fun from their side. It's also difficult to tell whether someone is just humorously faking the hurt, manipulating the situation through being hurt or honestly hurt. It's possible that in those situations where things can't be discussed respectfully and seriously, people may as well be toxic, but it keeps troubling me to not find clarity. I *don't want to repeat some old mistakes* I may not be realising I'm doing. I want to be able to interact with other people better. &amp;#x200B; This whole issue of course is even more troublesome online, where I usually find more people with whom there's something to talk about, than IRL. You can't interpret stuff from the other people's tone or body language, most of it comes down to how they use words and if their claims are realistic. Any pointers aside from ""let past be past"" on how to interpret social situations better? And how to tell difference between when it's okay to treat those situations (and people) through humor and when it's okay to be more serious even if some people didn't approve?"
61,vulnerability,socialskills,How to balance a desire for intimacy/friendship while also feeling too vulnerable to move closer to anyone,3,ct2ipl,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ct2ipl/how_to_balance_a_desire_for_intimacyfriendship/,2019-08-21 03:19:56,"Im a 26M going through a divorce right now. It has literally sent my life into a spiral and caused me to lose a lot of relationships I held dear. Long story short, Ive had to move away from my old support group of friends so I could try to be closer to my child that my STBXW has tried to keep me from. I get very little time with my daughter while we go through the court process and it has left me in a new area alone and difficult in finding friends for support. My struggle is the trust and vulnerability I have with others. The rejection of my wife, her family, and others has caused me to drift into cynicism about relationships. Ive been seeing a therapist about this and he wants me to just grieve for right now (which trust me, I am). But before all of this, I used to love people and always thought the best and easily forgave. Now, Ive been so badly hurt that I dont even WANT to give a shit about anyone else. Yet at the same time, I deeply crave just some form of intimacy and friendship that has been left void through all of this. Im apprehensive to even throw myself into dating because my divorce is not finalized and because I have had several people caution not to jump into any type of relationship until I have healed. So how do I fill this void? And balance the desire for intimacy while still trying to heal and remaining closed off to protect myself?"

I have been pretty fearful of social situations and perceptions of me for as long as I can remember. I would build up this ""confident"" mindset and tell myself I'm this and that and can handle whatever, but as soon as I'm out in the real world talking to people, I eff up pretty bad and yet again become an awkward person, and hate myself for it. The other day I realized that it might be because I hardly share who I am with the world. Let me explain. In my mind, I had all these different types of ""personas"" that I take on when I'm with certain people or situations. With this person I have to be this way, and in this situation I have to be that way, etc. My whole life I've had this mentality. I would see a person or character or trait that I liked, and added it to my ""reservoir"" of people I wanted to be. If I was afraid, for instance, I would pretend to be like a certain fearless or badass character I admired in a movie. I never saw a problem with this, and never really thought much about it. Turns out, it didn't do me much good. I could never hold on to that persona long enough in a conversation or situation without it turning weird or disconnected. And keeping track of all these different personality types confuses and distorts your own perception of you. I've been obsessed for so long trying to figure out what kind of ""personality"" type (like MBTI) I truly am deep down, and try to connect to it, and take on that one personality type completely and be that entirely, but even then I fail. And then the other day I had an epiphany. You know why I never knew who I truly was? Because I never let myself be myself. Ever. I was always too worried about my image and what people thought of me to let myself go and be myself and just do and say what felt natural, what felt right. And when I finally realized this, and decided to throw away all personas, and break down my walls, and just be myself, no matter how awkward or stupid or confusing I sounded to other people, to just own it entirely, I literally felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. No effin lie. The following days I was shocked at my behavior and how I looked at myself. I hate to say it was a simple switch, because I struggled with it for so long, but honestly, after realizing it, writing it all down and making that new commitment to myself, it was like an instant flip. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that I am no longer awkward or foolish, and instantly popular, not at all, but I have definitely noticed how much better I am when I'm being myself and owning it no matter how I act or look like. And I think I am slowly starting to figure out who I am, and being okay with it, even if its not like my favorite characters or personas. Im me, and *Im okay with it*. I can improve who I am, work on things I don't like, but I don't need to change, or hate myself for things that make me, me, if that makes sense. The other day I even uploaded my first video on youtube and that was insane, I was so fearful of that for so long, and freaked about finally showing my self and emotions to the world, but after sharing it with everyone and being okay with who I was, it felt so freeing. And weirdly, now I feel truly confident. I'm not afraid of what they think of me. I'm not afraid of my negatives, or my awkwardness. I am owning it fully and completely. I never would have thought that something as scary as vulnerability would make me feel strength and confidence. But opening up myself to the world unapologetically and bearing all, and not making excuses for it or diminishing myself has made me resilient, to say the least. Anyways, thought it was important to share and get out there, maybe someone else can apply this to their life and it could help somehow. Or maybe I'm the only psychotic one with different personas and I've just exposed myself to the world, but then again, Im riding a new wave and don't really care anymore. :)"

The other day I realized that it might be because I hardly share who I am with the world. Let me explain. In my mind, I had all these different types of ""personas"" that I take on when I'm with certain people or situations. With this person I have to be this way, and in this situation I have to be that way, etc. My whole life I've had this mentality. I would see a person or character or trait that I liked, and added it to my ""reservoir"" of people I wanted to be. If I was afraid, for instance, I would pretend to be like a certain fearless or badass character I admired in a movie. I never saw a problem with this, and never really thought much about it. Turns out, it didn't do me much good. I could never hold on to that persona long enough in a conversation or situation without it turning weird or disconnected. And keeping track of all these different personality types confuses and distorts your own perception of you. I've been obsessed for so long trying to figure out what kind of ""personality"" type (like MBTI) I truly am deep down, and try to connect to it, and take on that one personality type completely and be that entirely, but even then I fail. And then the other day I had an epiphany. You know why I never knew who I truly was? Because I never let myself be myself. Ever. I was always too worried about my image and what people thought of me to let myself go and be myself and just do and say what felt natural, what felt right. And when I finally realized this, and decided to throw away all personas, and break down my walls, and just be myself, no matter how awkward or stupid or confusing I sounded to other people, to just own it entirely, I literally felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders. No effin lie. The following days I was shocked at my behavior and how I looked at myself. I hate to say it was a simple switch, because I struggled with it for so long, but honestly, after realizing it, writing it all down and making that new commitment to myself, it was like an instant flip. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that I am no longer awkward or foolish, and instantly popular, not at all, but I have definitely noticed how much better I am when I'm being myself and owning it no matter how I act or look like. And I think I am slowly starting to figure out who I am, and being okay with it, even if its not like my favorite characters or personas. Im me, and *Im okay with it*. I can improve who I am, work on things I don't like, but I don't need to change, or hate myself for things that make me, me, if that makes sense. The other day I even uploaded my first video on youtube and that was insane, I was so fearful of that for so long, and freaked about finally showing my self and emotions to the world, but after sharing it with everyone and being okay with who I was, it felt so freeing. And weirdly, now I feel truly confident. I'm not afraid of what they think of me. I'm not afraid of my negatives, or my awkwardness. I am owning it fully and completely. I never would have thought that something as scary as vulnerability would make me feel strength and confidence. But opening up myself to the world unapologetically and bearing all, and not making excuses for it or diminishing myself has made me resilient, to say the least. Anyways, thought it was important to share and get out there, maybe someone else can apply this to their life and it could help somehow. Or maybe I'm the only psychotic one with different personas and I've just exposed myself to the world, but then again, Im riding a new wave and don't really care anymore. :)"
66,vulnerability,socialskills,Should I stop myself from developing a crush? Im so confused. Help needed.,2,chixnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/chixnf/should_i_stop_myself_from_developing_a_crush_im/,2019-07-25 14:27:05,"Okay. So basically I prevent myself from having crushes. My last crush that I developed was when I was 13 (Im 17 now). Since then, whenever Ive seen a possible interest (I.e. I notice it is logical for me to like someone, I feel like some feelings could begin) I shut it off. I tell myself no and reject the possibility of feelings. I dont allow myself to have a crush. I dont let myself entertain the thought of developing romantic feelings for someone. My friend thinks its a blessing, but it feels like a curse to be able to do that. I feel like love, for me, wont work out. I feel like Ill just end up being hurt. It requires vulnerability which is hard for me. Ive had people openly have interest in me, but I just cant imagine dating. It feels like it will just fall apart. I feel embarrassed, like I dont have the right to have that. I kind of dislike myself a whole lot. I hate my physical appearance and personality. I dont view myself as special, so why should I expect someone to treat me as such? Theres also the practicality part of this as well. I come from a fundamentalist Christian family, so very few girls would be approved. I start to think, Whats the point? My mom doesnt think women should work (I disagree, just want to point that out), so now even less options are available. At least if I want to please my mom. Side note: Idk my views on so many topics (besides abortion, Im pro-life 100%) are confused and uncertain, as I live in polars of left and right. School and friends make me feel like Im thrown into a movie staring Hillary Clinton, produced by CNN. Home/church feels like Ive been instructed to help build the wall. Also my view of liberal does include girls wearing short shorts and guys walking around without their shirts on (both are considered nudity) so when I say left, that is included, which most rights are fine with. Back to the love thing: Has anyone ever dealt with this? I think about it a lot, and wonder if I will ever let it happen. What if I dont? Then Ill just be alone. My friends think Ill be the first to get married and start a family, because Im just the nice Christian guy who wants a family one day, but I guess thats not how it will work out."
67,vulnerability,socialskills,Lots of free time to dedicate to improving social skills - where should I target my efforts,1,ckz8iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/ckz8iu/lots_of_free_time_to_dedicate_to_improving_social/,2019-08-02 14:20:45,"I have a lot of free time over the next 3 weeks and I want to dedicate a few hours each day to improving my social skills. I don't really feel much anxiety in social situations, I just feel like my mind is empty and I am also very laid back and not particularly high energy. I'm quite playful and happy but not particularly charismatic. I like to communicate with people but i'm just not very good at it and I think in some way I put people off and they can sense some form of vulnerability. I am very bad at holding peoples attention and I often very quickly lose their interest. Speaking for a long period of time is something I need to do in the form of public speaking in a few weeks and I'm also planning to work on those skills alongside improving my social skills in whatever way I can. There is a lot of great advice on this group and I really appreciate the effort and time you guys spend posting here and helping each other, The biggest things I feel I need to work on are the following: * Increase the length of time I can speak coherently about something while still keeping it interesting. * Improving the speed which I can think of things and link topics together. * Build up a sense of authority / be more of a leader in a social situation. * Not being able to stick to a task / follow through with it is one of my biggest downfalls, so keeping this practice going is going to be really difficult. &amp;#x200B; What I plan to do: &amp;#x200B; * Jump out of my comfort zone more. I am currently in a country where I don't speak the language and English isn't spoken well by that many people. I plan to approach people I find more intimidating ( I don't find approaching strangers intimidating ) to put myself on the spot in some way, perhaps by complimenting people directly or something that is more challenging than asking directions or saying hello. This will probably involve google translate 80% of the time as they won't fully understand me. * Record videos for youtube where I talk about different subjects. Hopefully this will help me get more comfortable talking and improve my mannerisms / facial expressions and body language a bit. This does't come naturally to me and I feel / come across somewhat awkward on camera and this is going to be tough to even do. * Learn and memorise 2 jokes each day and practice telling a few stories from my life experience each day so I've got a good understanding of how to present them If i come across a social situation where I might need to. * Spend a little time each day practising improv comedy by myself. Perhaps record myself performing a short stand up comedy sketch * Learn to rap / sing one song. I've never tried this before so it'll be challenging. I like the idea of it though, it's just something challenging that will be uncomfortable. Being in social situations is of course great for improving skills and practising but I don't really have much to talk about, so perhaps I also need to learn to express my own likes even if they contrast with the other groups members and bring out my passions without fear of being judged e.g I'm not a big drinker / don't watch the latest TV, don't know the latest music. Sure, it would be cool to learn a bit about some of the kind of popular topics that might help socially, but I don't feel I need to do that. The more I think about this the less i'm sure exactly what my biggest weaknesses are, I think mostly it's being completely comfortable / sure of myself / knowing who I and coming across like that socially. I had some difficulties growing up, which I'm slowly dealing with elsewhere and this played a part in me losing my sense of identity, but also I have a sense of spirituality and not wanting to particularly build up a big identity / ego. I've spent way too much time Pleasing other people / fitting in rather than fully being my own person and I definitely display these weaknesses and lose authority in any social situation fast. I need to find a way to gain authority / respect socially and to be more charismatic / engage peoples attention / improve storytelling. I hope this post at least makes a little sense. What would you do in this situation?"
68,vulnerability,socialskills,"Tomorrow Im seeing my therapist for our bi-weekly session...and what Ill be talking about, it terrifies me (*COULD BE TRIGGERING*)",4,bz4jkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/bz4jkj/tomorrow_im_seeing_my_therapist_for_our_biweekly/,2019-06-11 08:50:50,"Out of fear, I have never told anyone but two people whom I trust with my life that my ex-boyfriend sexually assaulted me. Two years later, Im still terrified that I will not be taken seriously...or that Id have to come face to face with the asshole again if legal actions are taken, for the reason that Im disabled...but Im tired of staying silent. At least in the protected walls of my therapists office. Right? Ive been seeing my therapist since the winter of 2018; actually went to this dude the month after I left my ex. Hes a great therapist and a kind fellow. Very informative and insightful. So I know I can trust him! But this...this topic. I never believed that Id be haunted by such a horrible experience.... From 2016 to late 2017, I dated this guy who, at the time in my naive perspective, was my first everything. Boyfriend, kiss, date, and, unfortunately, sexual experience (but in, for the first 6-7ish months, a loving manner...until things turned ugly). At 21, I had never been with any guy until my ex. Meaning, I was naive and easily blindsided by his unfamiliar but desired attention and affection for me. Little did I know that he had a narcissistic personality, thus it was programmed in his brain that, with the knowledge of my vulnerability, he could control me in every aspect. For the first 7 months out of the 12.5 that we were together, it wasnt perfect but it wasnt a nightmare either. Or so I thought... He and I had a lot in common so we did things we both liked to do: mini golf, movies, arcades, video game nights at his place. We fell for one another hard. Or at least in my 21-year-old POV. Sadly, as I look back now, two years after the breakup, I realized - although I did love those activities we did together - how little I had a say in what we did. Hed become so bitter and childish if we did something I wanted to do. Like, hed give me the silent treatment; refuse to sit next to me, hold me, etc. I ofc saw it as being a boy and ignored it. Until mid-August 2017 when I became ill while on a date. Burning fever, the works. My ex panicked and drove me home. It was as if he thought I was going to die; sometimes, when I think back to that night, I feel the car speeding up beneath me. Turned out to be a viral infection. I had to recover at the home for a week and, during that time, my ex called or texted me repeatedly. Asking if I was okay and even when I could go out again... I told him fine but that I was not well enough to go out of the house for a while (my immune system is very weak; I get sick so easily)...He whined and told me to buck up; my voice sounded healthy so why was I making excuses? Mind you, I didnt have enough common sense to understand what he was doing was manipulative. I was so under his spell that I thought him contacting me so much meant he loved and cared about me. Wrong. When I got back on my feet and we went out again, my ex began to show me his true colors in ways that I wish I could forget... He became so overly protective of me, not letting me use my phone while on a date or grabbing my body in a tight grasp and holding it close to his side if we walked by a group of people who to him appeared to be harmful. He then turned horribly defensive and angry whenever Id try to talk with him about something that was bothering me. In public hed humiliate me on purpose and then laugh, say it was a joke and to not be so sensitive. Then the emotional abuse and shaming of my looks, goals, lifestyle started. Lies. Gaslighting. Then, one night...and this is the night that used to come and go in a blur because of the trauma, but the more Ive thought about it... more... dark, fearful details become visible. (Even as I type this, Im shaking...whenever words try to be said, my anxiety chokes them back... ) I was sitting on his mums couch, watching TV with her. My ex was somewhere in the back doing something. Suddenly, he calls out down the hallway and asks me to go into his room. I wish I hadnt moved. But I did. I stood in the middle of his bedroom floor, waiting (wearing jeans and a t-shirt, btw) My ex comes in and has this...grin on his face. Like a sensual yet, mischievous... Why do you want me in here? You told me to go in the living room. (thats what he did toward the end of our relationship, told me to not go into his room without him there, that I had no say unless he told me so, etc) I wanted to see you. Thought we could have alone time. Isnt that enough? I sighed and said, Sure, I suppose. He then leaned in to kiss me. I pushed him back; I was upset at this point by how he treated me, but I didnt understand what I do now to put two and two together and actually leave... I tried to pull away because he became suddenly aggressive, which was abnormal for him as of late. When Id be be affectionate, hed force me off and call me needy or hed respond for a quick second and then tell me to take it easy...when I wasnt intense at all. He ignored me, saying that this was overdue and picked me up, put me on his bed. I struggled a bit to get off: Not now I said, and how this was not appropriate, that we were upset at one another still. But he chuckled and said that I did want this and that make up sex was fun...I refused again but he grabbed at my shirt and tried to pull it up over my head...He began to try foreplay, slapping my ass and kissing my neck...which he knew was my soft spot. I told him to stop but he took it as me enjoying it...Mind you, he was a 50 pounds heavier than I was (I was 86 at the time; very lightweight IK...). Within seconds he pinned my arms over my head when I went to put them on his shoulders to push him off. This wasnt what I wanted... I couldnt breathe; I am convinced to this day, I almost had a panic attack.... I felt his fingers on my legs and this horrible shiver come along my spine, but it wasnt like past sensations that I had when wed been intimate. Suddenly in the mess of kicks and demands of to get off, idk how but my panties were off...and I said his name but before I could say anything else, he took it as a cue and put himself in me... I gasped in pain but he thought, again, otherwise... This went on for a few seconds. I struggled. A bunch of nos escaped my lips; I pushed his hands off of my wrists somehow and with my knee, idk how I didnt develop bruises... I shoved him hard with my knee where it hurt him most. He instantly got off of me, choking at the shock of pain.... I scrambled off the bed crying, and ran to the bathroom, clothes in my arms. Locked the door, shaking, and I called a friend who lived nearby to come pick me up. Made an excuse my ex wasnt feeling well and didnt want my parents involved...theyd only make it worse... I regret how long I let myself stay after that, but psychologically, I was not in the right mindset with him. He had taken capture of my emotions and my love for him so I would be afraid to leave. Guilt trip or force me to feel lonely by leaving me alone in a room for hours, or saying in this psychopathic tone of voice that without him Id be nothing. Fear was implanted in me until I had enough and broke the chains. Two years later, I know he did a horrible thing. In his sick mind he was giving me what he knew I usually wanted from him. But because of how my parents are in terms of telling me Im being dramatic about anything and everything, I have kept silent. The fear of seeing him again in a courtroom, it always pushes down that memory and has me smile to cover up the pain. But now, I need to say something or literally, Ill explode from all this anxiety in me."
69,vulnerability,socialskills,Showing Vulnerability: Is it an Attractive Trait?,4,c0jxl6,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/c0jxl6/showing_vulnerability_is_it_an_attractive_trait/,2019-06-14 23:11:57,"One topic that I often see a lot of confusion about is that relating to vulnerability, and if it an attractive trait. The truth is it really comes down the context in which it is shown. Vulnerability is not being weak or soft, but rather being strong enough to deal with the consequences of exposing your true self, thoughts or feelings. However, showing vulnerability in a positive sense is NOT vomiting emotions and/or seeking sympathy from a person. Its not showing up on someones doorstep and crying for them to take you back. Its not acting like someone or something means everything to you and you will die without the person or thing in your life. Actively seeking pity or pleading in anyway is not attractive. Acting this way is the equivalent of trying to take a person emotionally hostage. Sure people want to know that really care about them, but unless a person is manipulative and desires to feel that they have direct power over you, that person does not want to feel that they are directly responsible for your emotional state. And they dont want you to force onto them this responsibility. They dont want to feel that it is their duty that you remain happy and its their fault if you become emotionally distraught. If a person feels that you are impinging on their freedom of expression, instead of speaking freely, they may now actively sensor themselves in an attempt to preserve your feelings. Especially in fun social situations, this is the last thing that a person wants to feel. A person would much more prefer to detect that they are with someone whose emotions are independent of their approval, so that they feel less pressure and feel that they can freely express themselves. If you go up to a person, and that person senses that you really want them to like you, and that your emotions directly depend on how they react to you, they will likely become uncomfortable, and not desire to stay in the interaction. They dont want to feel that you have taken them hostage and any misstep they make may set you off. If you are actively seeking their approval and qualifying yourself, they are also much less likely to view you as an equal. The key is to potentially show some vulnerability in being willing to initiate an interaction, while simultaneously not being dependent on the outcome of that interaction. You can display vulnerability by honestly showing interest in a person as long as you simultaneously show that your emotions and self-esteem are not directly connected to getting to the other persons approval. Revealing how one is vulnerable opens a person up to harm. As long as you are not searching for sympathy, then vulnerability shows that you are a person that is either trusting of others or is ultra-confident in their ability to withstand an attack. Extending trust is a manifestation of personal courage. You show that are willing to deal with any ramifications that may occur from allowing another person to harm you as a result of you opening yourself up. These are the situations which can make vulnerability appear as an attractive trait. Source Youtube Video: URL"
70,vulnerability,socialskills,Insight: Don't be afraid to be vulnerable,11,c23ci8,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/c23ci8/insight_dont_be_afraid_to_be_vulnerable/,2019-06-19 01:05:47,"All of us have secrets and pain. Sometimes we are so worried that others won't care or won't understand about that pain or those shameful secrets that we keep them permenantly hidden. The problem with that, however, is that forming connections requires vulnerability. The less you trust others with what bothers you or makes you happy, the less you are allowing yourself to be comfortable around them. Think of it like letting someone in your house. Ideally, you would be letting in people who you trust and *want* to be there. It's not like you open up your home to the pizza guy whenever they comes come by to deliver your food. You almost certainly don't hesitate at all with the people who are important to your life, however. Point being, the less you trust the person the more you will restrict access to your house (i.e. ""Dont go into any of the bedrooms"", ""you can use this bathroom"", ""feel free to use this glass if you need a drink"", and etc.) And the less you want someone there, the faster you will want them gone (i.e. You aren't trying to get the pizza delivery guy to stay overnight but you are perfectly fine with loved ones staying by much longer, especially if you are really close to them). The conflict with connecting with someone is that, in order to get closer to them, you have to let them into your (metaphorical) house. In practical terms this means opening up about your beliefs and emotions. For very special people, this means telling them about very deep issues, like what you feel ashamed over or a deep personal hurt you suffer. The more you hide these issues the less you will be able to bond with others."

Probably due to fear of rejection I only now noticed. But now that I now that people do need socializing to an extend I realized I am very needy and entitled. I don't show it tho, I just feel it. Like for instance, a person asks for a favor and doesn't say that no you, I feel like they owe me a thank you. I know i didn't have to pay any favors, I wanted to, but the truth is they are conditional favors. Or when I send a message and the person doesn't reply I think they owe me an reply and get pissed. I want to learn to be less like that. I don't feel like that because I want to yet I do. I want to gain more autonomy and be less fearful of rejection and people. I want to create deep relationships with people without feeling entitled to anything. I have this need for attention, acceptance, approval, compliments, inclusion, so I tend to kiss ass and get mad when I'm not valued. I hate being ignored and excluded. And because I feel that way I avoid intimacy, vulnerability and openness. I never feel like I belong. I only do things when I know they are safe, especially when it comes to people. I want to feel ntegrate and feel whole on my own and not let my mood depend on people, like it does when I get ignored, I get in a depressed mood."

I wanted to reach out to see if anyone had any solutions or similar experience with a problem I have been experiencing. When I meet new people, particularly people I am invested in creating a relationship with, I experience this crushing pressure to put on a performance and ensure that they have a good time talking to me. I feel like I need to entertain, and that otherwise Ill be judged as boring, nervous, shy, etc. The most maddening part of this issue is that once the anxiety about entertaining arrives, I can no longer sustain a normal conversation. Im so preoccupied with what Im going to say that I cant come up with anything. Its really frustrating. This is not always the case with me. It seems to intensify during high-stress/ high-vulnerability periods of my life. I have several established friends that I am able to completely be myself around, but I was only able to build these relationships because I was so focused on other things during that time in my life (schoolwork) that I didnt really care that much if I made friends or not. As such, the friendships that formed were natural and easy. I wish I could cultivate more relationships like this, but at this point in my life my anxiety around making new friends does not allow for it. I dont think Im a boring person. Im inquisitive, playful, and kind when Im able to let my guard down. However, recently I have not been able to break past this wall. I feel like Im constantly auditioning for something (and failing). I keep desperately waiting to reach some sort of breaking point where this behavior is no longer sustainable (movie moment where I finally realize I cant do this anymore and I finally learn to not give a f*ck and just get on with my life peacefully, haha), but it seems that my ability to keep doing this is somehow inexhaustible. Im currently working really hard with my therapist to reduce anxiety and stay in the moment, to cultivate self-compassion and stop the judgement-based dialogue that runs on loop in my head. However, my mind keeps introducing more logic to justify why I need to keep X or Y person interested in what I have to say, etc. TLDR, being so insecure is ruining my ability to enjoy other people, is there any way that you guys have learned to control these thoughts?"

My path isn't over but I hoped that my experience/s may help someone else along the way. If this isn't right for the sub, I do apologize. I will remove it if required. &amp;nbsp; ----- &amp;nbsp; I was always the generally quiet kid when I was younger but I tried to work on social skills. It started with public speaking but tired me relentlessly and worried me so much that I would be shaking afterwards. Eitherway, I struggled but kept trying to put myself out there. &amp;nbsp; The fear of rejection is a great thing. It's like a drop at a ledge where you're not sure if you'd make it if you jumped but you see so many others jump and make it out fine. *How come I can't do that?* *Maybe I'm just not as good looking* or *They're just socially more adept than I am...* &amp;nbsp; All of what I'm saying up there is what we all faced one way or another. Meeting new friends, co-workers and creating new relationships. Personally, I think relationships are the most difficult one because you make yourself vulnerable. That vulnerability is what makes it so unique, so special and why we wake up with a smile across our face but I digress for now. &amp;nbsp; ----- &amp;nbsp; You can skip this part and go straight below if you don't want to know about my personal journey of where I am now and how I got here. &amp;nbsp; ------ &amp;nbsp; My friends called me the most social person they know because we all met one way or another with me striking a conversation with them, a random stranger, but looking back, it was a once every few months occurrence that only happened in the presence of alcohol and I was lonely. Liquid courage does wonders but I didn't want to rely on it for every encounter so... &amp;nbsp; Just about a little under a year ago, I started to randomly chatting strangers up. Be it local or abroad, if I was at an open area where strangers are closely packed together, I would strike a conversation with literally anybody and try to see where it would take me. Sometimes, I found people with vast, intricate lives with so much history and detail that it was amazing I was speaking to them. I was in awe and I was reveling in the stories of their lives and our shared interests. &amp;nbsp; The thing was, I had also broken up with my girlfriend just before this began. She cheated on me. My partner of nearly 5 years had lied to me over the last 3 years of our relationship and that devastated me. I was sad, angry, then dull. I never wanted to date anybody anymore and to summarize, I was bitter. &amp;nbsp; But, over time, I found myself longing. I wasn't angry, I wasn't dull. Sure, the single life was great with me travelling more than ever, going to new places and meeting new people but chance encounters only did so much. You can change information, see each other every few months for a round of drinks and a small percentage becomes closer friends but I was sad. This wouldn't be the case for everyone but I lived most, if not all of my young adult life in long term, committed relationships. I never needed to really make new friends because I was happy with who I was with, my then, loves of my life. &amp;nbsp; One day, I went on a business trip. One of my first ever in a new career that I was excited to expand. It was a rushed thing with only a day and a half in a country I've never been to before *^^Shoutout ^^to ^^Malaysia, ^^your ^^food ^^is ^^amazing* with a coworker. &amp;nbsp; I went to the food districts and had wonderful conversations with people from Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, you name it, someone from a far place was there. All I had to do was say hello! But, like I mentioned, they were short lived. We were all people from far away places experiencing a new time in our lives and a culture different to us. Our contact after was only limited to occasionally liking each other's photos on Instragram. &amp;nbsp; Eitherway, it was time to go home and I was moderately content with my short time there. Thoughts still lingered in me though, I longed for deeper connections. I yearned for something more, friendship perhaps? I wasn't sure. &amp;nbsp; As my coworker and I were checking in, we found out that we were seated separately even when our tickets were purchased together. Bummer. Eitherway, not exactly a problem but I found myself at the rear-most end of the airplane. *oh god no*, *no reclining seats?* *The bathroom is right beside??* *N^o^^o^^^o^^^^o^^^^^o^^^^^^o* On the bright side, because it was the rear-most end of the airplane, the aisle side was only 2 seats instead of 3 to my delight and there was no rear wall! I could fully recline my seat in heaven. I was happy. &amp;nbsp; While walking to my seat, I saw that the seat next to me by the window was already filled. As I got closer, I saw that it was a girl and she was beautiful and obviously I was stunned. I realized I was holding up the corridor so I proceeded to clumsily put my bag in the overhead compartment and sort of sheepishly said hello and she said hi. &amp;nbsp; She was asleep before I even buckled in and I couldn't help but try to steal glimpses of her. You know those stares that we do to people who are just absolutely out of our league and it feels that our stares are so obvious and creepy that we suddenly become super self-conscious? Yep, that was me. &amp;nbsp; Eventually, the plane started to taxi and she started to bang against the wall with every vibration of the plane. I was actually worried that she'd eventually turn her head my way and she'd be bleeding like someone just hit her with a crowbar but before that worry got any bigger, I fell asleep too. &amp;nbsp; It was an 8 hour flight, pretty long and arduous plus it was a red-eye flight. We all needed sleep. I abruptly woke up about 3 hours later and found her sleeping very comfortably on my shoulder. To this, I was both happy and frozen scared. *What if she screams? What if this turns really bad and I end up looking like a creep?* But thankfully, she woke up sort of dazed and looked at me, apologizing. &amp;nbsp; You know those immigration sign out forms that they give you? The stewardess gave me 2 of them, maybe mistaking us for a couple. I noticed this about 5 minutes after I woke up and by that time, she was already awake too. Thinking hard for a good few minutes on how I could use this as a conversation starter, I remembered a saying I heard in the military. &gt;**""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.""** Then I went, ah screw it. Whats the worst that could happen? &amp;nbsp; We had a lively, bustling conversation where we both laughed a lot and being awkward every once in a while and this went on for the next 4 hours or so until we landed. I helped her get her bags and I helped her get a cab to her place but before that all finished, I asked her, **would you wanna have lunch or dinner sometime with me?** She said yes and gave me her number. &amp;nbsp; This was 3 months ago. She's now my loving, beautiful girlfriend who's wonderful beyond compare and I can't be any happier. She was actually upset why it took me nearly 3 months to ask her to be my girlfriend. I apparently waited to long and I was too insecure that she was out of my league. &amp;nbsp; ------ &amp;nbsp; You can continue here if you skipped that giant wall of text. &amp;nbsp; ------ &amp;nbsp; The things I want to get to at are things we've all heard before. Things that I think we all know but are too afraid to act on and something that I would like others to not make the same tumbles as I have before getting to the peak. &amp;nbsp; Meeting new people is just an arm's reach away. We're all afraid that we'll be turned down, rejected but remember, we're all unique, self-encapsulated life-times of stories culminated into a single person. Sometimes, they'll be dis-trusting, sometimes they'll be busy but most of the time, they're happy that someone would talk to them too because we all go through turmoils or happiness in our lives and sometimes, just someone asking how their day is going is that big of a difference. &amp;nbsp; It's easy to trick ourselves into thinking that ""being attractive"" or ""being socially adept"" is what determines whether someone may like talking to us. In so many ways, it's one of the easiest possible explanations because it demands so little of us and immediately explains our shortcomings socially. We recognize our fear, which in turn, turns into lack of motivation to try and put ourselves out there, as one of many large factors why we lack friends or we can't seem to get into a relationship. I know, it's scary to acknowledge these things but it's empowering because it means there's something we can do about it. &amp;nbsp; Every step we take, every action we make, is a new pathway to connections we never thought we could make. It's so easy to let our instinct take over and shield ourselves from the potential of rejection but we forget the light at the other side of the curtain. &amp;nbsp; We don't have to be someone new with a fancy watch or a great car but just ourselves. Listen to what people have to say and speak when you feel like it. It doesn't have to be forced, it doesn't have to be about something great or something political. What I find myself liking to do before striking a conversation is I like to count to ten. I find that the closer the number 10 comes, the more nervous I get and the more it feels like I'll explode but right before the counter hits 10, I let go and say something. &amp;nbsp; Next time when you're out, stay a while and take a listen. Revel in our bustling world and strike a conversation. Sometimes, all it takes is just a hello. &amp;nbsp; ------ &amp;nbsp; TL;DR: Felt like I was going to explode and regret not talking to the beautiful girl next to me on the plane and asked her out. We're dating now and she got angry why I didn't ask her out sooner."

People with flags and banners yelling in the street or the kid with blackend hair and thick eyeliner beneath his eyes. People identify with all sorts of things. Its a belief, the same mentality, but very different ideas. Afterall an idea can be anything from matiral need and money, to selfrealization and faith. Yet *as long as you believe it to be something true*, it can be *anything*. Even your bad social skills or anxiety. You affirm it, because it shows everytime you try and talk. You convince yourself and it becomes a self-fulling reality. Your truth. Bad or good, its you. You can change it when you see it. But you have to ask yourself if you actually want to. Whats good for you, the right affirmation? Is talking with a friend or group of friends and agreeing on everything mutually making you proud of yourself? Is that really good? Should you not blame yourself for your past mistakes anymore? Is that so bad? These and many other choises like them, introspective reflections, make up our truth, our egos, who we are and eventually will become. Whichever you believe you manifest in your life. This is my affirmation of my own idea of how to affirm myself. Im not here to convince anyone or point fingers. Im doing this for me. Im convinced Im a shithead, yet it pushes me to be greater. Im definitely not there yet, and thats exciting. Bipolar but balanced from the fact now that I know, it willcome and go. Affirmed and reassured Im going somewhere, still unsure where. So what, I needed this loathing because Im sometimes feeling fragile. The world is lonely and my mind is too weird for all of it. Compassionate overflow drowns me. But I am through being reliant and subservant. My emotional vulnerability turned to fuel. Lots of ideas floating just beyond my reach while Im too busy watching myself. Now its time for me to get up and grab them, assert myself and feed my need for the kind of affirmation nobody else can give me. Share that then with the world once I trust I am capable to. Encourage more ideas like this as an act of independence. I am found to be lost and its not easy searching this deep, but eventually I stumble upon a clue. It hurts to keep trying but I know it would destroy me if I didnt. Doing nothing is not even a choise by definition. I choose to make this post to liberate myself. Its my way of living."

And super confident about it. It didn't matter if it was some new idea I had come up with or some random stuff I was interested in. I talked about it to no end, with everybody. Some times that made me the leader, other times it made me get bullied. I didn't really understand any of that, I liked something, so why wouldnt everyone else? After many bad experiences, though, I stopped. It is crushing to time after time be open and passionate just to be dismissed or laughed at. But I didn't just stop. I forgot how to. What music do I like? Uhh... All kinds of stuff? At least I am over the phase of pretending to not like music at all because dismissing things, even in stupid ways, is more comfortable than showing any kind of vulnerability. And that is about small consequences, I mean, just imagine someone thinking your favourite song sucks. Absolutely horrible, right? Now imagine trying to show someone that you care for them. That is not even a thing, I wish it was. I just realized that this is probably where all my relationships stop, why I know many people but have very few friends. And also why my social interactions suck. If there is one thing I can think of that all people who feel warm and fun to be with have in common, it is how open they are. They don't reduce knowing something to trivia they ""overheard somewhere"", they admit to reading the whole book it is from because they enjoyed it. They are not ""hey..."" . And their friends are not ""some people they know"". I don't mean that everyone should be overly enthusiastic about everything, or that being completely open in every situation is a good idea. But that confidence and openness is essential for good social interactions and relationships. What is a friendship between two people who don't know each other, or a conversation between two people who are pretending? So that's what I think, but what now? How do I overcome this and not act like an empty shell of a person?"

They've made me feel like I was boring and there wasn't anything special or that I wasn't important. They've made me feel worthless. It dramatically decreased my confidence and because my confidence faded my social skills took a turn for the worst. I felt like whenever I spoke to someone I appeared boring. I felt like I was just one of those people who could never hold a conversation or could never get the guy because I wasn't outgoing enough. I felt like the reason all my conversations by text were dry was because of me but looking back it wasn't. They just never tried to get to me. They expected me to spill my secrets and show vulnerability the minute I spoke. Those people hurt me immensely. I continuously played it off in my head as if it were no big deal... In acctuality, it changed me. 1 played me. 1 hurt me. 1 crushed me. But I'm finally healing. For once in my life, I feel like there's nothing wrong me. Even as I write this post I feel a weight lifted off of my shoulders. It's hard to explain but I think I'm finally becoming me again. I wasn't always shy. In fact, I used to always speak my mind. I used to be social but I've always been bullied since elementary school and without realizing it, it got to me. Anyway... Just wanted to write this. Writing things out always makes me feel...

Become close to them, intimate etc? I just can't shake the feeling that I'm being annoying when I approach people, that I'm desperate for love lol and sadly I am. I am desperate to create intimacy with people but I don't want them to see it, vulnerability, I don't want to scare them away. Like for example, there's a group of ppl at uni I like and talk with every now and then but we aren't friends. During intervals they go out but They don't really invite me to hang out grab a snack or so, they only did so once actually. so it's like I'm that weird member that's not a stranger but not a friend either. I'm not part of them, I dont belong. I really want to change that but idk how without seeming needy and like a pathetic freak. I just feel really distant and alienated and lonely. It's like sometimes they talk to me and all and the other if I don't say hi they wouldn't do so either. I don't go after them all the time lol I have common logic that it would freak someone out. But it's just that they are more of acquaintances. And I really want to change that. But I'm sick of going after people and not feeling reciprocated, not feeling like I belong. I realized I've always felt like that, when I was a child I felt like that with my sister, she didn't wanted to play with me lol and I could go in her room to chat either but her friends were allowed, so with time I distanced myself bc I was sick of trying. Then there's my dad who's just as distant. Don't really know who that guy is. And with my mom it's actually the same, we have a good relationship and closeness but it's like when she tells me she loves me, I don't feel it. It just seems like empty words to me. She used to be closer with my sister and of course I noticed that. They had their private conversations I was left out of. And maybe it's me. Maybe it's not them. Maybe I'm the one being distant. Yesterday they were outside of uni talking and I pretended not to see them bc I didn't wanted to go there and say hi and have nothing else to say and be that weird person that's not their friend. Know what I mean? And I actually feel the same with my friends. We talk about feelings etc but i still don't feel belonging. It's a really sad realization I made this week lol but I want to change that. I think wanting to be close to people doesn't make you pathetic yet I feel it and I feel stupid for wanting it and I feel like that's something I need to hide"

Posting on an anonymous account just so to be safe. A little background: Basically, due to many childhood experiences Ive(24F) lived my whole life with the I dont want to bother anyone syndrome and its recently caused a lot of introspection and insight in how I see all relationships in my life. Ive *never* struggled to get along with people in group settings but have *always* struggled with having close friendships in which we bond in a 1 on 1 setting. I also never pursue close female relationships because they intimate me and the vulnerability of asking someone to hangout and the fear of it being awkward has always freaked me out. Also, I have never felt this way towards men because I think subconsciously felt the only motivator to be around me is physical and nobody would want me around just by being me. (I literally made this realization today) So anyway, these are things that Ive kind of uncovered inside myself recently and Im trying to push myself into vulnerable situations and practice self-love; as well as try to teach myself that I am valuable to myself and others. WELL... I have a gal date next Monday and my fianc is so supportive but I was hoping for some tips! Knowing myself, Ive set things like this up before and then end up getting anxious and cancelling. Does anyone have any stories or tips or advice on how to give me a little more confidence? One thing that has helped is that she text me out of the blue and asked to hang! So that made me feel special."

However,I learned to be vulnerable, which I think is a really important aspect of gaining new friends. Its scary for sure to admit to people that you dont know anyone or dont have any friends but when I first started asking people to hang out I would usually preface with the thing that I was most nervous about them judging me for- I dont know anyone. It would go something like this- hey Im off this weekend and dont really know anyone since I moved here, would you want to hang out sometime. Or if you arent new to an area, hey Im looking to meet new people and you seem really cool. Would you wanna hang out sometime? A lot of people have some sort of anxiety or self-consciousness when meeting new people but the key is being VULNERABLE. You can do it!!"
83,vulnerability,socialskills,For Men (Mid 20s+) who want to make more friends (comment breakdown from Askmen),8,bfpubd,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/bfpubd/for_men_mid_20s_who_want_to_make_more_friends/,2019-04-22 01:16:43,"I stumbled on [this comment](URL from r/askmen. A man in his 40s reflects on how to make friends in your 20s and later. It's a great brekdown of how to make friends in different stages of life. I'll be adding my own commentary throughout: &gt;I am closing in on 50 and I have made four very close friends in the past 20-25 years, in addition to 6 others that carried over from high school and college. Two of them were people who share a passion of mine (wine collecting/tasting); I met both of them online initially and then we met in person. I tell my sons that the way to make close friends for life is to find good people who share your interests and spend quality time together to build those necessary shared experiences. **Jeff:** This is solid advice. Meet good people who share interests with you, and spend quality time together. The combo of good people/shared interests/quality time is the key. Friendship doesn't magically happen overnight, like most things in life...it requires work. &gt;It's harder as an adult. But there are many men out there who want to have close friends, to have someone they trust implicitly and who will really listen to them, when they need it. **Jeff:** It's important to realize what stage of life you're in. HS will be different from college. Mid-20s will be dramatically different from mid-30s. People typically become more family-focused as they age. (But that also means that finding great friends is very important) &gt;So there are two ingredients, being open and vulnerable combined with self-confidence (so not presenting that vulnerability in a needy or desperate way) and really listening to people and what they have to say, and not laughing at or judging them for what they have said. And helping them talk through the issues in their life that they can't share with anyone else. **Jeff:** This is an important call-out. Straight vulnerability can feel needy, and is a friendship turn off. Imagine you're an onion with layers. Maybe the first few times you meet someone you share a little more about yourself. Most people don't eat a whole onion, but a little onion can make a meal taste better. Also, being non-judgemental when others bring up a struggle or a deeply held opinion is great advice. Friends are welcoming, not prickly. Helping them talk through issue is a cornerstone of being a good friend. &gt;So there needs to be trust, otherwise the relationship will never deepen. And trust can take some time, but shared interests and making an effort to have shared experiences together (even if just a beer at a bar) can help the relationship have some momentum so that trust can develop. **Jeff:** Shared experience over time is key. All relationships need momentum. This also applies to people you've stopped calling or texting but would like to be deeper friends with. Reaching out to other with a plan to connect goes a long way. &gt;I have to say I see these sort of posts a lot on reddit. To those of you in your 20s, I know it can be lonely as all your old social groups have fragmented as everyone has gone their own way and is focused on building their careers. But make the effort to ask people out for drinks/dinner/a bike ride/whatever. **Jeff:** Yes. I see this question a ton with my readers. BIG key here is being proactive and making the effort. Have a plan when you want to connect with someone. ""Let's try this new noodle place"" etc. Don't put the burdern of planning on them! Make it as easy as possible. This is a great way to flex leadership muscles as well. &gt;If they say no, dont get down over it, just keep trying. It gets better later, after careers are on a good path and any kids are older. If you dont have any friends left, join clubs or activities to meet people with shared passions, that can go a long way. I find it a relief to be around people with whom I can just deep dive into the intricacies of wine and have fun. **Jeff:** Consistency is effective. If you try three times and don't get the outcome you wanted. Keep trying. Control what you can control. (Dress well, take care of yourself, etc) And if it doesn't work out with a potential friend, ask yourself: ""Was there anything about that situation that was under my control?"" If so, fix it. If not, realize that you're not fundamentally flawed. On to the next one. &gt;For those in your 30s, I give you similar advice, but you're about to go through a phase when everyone has or is about to have kids. That's when everything other than family and career gets shoved to the side. Fight that and try to see friends every few months at least. **Jeff:** As a guy in 30s, this is spot-on. I still see friends, but often has to be scheduled in advance. (Calendar invites...something I never would have done in my 20s) &gt;Dont let kids overwhelm everything else. I have old friends where I am now their only friend since they never tried to maintain ties with people. The only reason we are still friends if that I never stopped trying. &gt;If I was visiting his city on business, I would always tell him and we would meet up. But don't be like that guy, try harder and maintain those ties however much they fray. Once the kids are 12 and up, it gets a hell of a lot easier, and people remember those who stuck by them through the hard times. **Jeff:** God yes. So much is within your control. You CAN maintain ties to old friends. Text/email/calls/etc. Fear of rejection is not an acceptable excuse to let ties go cold. Friends are an important part of life. Work hard to keep those people in your life. Feel the fear and do it anyway! **More on friendship** Here are a couple of podcasts about making/maintaining friends: **1.

You have to embrace all of yourself. All of the weird thoughts you think, that you are so sure nobody else has or agrees with. You have to display vulnerability, and sometimes just say exactly what is on your mind, even if it flops. You have to be completely present with people. Value their time, just as you value your time. Be silly, intentionally silly. Play yourself down, up, and sideways. Keep people guessing. Youre an enigma. Why are you so different from everyone else? Youre not so different. Dont be so serious. There is a time and place for everything. If youre at a party, just liven up. Dance, sing, make weird faces and gestures, smile. Nobody that is cool cares how you act, as long as its within reasonable boundaries. As in, dont harm anyone, dont harm yourself, and dont instigate or encroach upon anothers space unless permitted. There are people who are more adept at socializing than others. How well you socialize hinges upon your deepest intentions. Do I want to get laid? Do I want to make friends? Do I want to dance a lot and laugh a lot? What do I want, and is it a reasonable request? The thing about socializing is that you CANT treat it like a methodical process where you go from point A to B and expect a certain result. TOO MANY VARIABLES. Everything else is out of your control, so the only thing you can control is you. Control you. Embrace the chaos. Let yourself be embarrassed. Embarrassment is a good thing. It feels weird and off and you might want to die from embarrassment, but overall a healthy dose of it is good for the soul. Keep working guys. Its a step at a time. We are all in our shells and we must brave the world. Its never easy, you only get tougher."

Ive recently come to the conclusion that the reason I struggle making and keeping friends is because Im scared to be vulnerable. The idea of vulnerability is terrifying to me. I have this idea in my head that I should meet a friend and immediately click with them, and be comfortable opening up to them. But my therapist helped me realize that friendships dont work that way. You become friends with someone by showing tiny bits of vulnerability at a time. It doesnt have to be diving in head first. You dont have to trust someone or feel completely comfortable around them immediately. Just tiny bits of vulnerability, or opening the door just a crack. As my therapist said, you can doggy paddle at beginning of friendships instead of diving deep. That made me feel a lot less overwhelmed about trying to open up to people and make new friends."

I work with a guy who shows clear signs of social anxiety, despite seeming otherwise friendly and kind. He reminds me of myself. I've never seen him socialize with anyone, at all, and I wonder if he might be struggling to make friends. I happen to be looking for new friends, and I suspect that maybe he might appreciate a friend, too. I've gone out of my way to introduce myself to him and be friendly whenever we walk past each other. He has responded positively, though his anxiety is undeniable. But I swear he purposefully tries to make our paths cross now more often. He looks at me a lot now. I think we both like each other to some extent. Problem is, we don't work in the same department, so we don't have much opportunity to interact or get to know each other at all, unfortunately. We see each other around all the time, but we haven't had a conversation yet. So I want to get to know him better. Since he's basically a stranger, I don't feel right asking him to hang out or anything. (What would we even do?) I also can't really stop work and go force a get-to-know-you conversation with him, for more than one reason. So the best approach I can think of is this: Hey man, can I ask you something? Im trying to meet new people and you seem like you might be cool. Would it be cool if we text each other or something? I'm fine with the vulnerability and awkwardness of this. The only reason I don't like this is because it doesn't offer him much of anything. Why would he say yes, knowing nothing about me? But truthfully I don't have much to offer, besides my friendship. So maybe it's the best I can do. Any thoughts? (Full disclosure, I have high-functioning autism, so even the most basic of social skills tips would be appreciated.)"

I was hoping to gather some support from them while also trying to form deeper bonds. Basically, I just shared some mental issues like how I experienced highly stressed feelings, being mildly depressed for some time. I didn't exactly needed any advice but rather, just to share something which I never told anyone before. &amp;#x200B; However, their reactions were not what I hoped. There were some downplay and poor attempts to understand. Now, I do know that friends are not the best people to seek advice from for such problems but still though. I wonder if I can continue being even just normal friends with them. &amp;#x200B; Can you be friends with a poor listener? I mean, I don't think most people know how to react or give support if they were confided. But the way my friends treated me, I'm having huge doubts because I cannot empathize with disparaging remarks."

About 9 months ago I decided to try and fix this perception people had of me that I was disinterested in them because I didnt have many friends and wanted to make more connections. So despite it scaring me I opened up and showed vulnerability to my friends, coworkers, partner etc. and its been the worst mistake of my life. To help with my friends thinking I wasnt engaged enough with them Id say things like hey sorry, Im a bit burnt out with socialising today so if Im coming across as distant Im not meaning to. These friends soon stopped inviting me places or including me in things. To help with my colleagues thinking I came across as cold Id explain that Im sorry I struggle a bit with ptsd and sometimes things trigger me and can make me closed off for a little while, but its nothing against you and Im sorry After being open for this I got reported to management for creating an unfriendly, stressful working environment where everyone had to walk on eggshells around me and was told that because of this I was no longer going to be considered for any promotions and had my job threatened if I didnt pull myself together. To help with my partner Id confide in him when I was struggling with something and be open about my fears instead of masking it and pretending everything was okay like I had in the past. Every single fight weve had in the last several months has been caused by him telling me I need to toughen up, that Im being irrational, that its not a big deal, or that normal people dont feel like that. Being open and honest about my feelings and why I am the way I am has lost me my friends, cost me my career and damaged my relationship. Yet all I have done is follow the advice of books and journals and my therapist who all say that being open to others is a good thing and will help me with making connections. Now I think I need to go back to just faking that everythings okay, that Im normal. I can do this, I just find it exhausting and its makes people apparently feel disconnected from me, yet they also dont like the real me?!"

I turned down girls who asked me out. I never wanted anyone to value me. But it has been years since someone directly asked me out. I had a nervous breakdown and went to kink events and even saw an orgy happen. But the uncomfortable sensation was still there: my lack of experience and my unworthiness. Even at these events people found me to be really attractive but I just froze. If they knew my secret, how in almost 30 years I am still a virgin, I would have most likely been shunned from the community. How big of a red flag is it to be a virgin at my age due to my insecurities? I am also not religious, I live with my parents, and I have no job. I am just so insecure about someone finding value in me for me. It doesn't make sense. However, I still would like to face my vulnerability and seek out a romantic relationship.

91,vulnerability,socialskills,Deep-rooted fear of showing interest / reaching out / complimenting people,1,atp9qv,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/atp9qv/deeprooted_fear_of_showing_interest_reaching_out/,2019-02-23 11:52:56,"So, I've grown to recognize that there are some things working against me but above all it's my own self-sabotage hurting me. I'm a naturally introverted, independent person as I've grown to figure out, but I feel like I take that aspect a little too far in my life. I simply prefer to do things my own way, but I've gotten myself to a point where I actively fear and avoid reaching out to others -- friends, acquaintances/classmates, strangers, even teachers and my own parents. Before I go any further, some context: I'm a 16 year old American male. Currently a junior in HS at a boarding school that I just started attending this year. Some of my friends say that what's holding me back is that I fade into the background too often. I'm basically never the center of attention and I often just join the background in large group situations. I think I have a naturally quiet voice even when I feel like I'm speaking normally, which often makes me not talk because people mishear and often ask me to repeat myself if I'm acknowledged at all. I have the occasional flash of confidence where I'm much more social in a situation, but this occurs in specific situations (like late-night group study sessions where I'm supposed to actually be focused on something else) and I regress back to the mean the next day. For the most part, the only reason I have friends is that I'm in the right places at the right time and they gradually include me / reach out. It takes me too long to be comfortable around people, I'd say. What scares me is that I feel like it's only going to get harder to make friends as I grow. I know I'll go to a college that's much bigger than the campus I'm on now, and then it's into the anonymous ""real world."" I think there's some important background here. Maybe my inability to reach out is a manifestation of my fear of vulnerability. I'm mainly limited by this feeling that people don't want to be bothered combined with some insecurity on my part. If I go out with three or four people, I can stay in the background when I want and still interject when I want, so it's the most balanced social situation for me. One-on-one situations worry me somewhat because suddenly all the pressure is on me, even if it's for one person. If I go a few minutes without saying anything, it's a much more noticeable awkwardness. People who know me say I'm a much nicer person than I let on. I'm comfortable just being there for people and listening to their problems, but I come off slightly aloof, cold, maybe awkward/timid to people who don't know me. I've struggled through classes on my own this semester and I haven't been to a teacher's office hours for extra help a single time. Basically, asking for help is a last resort. My grades are mostly As, but I'm skating by on natural intelligence at a school where that's not supposed to happen (most of my classmates are struggling for Bs) and that's something that I can't do later even if I somehow get away with it now. Here's what I think lead me here. In sixth grade, I was bullied pretty badly to the point where I switched schools. I was overweight back then and very immature, and I tried too hard to be accepted. I was the dude who girls asked out as a joke, and my direct attempts to socialize were met with open rejection. Since then, I've changed many things. I'm no longer overweight, and I'm better looking. I'm just solidly average-looking now (peak of the bell curve, you know. I blend into the crowd perfectly, no features stand out, just a regular skinny guy) and I gained a solid understanding of social cues to the extent of being oversensitive. I've thought people hated me who didn't even know who I was before. This post isn't motivated by any particular story, but I'll just leave an example. I decided to talk to a girl who I kinda liked. She seemed pretty friendly and complimented me several times. I didn't jump to assume interest there, but it was kinda like... I haven't actually programmed the path in my head where things don't go wrong. I just noticed throughout the conversation that she was leading it and I was coming off as the uninterested party, which isn't the way it should work. Anyway, I just know I'm a warmer person than what I come across as, but I need to show that I actually value people's company even if I am pretty introverted. I started working out a month or so ago and I also started trying to build a habit of meditation. These things will help me gradually shift my mindset, but I really feel like I need a big paradigm shift where I just let go and say ""fuck it."" My subconscious mind wants me to, but my conscious mind is powerful enough to rationalize me out of doing anything."
92,vulnerability,socialskills,How to be Less Selfish?,2,awk8qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/awk8qb/how_to_be_less_selfish/,2019-03-03 04:49:29,"For the last few years I've focused on improving myself, doing things that keep me happy, pursing goals that give me the life I think I want. I'm healthy, I have a job that I enjoy, I make enough money to be comfortable, and I have friends I hang out with occasionally. But I think I missed something, I never learned how to develop meaningful relationships. Getting out of my first long-term relationship made me come to this realization. I've never sacrificed significant time or energy for other people in my life. My ex-girlfriend was frustrated with me; she felt like she was not a priority in my life. She felt ignored. Reflecting back on it, I think she was right. I was operating in a mode of focusing on myself and my happiness and comfort and did not consider that a healthy, happy relationship requires some give and growth. I guess I just assumed everyone was like that. I assumed everyone was living independent lives, figuring it out on their own, focusing on themselves first. I don't feel like I've ever had any close, vulnerable friendships. I'm not as close or vulnerable with my family as I'd like to be. When someone needs something from me, I'll think about how I can fit their needs into the context of my life. I won't hesitate to help but only if it's convenient. My friends have rarely described me as compassionate. When they're going through a tough time, I'm the last person they would call. I'd like to change that. I now realize sacrifice is an important part of maintaining any relationship, and that there's some selfishness I need to work through. I also think I need to practice vulnerability. I thought I had learned how to be vulnerable but I think I just learned to be honest. I am honest and comfortable with who I am but I think I got comfortable and didn't seek out opportunities to share that. Lately, I've been trying to be more giving, of time and energy, being more attentive and listening to those around me, to friends, family, and coworkers. And so far, it's been rewarding, it doesnt feel as draining as I thought it would be and it's nice to feel somewhat involved in other people's lives. I think for a while I was afraid of giving more of myself. I've struggled with depression for much of my life and still do. I was afraid if I spent energy supporting others, I wouldn't have enough to keep myself going. I've been looking for more reading on this subject. Or just any information on how to recognize this selfishness and work on my mentality and behavior. I'd appreciate any comments you have. Thank you. TL;DR: How to be more giving in my relationships and less selfish with my time and energy?"
93,vulnerability,socialskills,Does anyone socialize in a way that minimizes vulnerability?,1,akkbnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/akkbnm/does_anyone_socialize_in_a_way_that_minimizes/,2019-01-28 16:29:06,"I'm terrified of being vulnerable and rarely seek out social situations. I just socialize when a situation presents itself to me. I'm pretty sure it's why I don't have anything in the way of friends, romantic or otherwise. I don't even come off as a social outcast to most people, since I come off as just another introvert, not a person dying of loneliness. I'm just too terrified of letting people get to know me, only to reject me. A long time ago, all the friends I had in the world showed me that I meant nothing to them and they let me know I was a loser. I have never really trusted people since then. I now live my life haunted by the idea that people will never accept the real me, and so rarely expose myself to others. The rational part of me knows that this is ridiculous, but I can't kid myself either. People can be kind and accepting, but they can also be awful. Anyone who says differently is selling something. It's part of why socializing can be so hard. If we knew that everyone would accept us for who we were, it would be much easier to open our mouths and speak, there would be much less too be afraid of. I'm not saying that people are good or bad, depending on whether they like you or not. I'm just saying that people are not universally accepting, and that can make socializing difficult for people."

Sometimes I'll leave my room open and my roommate's friends will come over to hear me singing to Youtube videos with a ""giggle"" here and there too. I feel like they're laughing at me and I don't like it when people do, but there's still this part of me that is unaffected by what others think. I'm worried that this will keep me from reading social situations and acting properly, but some people have told me it's a strength because it shows vulnerability and courage to be oneself. Is there a chance that I'm insane/rude? I'm so scared that I'm letting people walk over me and disrespect me and will allow this to pervade into professional interactions. :/"

It is currently 1:30AM. In my life, I have seldom celebrated my birthday. I didnt want to inconvenience others, I was scared that nobody would celebrate it with me, and I was uncomfortable with coming off as needing attention. This weekend, a large group of friends have a whole day planned for me, and I am so, so incredibly grateful to have people in my life who will do so much for me. I am grateful for my father, whom I rarely speak to, for sending me a T-shirt (though it is two sizes too large). I am grateful for the acquaintance from two years ago remembering me and wishing me happy birthday at the campus library. Despite the busy lives of all these people, my birthday of all things was a passing thought, and they took action to let me know that I am in their thoughts. It is outstandingly validating. Yet, I can do better. Sure, my big day is this weekend, but after all these years, I can make a great birthday for myself and everyone around me TODAY. So heres my plan for today: - In the morning, I have a lecture. I will appreciate the fact that I am learning something awesome. - Afterwards, I come home to cook lunch. I will appreciate that my food tastes amazing. - In the afternoon, I need to attend a career fair. The recruiters will remember my enthusiasm. - My evening plans arent set yet. - Throughout the day, I will have the courage to talk to beautiful girls on campus. I will enjoy the conversation, or the lack thereof. At the end of the day, my birthday is just another day. Nonetheless, I want to LIVE in this day, and search for what it feels like to be ALIVE, to unashamedly project myself onto this world. I want to believe that if I can succeed today, then I can make every day a birthday. Writing this post is the first stepthat is, to share this vulnerability of mine. I ask for words of encouragement, for suggestions to this day and beyond, and for understanding. It is currently 1:51. Lets make the last 22 hours count. "

Ask about emotions. 2. Expand your vocabulary of emotion words. 3. Learn to focus on your own bodily sensations and identify those bodily sensations with specific emotions. 4. Acknowledge to yourself and others that you are a person who has an inner emotional life. 5. Show vulnerability. Admit fault and acknowledge fear, uncertainty, and insecurity. 6.

In the beginning, everything seemed fine except the mentor who had a serious chip on his shoulders. Everyone seems to not like his presence yet no one said anything. Now when it comes to me, I only give respect to people who have earned it and I sort of talk to others who are not really involved. I was told that he has no control over my probation and all. I thought I was working well as the people around me used to say that my work was the best and that the progress was awesome. While this was happening there was some personal issue with another co-worker and at the same time, our work hit a block. Which took a little longer than usual to get over. While this was happening the mentor always seemed to have an issue with me and because of my personal problem with the colleague, I was not that much efficient as I had always been. That didn't mean that there was no output. It was just that it was a complex work. I had a pretty laid back approach to work, I usually got up to roam about in the office and talk to people then go back to work again. But then people in other areas started having issues with that as well. I couldn't care less and I said, laid back. What happened was out of the blue I was called into a conference room and apparently there have been a lot of complaints against me from other managers(who I didn't even know), because they think I am unprofessional(I did my work and went back home, I just couldn't sit at my desk for 8 hours straight). So I was asked to leave and no one cared, which affected me to the core. I am still not able to understand where I was wrong and why did this happen. I also know that I don't want to feel this way. PS: I got a new job and will be moving to a new country but the emotional and mental trauma doesn't seem to heal up. Also, the work permit and visa are taking some time which is affecting me too as I am sitting idle with no work, my mind drifts to instances of my memories where I was working and was happy.

Past trauma, social anxiety, or perfectionism, can all cause feelings of emotional vulnerability. The first major step in dealing with your insecurities and becoming a better person is to identify the source. We all have problems. It's a universal truth.

I just have a lot of anxiety talking to people who I'm not very familiar with. I'm not good at small talk."" Obviously, I'd want to get to the point where I no longer send awkward signals in the first place, but that's going to be a very slow process, so I'm thinking of this sort of disclosure as a stop-gap solution in the mean time. I'm very reluctant to disclose personal things like this for fear of them being used against me, but I've realized that that fear is mainly because I'm still stuck in a high school mindset. I would hope that now that I'm an adult dealing with other adults, everyone is going to be a lot more mature and understanding.

For example, is there a risk that showing this vulnerability might be misconstrued by certain people and taken as an invitation to make romantic advances? "
103,vulnerability,socialskills,I just came to a realization that's been right in my face this whole time,1,a517ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/a517ez/i_just_came_to_a_realization_thats_been_right_in/,2018-12-11 10:40:53,"Holy crap. So to preface this, I'm generally a soft-spoken, awkward type who doesn't leave the house much unless it's to hang with his athletic friend. I spend a lot of time, therefore, in my own head--daydreaming, thinking, analyzing myself and things around me, telling stories in my mind, and just kinda living there. Because of this (and the fact that I'm probably mildly autistic), I'm not the best at articulating my thoughts into words, or text, so this is probably going to be all over the place, and I'm probably going to randomly cut myself off a lot, so bear with me. Despite being so reserved though, probably because my best friend is everything I'm not--I've also kind of been all over the spectrum as far as the people I surround myself with and observe--online an off. You could imagine my shock when I just found my own answer to the age-old question: ""What makes a person appealing [to others]?"" (As far as personality goes.) It's so dumb too because I've probably had this idea several times before but never really took the time to connect it to the bigger picture. The thing that makes a person likable and attractive--in the most basic sense, is HAPPINESS. It. is. HAPPINESS. And before you tell me how obvious that was and how simple it should have been to deduce that, lemme explain some stuff: So a while back, I had thought to myself: ""What's the meaning of life? What's our purpose? Why are we even here? What's any person's greatest ambition in the most basic sense?"" Lo and behold, I found that happiness was also the answer to this question. Why? Well, the way my mind puts it... -Why is some people's dream in life to be rich? Because money equals opportunities and power, equals freedom and experience, which provide a sense of fulfillment, which instills HAPPINESS -Why do so many people DESPERATELY crave a significant other to love and cherish? Because that sense of companionship--that knowledge that one person in this world of practically infinite options--considers you to be the most important person in their life--that love, that intimate bond nobody else can come between--it makes you (and them) HAPPY. We want to LOVE because we want to be HAPPY. We want to make others feel loved and happy because it makes us happy seeing them with that sense of comfort, which in its own sense, is a form of happiness -Why are some people (like those who head mega-corporations and large authoritative positions of power) so bent on maintaining that control? Because control = power = universal fulfillment of any desire that person has, which ties in to why people would want lots of money--because it gives them the opportunity to do anything they want--to eat anything they want--to try anything they want--to fulfill (almost) any desire they could have! That fulfillment--that idea that they took their one life they have to live and they seized it with no missed opportunities--it makes them HAPPY. That's also why so many people, even with all the money and influence in the world, are just empty shells of human beings. Many of them can't even pinpoint that the reason they feel empty is because they lack sincere love and acceptance by someone(s), and that isolation weighs a lot more than the INDIVIDUAL freedom power and control provides. If love was a purchasable commodity, it would be the most expensive thing on the market. That's why the love of someone you deeply care about will always be worth more important than any job offer or amount of money you could ever possess (albeit that's starting to go on an unrelated tangent) I could keep providing examples, but I hope that's enough to make my point clear, regarding a person's most basic sense of purpose in the world, which is to find happiness, in whatever form they desire. Now, regarding the original, larger point of this post... Happiness is also the thing that makes a person the most likable--everything in the world points to it. I used to think the most valuable thing to be or have in a social setting was the power of comedy. Because if you can make people laugh, you're easing the atmosphere, and establishing a loose, friendly bond between you and those around you. When they see you as funny, they associate you with laughter and positive feelings, and they want you to keep making them feel those things, (sort of as if a person's most basic desire is to be &gt;&gt;happy&lt;&lt;, eh?). And it makes sense, I still regard that logic with credibility. BUT--big but--comedy isn't the most important thing just because ""it's comedy, Q.E.D."". No, it's because of what I stated above: laughter = ease of tension = casual, lax vibes = less pressure and feelings of vulnerability when opening up = more personal bonds between people = friendship = sense of acceptance = HAPPINESS. Therefore... ...while comedy is a powerful tool to have in a group setting, there are others. Comedy works because it gives happiness the opportunity to thrive in a situation. But what about other forms of happiness? What about--wait for it--just BEING HAPPY? It's SO SIMPLE, but it makes SO MUCH SENSE! If you're radiating positive vibes, other people pick up on that, all the same as when they pick up on tense vibes (if you're angry and people sense you might blow up), or awkward vibes (if they sense what you've said/done isn't socially acceptable/is a dead-end conversation stopper). Those positive vibes provide people with--well, you already know. But it seriously works. That's why people who bathe themselves daily in self-pity--EVEN IF IT'S JUSTIFIED--don't do as well at making friends. They may find people who are going through similar troubles, sure, but EVEN SOMEONE WHO'S CONSTANTLY NEGATIVE DOESN'T WANT TO BE AROUND SOMEONE WHO'S ALSO CONSTANTLY NEGATIVE. I frequent the r/foreveralone sub, and have bounced around the incel subs, depression subs, need-a-friend subs, dating subs, and pretty much all over the place, and I've picked up on this pattern each and every time, in each and every place. People who project sadness or loneliness or desperation do not do well in social environments. The most basic reason why isn't because they're ""not confident,"" or they ""don't love themselves enough."" Those are valid reasons, but they branch from the same seed: to be confident in an attractive sense, you have to be HAPPY. To be confident with a bad mood is to be arrogant--is to push everyone away--is to be stubborn--is to be closed-minded. Same confidence, different vibes, different results. Likewise, you can ""love yourself"" and still be unattractive in a sensual manner--most of the general population is, (think of social media-ites, who project a feeling of loving themselves so much, they just can't stop taking pictures, to the point to where it becomes ANNOYING and UNLIKABLE. It's always argued that people who do that are usually ""insecure,"" but then it's also tagged on with ""...or they're just conceited."" Do you know what that last part means? Let's rephrase it: ""...or they just love themselves too much."" WOW! Look at that! Suddenly, self-love on its own =/= attractive! That is to say, being confident and loving yourself aren't standalone answers to ""how can I be more appealing?"". The most basic way to answer that question--to be someone other people want to be around--it's to be HAPPY, or, to at least project happiness while in those settings. That's why some of the seemingly happiest people in groups may also be some of the most depressed, or have gone through some of the worst struggles. They realized this--consciously or not--and they made the connection that putting on this happy mask--it brings people to them. It alleviates the loneliness (or at least, that's the goal). It provides them a sense of belonging, and, hopefully with that, a greater sense of purpose. So to project HAPPINESS, is to be LIKABLE. Of course, you can go over-the-top with it, and then people get suspicious and can tell you're just wearing a mask, and it can have the opposite effect, but if you can find that perfect balance--just enough happiness produced by focusing on the positives of the events surrounding your life, (or even putting on that mask if you have nothing positive to think about), it can get you by. That's my realization."
104,vulnerability,socialskills,What helps me maintain eye contact in conversations,1,9r6uo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9r6uo9/what_helps_me_maintain_eye_contact_in/,2018-10-25 14:53:30,"I used to be a shy kid who had trouble looking people in the eyes when talking to them. What helped me maintain eye contact was actually a side effect of something I was practicing which is vulnerability. I believe from personal experience that people dont maintain eye contact with people because they dont want to be vulnerable with who theyre taking to. Being vulnerable is being comfortable with how you look, what you think, feel, etc. Id been practicing this trait recently and I noticed that I would maintain eye contact when I was willing to be vulnerable with whoever I was talking to. Im still working on this and from time to time I do go back to avoiding eye contact but I remind myself to be vulnerable and it instantly makes me more comfortable. "
105,vulnerability,socialskills,How I learned to (Sort Of) Love Small Talk (or at least get better at it),1,9tutjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9tutjl/how_i_learned_to_sort_of_love_small_talk_or_at/,2018-11-04 02:09:02,"Small talk sucks. I only like deep conversations. Well yeah, everyone likes deep conversations. Thats not special. I dont see anyone who would trade one drunken reminiscing at 2am at Waffle House with a friend of ten years for twenty hey how about this weather? *Hot enough for ya?* while waiting for the damn elevator to come. You dont have to love small talk (its not my favorite) but listen; **The better you are at small talk, the more youll get to have the deep conversations that you crave.** Simple as that. \--- As previously mentioned, young-whippersnapper-me was an [arrogant, awkward d bag](URL (what a winning combo!). At my first big boy job out of school, I refused to even say good morning to my coworkers because small talk was a big bucket of bullshit. Im being paid to work not chat. Every morning Id usually shrug a response or try to get to my desk through the side door to minimize human contact. For some reason, I always felt alone most places I went. Hmm. It wasnt until I was midway through my meet-100-people-in-a-month experiment I called the Hundo Month that I finally got it: The purpose of small talk is to open the door to starting a relationship. Yeah, I know this seems obvious to you naturals out there, but to me this was a **FUCKING HUGE LIFE CHANGING REVELATION**. Even bigger then when I realized the importance of patting a steak dry before a sear (and thats a BIG revelation!) Small talk is dumb. Weather is dumb, sports are dumb, TV, movies, and music are all dumb. News is dumb. Dumb is dumb. Everything is dumb\* (according to my highly paid research assistants). But thats not the point. The value of small talk is in the *context,* not the *content.* Insisting your small talk has to be brilliant and exciting like it always is in The Movies actually makes your small talk *worse* because youre in your head trying to be maximum-clever instead of in the moment reacting to the person in front of you. The purpose of small talk is to \- convey your openness to and interest in someone new \- invite the other person to start talking in a low-risk way \- lay the groundwork for more conversation if things go well \- give a small sampling of who you are, and most of all, \- **reduce fear**. Interacting with other people is scary. Downright *Spooktacular* if you will. **A large amount of improving social skills is about reducing uncertainty and fear in** ***others*****.** Small talk is a simple ritual to let people you interact with know Hey I acknowledge that you exist and I will probably not stab you (probably). Or at least not soon. That counts for a lot. \--- But back to Small talk sucks. I only like deep conversations? As we established earlier, everything is dumb and boring. (See above). Think of it this way, small talk is the foreplay to deep connections **fuckin**. The Deep Emotional Conversations that matter in our lives come from a place of both *openness* and *vulnerability*. Talking about what really matters in your life to someone else means you might get rejected, made fun of, hurt, or have you waste time pouring your soul out to someone who doesnt get it. **Demanding a deep emotional conversation from the start of a relationship is the emotional equivalent of Nice shoes, wanna fuck? and then calling everyone an asshole/bitch when they dont wanna fuck.** \--- But hey, Ill be real. As much as getting better at small talk has *seriously* improved my quality of social life, sometimes I just cant fucking be assed to do it. Whether Im busy, peopled out, on 3 hours of sleep, or whatever, Im just not going to be bother. I love people, but as an introvert I still need to recharge my social batteries. And thats fine! Its ok to opt out *sometimes* when youre not feeling it, but opting out of small talk completely leaves you at a **massive** disadvantage for finding your new best friend and enjoying life. If youre trying to build a new social circle, its worth pushing through when youre not in the mood because **thats how you start friendship.** Plus, the more you practice the easier itll get. Am I a grand-champion, double-master, ultra-guru whatever at making small talk? **Hell no.** But Im better than I was last year. And the year before. And *definitely* better than 2010 (*hoo boy, that was the year of saying things that keep me awake at night from painfully awkward they were, damn.)* All I know for sure is that **holy goat-balls, getting better at small talk makes your life easier, fun, and friendlier.** Plus, one completely unexpected side effect of improving my small talk is that I can handle WAY MORE socialization before needing to recharge my social batteries. Neat! \--- Theres no need to beat yourself up if youre not perfect at small talk right out the gate. It might be natural for some people, but sure as hell wasnt for me. I had to fail a *whole* shit ton before I started figuring things out because I didnt really have any role models to learn from. And thats fine! Building social skills is a process. All that matters is that youre better than you were last year. Thats it. The next time youve got an opportunity for small talk that youd usually avoid, give it a full-hearted try. It might not be perfect, but the more practice you put in, the easier itll be to build your social circle."
106,vulnerability,socialskills,You might need to be MORE selfish,1,9vvd3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9vvd3w/you_might_need_to_be_more_selfish/,2018-11-11 02:59:15,"Everyone's advice is always about how to be more selfless. Talk to other people about themselves, be interested in other people, be nice to other people, ad nauseam. Oh and stop being so selfish, the worst advice of all. I'm trying to undo all that damage. It's deeply rooted. But, it turns out you HAVE to have self-worth otherwise people will assume you're not worth talking to. Turns out you have to have a well-developed self-identity otherwise there's no person inside you for others to connect with. Turns out you can't put all the focus on other people because it makes them uncomfortable if you're not sharing too -- there has to be a MUTUAL vulnerability when it comes to sharing stuff about oneself. Turns out people-pleasing just makes you seem desperate and pitiable (and pity friendships are the worst!). You have to know who you want to spend time with and take the initiative because it's what YOU want -- otherwise, those people will feel unwanted. And worst of all, if your ""selflessness"" does attract friends who stay, then the type of people you attract are those who are so selfish they don't give a shit about you, they interrupt/ignore you on the rare occasion you have something to say, and when you are in need they disappear until you're ready to focus on them again. So yeah, you can't put all your focus on others. You have to have a strong sense of your own personal identity before you seek to connect it with others'."
107,vulnerability,socialskills,Mastering Social: Stage 4 - Make People Feel Important,1,9kxfi2,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9kxfi2/mastering_social_stage_4_make_people_feel/,2018-10-03 13:07:23," # Introduction And we're back! If you've mastered the [previous stage](URL you're in a great place: you can make yourself, and people who share a similar taste of humor with you, laugh! But more importantly, laughter isn't just about feeling good. Laughter is our first sign that someone is *compatible* with us--that someone can be our friend. While the previous stage allowed us to find potential friends by showing us who we are compatible with, this stage will bridge the gap to actually forming meaningful friendships. &amp;#x200B; # Make People Feel Important The fourth stage is all about making people feel important. Before we get into what that means, lets call back to an important lesson from stage 3: mastering social isnt about making everyone like you. In fact, mastering social is more about developing the skills needed to find your people: your friends, close friends, best friends, and lovers. Keeping that in mind, making people feel important is a very intentional process that can only be effective if its genuine. How do make this process genuine? By only attempting to make people who you want to be friends with (and more) feel important. Given that we mastered stage 3, we now have a pool of people who we genuinely know we want to be friends with. There are two types of skills we need to master to make people feel important. The first type of skill is the passive one, the one which can technically be applied to everyone, not just the people you want to be friends with. This involves working on your importance quirk. The second skill requires learning how to effectively give your time to someone. Giving your time (effectively!) is the single most important thing you can do towards making someone feel important. Thats another reason I stressed earlier that you shouldnt try make everyone feel important. Your time is a finite resource and you should only invest it in people who you actually like to be around. ***You will have mastered this stage when you feel content with the quality and quantity of friends you have****. As a baseline if youre unsure, aim to have 5 friends. You can measure quality by seeing how often they hit you up versus how often you hit them up.* &amp;#x200B; **Developing an Importance Quirk** Remember back in stage 2 how we worked on finding our fault? In many ways this was like finding a vulnerability quirk. In this stage, well work on finding and using an importance quirk. The same way our fault from stage two is an authentic way of making someone feel comfortable around you, an importance quirk is an authentic way of making people feel important around you. One example is that person that never forgets peoples names. When they see you, they instantly call you by your name. However, this importance quirk should only be reserved for people with great memory. Oftentimes, self-help books say that you \*need\* to learn how to memorize peoples names as that will yield you great social gains. However, what these books fail to realize is that there are many ways you can make someone feel important, and its not worth it to try to force yourself to learn peoples names if thats not something thats not already natural to who you are. If your memory sucks, dont work towards this quirk. Another example is the person with the amazing laughits almost as if when they laugh you feel like youre the funniest person in the world. This should again be something natural; if you have a pretty good laugh then it makes sense to work on it and really make it full. But if you have a funny laugh (I.e. that was your vulnerability quirk) then dont waste time trying to make it your importance quirk! The ingredients to having a good importance quirk is 1) something that you have a natural affinity for and 2) something that makes someone feel special and/or unique. Notice how in the name example the person feels special because their name is remembered, or in the laughter example the person feels important because they think theyre the funniest person around. Use this to craft your importance quirk, and from there practice using it by trying to insert it at least once in every conversation. Here are a couple more examples to get your mind thinking: 1. The Smile Quirk - This is the person that has that super warm smile that makes you feel like they just really like you. Develop this quirk if, after stage 2, you found that you have a natural resting smile. 2. The Connections Quirk - This is the person that is always able to connect people. Develop this quirk if youre in a position that affords you the opportunity to know a lot of people. It really makes someone feel important when you can connect them with someone thats relevant to their current issues in life, I.e. I know the perfect investor that would love to invest in your tech startup idea, Ill get you all connected. &amp;#x200B; **Effectively Giving Your Time** The second part of learning how to make people feel important is effectively giving your time to someone. To begin, lets understand what I mean by effectively. To effectively give your time to someone, you must give someone value each time you give them your time. Therefore, your time is always valuable. What do I mean by value? Value is a term which we will come back to a lot as we move forward with this series. I define value (within a social context) as something that directly or indirectly helps someone gain status and acceptance within a social heiarchy. This is best understood through examples. For a first example, lets think back to stage 1 where we learned about making endless conversation. Were there any topics that got really deep with this potential new friend? Did you guys really bond over e-sports? Fashion? Lets call one of those deep mutual conversation threads a **common topic**. Knowing the common topics of your potential friend is a great example of giving someone value. When you see said person, bring up that topic again. Given that you are immersed in that space, for example e-sports, there is probably new information that you learned that you can share with your potential friend. This is **valuable** because that person now has more information to navigate that space. Lets say you told them that there is a huge e-sports competition in a month. That gives them a chance to sign up and potentially win, which would be boost their status and acceptance in the e-sports social hierarchy. Thus common topics provide a great avenue to give value to someone. Laughter is another example of giving value. Fortunately for us, we mastered humor in stage 3, thus we should able to make this person laugh. Why is laughter valuable given the definition of value we provided earlier? Well, we kind of got into this already. Laughter is a sign of compatibility. If you make someone laugh, they realize theyre compatible with you and thus are accepted by you. Therefore in the grand scheme of things where you two are one social hierarchy they have gained status and acceptance in that small social hierarchy. They also realize through you they can probably gain more compatible and like-minded friends. The examples above are two of potentially many ways that you can give value to someone. It ultimately boils down to finding the social hierarchies your potential friend cares about and finding ways to advance them in that hierarchy. Furthermore, this is a proactive step. You must go out of your way to make time for this person: lunches, dinners, hanging out, etc. but make sure you have something valuable to give every time you meet. Whats wrong with time thats not valuable? You know that friend that just wants to chill but nothing ever really comes out of the hangout session? No laughter, no anything? Thats frusturating because you could have been gaining value in other ways. Dont be that friend. Always embed your time with value and invest it proactively in the right people. &amp;#x200B; # Side Piece: Making Conversations more Enjoyable *Aside: This section is not necessary for mastering stage 4.* We'll continue finding more ways to make conversations more enjoyable. This time, we'll talk briefly about conversation exit strategy. There will be times when you will need to exit a conversation. Here a few potential reasons: 1) youre at a networking event and you need to meet as many people as possible, 2) the person youre talking with is terribly incompatible with you, 3) youre at an event such as a concert where conversation is not ideal. First and foremost, make sure the current conversation thread is done. If it seems like it could go on for a while, provide a closing statement. For example, lets say youre talking about tennis and you all got into a flow of mentioning your favorite players. Close it by stating Yeah, I love talking about my favorite tennis players. Thats it, the formula is simply sitting back almost as if youre introspecting, and say that you love talking about conversation topic XYZ. This should effectively close the thread and will leave a brief enough pause to get into the next part of our strategy. The next part is providing a reason to stop talking. If the situation allows it you can be blunt: it was great meeting you, Im gonna go meet some other people. This is a great line for a networking-type event where its expected that youll meet a lot of people. Another reason is to say you need to go do something: get a drink, use the bathroom, etc. These are socially acceptable reasons for ending a conversation. Finally, if none of the above is possible, change the center of focus. For example, if you were at the concert, make an observation about the band thats playing and start focusing intently on them. The person youre conversing with will get the idea. &amp;#x200B; # Conclusion That wraps up this stage.

I was raised by a family whose motto could easily be summarized as""stick your neck out for no one, not even blood. And when you you do, make sure there are as many strings attached as possible so you can pull out with little invested or destroy you and them both."" This upbringing birthed a forged a victim mentality. I view the world cautiously, everyone is a potentially threat, a potential betrayal, and as a consequence I see myself as someone who is incapable of maintaining relationships for who I am but for what I have. As an example, in high school I gave my date her ticket to the prom a couple of day before prom and my dad responded ""You big dummy, now she can go with someone else."" As though I wasn't a worthy date, as though my dad actually knew anything about the girl [he didn't even know her name]. Protection over courage; always give with strings attached. Or even to date, as an adult my parents have given every excuse in the world not to help me assistance in times of need. If it wasnt for friends and parent of friends I would not be where I am now, nor would I understand how to give to someone solo because you love them and the best for them. I now realize the problem.. I am the problem.. my social skills are ass, because I view the world and other people as a threat and I have been trying to control others through resources just as my parents have done with me. Not only that but I view all acts of kindness as potential freedom traps. Help? I dont know how to get better. I now realize building relationships is about vulnerability but I am terrified of being vulnerable. Plus years of living this way given me plenty of incidences that give me a confirmation bias."

My friend group sorta is disintegrating, because a few guys stopped studying and I am not so close with the rest because they drive home every weekend and one is a douche ( agrees to meet, then goes somewhere with other people). In the beginning I was happy to meet so many new people,I have lots of numbers on my phone. Hell, I even organised a Meet up for a bunch of people . But with very few people something worked out. Basically some people I met at the start were my only chance ( even though I was not so passionate about them). But they are mostly gone now. I have some friends outside my study, so Im not totally lonesome. But still It frustrates me that Im stuck with this ""broken group"" and have no other friends in a group of 300 people in my study. &amp;#x200B; I am really not shy, quite the opposite. I have no problems approaching girls on the street (and even a bit success with that). But when I approach people that would make cool friends it hardly goes further than the first contact. I text them, ask them to do something a couple of times... they dont have time and dont reciprocate. Then I stop texting them. &amp;#x200B; I think those are some of my problems, maybe you guys have some solutions 1. I am to direct when I meet new people, I suppose. I am very open and direct asking for the number of everyone new I meet. After that I asked them to meet up or go for drinks. But I almost never get a positive reply. Maybe I should first text a bit or meet for a coffee. But I really hate texting! I am also not patient enough to wait, if they ask me to do something because I think that they wont :(. Which is true in most cases. But maybe I scare those off that would 2. When I am drunk I get like super horny, and only talk to girls. That ruined a lot of potential friendships and almost a few existing friendships (pisses off some of my guy friends). Maybe I should jerk of like a lot more? or stay off the alcohol? Might be that I also seek female validation. This is really a problem... 3. Probably I am to superficial in conversations, because people dont call back. If there would be a deeper connection I would get a lot more positive reactions. Maybe I have problems showing intimacy and vulnerability because of a history of bullying and loneliness. 4. I am very egocentric and when people dont behave in a way that I expect them to, it really infuriates me... If they dont respond in time or make. And I can be very forgetful of other peoples feelings, because most of the time I only had to take care of mine. 5. I am very open to talk to people, but oblivious to social cues most of the time. Its mostly my old bully coping mechanism not to care what people think.

One of the main thing that has stopped me from asking questions in school was the effects of being mocked. People would sigh, laugh, chuckle, at my questions and it just generally made me feel lesser and that my presence was more of a burden than anything. Ignoring the responses from my peers even the teachers didn't respond well to them, and I was occasionally used as a stepping stone for other students; ""At least you're smarter than \_\_\_\_."" It was demotivating to hear from people that told me that talent and intelligence were things that could be honed that I was seen as a lost cause. Due to the way me displaying my vulnerability in subjects made people see me as worse, I began to go back to just drilling through my questions on my own, chunking them up as well as I could to research. This took a long time since i'm bad at understanding myself and my problems, much less the problems inside the problems, and I didn't have time. Usually I either gave up and had the teacher tell me followed by ""How could you not know this?"" or kept drilling till the test came and did poorly. While i'm still searching for the holy grail method of self sufficient studying and solving my own questions, I keep finding myself in spots that I just don't know how to categorize, much less chunk, and the lack of knowledge of my lack of knowledge makes me feel like i'm in a shrinking box, but i'm just too scared to put myself in that corner of shame again by asking for help. &amp;#x200B; I've been trying to apply advice of not caring how other people see me, but i'm not sure if that will really work in academic/work spaces when people's perception of you can influence the opportunities you get. It's hard to push yourself and just ask that ""dumb"" question when that could mean being excluded from a project or generally mocked. Which leads me to asking about the intersection of school/work and people. What parts of general social advice and confidence do you keep, and which do you exclude? How do you not care what people think when most of you're progress depends of what people can estimate of you? People can be mean, but what do you do in situations like this where it really seems to matter? For people that have been put in these situations, what did you do? What should I do? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

115,vulnerability,socialskills,Mastering Social: Stage 2 - Make People Feel at Ease,95,9eugjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/9eugjx/mastering_social_stage_2_make_people_feel_at_ease/,2018-09-11 14:35:14,"# Introduction [Just because you can talk endlessly with someone](URL doesnt mean they actually feel at ease around you. Stage 1 only conquered one negative emotion that breeds uneasiness: feeling awkward. In this stage well need to conquer several other negative emotions that we can very easily invoke in other people. Youll notice a recurring pattern as we move up the stages: each stage is a subset of the next stage. Think of each stage as a concentric circle with the smaller circle feeding into the larger one. This is why its important that you master the previous stage before going on to the next stage. (Its ok to read ahead, but practicing should be done linearly). &amp;#x200B; # Making People Feel at Ease The second stage is all about making people feel at ease when youre around them. Ultimately, feeling uneasy comes from a combination of negative emotions including but not limited to: feeling awkward, feeling judged, feeling sad, feeling angry, etc. When a subset of negative emotions come together, not only do we feel those emotions, but we also feel unstable and uneasy around some person especially when theyre the cause of those emotions. ***You will have mastered this stage when you dont feel uneasy around anyone or any group of people by the end of the social interaction.*** Why is this our definition of mastery here? Because our feelings towards a conversation or social interaction often tend to mirror those of the other person(s) involved. Ever left a conversation and felt it was very awkward, praying to god that the other person didnt feel the same? 9 times out of 10 they probably felt the same way. Also notice how this requires that you master stage 1 first before coming here. If you cant hold a conversation, you best believe people will feel uneasy around you and avoid you like the plague. Lastly, notice the last phrase of our definition of mastery: by the end of the social interaction. Obviously, things happen at the beginning and middle of an interaction that you have no control over. However, a recurring theme during this series is that you need to learn to take control and lead interactions. If an interaction starts off on the wrong note, you need to figure out how to dissolve the uneasiness before it ends. To improve at this stage, you must practice being more vulnerable, more honest about what you see, and more relaxed. By doing this, you will crush the majority of the negative emotions that you may inadvertently invoke in someone else during an interaction. &amp;#x200B; **Become More Vulnerable** Vulnerability? What? Why do I need to be more vulnerable? Hold your horses. Ultimately, vulnerability is your ultimate tool to crushing the negative emotion of ***feeling judged***. Let me explain. Ever meet that perfect person that had all their stuff together all the time and had seemingly no flaw? How did that person make you feel? In awe? Jealous? Intimidated, maybe? In fact, I know many people who feel judged around very successful and put together people. I argue that this is because we feel a combination of those emotions I listed earlier around said people: jealousy, intimidation, awe, etc. You cant help but feel like if you mess up around this person, it would be disastrous. As you might guess, this will all make you feel very uneasy. Im by no way saying you need to not be successfulbut what I am saying is you need to figure out how to seem human and down to earth. The first task in becoming more vulnerable is finding your fault. I have noticed that the most charismatic people I know have some perceived fault: maybe they get just a little bit too drunk sometimes, or maybe they have a funny laugh, or maybe or theyre just a little bit forgetful. Ironically, having an insignificant fault makes people feel comfortable around you because they realize youre not perfect. They dont feel like you will judge them at any one of their faults and in turn it will make them feel more comfortable. With that being said, you dont want to take this too far. Notice in my examples I used a little bit. If youre getting belligerently drunk at every social event or you forget every detail that everyone tells you then youll just be the butt of everyones jokelosing the respect of all your peers (which is critical to mastering social, something well cover in more depth in stage 6). Work on finding your fault and then work on conveying it in a believable way. Assuming its a genuine fault, you wont have to fake anything when it comes to conveying it, so make sure you find a genuine ***insignificant*** fault. Next, stop interviewing people during conversations. We alluded to this in the side piece from the previous stage. One of the biggest problems with the interview conversations is that you make the person feel judged. Conversations are give and take. If you arent being vulnerable, why are you prying through someones vulnerabilities with your questions? Thus, to be more vulnerable work on making statements before you ask questions. For example, instead of prying into someone about their pet peeve lead the conversation by first saying something you dont like as a pet peeve before even considering asking them about it. Finally, practice not taking yourself too seriously. Finding your fault will help here, but most important is learning how to be humble. While its good to convey to people that you have value, you must learn to not do it by throwing it into someones face. In later stages we will talk about spreading value to people, so for now just focus on not explicitly saying something thats meant to make you seem better than the person youre talking to. For example, its okay to say, Yesterday I was at the basketball game with my friends, it was a lot of fun but its not okay to say Yeah, I had front row seatsI mean do that all the time, its really no big deal for me. Every time you catch yourself bragging, write it down and introspect on why you bragged. &amp;#x200B; **Become More Situationally Honest** Being situationally honest is all about being up front about the current situation at hand and not hiding anything. We use situational honesty to eliminate feelings of awkwardness. In stage 1, we learned how to create endless conversation which removes a lot of the awkwardness we normally experience. However, there are more ways for situations to get awkward. Imagine you go give someone a handshake, but they meant to give you a fist bump and then you have that extremely awkward situation where both of you keep switching hand positions to try to match the other person before you inevitably collide. Talk about awkward. Situational honesty becomes critical here and there is a relatively straightforward way of practicing it. When something weird or awkward arises, tell it how it is, and if you cant tell it how it is write that situation down in your social journal and introspect over why you couldnt tell it how it is. Lets go back to the previous example. Youre about to collide with your friend and neither of you have figured out whether or not to do a handshake or a fist bump. Youre freaking out, *Oh gosh this is so awkward, I dont know what to do with my hand.* Did you hear that thought in your mind? Well stop moving and say it out loud. Yup, you heard me correctly. Stop moving, laugh, and say wow this is awkward, Sam, I have no idea what to do with my hand as you grab his fist with your palm. Its still a little awkward, but Sam will appreciate your honesty which somehow has a powerful effect of disarming the situation. Finally, you say, lets try that again and give each a firm handshake. Now things are finally getting back to normal. Then using your skills from stage 1, you start a brief conversation with Sam to end things on the right note. After that, you move on. Imagine instead, you all collided and it was awkward and neither of you addressed the situation honestly. You would probably be hung up on the interaction for the next several minutes. Instead you were honest and that allowed for things to pan out relatively normally. &amp;#x200B; **Become More Relaxed** Finally, you must learn how be relaxed and at ease with yourself. Think about it. If you dont seem relaxed or at ease, how will the person youre talking to feel okay? Becoming more relaxed is ultimately a very physical rather than mental practice. First, work on your face. Talk to yourself in the mirror every day (Im serious) and notice how you talk. How does your mouth move? How do our eyes move? You need to figure out what makes you most comfortable and what you personally like the most when youre talking as this is going to be how you present yourself to other people. Create a consistent pattern with your face that you feel good with and this will translate over when you talk to others. As long as you feel good about it, you will naturally look relaxed. Next, practice your speech. How do you like your vocal tonality? Record it if necessary so you can get an accurate sound. Do you have any quirks in your speech that sound foreign to you? Are you comfortable with those speech quirks? Much like your face, find a consistent pattern you are comfortable with. Finally, practice your body language. While you should always work to keep your back straight (as thats just healthy for your back), everything else about your body language needs to seem like you are in the utmost comfort. People often make a big deal about how you need to do X, Y, and Z for perfect body position. What ultimately ends up happening is the person looks insecure and that theyre forcing something. Instead, practice once again the positions you feel most comfortable in. The key here is comfortability and consistency. &amp;#x200B; # Side Piece: Making Conversations more Enjoyable *Aside: This section is not necessary for mastering stage 2.* Much like the previous stage, we will again explore more ways of making conversations more enjoyable. Before I continue I want to take a step back to better clarify the point of this section. You can think of ""making conversations more enjoyable"" the social equivalent of becoming better at stretching in the exercise world. While we've already learned how to converse endlessly (Stage 1) which is a requirement for advancing up the stages, that doesn't mean we can't make conversing more enjoyable and therefore better. Similarly, it's a requirement that you know how to stretch properly before doing any serious exercise or else you will get injured. However, it's always good to learn how to stretch better as that better reduces your chances of injury the same way making your conversational skills better makes your chance of social injury diminish to nearly 0. This time, we'll ironically be talking about how one way to make conversations more enjoyable is learning when to ***not*** have them. People oftentimes make the mistake of trying to open up deep conversation during high energy situations. For example, if youre at a loud, noisy club thats not the time to try to open up to your romantic interest of the night that you read Harry Potter the night before. Write down in your social journal times in which you thought someone opened up a conversation at a time you really wished they didnt. Every week look at your list and internalize them so that you dont make the same mistake. &amp;#x200B; # Conclusion That wraps up this stage. For the eager wondering what is coming next here is a breakdown of all the stages: [Stage 1: Make People Talk](URL ***Stage 2: Make People Feel at Ease (That's this article!)*** Stage 3: Make People Laugh Stage 4: Make People Feel Important Stage 5: Make People Feel a Part of Something Great Stage 6: Make People Respect You Stage 7: Make People Love You &amp;#x200B; Until next time!"

117,vulnerability,socialskills,You're Probably Hiding Some of Your Best Conversational Material,433,8nrshr,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8nrshr/youre_probably_hiding_some_of_your_best/,2018-06-01 23:16:05,"For seventeen years, Ive studied the best conversationalists and what they do differently. One of the habits I discovered was that the best conversationalists dont hide their flaws and imperfectionsthey embrace them. They are the first to admit their weaknesses. The path to social confidence and more interesting conversations starts with social vulnerability. Think about the person or people who make you feel comfortable. Likable and easy\-going people are usually comfortable in their own skin and have embraced their character flaws. They are okay being a little vulnerable. These likable people are the first to admit that they arent perfect and are happy to laugh at their personal quirks. Theyre quick to admit funny mistakes or episodes of forgetfulness. They use their flaws to their advantage. *Think about that for a minute.* The best conversationalists realize that their weaknesses and insecurities can actually make some interesting conversation material. Not many people want to listen to a braggart rave about how well he did on a test or how many new sports cars he owns. But everyone enjoys hearing about the time you made a fool of yourself at that partyespecially if you can laugh about it after the fact. Your flaws subconsciously make others feel better about themselves, as well. The end result is that people will often like you *more* after you expose an inner flaw or embarrassing experience, even of the small or trivial variety. Check out the following example: ***Nate:*** *Wow, thats an awesome tattoo.* ***Lisa:*** *Thanks, my husband George actually drew it.* ***Nate:*** *Really? Thats cool.* Not a very interesting interaction, huh? Now lets look at the conversation if Nate had admitted a weakness. ***Nate:*** *Really? I wish I could draw like that. I could probably draw a 3D cube, but thats about it. My skills dont get much beyond cubesand half the time I even mess up the 3D part!* The conversation took a much more interesting and playful turn because Nate admitted something he was bad at. These types of statements are also great to toss around in order to paint your self\-portrait with a little shade of humility. Look at a few more examples: *I never knew/experienced \_\_\_\_\_.* *I didnt expect/think Id find \_\_\_\_\_.* *I never knew there were \_\_\_\_\_.* *I was expecting \_\_\_\_\_, not \_\_\_\_\_.* *Trust me, you don't want me involved with \_\_\_\_\_.* *I'm the last person you want \_\_\_\_\_.* *I know absolutely nothing about \_\_\_\_\_.* Think about your favorite comediantheres a good chance that he relies on a heavy dose of self\-deprecating humor. Its one of the most common comedic techniques. A few years ago, I was riding in a car with my new boss, and she asked me how to find our destination. I responded rather bluntly and with some embellishment, Ill be honest, Im navigationally impairedIm probably the worst person to ask for directions. If I say turn left, youre probably better off turning right! She quickly admitted that she, too, was horrible at navigating, and we both had a few laughs over who was worse! It was a good bonding experience. When you leverage mistakes instead of fear them, mistakes can often lead to fun and engaging tangents rather than awkward moments. "
118,vulnerability,socialskills,Communication &amp; Vulnerability (from Models by Mark Manson),1,8nymcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8nymcz/communication_vulnerability_from_models_by_mark/,2018-06-02 15:50:42,"Source: Models by Mark Manson When most men hear the word vulnerability, their immediate reaction is to associate it with weakness. Men have a lot of negative assumptions about the idea of being more vulnerable and opening up to their emotions. Dont worry, Im not going to have you hold hands around a campfire with some wimpy support group and cry about your spirit crystal or share stories about your power animal. Also, vulnerability does not mean sharing sob stories to get attention. I want you to think of vulnerability in a more broad way. **Making yourself vulnerable doesnt just mean being willing to share your fears or insecurities. It can mean putting yourself in a position where you can be rejected, saying a joke that may not be funny, asserting an opinion that may offend others, introducing yourself to a group of people you dont know, telling a woman that you like her and want to date her. All of these things require you to stick your neck out on the line emotionally in some way. Youre making yourself vulnerable when you do them. Being open with your insecurities paradoxically makes you more confident and charismatic around others.** In this way, vulnerability represents a form of power, a deep and subtle form of power. Its courageous, even. A man whos able to make himself vulnerable is saying to the world, Screw the repercussions; this is who I am, and I refuse to be anyone else. Think of it this way, there are two men. One stands tall, looks straight ahead. Looks people in the eye when he speaks to them. Says what he thinks and is comfortable if some people disagree with him. When he makes a mistake, he shrugs it off and apologizes if necessary. When he sucks at something, he admits it. Hes unafraid to express his emotions, even if that means he gets rejected because of them sometimes. He has no problem moving on to people who dont reject him, but instead like him for who he is. The second man hunches over, his eyes dart around and he is unable to look someone in the eye without getting uncomfortable. He puts on a cool persona that is always aloof. He performs. He avoids saying things that may upset others, and sometimes even lies to avoid conflict. Hes always trying to impress people. When he makes a mistake, he tries to blame others or pretend like it didnt happen. He hides his emotions and will smile and tell everyone hes fine even when hes not. Hes scared to death of rejection. And when he is rejected, it sends him reeling, angry, and desperate to find a way to win back the affection of the person who doesnt like him. Which one is more vulnerable? Which one is more comfortable with himself? Vulnerability is the path of true human connection and becoming a truly attractive person. As psychologist Robert Glover once said, Humans are attracted to each others rough edges. Show your rough edges. Stop trying to be perfect. Expose yourself and share yourself without inhibition. Take the rejections and lumps and move on because youre a bigger and stronger man. But opening yourself up to vulnerability, training yourself to become comfortable with your emotions, with your faults, and with expressing yourself without inhibitions doesnt happen overnight. But its a process, and at times, a grueling one. If you go around saying and doing whatever you want in the name of expressing yourself, this will not work because your intentions say that you are here not to connect to people, but rather simple self\-gratification. **Vulnerability is not a technique or tactic. It is a way of being. Its not something you learn, its a mindset you practice. If you ever find yourself thinking, That didnt work, or This doesnt work, then you are doing this on superficial level.** For example, If you tell a woman that shes beautiful only because you think itll give you a better chance of sleeping with her, then amazingly, she will not be very flattered. So the catch is that everything you say must be as authentic as possible. Your statements towards must be unconditional, otherwise its not really being vulnerable. Theres no shortcut. There are no tricks. You say it because you mean it and mean it because you say it. The more nervous it makes you, the better, because it means youre being authentic and making yourself vulnerable. **TL;DR \- Vulnerability means expressing yourself unconditionally and being open and comfortable with the idea of rejection/facing awkward situations/accepting your insecurities**"

120,vulnerability,socialskills,On the allure of social experiments and pranks (long crosspost from my blog),1,8q50h6,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/8q50h6/on_the_allure_of_social_experiments_and_pranks/,2018-06-11 09:51:53,"Ive recently been on a bit of a rediscovery of youtube pranksters, and Ive noticed how often I have a huge smile on my face during and after watching these sorts of videos. Its captivating stuff and in my experience they get you in a social mood much quicker than any music or movies! It got me thinking... what exactly makes social experiments/pranks so incredibly popular and feel-good? The common thread in all of these types of videos are of course, experimenting with social interaction. We all more or less follow implicit social rules that have been inculcated in us from a very early age. Dont talk to strangers, be polite, be vulnerable with those closest to you only, etc. etc., and very seldom do we really try to break the social mould, or if we do, its usually thanks to alcohol and in an environment where people are already socially pliable and wanting to interact in more open ways to begin with. If one buys the idea that cinema, art, and narrative projects us into a world where we can feel first-hand like the protagonist on the screen, then from this lens, watching social experiments allows us to adopt for a short time a socially liberated persona who isnt held back by social judgement or rejection. As far as our brains are concerned, when we watch these videos it is us ourselves who are pushing through the common fear of social rejection/judgement through risky or vulnerable social action. As so many of these pranks and social experiments have shown, these risky or vulnerable efforts very often either produce positive results or we learn that the negative judgement or evaluation, if it does occur, isnt nearly as scary as we were led to believe. The latter is evident in pranks like Vitalys Disturbing the Peace series, where he would do things like bring a blender into a library and make a smoothie, or watch porn with the headphones jack removed. Hes being judged harshly, sure, but we feel good and laugh anyways, especially when we realize that there is nothing imminently dangerous and high stakes here, a realization that requires seeing the responses of the strangers at the butt of the prank (side note: there is no better way to ensure your prank falls flat than not including the reactions so that the audience cant successfully connect the risky/vulnerable event to the unexpected outcome, in other words, social ambiguity is highly undesirable). Now you might counter, I see, but one of the best ways to get views on these prank videos is to make content that is continually pushing the boundary from fun to dangerous and unsafe, like doing x,y, or z in the hood or bomb pranks. And to that I would say that the above is still in effect in those cases, its just that we are given the extra kick of having our unconscious expectations temporarily confirmed WHILE being in on the prank (oh shit see I knew this would go bad) followed up with a highly desirable resolution (the classic Its just a prank bro! Its a prank!). Im sure theres also a nice helping of schadenfreude mixed in too. Now if we have set up within us an expectation that risky or vulnerable behavior (especially towards strangers, which the vast majority of these pranks are directed towards) will lead to social evaluation and judgement, then seeing these responses is of course, an unexpected response. What feel-good neurotransmitter is associated with unexpected rewards? Dopamine. You got it. Thats not to say thats the only one at play here, serotonergic activity is associated with status in a social hierarchy, so you can be sure thats contributing to positive feelings when youre vicariously experiencing social success, as well as oxytocin in those moments of vulnerable connection between two strangers (Im reminded of many of angrypicnics videos of successful pick up attempts where the initial guitar serenading and compliments are extremely successful and the girls are blushing and flabbergasted after he leaves). The fears these youtubers are capitalizing on have evolutionary roots of course, social evaluation and harsh judgement in a hunter-gatherer setting thousands of years ago could spell the difference between your inclusion or exclusion from the tribe (aka... death). These videos are a bit of a cultural reprogramming of this hardwired high stakes instinct to preserve our social reputation, and nothing feels better than voluntarily subjecting yourself to those things that you fear and overcoming them, this is at the heart of one of the most successful techniques in psychotherapy - exposure therapy. If there is any moral lesson to these videos, its that social risk taking and vulnerability isnt nearly as high stakes as we think, and the 'social reality' out there is waiting to respond to any open efforts.

There are times when I can just click with people and I don't experience any issues in terms of reactions to their vulnerability towards me. Other times, when someone opens up to me and says something like, ""My dad just died"" and I break out in a little chuckle (real example). I don't sincerely think it's funny that the person's dad died, I think it's more just I didn't know how to react or when they brought it up it was just such a 180 in the conversation and I was laughing at the awkwardness. Either way, out of the numerous times I react, how I feel is incorrect, I don't think it's ever made a lasting impression on how I'm perceived but my self esteem plummets and I feel like a jerk while the conversation already moved on. Some background, I'm 24 and worked in customer service or, at least in environments were social skills are key to success in the role, for about 7 years now - so I don't believe lack of practicing social interactions is the problem. I don't consider myself to have social anxiety, as I'm okay with just being myself - although, on the 1/5 conversations that turn awkward, sometimes I beat myself up for it but this never stops me from talking to people. Is this just something that's normal, to react before you think sometimes? Or is it something that's abnormal for someone my age and I should look into analyzing my conversations and trying to determine the root cause?"

He's been in the friends group longer than I have, and also he only ever yells (not exaggerating, he yells everything he says), and so he has more sway over the group than I do. He usually makes short, quick remarks that insult me. Example: &gt;**Me, to the whole group of friends:** Ooh, I've got a good story. So this morning my mom was driving and we got into a car crash- &gt;**1, interrupting me:** Hehe, wow, loser. I just continued talking because I currently don't have very quick wit, and I knew that ignoring him was the second best way to diffuse negativity. This is also before I told them that nobody was hurt and the cars were fine. **2** is a verysmart straight A student that has limited social skills (not trying to roast, I'm just being honest.) He's the least popular of our group; at the best of times he's funny and interesting, at the worst he's yelling at people for being too loud in a lunch room filled with 200+ people. He is never polite when he needs something. Even 1 would say ""Hey, I don't know whose bag this is but I'm moving it"", but 2 elbows people (not even just me) when they get too close, and punches people (hard) when they say a shitty joke. His sense of humor is mostly really cheesy puns (not complaining) and calling me stupid with no cleverness at all. Example: &gt;**2:** *says a really cheesy joke* &gt;**One of my friends:** *plays up his reaction, laughs really loudly* (laughing weirdly is an in-joke in our friends group) &gt;**Me, playing off of my friend's reaction in a deadpan tone:** I don't get it. &gt;**2:** Don't worry, you're too dumb to get it. I think he mostly goes after me with these jokes because most of the other people in our friends group are ""un-roastable"" while in the past I've played off of insults with jokes because I didn't know how to react. (My strategy of just ignoring is from the past few weeks). I'd also like to point out that both of these events were just from today. I've thought about a few strategies for dealing with negativity in general, but I don't like a few because I want to be more assertive: *A.* Talking to them about what they say. It *might* work with 2, but 1 would only do it more now that he's gotten a serious reaction from me. *B.* just ignore them. Current strategy. *C.* Ask ""What are you hoping to accomplish from saying that?"" I like this one because it's assertive but I have absolutely no clue how either of them will respond. *D.* Saying their name and looking at them with a disappointed face, before looking away and shaking my head. And not in a humorous way. After that I would: *E.* Immediately change the subject or continue speaking. Again, this is passive and I'm kind of already doing this. Combining it with C could be interesting. *F.* Just get over it. This was my strategy for over a year. I'm done being a pushover. *G.* Cut them out entirely. This wouldn't work at all, because if I do that then I lose my entire friends group (which is amazing aside from these 2 people). This was mostly just venting, but I'd also like to know if anyone else has a good way of dealing with this? **TL;DR:** 1 Is /r/IamVeryBadass, 2 is /r/IamVerySmart. Both direct most of their negativity towards me and I need to tell them it's not okay in an assertive but not aggressive way."
123,vulnerability,socialskills,"Kind of a long, incoherent post about my inability to form the kind of friendships I want (xpost /r/relationships)",7,7zzhwt,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7zzhwt/kind_of_a_long_incoherent_post_about_my_inability/,2018-02-25 08:00:49,"Before I start, let me give a little background on myself. I'm a 30-year-old man of South Asian descent. I was born and raised in Northern CA, which is where I currently live. My parents grew up emphasizing academic and professional success, and they considered any social or emotional problems I had - like not having friends or being lonely - as minor trivialities, like not being able to beat the final boss of a video game. On top of that, I went through a few pretty traumatic years in elementary school which, IMO, really affected my social skills in high school and onwards. No sexual abuse or anything, but just...not fitting in, being picked on, kids just being nasty to each other, and parents not really giving a shit about any of those things as long as I had good grades. This post might be a bit rambly and incoherent, and I apologize in advance for that. Im trying to put into words some very deep and convoluted issues. Its all kind of hard for me to unpack, to be honest, so please bear with me. It might seem a bit stream-of-consciousness-y. So Ill just try to dive into it. I seem to have trouble connecting with people. I hate using the word connecting for the same reason I hate words like intimacy, vulnerability, and relationship - they give me the warm and fuzzies, and I wish I was better at them, but they dont seem to have a real, concrete, dictionary definition. Theyre all very vague words, IMO. But I think that connecting seems to describe the problem Im having the best. Ive always had trouble really fitting in with groups and forming meaningful friendships. I have friends, sure, and I always have. And, yeah, I guess you could say Ive been part of groups or cliques. But Ive always kind of been on the periphery. And the friendships Ive formed always seem to be pretty one-sided and shallow. honestly wonder if I should refer to my friends as friends (in quotes) or merely as acquaintances. It just seems like Im easily forgettable. Like, if Im not actively interacting with someone (in real life or online), its as if they forget that I even exist. I mean, I often think about my friends. Not in a longing or creepy way, but just replaying memories in my head, thinking about what they said, etc. And I really am starting to doubt that they ever even think about me. Dont get me wrong - when Im actually interacting with them in person, it tends to be pretty fun. But after those interactions (like, say, when I go home from a night of drinking after kickball), it seems like Im the only one who seems to remember or care about them. Sometimes I wonder, if I just stopped showing up to the events where I meet up with my friends (weekly pub trivia and weekly kickball), how many of them would notice, care, or wonder what happened to me? I look at these friendships and groups of friends where people text each other all the time and seem to always be on each others minds and wonder what it is that theyre doing that Im not doing. I really wish I could get some kind of feedback from my friends. But I dont want to hassle those friends by bringing up kind of a heavy topic. I mean, I think that one of the few things I have to offer in a friendship is the fact that I dont burden people by asking them these types of questions. I keep it light and drama-free. I havent had a deep conversation about a serious topic - like my loneliness, whats bothering me, being depressed, etc. - with a friend in over a decade. I used to talk about these things with friends in high school, and looking back, I realize I must have been a real pain in the ass. I honestly feel quite guilty about it. The way I see it, my friends dont reach out to me to talk, which must be a sign that they dont want me to reach out to them to talk, right? Reciprocal respect for boundaries and space. Besides, if I ask a friend if they forget that I exist when Im not talking to them, what are they going to say? Yes, the only time Im aware of your existence and give a shit about you is when youre standing 2 feet in front of me? Of course theyll say the polite and friendly thing instead of being honest. But the problem is that this leads to kind of a vicious cycle. Im doing (or not doing) certain things that lead people to not want to reach out to me, initiate conversations, hang out with me, etc. I wonder what those things are, but to find out, Id have to bug my friends, which would make them like me less. So I dont ask anyone for any feedback, and I continue with these shallow friendships that leave me feeling lonely. In fact, it's gotten to the point where, when I'm in social settings, I start to withdraw and become closed off because of my depression, anxiety, and frustration with these friendships. I guess I'm basically thinking that, since I'm never going to get any closer to these people I'm having fun with, there's no point in actually interacting with them at all. So Im wondering what I should do. Honestly, Ive been quite depressed about this for a long time, and its led me to really hate myself and believe that Im justnot supposed to have meaningful friendships. It really does cause me quite a bit of distress and pain. And Ive come to the conclusion that Im not meant to date, because if my friends dont want to reach out to me or start conversations with me, how the hell am I ever going to get a woman interested in me? If my friends dont seem to want to initiate platonic interactions with me, then theres no way a woman would ever want to initiate romantic or sexual interactions with me, right? I dont know. Sometimes I wish I could get some kind of coaching where someone shadows me when Im at my pub trivia or at my social kickball league and then give me pointers and tips the following day (sort of like Queer Eye). But this issue is really starting to take a toll on me. When people in their late teens and early 20s post about this kind of stuff, the typical response is hey, youre still young, youve got plenty of time to figure this stuff out. Well I really thought Id have figured this stuff out by now, but I havent. Do I just need to wait another 10 years or is there actually a problem that needs to be actively addressed? Is the solution some vague bullshit like be more vulnerable? Before anyone asks, I already see a therapist and a psychiatrist on alternating weeks, and Im also on two medications. And yeah, sure, seeing them kind of helps, but I think that there are certain things that friends can do that therapists just cant, and vice versa. I dont seem to be making any real, meaningful progress with them. It just seems like I meet with one of them once a week, unload whatevers been bugging me, go home, and repeat the cycle. Anyway, sorry again if this is sort of incoherent. If I dont get many responses, I may delete this, try to reword it, and post it again later. "
124,vulnerability,socialskills,How do you practice vulnerability and being open with others?,6,82przc,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/82przc/how_do_you_practice_vulnerability_and_being_open/,2018-03-08 03:57:31,"I [32F] recently had some experiences that made me really realize how much I keep myself guarded. Little back story: I've been to so many schools and lived with many families that I tend to take a ""I won't know you for more than a year"" approach when I meet people, so I don't know how to be open from the get go. I hated people digging into my life when growing up so I do not ask questions that I feel like are digging into others' lives. It's not that I don't care, I just take the stance that if they want to share something, then they will, and I am always willing to listen and help. I am in the process of leaving my ex. We were together for 7 years, but have been ""separated but living together"" for the last year or so. We do have two small children. Because we are still living together (hopefully not for too much longer), I am still extremely guarded. He was very emotionally abusive, and while he has learned a lot and changed for the better, it's just not something I want to be part of anymore. I can feel a cage around my heart, so to speak. While I can be honest and tell people intimate details, I just don't feel like I am very vulnerable and open to anyone, including friends. What I want to work on myself with right now is the opening up, having deep and meaningful conversations and really prepping myself to have a good next relationship, whenever that may be. Any ideas, direction, or even some ""practice runs"" if anyone wants to message would very appreciated. **TL:DR** How to become more vulnerable, open, and have really close friendships and next relationship."
125,vulnerability,socialskills,The extensive toolkit to turn casual contacts into new friends!,0,7rsapa,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/7rsapa/the_extensive_toolkit_to_turn_casual_contacts/,2018-01-21 06:00:16,"New people, new chances! So I just started a new job at a big engineering firm. From day one I try to connect with everyone I meet. Confident that all encounters will go well. Hopefully, I can make a few new friends among my colleagues. Just like all the awesome people I befriended at my last job. As we have lunch, slurping some cheap goulash soup, I try to go to a deeper level. But my newfound lunchmates were reluctant, rather discussing the weather. The weather?!? Fuck that! Only then I realize, I dont know any of these people, not really, nor do they know me. Despite being surrounded by people, it feels lonely. **How do you go from just knowing people to being friends?** Its not as easy as I thought. I start remembering the long arduous process of befriending my former colleagues. Shit thats true, that did take a long time. Or any of my other friends, all gradual processes. Fun though! Colleagues are one example. But going from acquaintances to friends is ambiguous. Often we just dont know how to take superficial contact further to deep friendship. Especially as we get older. Playground socializing is so easy compared to when adulting. As a four-year-old, you throw sand at some kid, say sorry, share a popsicle and friendship in 5 minutes. A nice four-step process worth of a BuzzFeed article. But why isnt it that easy as adults? It would be nice if you could just go up to people and say: ""Hey lets be friends"". Then hang out and do fun stuff! But that somehow never works, Even in your late twenties and thirties, there are fewer opportunities for friendship. It even takes longer to create them. But no matter what age, we all need friends. It is just nice to be invited by people you feel comfortable with. To connect and spill your heart. But as you struggle to make new friends, it can feel like you are destined to be forever alone. There are many people having this problem. It is widespread in modern society. In the UK for example, 2.5 million men dont have any close friends. It sucks. Loneliness hurts and is detrimental to our health! Hurray for individualization and social media! Well done breaking up our communities. Not only 80s kids (old people) have this problem  the next generation is having trouble as well. A world of anxiety and suffering. **Thanks, so now what?** It is time to act! Time to build profound friendships! How to deepen relationships! You are deeply shaped by your social environment. It is part of you. We are wired for friendships. If your social life is good, you feel good! It is the greatest factor in longevity. Hanging out with buddies, laughing, bonding, supporting each other. It is awesome and helps you live up to a 100 years. Sure we can talk about empathy circuits, oxytocin release, and dopamine rewards. But we dont need to dive deep into the science. You know that having friends just make you feel good. So, you dont many friends yet? Dont despair! **You can make friends all your life!** Developing the skill to do so at any time. But lets start now! Friendships dont just spontaneously arise out of thin air. They take time to mold. Effort! A long, but often fun-filled process. If you hear *""friendship""*, you might imagine a one-dimensional connection. But a bond between people exists of multiple strings. Shared experiences, similar believes, enjoyment of company, shared goals. You name it. Many connections make up a strong bond. If you know someone a bit, you have a few small connections. To create a friendship, you need to strengthen and expand your mesh of connectivity. So how do you create new connections? **You reach out and be open to others.** Psychologist John Gottman explained this in the world of marriage in the form of emotional bids. It applies to friendships as well. A ""bid"" is a request, an invitation to connect. The reaching out. This can be a smile, a question, or an invitation to go gaming. You reach out, if people are open to it and accept, you create a small connection. Another thread in the bond of friends. And vice versa  if people reach out, be open and accept! Stop doing this and friendship erodes. Just like a physical structure  time and the elements will wear it down. In the beginning of a friendship, dont overreach with the scale of your bids, you might scare people off. Even if you mean well, dont offer to help someone move apartments if you know them for 2 weeks, that is overreaching. People are taken aback by the level of intimacy that is assumed. Take it easy, and build from small to big. From a smile, to having drinks, to playings sports, to in the end being someones best man! By **offering and accepting small connections** your create a cycle of increasing trust. Forming a deep friendship. But someone needs to give the first push. Its hard, but **you need to take initiative!** So, step by step, with increasing impact, and on my own initiative? Yes! What does that mean? Can you I a plan? Yes! Yes, you can! It wont be your 5-step guide or 5-year strategy plan. But a detailed look at what behavior it takes. **A toolkit of strategies and behavior,** to go from just knowing someone to a deep friendship. **1. Put away your screens of distraction** It is old skool, but establishing a connection doesnt need fancy hardware. If you meet people in the real world **your phone is a distraction**, especially when talking one-on-one. So put away your devices. Silent mode and out of sight. Yes, you will have that hand jerk reaching for your phone. But resist temptation, especially if things get tense, boring or awkward  that is the time to pay attention! These rough spots are where you really get to know each other. You need to be there in the moment, not bailing to ***happy-joy-joy-digital-wonderland.*** **Focus on the people in front of you!** A phone on the table, even top-down, already distracts people. Constantly aware of potential interruption. Any moment it could ring, so you never are really invested in the ongoing activity. It shows you are not interested in the person in front of you! How can you make friends that way? Its against your impulses  but do this to truly connect. So bye bye phone. **2. Eye to an eye  Look people in the face** It is important to look at people while communicating. Especially focus on face and eyes. A lot of people find this hard. But **expressions show how people feel** and what they think. It is intuitive. The skill comes more natural to some, but it is how you develop the finer details of social skills. Everybody can learn this. What and how you communicate affects people. If you only type and send, you will never truly know what the effect is. It is scary if you are inexperienced because you have a lot of inner reactions. Fear, anxiety, insecurity. Most come from ambiguity. You dont understand how someone reacts because you dont get their expressions. So practice will make it easier! Start looking people in the eyes, so you can start understanding  on a cognitive and an intuitive level. Understanding will create more comfortable dialogue. Most expression and their meaning are hard-wired anyway  you will catch up. The rest you learn on the job. As you get better youll relax, in turn, others feel more at ease  and the upward cycle starts. **3. Show genuine interest** Show real interest. Interest from the depth of your heart. Is someone not interesting to you, maybe reconsider making him your friend. Assuming this is someone you already know a bit. You can guess what she is interested in. If not! That is the first thing to find out. What are her hopes and dreams? What do they do for fun? But more importantly, **ask people WHY?** **Go deep** you want to find out why they like water skiing. Because shes been on the water since she was 5? Or her parents never let her do anything exciting? **You dont know  find out!** These type of bids are really great for shared emotional connection. Dont stop with just one why question, ask a few in a row. But learn when people dont want to answer anymore. Might be your connection doesnt merit that level of trust (yet!). People love talking about themselves. It makes them feel good and you get to understand them better. An extra little trick to make people feel good  **use their name** in conversation. People adore the sound of their own name, their whole identity is wrapped around that word. If you can use that magic word in a positive way. Awesome! (Dont be the fool who overdoes this, people notice!) As you ask, give plenty of attention to people (remember no phone). **Listen well**, so you can use stories and facts as anchor points for next time you meet. Displaying your lasting interest. Afterwards, dont forget to reach out once in a while. Send a text with a **small update** on your part, and some **interest in them.** Have they finally finished dark souls? How are their exams going? You name it. Show that youve listened and reach out with a bid. **4. Ooze out positivity** Next element, positivity. **Starting with a smile.** The easiest disarming gesture. It can mean so many things: ""Its ok""  Im enjoying this  ha!, you name it. Cracking that smile to connect is hella useful. Being upbeat is important. Nobody wants to hang out with an emotional black hole sucking up all energy. Neither do you! So dont be the one who is negative all the time. **Bring your upbeat self!** Dont drag your annoyances and sorrows with you. You may have them, they may be real, but as you are making friends, leave them at home! Building a friendship is mostly fun. Dont be that guy who is addicted to his negative emotions! Need to get yourself in that positive vibe? Do what always helps you, go for a run, play video games, or do something artistic. Whatever gets you out of that funk. Trust me, regular workouts help! If you are unable to get out of a chronic negative mindset. Whatever the reason, find a way to fix that first. Its pretty hard to make new friends if you feel depressed. The irony might be, that you feel better if you have friends. But find your healthy positive self on your own first. **You are probably a great guy!** So get your shit in check and **bring all of your awesome self!** The world is eager to meet that great side of you! **5. Touchdown  high fives and more** Humans dont only communicate verbally. A major part is touching as well. What does that mean? You can start shaking hands, high fiving, bro-fisting, hugging and kissing everybody! Alright, do it with at the right time! Build the right level of connection first. Hookup culture teaches to go for the touch. Strangely, it is also a good step in building friendships, just a different kind of touch. In the West, we can be a bit clinical about it. But it is really simple. Raise your hand for that high five, or hover your fist in the air. Boom! Connect! **Touch creates intimacy.** Learn as you go what is the right move with whom. It is different in every culture and kinda bond you create. But most of the time a handshake or high five will do the trick. As you get to know your new mate better, a good tight hug can come in. It does **take some practice** to find out when what intimacy is warranted. But we often err too much on the safe side. Learn to go with your guts and conviction. **6. Sharing is caring** Yes, Sesame Street was not some crazy socialist paradise. These critters, for all their singing and dancing, got their basic principles right! Amongst them the power of sharing. Sharing is bonding. Most primal is **the act of sharing food**. A profoundly human gesture. It may not feel like much in times of affluence, but for most of history, people were lacking ample food. Sharing with a stranger to befriend, is sharing something valuable, something you need to survive. A very powerful gesture! But you can share more. Loan someone a pen, share your couch to crash on, let someone use your car. More ways to open up, more bids to connect. Also notice when others share with you, how you feel deep appreciation. Besides that, there is a strong feeling of reciprocity. You give, so I give. This is a deep-seated instinct to reciprocate giving. That is the type of collaboration that makes us survive as a group. Besides items, you should **share stories.** To share and relate on an emotional level. What funny or interesting experience did you have? Or what have others experienced? What did they do? Share how you relate to their stories. How they made you think or feel. Ask more, then go on and tell your own experience regarding that (or similar) subject. There is much to share and connect over. **7. Show vulnerability and relate** Segwaying nicely into sharing your feelings. Sharing items and stories already display vulnerability. But over time take it a notch further. Ideally, you have built up a bit of trust. But **the most confident people show vulnerability easily.** Because they know it creates deeper bonds. Despite their flaws, they feel secure about themselves. The illusion that you just have to be brave, though and cool  and not vulnerable limits our ability to connect. You throw up walls instead of building bridges. Being brave and afraid can coexist. Showing your fear can be a profoundly brave act. This opening up is a profound way of showing trust in the other! By giving trust you gain trust. It is scary of course, there is an inherent risk. Sometimes you have to take a leap of faith, the trust comes later. But it can backfire. If you are not used to this, create an initial steady bond first. But later **deepen it by sharing more of who you really are.** Being vulnerable is something else than being needy. Being needy is showing weakness and expecting something in return. Comforting, a favor, pity, you name it. Being vulnerable is showing weakness and accepting it. Not expecting anything in return, you just show who you are underneath societal masks. Believe me, showing vulnerability can take any form: explaining your feelings, talking what porn you fap to, admitting you actually liked Jar Jar Binks (gutsy!). Also, **share gratitude together.** Tell people you appreciate them being there, how you like hanging out. That drinking beer and eating pizza is better with them around. Tell them about that positive vibe you guys are building. That doesnt have to be sappy, a good: ""Bro, that was an awesome day!"" will do! **8. Experiences shit together** So there is reminiscing about events. But an even better way is to **create a shared experience.** A good shared story is a topic to talk about for years. To keep reinvigorating that bond. But just hanging out also counts. Just regularly go do stuff together to make new friends! So start having tea, play sports or do a weekly DnD session. Go build a fort together, visit a concert and have fun. Live those experiences together. Want to go to the next level. The very best bonding is **sharing hardship together.** Doing though shit. A bit of suffering needs to be involved. Shared pain brings people together. Go for a 3-day hike or collaborate on a competitive hackathon. Frustration, pain, conflict but coming out on top together! **9. Always under maintenance!** So if you followed most of the advice, you have built a deep friendship! Awesome, congrats. Now you gotta keep it up. Make sure you keep doing these things. Regularly meet up, share shit together, do shit together and show vulnerability from time to time. Every friendship needs another level of maintenance, dont forget your buddies and keep up to date! Dont rest on your laurels when youve made a friend. Keep repeating all of the above. Learn to **be considerate** as well. When its someones birthday, come by with a bottle of wine. But also at random moments, just initiate to hang out. A friendship will be driven by your new buddy and you. And hey, in some friendships you will take most of the initiative, some you will take the least. For this, you can use your digital tools. Occasionally **send updates** and an open question to see how others are doing. ""Hey, I was busy with this and that"" ""How are things on your end?"" Keep doing that and you will make **friends for life!** **How to friend?** So, easy right? Haha, like anything, this too will take practice. It sounds simple. But there is a lot of social nuance in real life. For some people, it comes more natural  but with enough practice, you can make and deepen friendships just as easily! Take this guide, but dont overthink all of this. These aspects are important. But dont checklist them and tick them off compulsively. **Its a toolkit  it is your challenge to find out with whom and when to use what.** So sure you will make a few mistakes, everybody does. But that doesnt really matter, it is a learning process. The number of birthdays I have forgotten, despite Facebook warnings hahaha. When making friends dont try to rush it. Realize making friendships takes time. Think weeks to months instead of days. Especially when you grow older. It takes years for truly deep bonds! **So what are you going to do?** You have an acquaintance you want to deepen your bond with? Someone loosely affiliated with? Next time you see them, or give them a call/text right away and suggest you guys go hang out together. Have some drinks, watch a movie, build a castle! Take your toolset along and build something cool. **Let me know how you are going to start making more friends.** ps. if you found this useful you can always [learn more here.](URL"

And whenever I voice my opinion or start conversations I find myself freaking out about it because what if someone hears me and hates everything I say/thinks I'm stupid? I have a solid group of friends that I feel comfortable around, plus two jobs at which my coworkers and customers generally like me, so all of this is coming as a shock to me. I guess I spent all my life making myself tolerable and mild instead of someone who stands out and attracts attention by being authentically themselves. Anybody have any pointers on how to get over this barrier? How do I learn to ""be myself"" in a constructive and likeable way without fearing vulnerability?"

As a result, I've repressed my emotions for many years, but I found that this has done me a lot of harm, both for my well-being and for the way it impacts how I interact with others. For example, I used to have a very tough working relationship with a lab partner for just 10 weeks. During that time, we had so many arguments, with me trying to rationalize his unreasonable complaints with me. It just bottled up, until one day while I was arguing on the phone with him, I just exploded, and threw out all my contained anger at him (while I was in the doctor's office). I feel that it's much better to try and express my emotions rather than repress them---but, I don't know how to really go about it. For a lack of better words, I'm afraid to show my emotions to people because of the vulnerability of it. If I were to find something enjoyable, I wouldn't smile my face off like I would if I was at home by myself. I would always imagine it would be like stripping yourself naked in front of people. But I'm wondering, is that actually the right way to go about it? Just being unafraid to show your emotions to people, regardless of situation or how people may perceive you? Or is there a more constructive approach to this? I'm interested and appreciate any advice you guys could give."
131,vulnerability,socialskills,3 strategies to start making friends IRL - even if you feel socially left behind [repost],319,6pombw,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/6pombw/3_strategies_to_start_making_friends_irl_even_if/,2017-07-27 01:03:37,"At the beginning of my college years, I was alone a lot, it sucked. I had this gaping hole in, but didnt know what to do with it. So I grinded away my time. Gaming, watching movies. Numbing myself. Feeling lonely. Yeah, I knew a few people. My stoner roommates for example. Cool guys, but not the relief from social isolation I craved. No offense stoners, but you are not that talkative while on a semester-long smoking binge :). A lot of people are familiar with periods of loneliness. Maybe even you. It can feel like everybody already has a great social life. But you are just left behind somehow. Why are you the one without normal social skills? Wouldnt it be awesome if you could have a group of cool friends? I sure needed a group of more active friends. Instead of watching Anchorman for the 5th time in a row, while blunts passed over dropping chemtrails. For you, it might be having a new cool group to hang out with. People to share and bond with. But where to start, if you know no one? I just moved to a new city, 12 years after first facing this dilemma. But now I know how to find and make friends! And it is fun! You want to know how? Yes! Great, you just might enjoy it as well. Lets start with three basic strategies to make friends. Even if you feel like you lag in this area, soon you will have great friends to hang out with! To eat nachos while watching a game, or grab a beer at Friday reviewing the week! Geeking out on the newest episode of One Piece. Whatever floats your boat. Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, some clarification. Being a friend is not a binary status. With on the one hand stranger and on the other side best friend. It is a spectrum. From; *not knowing, to stranger, to acquaintance, friend, good friends, best friends.* And everything in between. Making friends is strengthening a bond between you and others. Shifting them from stranger, slowly to the other side of the scale. Sometimes it is easy to move up. Sometimes it is hard! People slide back on the scale or shoot forward through shared hardships. It is not an exact science, but a skill you get the hang of. Making friends is hard to learn but easy to master. At first, there is a steep learning curve, but after you acquired the basics it is easy to **apply all the time.** Know what you want or like, but also be open minded when exploring these strategies. So lets get started, to make friends, you need people. Strangers. New people. **1. Where to go to meet new people** There are infinite places where people meet. People mines to harvest. Some will be better suited for you than others. Starting from scratch asks for some advantageous circumstances. These beneficial circumstances start with a **low threshold to enter.** So not an exclusive club, or a place with incomprehensible mores. But a place where it is easy to go, without any hurdles. Preferably **strangers are welcomed** as part of the culture. A dynamic place where new people come and go all the time. In fact, its a place that **looks for new people** all the time. Furthermore, it is centered around something **you like.** An activity, interest or passion. Where you can learn or share a common interest. Another plus is a **regular meetup.** A small commitment to get together creates a healthy social atmosphere. But one of the best features; its **open minded.** Full of people open to getting to know new people, ideas, and passions. Where you can be yourself. So where do you find these conditions? First the easiest option of all. There are some great digital ways to join (or even create) communities. You could look at your **local Facebook groups.** Search what is happening around your interests. Probably there are some groups open to you joining. Especially if they have regular meetups this is a great way to start. Alternatively **meetup.com** is great for these kinds of groups as well. It takes a bit of digging. But using this tool, you can easily find new peers. Ideally, you search for a modest sized get-together. Lets say you are interested in Quidditch. You search for local groups that do just that. Ask to join - chat a bit online, things click you can hang out. These are international examples, but undoubtedly there are local digital alternatives as well. As for the analog world, the most obvious place to meet new people is **at work, school or college.** A great opportunity. Here are potentially loads of unknown people, with similar (professional) interests. There can be an open atmosphere for new people. Look out for people you havent met yet at the office/class. You can also **join clubs or associations.** Think of sports, games, and culture. Join the newbie soccer team. Start going to philosophy meetings. Tag along with the theater guys. There are many societies that align with your interest. But even cooler, try to do something new! **Follow classes.** Learn to paint, or farm, or drive stick (Im looking at you Americans). Preferably something you do with a group. Where you and other rookies get the hang of a new skill. It is fun and interesting to bond over shared fuck ups! Failing and messing shit up together, but eventually learning something new, its fun! Or better yet, try **volunteering.** Go to your local soup kitchen, or help at the local marathon. Give yourself to a community and help loads of strangers. People will appreciate your effort, and your fellow volunteers are happy you join them in their endeavor. A low threshold, enriching environment to meet and help people. A last potential option is **reacquainting yourself with lost friends** or classmates. You kind a know each other already. Which makes reconnecting easier. It may feel a bit awkward, but if you used to have a good bond but you grew apart, there is no reason you cant reconnect. It is easy to find them on Facebook and reach out. Just ask if they are up for hanging out. Rebuild your friendship from there. As you see there are many options to find new potential friends. Find out what suits you best. Maybe you first try volunteering, but it doesnt work for you. Thats cool. When you join the local fantasy book club, you might just fit in perfectly! I dont know what works for you, but you can find out! Not everything will work for you. Dont beat yourself up about it. Just be flexible till you find a place that suits you best! These options are the easy places to start. As you grow more skilled, youll see you can make new friends almost anywhere. But first, try getting good. A big part of that is getting good at creating a relaxing atmosphere. **2. How to have comfortable interaction** To lay the foundation of friendship, you want to get to know each other in a pleasant way. Therefore you need two things. A comfortable setting and friendly interaction. There are different types of **friendly interaction.** Four basic and four complex ways. As you start out with people, focus on the simple interaction first. As a way to get to know each other. As your relationship grows, moving up on the friendship scale, more complex interaction will be more suitable. But start with simple gestures of friendship. Besides friendly interaction, there are more types. Like romantic or professional, but those are meant for different kinds of relationships. The *first basic* friendly interaction is **simple companionship**, by doing work together, acting out hobbies or facing challenges. Secondly, you can provide **small favors** to one another. You give so that I give. The basis of cooperative groups. **Exchange of information**, contacts, and communicating. Helping each other out by sharing what you know. Like recommending books, or referring them to your network. And of course, hanging out, **relaxing together** and having fun. Go watch a movie together or grab a coffee at your local caffeine dealer. All simple types of friendly interaction. The more complex gestures of friendship are mostly used later on. But sometimes they just so happen at the beginning of a new friendship. First elaborate gesture is **providing big favors.** Like helping to paint a new apartment. Or picking people up from the hospital after surgery. Furthermore **deep emotional support**, in times of crisis, but also sharing their euphoria. As a way of showing your commitment, support, and integrity in the friendship. Part of that is the **sharing of personal information** and stories. Showing vulnerability, while respecting and trying to the understand that of the other. Telling about your frustration, how you feel about being dumped or [how chickens scare you.](URL Last but not least, is **sharing an outlook on life.** You can differ in many ways, but all friendships have (developed) a mutual view on at least a few subjects. Dont think to binary about this. Its not like; week 1-4 is for small gestures week, 5-6 for big, and we are done. No no no. Try to let it come more natural. Find out what suits the moment best. Moving on to comfort. You want to feel at ease when making new friends. But meeting new people is distressing. I mean, you feel anxious meeting strangers right? It can feel like everything is at stake (spoiler: it isnt). It would be great if you could just feel comfortable. Well, most other people think so as well. They feel jittery when meeting new people, having a hard time to take the right stance. Thats why you focus on the **comfort of the other** when you meet. A lot of your discomfort stems from not knowing what others think right? (surprise, they feel that way as well.) If you can make **them feel comfortable**, that makes you more at ease. To feel relaxed, make other people feel relaxed. This starts by **initiating contact.** When you meet new people, say hi and **introduce yourself first.** Dont wait till someone else does this for you. Whenever we have a new employee at our company, some immediately introduce themselves, others wait for the interaction to somehow arise. New colleagues who are assertive gain a lot of social credit. It makes it easier for us to talk to the new guy as well! In any social environment start by introducing yourself. Its a big plus. After introductions, be genuinely interested. Cultivate a curiosity in other people. Ask questions concerning how they feel, what they do, how you can help them. Show interest in **who** the person in front of you is. And **why** they do what they do. Ask about **what interests them.** Focus on getting to know them. Dont worry too much about them getting to know you yet. People will ask eventually. No biggie. **Smile generously** throughout your conversation. Introduction? Smile! Questions? Smile! Smiling makes YOU feel more at ease. As well as your counterparts. No need for a Joker grin all the time, but give them your gentle opening up smile. Be helpful and kind to people. **Do small favors.** People really appreciate it. But dont be a pushover. Especially amongst men only groups, there can be some testing out. They look for how far you can be pushed. So do something nice when you want to do it. Not when you are constantly pressured to do it. But in most open communities this wont be much of a problem. **Show integrity** when talking to people. Dont use stories you hear, to one-up others. Just for some social credit. Neither lie just to make yourself look better. Be honest, upright and dont gossip. It might win you a few points in the beginning. But it will come and bite you in the ass. As you interact a while, share some stories of yourself. **Show some emotional depth.** A bit of vulnerability. Not too much when just meeting. It doesnt have to be a heart opening story. But displaying your humanity makes people relate to you better. It creates a bond. As you go out and meet people, pump yourself up. Be energized! **Excited about life** in general. Nobody is waiting for someone who is feeling blue. Or someone who brings drama to a group. Show you are a positive addition to a circle of friends. No whining, be grateful, but most of all, enjoy yourself! If you do this, you will have a great and relaxed time meeting new people. So whats next? Aaah yes. **3. Taking it from meeting to becoming friends** Time to escalate. Its so cool you have met new people. Which is already a victory. But we want to make friends :), not (only) meeting strangers. Before you move to the next step, gauge what kind of friendship they might want. Maybe they need a new close friend, but maybe they just want to be acquaintances. Not sure? If the place where youve met them has recurring events, meet them there a few times before moving on. (But dont postpone moving on indefinitely!) So you think someone wants to be friends? Then when the social event comes to a close, tell your new buddies you had a good time. Then just bluntly **ask them if they want to hang out** again. If so, ask their phone number so you guys can meet up. Just as simple as that. Say you had fun, ask if they like hanging out more, ask their contact info. Ask for their phone number. It is more effective than their Facebook. A more personal and easier way to connect. **Regular meetings** at clubs can already form the basis of new friendship. Making it even easier to go out later. If you are doing group activities, and someone invites you to hang out afterward. Dont turn it down! These are great opportunities. GO! The informal reflection and bonding afterward is friendship forging gold. Drinks with colleagues, relaxing with sports mates, whatever. The cooldown is a time to reflect on shared experiences. Together you can whine, relive and laugh about what occurred. If people dont want to meet up. **Dont be offended or feel rejected.** Some people just dont have time or are not interested in making new friends. They just might be busy with an active life. It probably has little to do with you. Be okay with it and someone else you meet probably will like to meet up. Dont be surprised if you are not besties all of a sudden either. Its a scale remember. I have a few best friends. The ones I made as an adult, took years to get to that level. It is a long process. But thats okay, doesnt mean you cant be good friends in the process. So you got the contact information of a potential friend. One who is open to meeting up. Or a few guys, getting together in a small group can be easier and more effective. **Give a call** a few days after meeting. I know, this can be nerve wrecking! Remember, this is not dating, this is straightforward. Its actually easy. Your potential friend already told you he wants to hang out. Besides you already had some fun or shared experience. If youve been asking questions a bit, you already know their interests. So give them a call! Just a simple: *Hey, what's up, want to hang out later this week? Thursday? Great, we will go [chilled out activity]. Great, see you then, Ill text you were to meet up. Cool, Bye Bye.* Easy as that. Calling too nerve wrecking? Try texting instead. As for activities, really depends, but try to do something where you can be relaxed. Something you both like, or **where you can get to know each other.** Watch a movie, go gaming, have drinks, do some sports. Whatever fits. Dont be too serious about it. Friendships are mostly fun! Again make people comfortable as discussed in the previous strategy. So both of you can enjoy yourself easily. If things go well, keep in touch. Give a call again a few day later, have fun, create a comfortable atmosphere, and **repeat infinitely.** This way you grow from simple acquaintances to good friends! - So this is how you make friends. Be persistent, it might take a bit of time. But your patience will pay off. Keep showing up at your people source of choice, your people skills will develop from just that. You might get rejected a few times, but hey, you are (re)learning a skill. Dont take it too personally, dust yourself off. Keep on learning, keep on developing! You can build on your foundation of knowing people. The great thing about making friends is, they have friends, that might become your friends as well. Before you know it, you might have a whole host of friends! Go out there, be positive be fun! You can do this! **Tl;dr:** The three strategies to making new friends: go somewhere where you can easily meet new people, make people comfortable and enjoy yourself, make plans for meeting up, have fun, repeat, repeat, repeat. This is of course only a segment of the social skill friend making. But if these tips helped you and you are interested in learning more about social skills and confidence.

I am a little new to this sub reddit so I'll give you a bit of some background. I'm a 26 yo white male who lives in Minnesota and has problems with social skills and trying to connect with people. I feel that I have the social skills to connect with people yet I'm not always confident in them. Or say that there's some miscommunication or awkwardness during an encounter, it always draws me back and I feel that it's my fault. This is a huge mindset I'm trying to change but I'll just update you all now on my current problem. I find myself having trouble setting a routine or having things to do on the weekends. I currently have a full time job and do part time school, but when it comes time to relax or try to plan things with my current friends, I am a huge mess. I have two closer circles of friends that I'll decide to contact over the weekend. One being a little more conservative and have hobbies like hunting and fishing; while I love hanging out with them and have a long history with them, we don't have very similar values or interests and I don't feel the ""friendship meter"" filled as they also have problems with alcohol and smoking (I would describe myself as a more intellectual type of person). My other group of friends are more liberal and very opinionated, which are values I admire. These are also friends I've known for a long time and who I have similar interests with, especially when it comes to music. We love to collect vinyls and have long chats that go deep into the late hours of the night. There are other different hobbies that we connect with but I won't extend any more with that. The only problem with this group is sometimes I feel like I have too much time for them. I work throughout the whole week but once the weekend comes along, I always hope that they free to do something. This isn't always the case, as they have busy and healthy lives/lifestyles, that sometimes leaves me with nothing to do and no one to connect with. They don't have the same mental health issues I do (or so it seems). I try to be as open with them as I can, as I believe vulnerability and honesty is important in a relationship, but at times I feel like I come across as negative, needy, or a soul sucking vampire. This particular weekend, I've messaged both of my liberal friends; Luke who live in town, and my other friend, Jordan, who comes up from Iowa to hangout every once and awhile. Luke happened to busy on Friday but said he may free on Saturday (today) but I have yet to get back to him. As for Jordan, I messaged him as well this Thursday but still haven't heard back from him. I wish he would message me back at least to say he is busy or doesn't plan to come up but over time I've realized this is out of my control and there's nothing more I can do about it. As I'm sitting here, writing this now, I feel that I'm almost developing a oneitis situation with this particular group of friends when there should be other things I could be doing or other people I should be connecting with. If I could, I would love to have more friends like them but my approach anxiety has become so bad and I find it very hard to make new connections. It's hard not to think that my friends and others are better than me, although I know this isn't the best mindset to have at all. Has anyone else had similar issues like this? I would love to hear some advice or hear what situations others have gone through to succeed in better relationships and better habits. Is there something better I could doing when all my friends are busy? What are some activities you can do by yourself? And is there a better way to approach the friends I currently have without seeming needy or pressure them (center of attention)?"

Leaving satisfied and positive after a conversation. So how do you make people comfortable? When you yourself feel shy or anxious. You can achieve this by applying a few tactics. Even if you feel terrible about your social skills, you can learn this. It feels great **to make people comfortable around you.** To become a bit more charming. So you have fun and connect with ease. But I get it. It is scary. You fear to look like a fool and be laughed at. So lets get to terms with some truths. So it will be easier. You thinking *you make people uncomfortable*, causes part of your shyness. Its a self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead of staying in this negative feedback loop, start acting like you are not anxious. Because: [It's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking, than think your way into a new way of acting.](URL (Jerry Sternin) So how do charming people act? How do they put others at ease? Well someone like that is smiling, joking, listening. Showing interest and warmth. Someone that shows an affectionate interest in YOU! You can do that as well! Say you start a conversation with someone. Start by **focusing on the other.** Imagine they are also very anxious. Maybe they are stuck with negative thoughts as well. Be the best person you can be. Shift your attention to them. Make them feel welcome and interesting. You will notice that as you **shift your focus** to someone else, you will forget your own anxiety. Result: You are more at ease. They are more at ease. So how do you focus on other people? Start with a smile. **Be the first one to smile.** Open up and give a nice smirk as welcome. It feels good when someone accepts you with an easy grin. Minimal effort, maximal effect. Maybe it feels a bit weird at first. But youll get used to having an affectionate smile. As you talk to people, **use their name.** It feels good to hear your own name. You actually get a small dopamine kick when you do. So share the dope! Mention peoples name naturally throughout a conversation. Third, people feel comfortable when listened to. Ask questions, show interest and **listen intently.** If you catch yourself falling back into your thoughts. Catch yourself and refocus on what is said. It helps to **paraphrase what people said.** This forces you to listen. And shows people you are interested. On top of that, ask questions about what is said. Best questions ask for more emotional depth. So ask **WHY** people do things. Or **HOW** things made them feel. But, even with all your new found social fluency. Sometimes, things just get awkward. Instead of ignoring it, **state the awkwardness.** For example, you try to fist bump and someone else high fives? Fusing in this awkward fist grab. Just say: Wow, we fucked up and laugh it off. Acting like nothing happened makes it weird. Addressing the tension will release it. Giving you both a laugh. Dont be afraid to **show some vulnerability.** Be true and say what you really think or feel. Pussyfooting around issues creates an emotional barrier. Most people cant put their fingers on it, but they will feel you are holding off. **So say what you think. Share how you feel.** Being radically honest is a fresh breath of air. Sharing true feelings and thoughts connects you to others. But most importantly, **dont take it all too serious.** Not the conversation, not yourself and not other people. Make crappy jokes, enjoy yourself, laugh about ridiculous things. No matter what situation, everything can be put in perspective with some dry witty remarks. Nobody likes stuck up assholes. So let your fucks fly and enjoy yourself. **Tldr:** When you feel anxious, but still want to make people comfortable. Focus on making them feel at ease. Instead of focusing on yourself. *Smile, use names, listen intently, paraphrase whats said, ask for emotions, address awkwardness, show vulnerability and dont take it too seriously.* You will relax by refocusing. People appreciate the effort and enjoy your cool attitude! Good luck! If this helps you and are interested to learn more about social skills and confidence. [Check this out.](URL "
134,vulnerability,socialskills,Your 16-Point Checklist For Quickly Building Rapport With Anyone,80,6ln8wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/6ln8wr/your_16point_checklist_for_quickly_building/,2017-07-07 03:18:46,"So theres someone out there that you want to connect with on a deeper lever. They could be a stranger, an acquaintance or someone youre romantically interested in. It doesnt matter. In order to pull off this youre going to have to first create a series of reactions inside the other persons mind. Youre going to have to **give** the other person certain experiences that make them feel a sense of connection with you. Then once **they** feel comfortable with **you**, their behaviour will change. Theyll open up to you, theyll share things that they dont normally share, theyll want to be around you. And when you notice this new behaviour coming from them, it will pull you in. Youll want to open up to them more, share more and be around them more. Youll be connected. With one caveat If you use dishonest tactics or ill-intentioned manipulation to create a connection you may succeed in making the other person like you but you **will not** succeed in feeling a genuine sense of connection with them, because their affection wont really be for you. It will be for the false persona youve presented to them. This is not the goal. Its empty and unfulfilling, and is absolutely not what you want in your life. This checklist will guide you towards building meaningful relationships with anyone using trust, authenticity, playfulness, vulnerability, creativity, and respect. **YOUR CONNECTION CHECKLIST** When you meet someone for the very first time theyre going to want to put you in a box. And understandably so. When you first start talking to them youre nothing but a walking question mark, and they want to figure out **how they should act towards you**. If you manage to give them the experience of feeling annoyed, youll end up in the *ANNOYING* box. If you give them the experience of feeling uncomfortable, youll end up in the *CREEPY* box. If you dont trigger any strong negative reactions in their mind, you might end up in the *NICE BUT MEH* box. Over time your box gathers labels, and those labels dictate how that person will behave around you. They'll avoid someone who is *ANNOYING AND CREEPY*. They'll reluctantly tolerate someone who is *BORING AND NICE*. And they'll actively engage and connect with someone who is *CHARMING AND FUNNY*, for example. So in order to genuinely connect with someone you have to give them the experiences that earn you the right labels, and avoid giving them the experiences that earn you the wrong ones. Consider the below your foundation checklist for beginning a healthy, meaningful relationship with someone: Part A are the experiences that you must give them through your **conversational skills and techniques**. Part B are the experiences that you must give them through your **stories and responses**. Part C are the experiences that you must avoid giving them. **Checklist Part A (Conversational Skills &amp; Techniques)** * Make the conversation effortless for them * Make them feel comfortable * Make them believe that you find them interesting * Make them believe that you like them * Make them feel playful **Checklist Part B (Stories &amp; Responses)** * Make them believe that you are genuine (honest, trustworthy, etc.) * Make them believe that you are interesting * Make them believe that you care about their well-being * Make them believe that you are fun **Checklist Part C (Things To Be Mindful Of)** * Avoid making them feel unsafe * Avoid making them feel pressured * Avoid making them feel judged * Avoid making them feel ignored * Avoid making them feel awkward * Avoid making them feel doubt (suspicious of you) * Avoid making them carry the conversation Thats all it comes down to. If youre struggling to connect with someone, youre either giving them one or more of the negative experiences in Part C, or youre failing to give them the positive experiences in Part A and B. So figure out what you need to work on most and start there. **ARE YOU A HIGH-VALUE PERSON?** The people you meet will fall into one of three categories: * High-value people * Average-value people * Low-value people You probably already perceive yourself to be somewhere on that spectrum, and you probably instinctively put new people into one of those categories within moments of meeting them. But you probably dont have a quantifiable way of defining who belongs in which category. The checklist above is that yardstick. A person with more ticks on that checklist will be perceived by others to have more value. And a person with fewer ticks will be seen as the rotten apple at the bottom of the barrel. High-value people deliberately limit the people with whom they genuinely connect. Everyone wants to connect with a high-value person, but it would be impossible for them to sustain a connection with everyone, so they choose to **only** connect with other high-value people. It follows that average-value people will put in the effort to connect with other average-value people or above. And low-value people will strive for any connection at all. So how do you quickly build rapport with anyone you **choose**, and connect on a deeper level? You become a high-value person. You demonstrate your value through your conversational skills and techniques, and through your stories and responses, as per the checklist above.

Those points of vulnerability are the parts of our identity we defend most vigorously. &amp;nbsp; The flaws you need to become aware of most are those that are the hardest to accept because they dont fit into your self-concept. Accomplishing this is fundamentally challenging, but extremely powerful. &amp;nbsp; Not too long ago, my friends started to call me overly competitive. Instead of saying, What makes you think that? I would reply with an offhanded (and intentionally cocky) response like, A god does not compete with mortals. &amp;nbsp; I was sarcastic so I could avoid confronting the issue. I didnt respond with an open mind when I got called out on a bad social habit, that deep down, I knew I needed to change. I dealt with my exposed insecurity by brushing it under the rug with sarcasm. &amp;nbsp; Addressing this issue with an open mind was the only way to overcome my biggest insecurities, but I blinded myself to the possibility that it was even an issue. &amp;nbsp; Months after I had begun getting called out on my hyper-competitiveness, I finally saw my insecurities rear their ugly head. I was in a small college writing class, and one student was answering most of the discussion questions. His answers were well-thought-out and added substantial value to the discussion. But I got frustrated, I told myself he was an attention whore and that he should let other people contribute more. &amp;nbsp; In reality, he wasnt an attention whore, most of the other students didnt even have something to contribute. I wasnt frustrated because he was hungry for attention, I was frustrated because I was hungry for attention. I saw the class as a social competition, and he was winning. I had an emotional need to be the main guy in the class. I was jealous that someone else was charismatic, engaging, and intelligent. I was butthurt by the fact that he was offering more to the discussion than I was. &amp;nbsp; Until I realized what I was doing in that class, all the emotions I felt and decisions I made because of my machismo-infused competitiveness went completely unnoticed by me. Beforehand, when people complained that I was too competitive, I consciously assumed they were jealous of me in some way (the irony is that even my thinking about my competitiveness was competitive without my awareness). &amp;nbsp; Resistance is a Compass That Point to True North &amp;nbsp; Blindspots to our own flaws are completely natural, and you cant expect to be so perfectly aware that you have a totally accurate self-image. However, it is possible to become more aware of your flaws and bad social habits, but it requires a counterintuitive approach. Remember that when you feel uncomfortable, the dialogue you tell yourself cannot be trusted because criticism and self-doubt put your ego on defense. Unfortunately, the voice in your head prioritizes the protection of your current self-image over open-minded self-reflection. &amp;nbsp; Instead, listen to your emotions. Whatever makes you emotionally reactive can become a goldmine for personal growth. When an interaction makes you angry, anxious, jealous, etc., Thats where you can be sure you have insecure self-beliefs that you are not consciously aware of. Listen to your emotions much more closely than to the voice in your head. &amp;nbsp; Admit to yourself that the fact you are upset is telling you something that you probably dont want to hear. Once you come from this vulnerable, open-minded starting point, then and only then, you can start to accurately analyze what is causing you to feel emotional discomfort. &amp;nbsp; This process is difficult in a culture that teaches people to place blame on everyone but themselves. However, when you start assuming responsibility for your emotional reactions to people, situations, and criticism, you can accurately root out the instance when you are (at least partially) at fault. &amp;nbsp; There are instances in which your emotional reactivity is warranted, but usually, emotional discomfort is indicative of something you should be working on internally. &amp;nbsp; **Slip Into Your Shadow** &amp;nbsp; What frustrates us about others tends to be what were afraid of in ourselves. If you hate men who regularly sleep with girls on the first date, most likely youre either secretly jealous and unable to admit this to yourself, or you think that what hes doing is disrespectful and youre afraid that youre capable of acting the same way if youre not careful. Either way, this is saying a lot about your values and your insecurities, and very little about the other person. &amp;nbsp; I have a friend who is extremely uncomfortable around anyone whos a bit socially awkward. He will complain about how weird some guys are and treat them like shit. In his mind, this treatment is fair; these socially awkward people deserve to be treated poorly because theyre awkward. But what he doesnt admit to himself is that he is terrified of being socially awkward himself. &amp;nbsp; These people trigger him not because theyre socially awkward, but because hes afraid of the possibility that he might be socially awkward too. &amp;nbsp; This is an example of what famed psychologist Carl Jung calls the shadow. The shadow is all of the pieces of our identity/ego that we keep hidden from ourselves. My friend is so terrified of being awkward, that he will not do anything that makes him feel vulnerable. In fact, he will regularly dare me to pull unusual stunts in public when we go out, like approaching a girl with an awkward pickup line (Is it hot in here? Or is that just the holy spirit burning inside of you?) &amp;nbsp; Numerous times after completing his challenge, I gave him a similar task and he always became visibly nervous and refuses to do it. To this day, he hasnt done a single thing that he thought was socially uncalibrated, even when offered money to do so as a bet. &amp;nbsp; His fear of being socially awkward is understandable (yet irrational), but what makes it so powerful is that he wont admit to himself that he has this fear. The only way he can come to terms with his own insecurities is by assuming that his emotional discomfort is reflective of his own flaws instead of placing the blame on others. &amp;nbsp; Realizations likes this catalyze significant change, yet this is always emotionally challenging. It requires a mindset shift towards your own negative emotions. You must realize that emotional resistance isnt something to avoid, but something to lean into and learn from. Negative emotions arent bad, theyre revealing a point of vulnerability in your own self-concept. &amp;nbsp; Negative emotions are signposts for your own neurotic and insecure beliefs, and theyre screaming at you to become aware of this to make a change. As soon as you see these emotions as signals, as opportunities for growth, they transform from something to be avoided, to something to be sought out purposefully. &amp;nbsp; Realizations like this catalyze real change, and it is always emotionally challenging.

136,vulnerability,socialskills,Hhow do I remain true to myself? [20m],3,6h4uh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/6h4uh3/hhow_do_i_remain_true_to_myself_20m/,2017-06-14 13:01:55,"Over the course of the last five years or so, my social skills have really blossomed. I was ostracized in high school because I was so strange; as a loner I learned that I could make everyone laugh but still sat alone in the hallway during lunch to carve another notch on a locker that nobody had claimed. Everyone thought I was psychotic. I would dress in scruffy clothes and a military jacket every day and had an angry look on my face, because I didnt know enough about the world to understand that it is not encompassed solely by the walls of institutional education and I thought that the douchebags who made my life hell would continue to do so for the remainder of my life. So, when I was 15, I began my long self-improvement journey. Gradually, I learned how to walk again. I learned how to command attention when I walked into a room and how to stand perfectly still. I was miserably shy around people, especially girls, but eventually I adopted a temporary bad boy image to impress my friends. I wore button down shirts that were two sizes too large over a white t shirt until I received a leather motorcycle jacket as a Christmas gift, and while I was able to pull it off (somewhat) I was still a weird, lonely kid who nobody wanted to talk to. So I kept at it. I started reading articles on books on things like self improvement, and then I read a lot more. I forced myself into situations where I could learn how to eliminate my anxiety and socialize  my first job after I dropped out to go to college was as a canvasser for politics  and I knocked on doors and learned how to get better. After that, I met my mentor, the closest person to a father I have ever had, and with his guidance I got a job doing room service at a hospital. Now, at 20, I have become hypersocial. I can talk to anyone about anything, people talk to me constantly, and girls seem to be enchanted by my presence. This is because I have changed everything about me. I worked on my voice, I learned how to modulate the pitch to make people more engaged. I worked on my fashion, and after a lot of trial and error people now complement me all the time and tell me I look like a movie star. I worked on how I gesture my hands and body when I talk, how I look at people, the content of my conversation, and how to tailor my words to each person I speak to, the questions I ask people, the jokes I tell, the things I complement people as well as the right questions to ask and how to find common ground, how to read peoples emotions and tell them the right thing. And it really is great, dont get me wrong. I never thought I had a chance to be anyone at all, and now I find that Im getting closer to being the person I want to be someday, but true success is still a long way from being realized and I'm only at the beginning of my journey to be a better human being. My problem is that I dont know how to stay true to myself. I find that the further I go the less I recognize the person I was, the person I am. I often feel fake, like an actor in a movie playing a role and wearing a mask. I guess I am pretty fake. I find it frustrating because I make friends wherever I go, but cannot connect to anyone on a real level because I am afraid of betraying my vulnerability. Im frustrated that nobody understands that I need some time to myself; that I dont have the energy to socialize with everyone forever, and I dont want to be rude to anyone but sometimes it feels like I am stuck a den of piranhas or a giant boa constrictor who so generously thought it kind to give me a hug and wont let go. I feel like Im wearing a mask that I cant take off. My other worry is that if I find my place in the world and the success that accompanies, my ego will grow so large that I will become blinded. I need to learn how to stay grounded in the real world and how to continue to relate to those who arent fortunate, and I dont want to become so arrogant that I screw up or hurt someone else royally. I want to know, what do I do now? Sorry for the long post, and thank you for reading. Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated. I dont mean to sound like I am complaining about my small successes, Im very grateful for all of the opportunities that others have given me and I want to continue to help those I can, but I would like to get over this general unease and learn how to be myself if I even still exist, at least a little bit. So, thank you all, and have a beautiful night or day wherever you may be. "

I can't ask for help, favours or even things that are mine by right. I have similar anxiety about doing things and going to places that are quite normal for most people. It is like I'm needing a permission for everything in life, but not being allowed to ask for it. I suppose I'm just waiting for the relevant person to see how I struggle and grant me what I want. I was in therapy for almost a year and it seems that the problem is caused by my shame for having needs. I didn't get any further in finding solution and can't afford any further therapy. I would appreciate if you had any thoughts on how to become more able to express my wants and needs.

138,vulnerability,socialskills,3 strategies to start making friends IRL - even if you feel socially left behind,203,689jhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/689jhl/3_strategies_to_start_making_friends_irl_even_if/,2017-04-30 00:16:46,"At the beginning of my college years, I was alone a lot, it sucked. I had this gaping hole in, but didnt know what to do with it. So I grinded away my time. Gaming, watching movies. Numbing myself. Feeling lonely. Yeah, I knew a few people. My stoner roommates for example. Cool guys, but not the relief from social isolation I craved. No offence stoners, but you are not that talkative while on a semester-long smoking binge :). A lot of people are familiar with periods of loneliness. Maybe even you. It can feel like everybody already has a great social life. But you are just left behind somehow. Why are you the one without normal social skills? Wouldnt it be awesome if you could have a group of cool friends? I sure needed a group of more active friends. Instead of watching Anchorman for the 5th time in a row, while blunts passed over dropping chemtrails. For you it might be having a new cool group to hang out with. People to share and bond with. But where to start, if you know no one? I just moved to a new city, 12 years after first facing this dilemma. But now I know how to find and make friends! And it is fun! You want to know how? Yes! Great, you just might enjoy it as well. Lets start with three basic strategies to make friends. Even if you feel like you lag in this area, soon you will have great friends to hang out with! To eat nachos while watching a game, or grab a beer at Friday reviewing the week! Geeking out on the newest episode of One Piece. Whatever floats your boat. Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, some clarification. Being a friend is not a binary status. With on the one hand stranger and on the other side best friend. It is a spectrum. From; *not knowing, to stranger, to acquaintance, friend, good friends, best friends.* And everything in between. Making friends is strengthening a bond between you and others. Shifting them from stranger, slowly to the other side of the scale. Sometimes it is easy to move up. Sometimes it is hard! People slide back on the scale or shoot forward through shared hardships. It is not an exact science, but a skill you get the hang of. Making friends is hard to learn but easy to master. At first, there is a steep learning curve, but after you acquired the basics it is easy to **apply all the time.** Know what you want or like, but also be open minded when exploring these strategies. So lets get started, to make friends, you need people. Strangers. New people. **1. Where to go to meet new people** There are infinite places where people meet. People mines to harvest. Some will be better suited for you than others. Starting from scratch asks for some advantageous circumstances. These beneficial circumstances start with a **low threshold to enter.** So not an exclusive club, or a place with incomprehensible mores. But a place where it is easy to go, without any hurdles. Preferably **strangers are welcomed** as part of the culture. A dynamic place where new people come and go all the time. In fact, its a place that **looks for new people** all the time. Furthermore, it is centered around something **you like.** An activity, interest or passion. Where you can learn or share a common interest. Another plus is a **regular meetup.** A small commitment to get together creates a healthy social atmosphere. But one of the best features; its **open minded.** Full of people open to getting to know new people, ideas, and passions. Where you can be yourself. So where do you find these conditions? First the easiest option of all. There are some great digital ways to join (or even create) communities. You could look at your **local facebook groups.** Search what is happening around your interests. Probably there are some groups open to you joining. Especially if they have regular meetups this is a great way to start. Alternatively **meetup.com** is great for these kinds of groups as well. It takes a bit of digging. But using this tool, you can easily find new peers. Ideally you search for a modest sized get-together. Lets say you are interested in quidditch. You search for local groups that do just that. Ask to join - chat a bit online, things click you can hang out. These are international examples, but undoubtedly there are local digital alternatives as well. As for the analog world, the most obvious place to meet new people is **at work, school or college.** A great opportunity. Here are potentially loads of unknown people, with similar (professional) interests. There can be an open atmosphere for new people. Look out for people you havent met yet at the office/class. You can also **join clubs or associations.** Think of sports, games, and culture. Join the newbie soccer team. Start going to philosophy meetings. Tag along with the theater guys. There are many societies that align with your interest. But even cooler, try to do something new! **Follow classes.** Learn to paint, or farm, or drive stick (Im looking at you Americans). Preferably something you do with a group. Where you and other rookies get the hang of a new skill. It is fun and interesting to bond over shared fuck ups! Failing and messing shit up together, but eventually learning something new, its fun! Or better yet, try **volunteering.** Go to your local soup kitchen, or help at the local marathon. Give yourself to a community and help loads of strangers. People will appreciate your effort, and your fellow volunteers are happy you join them in their endeavour. A low threshold, enriching environment to meet and help people. A last potential option is **reacquainting yourself with lost friends** or classmates. You kind a know each other already. Which makes reconnecting easier. It may feel a bit awkward, but if you used to have a good bond but you grew apart, there is no reason you cant reconnect. It is easy to find them on facebook and reach out. Just ask if they are up for hanging out. Rebuild your friendship from there. As you see there are many options to find new potential friends. Find out what suits you best. Maybe you first try volunteering, but it doesnt work for you. Thats cool. When you join the local fantasy book club, you might just fit in perfectly! I dont know what works for you, but you can find out! Not everything will work for you. Dont beat yourself up about it. Just be flexible till you find a place that suits you best! These options are the easy places to start. As you grow more skilled, youll see you can make new friends almost anywhere. But first, try getting good. A big part of that is getting good at creating a relaxing atmosphere. **2. How to have comfortable interaction** To lay the foundation of friendship, you want to get to know each other in a pleasant way. Therefor you need two things. A comfortable setting and friendly interaction. There are different types of **friendly interaction.** Four basic and four complex ways. As you start out with people, focus on the simple interaction first. As a way to get to know each other. As your relationship grows, moving up on the friendship scale, more complex interaction will be more suitable. But start with simple gestures of friendship. Besides friendly interaction, there are more types. Like romantic or professional, but those are meant for different kinds of relationships. The *first basic* friendly interaction is **simple companionship**, by doing work together, acting out hobbies or facing challenges. Secondly, you can provide **small favors** to one another. You give so that I give. The basis of cooperative groups. **Exchange of information**, contacts, and communicating. Helping each other out by sharing what you know. Like recommending books, or referring them to your network. And of course, hanging out, **relaxing together** and having fun. Go watch a movie together or grab a coffee at your local caffeine dealer. All simple types of friendly interaction. The more complex gestures of friendship are mostly used later on. But sometimes they just so happen at the beginning of a new friendship. First elaborate gesture is **providing big favors.** Like helping to paint a new apartment. Or picking people up from the hospital after surgery. Furthermore **deep emotional support**, in times of crisis, but also sharing their euphoria. As a way of showing your commitment, support and integrity in the friendship. Part of that is the **sharing of personal information** and stories. Showing vulnerability, while respecting and trying to the understand that of the other. Telling about your frustration, how you feel about being dumped or [how chickens scare you.](URL Last but not least, is **sharing an outlook on life.** You can differ in many ways, but all friendships have (developed) a mutual view on at least a few subjects. Dont think to binary about this. Its not like; week 1-4 is for small gestures week, 5-6 for big, and we are done. No no no. Try to let it come more natural. Find out what suits the moment best. Moving on to comfort. You want to feel at ease when making new friends. But meeting new people is distressing. I mean, you feel anxious meeting strangers right? It can feel like everything is at stake (spoiler: it isnt). It would be great if you could just feel comfortable. Well most other people think so as well. They feel jittery when meeting new people, having a hard time to take the right stance. Thats why you focus on the **comfort of the other** when you meet. A lot of your discomfort stems from not knowing what others think right? (surprise, they feel that way as well.) If you can make **them feel comfortable**, that makes you more at ease. To feel relaxed, make other people feel relaxed. This starts by **initiating contact.** When you meet new people, say hi and **introduce yourself first.** Dont wait till someone else does this for you. Whenever we have a new employee at our company, some immediately introduce themselves, others wait for the interaction to somehow arise. New colleagues who are assertive gain a lot of social credit. It makes it easier for us to talk to the new guy as well! In any social environment start by introducing yourself. Its a big plus. After introductions, be genuinely interested. Cultivate a curiosity in other people. Ask questions concerning how they feel, what they do, how you can help them. Show interest in **who** the person in front of you is. And **why** they do what they do. Ask about **what interests them.** Focus on getting to know them. Dont worry too much about them getting to know you yet. People will ask eventually. No biggie. **Smile generously** throughout your conversation. Introduction? Smile! Questions? Smile! Smiling makes YOU feel more at ease. As well as your counterparts. No need for a Joker grin all the time, but give them your gentle opening up smile. Be helpful and kind to people. **Do small favors.** People really appreciate it. But dont be a pushover. Especially amongst men only groups, there can be some testing out. They look for how far you can be pushed. So do something nice when you want to do it. Not when you are constantly pressured to do it. But in most open communities this wont be much of a problem. **Show integrity** when talking to people. Dont use stories you hear, to one-up others. Just for some social credit. Neither lie just to make yourself look better. Be honest, upright and dont gossip. It might win you a few points in the beginning. But it will come and bite you in the ass. As you interact a while, share some stories of yourself. **Show some emotional depth.** A bit of vulnerability. Not too much when just meeting. It doesnt have to be a heart opening story. But displaying your humanity makes people relate to you better. It creates a bond. As you go out and meet people, pump yourself up. Be energized! **Excited about life** in general. Nobody is waiting for someone who is feeling blue. Or someone who brings drama to a group. Show you are a positive addition to a circle of friends. No whining, be grateful, but most of all, enjoy yourself! If you do this, you will have a great and relaxed time meeting new people. So whats next? Aaah yes. **3. Taking it from meeting to becoming friends** Time to escalate. Its so cool you have met new people. Which is already a victory. But we want to make friends :), not (only) meeting strangers. Before you move to the next step, gauge what kind of friendship they might want. Maybe they need a new close friend, but maybe they just want to be acquaintances. Not sure? If the place where youve met them has recurring events, meet them there a few times before moving on. (But dont postpone moving on indefinitely!) So you think someone wants to be friends? Then when the social event comes to a close, tell your new buddies you had a good time. Then just bluntly **ask them if they want to hang out** again. If so, ask their phone number so you guys can meet up. Just as simple as that. Say you had fun, ask if they like hanging out more, ask their contact info. Ask for their phone number. It is more effective than their facebook. A more personal and easier way to connect. **Regular meetings** at clubs can already form the basis of new friendship. Making it even easier to go out later. If you are doing group activities, and someone invites you to hang out afterwards. Dont turn it down! These are great opportunities. GO! The informal reflection and bonding afterwards is friendship forging gold. Drinks with colleagues, relaxing with sports mates, whatever. The cooldown is a time to reflect on shared experiences. Together you can whine, relive and laugh about what occurred. If people dont want to meet up. **Dont be offended or feel rejected.** Some people just dont have time or are not interested in making new friends. They just might be busy with an active life. It probably has little to do with you. Be okay with it and someone else you meet probably will like to meet up. Dont be surprised if you are not besties all of a sudden either. Its a scale remember. I have a few best friends. The ones I made as an adult, took years to get to that level. It is a long process. But thats okay, doesnt mean you cant be good friends in the process. So you got the contact information of a potential friend. One who is open to meeting up. Or a few guys, getting together in a small group can be easier and more effective. **Give a call** a few days after meeting. I know, this can be nerve wrecking! Remember, this is not dating, this is straightforward. Its actually easy. Your potential friend already told you he wants to hang out. Besides you already had some fun or shared experience. If youve been asking questions a bit, you already know their interests. So give them a call! Just a simple: *Hey, what's up, want to hang out later this week? Thursday? Great, we will go [chilled out activity]. Great, see you then, Ill text you were to meet up. Cool, Bye Bye.* Easy as that. Calling too nerve wrecking? Try texting instead. As for activities, really depends, but try to do something where you can be relaxed. Something you both like, or **where you can get to know each other.** Watch a movie, go gaming, have drinks, do some sports. Whatever fits. Dont be too serious about it. Friendships are mostly fun! Again make people comfortable as discussed in the previous strategy. So both of you can enjoy yourself easily. If things go well, keep in touch. Give a call again a few day later, have fun, create a comfortable atmosphere, and **repeat infinitely.** This way you grow from simple acquaintances to good friends! - So this is how you make friends. Be persistent, it might take a bit of time. But your patience will pay off. Keep showing up at your people source of choice, your people skills will develop from just that. You might get rejected a few times, but hey, you are (re)learning a skill. Dont take it too personally, dust yourself off. Keep on learning, keep on developing! You can build on your foundation of knowing people. The great thing about making friends is, they have friends, that might become your friends as well. Before you know it, you might have a whole host of friends! Go out there, be positive be fun! You can do this! **Tl;dr:** The three strategies to making new friends: go somewhere where you can easily meet new people, make people comfortable and enjoy yourself, make plans for meeting up, have fun, repeat, repeat, repeat. This is of course only a segment of the social skill friend making. But if these tips helped you and you are interested in learning more about social skills and confidence.

I've been around the spectrum. It seems like no matter WHAT I do or who I am, people hardly ever reciprocate deeper than surface investment into the relationship. I love people. I want to get to know people. But I want people to invest in some semblance of a relationship with me beyond surface level. I try to make people feel special, care about them, support them, but I also hold my own and know how to tease and joke. But all of the kindness, confidence, vulnerability, honesty, and humor I put forward doesn't seem to entice people. Nobody messages me first, even those with whom I feel a strong chemistry. Friends and peers constantly treat me as someone in the background. And all around I can't break through to a deeper, more involved level."

Even if you feel terrible about your social skills, you can learn this. It feels great **to make people comfortable around you.** To become a bit more charming. So you have fun and connect with ease. But I get it. It is scary. You fear to look like a fool and be laughed at. So lets get to terms with some truths. So it will be easier. You thinking *you make people uncomfortable*, causes part of your shyness. Its a self-fulfilling prophecy. Instead of staying in this negative feedback loop, start acting like you are not anxious. Because: [It's easier to act your way into a new way of thinking, than think your way into a new way of acting.](URL (Jerry Sternin) So how do charming people act? How do they put others at ease? Well someone like that is smiling, joking, listening. Showing interest and warmth. Someone that shows an affectionate interest in YOU! You can do that as well! Say you start a conversation with someone. Start by **focusing on the other.** Imagine they are also very anxious. Maybe they are stuck with negative thoughts as well. Be the best person you can be. Shift your attention to them. Make them feel welcome and interesting. You will notice that as you **shift your focus** to someone else, you will forget your own anxiety. Result: You are more at ease. They are more at ease. So how do you focus on other people? Start with a smile. **Be the first one to smile.** Open up and give a nice smirk as welcome. It feels good when someone accepts you with an easy grin. Minimal effort, maximal effect. Maybe it feels a bit weird at first. But youll get used to having an affectionate smile. As you talk to people, **use their name.** It feels good to hear your own name. You actually get a small dopamine kick when you do. So share the dope! Mention peoples name naturally throughout a conversation. Third, people feel comfortable when listened to. Ask questions, show interest and **listen intently.** If you catch yourself falling back into your thoughts. Catch yourself and refocus on what is said. It helps to **paraphrase what people said.** This forces you to listen. And shows people you are interested. On top of that, ask questions about what is said. Best questions ask for more emotional depth. So ask **WHY** people do things. Or **HOW** things made them feel. But, even with all your new found social fluency. Sometimes, things just get awkward. Instead of ignoring it, **state the awkwardness.** For example, you try to fist bump and someone else high fives? Fusing in this awkward fist grab. Just say: Wow, we fucked up and laugh it off. Acting like nothing happened makes it weird. Addressing the tension will release it. Giving you both a laugh. Dont be afraid to **show some vulnerability.** Be true and say what you really think or feel. Pussyfooting around issues creates an emotional barrier. Most people cant put their fingers on it, but they will feel you are holding off. **So say what you think. Share how you feel.** Being radically honest is a fresh breath of air. Sharing true feelings and thoughts connects you to others. But most importantly, **dont take it all too serious.** Not the conversation, not yourself and not other people. Make crappy jokes, enjoy yourself, laugh about ridiculous things. No matter what situation, everything can be put in perspective with some dry witty remarks. Nobody likes stuck up assholes. So let your fucks fly and enjoy yourself. **Tldr:** When you feel anxious, but still want to make people comfortable. Focus on making them feel at ease. Instead of focusing on yourself. *Smile, use names, listen intently, paraphrase whats said, ask for emotions, address awkwardness, show vulnerability and dont take it too seriously.* You will relax by refocusing. People appreciate the effort and enjoy your cool attitude! Good luck! If this helps you and are interested to learn more about social skills and confidence. [Check this out.](URL "
142,vulnerability,socialskills,"I suck at conversation. I come off as awkward/uncomfortable instead of playful, relatable, interesting, or funny. How do I fix this?",3,5jt0if,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/5jt0if/i_suck_at_conversation_i_come_off_as/,2016-12-23 08:00:02,"Im 18 and a freshman in college, I just finished my first semester. Ive never gone on a date, never kissed a girl, etc. I havent really tried, in elementary-high school I was ostracized and harassed and I eventually stopped taking care of myself and stopped talking to everyone. Im still not sure I could manage a relationship even if I could get in one. I think my main issue is that I almost always feel uncomfortable, and it makes it hard to think. I cant think of anything to say or do to keep conversation flowing and establish a romantic connection. Its difficult to talk in a way thats fun and playful because I get nervous/uncomfortable from social anxiety. Thats largely diminished after this first semester, Ive forced myself to talk to people and go to parties and I dont get shaky from adrenaline anymore, but I think its still preventing me from thinking clearly and being playful/fun. Although aside from the social anxiety I also have very little life experiences that make me interesting and easy to relate to because my lifes been pretty routine so far. In middle and high school I mostly just did school work and tried to distract myself from depression via sleep or wasting time on the computer. Now my routine is school work, going to the gym, doing judo, and going to whatever party I can. My experience at parties is mostly the same: I watch and play drinking games, and I make small talk with people I know. Theyve all been hosted by the judo club Im in, and talking to people in judo is still awkward even after having known them for an entire semester. It feels like they dont mind having me around, but Im not someone that they actually want there. My routine is healthier than it was, but no one is interested in talking to the guy who never does or talks about anything but schoolwork, judo, going to the gym, or parties where all he does is play drinking games. I just dont know what else to talk about most of the time while still being comfortable. So when I try to talk about things that are more relatable, fun, interesting, or playful, depending on how nervous I am there are a couple things that can happen. I might just try to smile and say whatever comes to mind to try to prevent awkward silence, which fails because Im uncomfortable on the inside and not thinking clearly and they see that which makes them just as uncomfortable. Or Ill not say much at all, because I recognize that most of what comes to mind in that moment really isnt playful or funny and is just awkward, or maybe it just doesnt come off that way because my facial expressions (If I'm presenting any at all) look forced and my appearance usually tells people I dont have my shit together. The only way I can think of to break that awkwardness is to expose some vulnerability by telling them Im uncomfortable and dont really know what to say, but I dont really know how to say that without sounding grim or like Im asking for pity, and that just makes the situation even more awkward. I tried to expose this with two girls (I had no romantic intentions with either), I feel patronized by one and my relationship with the other is sort of a friendship but talking to her is still awkward and uncomfortable much of the time. Sometimes Ill feel comfortable talking for a minute, and then I cant think of anything else to say and I dont know what else to do besides try to exit the conversation which is also awkward. **tl;dr:** I feel uncomfortable/nervous from social anxiety, makes it hard to think. I don't have much to say because I lack life experiences, my life's always been pretty routine and no one is interested in hearing about my routine all the time. I end up with a forced facial expression (Or none at all) and anything I say makes whoever I'm talking to uncomfortable, or I might not say much at all which has the same effect. I don't know how to communicate that I'm uncomfortable and don't know what to say in a playful/fun way, I sound grim or like I'm asking for pity. "
143,vulnerability,socialskills,"How to not take things personally, or: Turning Hurtful Criticism into Helpful Feedback",1,5kyjvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/5kyjvr/how_to_not_take_things_personally_or_turning/,2016-12-30 06:06:06,"Criticism sucks, but many of us make it worse with how we handle it. The worst part is that criticism can keep us from the very valuable *feedback* we need to grow. In this article, I'll cover 6 techniques that will help you not only cope with the sting of criticism, but turn it into beneficial feedback. ## What is Criticism? Criticism is when someone gives us feedback that comes across as disapproving or highlighting of our faults or mistakes. It often triggers shame, humiliation, or embarrassment. We can rarely control how we're exposed to criticism, but we can affect how we receive it and what we do with it. Think of it as a muscle, the more we flex it, the more negative feedback we are able to withstand and even harvest. Some of us have been hurt so deeply in the past that we stopped working the muscle altogether and instead built incredible walls with the hope of keeping it out entirely. Unfortunately those walls can just as easily be prisons that keep us stagnant. The sting of criticism triggers our fight/flight response, AKA the survival response. In this state we assume the worst, accept nothing, defend, and dig in or run away. Our emotions drive us as we try to escape the perceived pain. We can't grow from survival response, only maintain. Turning criticism into feedback essential for our continued growth. ## Turning Criticism to Feedback Feedback is often mistaken for criticism and vice versa, but there is a key difference. Feedback is simply information about reactions to something. In this case, us or our work. Criticism can become feedback when we take the teeth out of it and feedback can become criticism when we take it personally. We've all experienced moments in our lives when something called feedback hurt. Bosses and clients love calling it feedback right before they lay into us. There are many bosses, clients, romantic partners, co-workers, and friends out there that give actual well-intended feedback, but our past experience triggers the survival response anyway. What could have been a great growing experience is instead one filled with conflict, pain, and fear. Here's how to overcome criticism and to gain its hidden benefits by turning it into feedback. # 1. Choose who can criticize you Trust is vital in keeping feedback constructive. When we trust the people giving us feedback, we know that while their words may sting, they don't intend them to. We can give these people the benefit of the doubt, and it helps keep our survival response at bay. This requires vulnerability, and its so much easier to be vulnerable with trusted people. ## Avoid or ignore anonymous criticism When we expose ourselves online, we put ourselves more at risk for criticism. Anonymity means less intention, less understanding of the OP, and less incentive to write something well intended. It's so much easier to tl;dr, shoot off a hasty comment and move on. And some people are just out for blood. It's okay to ignore them altogether. When dealing with anonymous criticism, it's not about you. # 2. Choose when you (re-)expose yourself to criticism Sometimes we don't have a choice as to when we receive criticism, but we do have a choice as to when we go back to it. Your boss may sit you down for a one-on-one, and if you haven't built up trust (or if they're not great at communicating with intention) it can be a big shit fest. It may suck in the moment, but you don't have to let it ruin your day or week or month. Same thing with posting online. You don't have to masochistically sit and wait for responses. Choosing when to expose yourself means deciding when you revisit something that you felt hurt by. If you know it's a sore spot, stop poking it! Let it cool down, be kind to yourself and decide whether you need to revisit it at all. If you decide you do, then do it on your own terms, not out of a sense of obligation to anyone else. Do it when you've taken the time to examine the following steps. # 3. Eat the fruit and spit the pit I spent some time working with a theater training program. Actors (and many other artists) are disproportionately exposed to feedback, critique, and criticism. One of the director/teachers had a quote that never left me: ""Eat the fruit and spit the pit."" Hearing it the first time was an *ah ha!* moment. We're really good at remembering the bad shit. The stuff that we don't like about us, that other people happen to find and mention. We latch on it. And we're also pretty bad at remembering the good. What was the last compliment someone gave you? What was the last criticism you received? How many pits do you have have lying around? ## Maintain a fruit supply Make it easy by surrounding yourself with reminders of valuable, kind things you've been told. A youth group I work with once made a big poster of kind comments, encouragements and thanks for the work I'd done with them. For years I left it folded up and stored away. One day when I was feeling pretty shitty, I stumbled upon it and was reminded: hey, not everyone thinks my work is trash! That one guy I've been fretting over, he's in the minority. That poster hangs on my wall above my computer. While writing this, I actually wrote the quote down as ""Eat the pit and spit the fruit"". Freudian slip much? # 4. Work out the emotion When we enter that survival state, it can get messy really quick. Our emotions go ""GET ME OUT OF HERE"" or ""KILL HIM!"". We get defensive, feel hurt, and sometimes our whole day is ruined. Don't let it fester, don't dwell on the thoughts. At the same time, we can't just suppress it (when it's buried, it grows). Find a strategy that works for you. Writing it out, talking to a friend, taking a walk, working out literally. These are all options that can help you heal the emotional sting so you can revisit the comments and pull out the useful bits. # 5. Don't be Superman This is a big one. Having even one or two people you can call and say ""Hey, I need some encouragement"" can mean the difference between a blip on the radar and a blotch on your day. As much as we all would like to be super-men and -women, invulnerable to the difficulties of the world through sheer force of will alone, it's immeasurably easier to go it together. Find folks who get you, are able to help you stand up when you stumble, and who you're there for as well. Trust is build over time. Shame (often triggered by criticism) is a social wound and is best healed with a social balm. For more on this I highly recommend reading the works of Brene Brown. For those of you who feel like you don't have anyone trusted, you are not alone. This is a bigger subject for another time, but it's possible to build a new trusted relationship with less effort than you may think. It starts by reaching out and asking for help. # 6. Re-frame We can overcome a lot of the sting of criticism with how we interpret it. Often having a scarcity mindset can amplify the negative effects of criticism. We feel like every criticism we receive is condemning, because it just further shows how we are not enough. You can interrupt this negative self-talk spiral. Write down the words that hurt and re-interpret them in a way that helps you. There's more than one way to skin a cat, or put another way: There's more than one one way to cook an egg, there are multiple solutions to any given problem, the forest has many trees... ## Parting Words I hope you've found something of use here. If you've got the time, I'd love to hear about your experience with criticism and feedback, and the lessons you've learned. Good luck, and keep on trying! ""Absorb what is useful. Discard what is not. Add what is uniquely your own."" - Bruce Lee "

It has some solid advice and the author begins with saying that yes pick ups and such may work in the short term but you have to change yourself and your attitude towards life for a more long term solution. It's not a book about cheesy pickup lines. Just a random part of the book: This book presents many ways in which to change your life: how to dress better, express yourself better in conversation, approach women on the street, make women laugh, become physically intimate, build a network of friends who make you happy and much more. But all of these things have one thing in common, theyre going to require you to open up to being vulnerable. Whether its forcing yourself to make some new friends, or forcing yourself to go in for that kiss that youve always been afraid to go for on the first date, youre going to be making yourself vulnerable. And the feeling is going to suck. A lot. Youre going to feel uncomfortable. Youre going to come up with rationalizations about how youll do it next time. Youll plan ahead, procrastinate and then re-plan and then procrastinate again, and then decide you need to read this book a couple more times -- all because youre scared to death of that vulnerability. Highly recommended for anyone here."

Ask open ended questions during conversations. Those are questions that force people to answer you with more than one or two words. Most of these questions start with how or what. *Examples:* What is it like to live in Denmark?, How do you envision your life after college?, Is there something that youve dreamt of doing for a long time? Also, check out these [open-ended questions.](URL * Earn the other persons trust by showing vulnerability. Allow them to see your weaknesses and never play too cool for school! If the other person trusts you he/she will open up and be much more perceptive. * Dont hide what youre thinking and express your opinion clearly. Nothing is more boring than a person who tries to be liked by everyone. &gt;In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different. *-Coco Chanel* Consider that its OK *not* to get along with *everyone*. Thats a good thing because it helps filter out people who arent compatible with your vision of life. * Practice listening. Most people think about what to say next while the other person is still talking. Never ever do that! It just distracts you, makes you come across as a bad listener and lets you run out of words. *One last tip regarding starting a conversation:* Asking for permission like ""Excuse me, can I ask you"" only makes you more *nervous* and isnt necessary. Just skip the apologies and start with your opening sentence."

It's a vulnerability challenge, and it helps because most of depression and isolation is as a result of lacking vulnerability, so if I challenge myself daily to conquer a small fear and become vulnerable, then it becomes easy to live on the edge and conquer big fears! Whether that's asking out a girl, a business proposal, or jumping out of an airplane. And it can be as small as just saying hi and smiling to a stranger making eye contact, it's all dependent on comfort level and how deep we go! So my first was that I released a trauma that was with me since childhood involving my parents, and I was afraid to speak with my mother about how I had experienced life since then, but I did it! And shedding light on it made me feel better, plus she got stuff off her chest that she needed to. SO, I'm proposing this as a challenge to reddit users and every day for 30 days want to see everybody post what they did that day that scared them a little :) progress reports are welcome as well. You will see this will result in more involvement and willingness in life at large and expand possibilities. I'll be posting more progress as I go as well! Looking forward to seeing everything happen for everybody!"

Made one close friend around that time who lives across the country, we're still friends 10 years later, I'm female 26years old It feels weird even writing that, cause it doesn't even feel like me, but that's why I am so messed up and I need to just accept that this is what I have to work with. Mostly I think those preschool moments are the most important time in someones life, where you learn subtle body language, and learn to laugh out loud with people, make friends and are able to be there for each other.

I want to learn how to play - SERIOUSLY damn it Anyway, what's prompting me to write at all is I just started a Martial Arts class and I don't know how to be Human, lol. eye contact, catching someone's eye, small talk, yelling and counting out loud for class, with my voice? haha. oh. And when everyone's standing around talking at the end I kinda just run to the door :{ tonight one of the girls and my instructor talked to me before I was able to vanish, and I'm feeling very hopefull that I can really just be myself around these people, but also very nervous, cause my body psychically tenses up, and I have No IDEA what to say.

149,vulnerability,socialskills,7 Tips That Will Make You A True Friend,320,52k0lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/52k0lp/7_tips_that_will_make_you_a_true_friend/,2016-09-13 21:45:40,"Maintaining a friendship is work like anything else thats worth having. But no matter what you do with your life, sharing it with people you love is a tremendous source of happiness. The better friends you have the happier you will be. Its as easy as that. But how can you maximise your chances of developing and maintaining deep friendships for life? I say by being a great friend yourself. Here are a few practical tips on how you can become one. **1. Pay your debts  without having to be asked** Often when you hang out with people someone will come up with an idea like, I am hungry, lets order a pizza. Who is in? But unfortunately, you have no money whatsoever in your wallet. So either you tell them that you arent hungry and, like a hyena, hope to get some leftovers, or you borrow cash. Many people borrow little amounts like $10 and then just forget about it. Constantly having to ask them for your money is a pain in the ass,  both for you and for your friends  so set an example by writing these little debts down and paying them unasked. Do this even if your friends forget about their debts all the time. You reap what you sow. **2. Remember events that are important to your friends** I am not just talking about birthdays here. Events that are big to your friend but unimportant to others. E.g, an important exam, a job interview, a surgery, a first date your friend was nervous about, a big match  basically anything that makes your friend stay up at night but everyone else deems not a big deal. Write these events down somewhere and send your friend a supportive text the night before. You cant imagine how good it feels to know there is someone out there who cares about you. **3. Value punctuality** I know being punctual seems outdated to some. Nowadays everything is more chilled and not as strict. But punctuality is still important. If you are late what you communicate indirectly is, my time is more important than yours. You dont care if your friend had to wait outside in the cold for 15 minutes because you were watching an old episode of Breaking Bad and wanted to see how it ended. Not cool! Some people claim they just cant be punctual even though they try. I dont buy it. Somehow when something important comes up, like boarding a plane on time, everyone suddenly seems to have no problem with punctuality. So if you are honest to each other you will discover that punctuality is merely a matter of caring enough. And if you dont care enough about a good friend to be there at the arranged time (or at least call that you are running late) it speaks volumes about how much you value the friendship. **4. Put your actions where your words are** Ill be there. When you speak these words do you stay true to them? Many people dont. They use their word to get rid of uncomfortable situations like when someone invites them to a party they dont want to go to. But if you want others to trust you its incredibly important to put your actions where your mouth is. If you arrange to go to the gym with a friend the day after tomorrow at 2 pm, there should be no need for your friend to check back if you havent forgotten about it. I dont know about you, but I want to be remembered as the guy who stayed true to his promises all of his life. **5. Be there when a friend needs you without expecting anything in return** It comes up seldom, but every now and then a friend will call you up with a request like, Hey my car broke down in the middle of nowhere and I didnt know who else to call. Can you pick me up? I hope you are the kind of person who gets up immediately, jumps into the car and drives there no matter how far it is. I specifically remember an event a couple of years ago. My girlfriend Kristina and I moved in together and we had to get rid of two heavy old heavy mattresses. The problem was that we didnt have access to a car. So we called up a friend who can sometimes borrow a van from work. He came over a couple of hours later, picked up the mattresses and even brought them to the waste dump by his own. It doesnt sound like much, but I will be forever grateful for what this friend did for us. Its when a friend needs us that we have to be there no matter what. This builds bonds for life! **6. Are you open with your friends?** Its all too easy to stay on a superficial level with your friends. If you arent careful, you will slide into it without even noticing it. But there is an easy solution. Be open with your feelings and show vulnerability. By doing that you will let your friends take part in your life and they will open up to you in return. Sharing your feelings is the best way I know to maintain an interesting relationship with your friends that doesnt solely rely on supporting the same sports team, or working out together. Next time a friend asks you, How are you?, dont just reply with the same old, Im doing ok. Answer truthfully instead, How are you?, To be honest, I feel like shit. People who say what they feel, without wasting any thoughts about how it might make them look, are refreshing. Its easy to have deep conversations with people like that, and it makes it easy for you to share your feelings with them as well. **7. Dont just call your old friends when you need a favor** Lets be honest, most of the advice in this post isnt new to you. We all know how we could be better friends, but we dont put the effort in because we are too lazy, or we take our friends for granted. But if we arent careful, we could easily lose some of the most valuable people in our own lives without even noticing that we are drifting apart. That is why I want you to take at least one last thing with you from this post; stay in touch with your friends! Pick up your phone, or open up Facebook and send an old friend a message. Ask to meet for a beer, or just tell them about whats going on in your life. Dont forget to ask about their life as well. Set a reminder if you know you are catching up too seldom and reserve an evening just for talking and writing with old friends. I promise you, become a great friend and you will never have a lack of good people in your life. P.S: Have you read my free ebook [Basics of Attractiveness](URL already?

150,vulnerability,socialskills,The PERFECT conversation starter to talk to aNY stranger,2,53p9zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/53p9zc/the_perfect_conversation_starter_to_talk_to_any/,2016-09-21 05:56:47,"Weve all walked by people on the street feeling a moment of awkwardness as we both look at each other, and then immediately look away, as if to not let each other know that we were looking. Im going to guide you through a situation that I experienced a while back before I had a girlfriend but I would like for you to put yourself in my shoes. Lets imagine that youre walking down the street and notice a pretty girl walking your way. You also notice that she looked at you and is aware that youre going in her direction. As you get closer you look to make eye contact because you think she might look BUT she looks elsewhere. Although she was actually physically closer to you; she distanced herself from you with the good old look away as she passes you by. WHY??? Because by looking at her, you were invading her personal space, even though you were five feet away. BUT!!!! Regardless, of her look away this is a great opportunity for you to initiate a conversation. Especially, if you really find her attractive, which I did, so I did. This is a framework conversation starter I have used to initiate numerous conversations with total strangers with great success, where the interaction led to me learning more about the person and/or establishing a new relationship. Ive used this framework with men and women where the context of the interaction determined the words that were plugged into the framework. This is how I went about it with this particular girl Excuse me miss? (PAUSE, let them acknowledge you before continuing) Sorry to stop you I dont mean to waste your time. My names X I noticed you walking towards me, and I know I wouldve been torturing myself all night if I didnt stop and at least get your name? (Finish by smiling) What happened here? There are 5 things that made for an easy icebreaker: 1 Tone of Voice By saying Excuse me miss? in a soft well-mannered tone her defense went down and she turned and looked at me, giving me the opportunity to speak. 2 Vulnerability &amp; Importance In the second part I put myself in a vulnerable position by apologizing, while at the same time letting her know I understood her time was valuable. 3 Tell Them Your Name I introduced myself so I was no longer a stranger per say. She still didnt know who I was as a person but she could at least put a name to the face bringing down her defenses even more. 4 Ask Who They Are I ended by asking what her name was and this was crucial because it gave her a feeling of importance. As humans we always crave feeling important, its rooted in wanting to be loved, and thats why we have all been in conversations with someone that only speak about themselves. 5 Body Language The most important thing I did was the way I expressed myself through body language. First, I smiled at her. Second, I kept my distance as I was making my case for stopping her in the middle of the street. Third, I used my hands to express myself as I made my statement. As a result, that allowed her to feel comfortable. This particular situation resulted in a pleasant 10-minute conversation. This allowed me to gain some insight into who she was as a person, allowing me to determine if I would like to proceed into trying to get a phone number. In this case I didnt, but it was the ease with which I was able to initiate the conversation that was most important to me. Even so, that doesnt mean she couldnt have just ignored me and kept walking away. Every person will react different and you can determine what the best approach is based on the situation. This is one approach of many but the same fundamental structure can be applied to other spontaneous scenarios. Give this a go. Let me know how it goes, and if it doesnt help Id love to hear why :). "

I immediately thought ""Holy s***, my colleagues are trying to tell me something - they think I'm bad at talking to people!"" I got worried. My colleagues hear me on the phone with my clients every day, and I thought for sure they were judging me. I later found out it was just a book in the company library that was misplaced during some renovations, but it got me thinking about what makes people interesting to talk to. And I decided in that moment that I would embrace my inner awkwardness from then on. I know sometimes I make weird facial expressions, or that I say things that might sound odd, but so what? I know a lot of people find these quirks endearing, and these quirks are what make me who I am. In fact, showing that vulnerability can make you even better at connecting with people! People like connecting with others who are real and genuine. And being real and genuine can be your ""superpower."" Here's what I mean: Be real. Be genuine. Embrace your inner awkwardness, but be aware of it! That will help you connect with people better, but also give you an advantage in the social interaction. By being aware of what you're doing, you can tweak and control the little things that you do to get a desired response from others. It's truly a win-win. What do you do that's a little awkward?

Unfortunately, I feel like I'm often way too judgmental and ""stuck-up"", not that I criticize people openly or in my head, but rather that I have a hard time opening up to most people. It's hard for me to loosen up and see the best in things. This might even translate to less risk-taking too. This hurts my relationships, new and old, with other people, and I'd like to see if I can take steps to change this without making any *true* compromises to what I care about. For example, if I'm at a party and a new pop song comes on, I might like a pop song's beat, but I'll probably hate the lyrics, no matter how hard I try to not pay attention, so I won't be on the dance floor for a while. I might be unwilling to interact with other people if I don't think we're almost exactly similar. Another example is how polarizing this election has become. I don't talk politics with anybody except close friends, but hearing some of the vitriol from all sides, all affiliations, makes me uncomfortable, so when I hear people talking about politics ""passionately"", it causes me to avoid them. Sometimes, I don't know how to make the connection, and it feels like the friends that I make, who are different from me, were made with nothing but sheer luck. I'd like to stay 100% truly me in my own private time to myself and with friends/family/significant other, but I feel like I'm missing out on many opportunities to make new friends and have good experiences because I don't know how to come out of my shell and ""compromise"" with the little things. It might be a vulnerability problem. It might be an ego problem. I might be too petty. I might be scared of losing faith in what I believe in. I might be too self-conscious. I'm not somebody who goes around and boasts to people, or somebody who tries to make a big deal out of little problems in the real world, but I can definitely see these aforementioned problems subtly being responsible in the back of my mind. What are some mindset tips so I can loosen up, stop being so judgmental, see the best in things, and learn to have fun? What are some methods that you've employed to loosen up, be more openminded, squash your ego, and come out of your shell? "
153,vulnerability,socialskills,A tip that helps me start conversations with strangers.,2,4is3cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/4is3cn/a_tip_that_helps_me_start_conversations_with/,2016-05-11 09:29:10,"I'm sure this has come up enough here, but here's my interpretation: Ask questions. This really helps to remove me from the fear of awkwardness/rejection because it's objective - while a lot of people might not respond too well to outward friendliness out engagement, most people will respond to a question, even if they're not talkative or friendly (in which case you may just get a ""yes/no/I don't know""). If they respond with a short answer while not making eye contact, I don't feel awkward/embarrassed/negative for having engaged them, because the detachedness of simply objective pursuing knowledge separates my ""self"" from the other person, if that makes sense. Questions don't carry a lot of exposition/vulnerability, except maybe for the admission that you don't know a particular thing. Asking questions serves to get a feel of their personaliy. Depending on how they respond, I get a sense of whether or not they're open to talk more, if they seem nice, whether or not I actually want to talk to them etc. Asking questions also connects two people to a common object, oftentimes a physical object in the environment; if the question is about something related to them, like what they're doing, people are more likely to talk about it because it's interesting to them as well. (Though getting too personal too fast can be creepy, especially for a guy approaching a girl he doesn't know etc) It makes starting conversations way easier, because the more you talk about something interesting, the more often ""keywords"" that lead to more conversation come up."

I've done some reading and experienced some things. That is where this comes from. **CHARISMA. WHAT DOES IT MEAN?** ******* Charisma isn't the guy you ""click"" with. It's the guy you become viciously interested in. Charismatic people suck you into their world to have a party instead of meeting you halfway. They pull you into their comfort zone...and for some reason you feel right at home too. Charisma is the antithesis of social skills. They aren't socially skilled. They're socially **gifted.** They're not the people you're ""with"". They're the ones you follow. Some people walk into a room and instantly mingle. Charismatic people walk into the room and flood it with their being. The room *becomes* them. The mood changes. The people change. Everything changes with their presence. You hear about them before you ever hear directly from them. It's in the way they walk. The way they talk. The way they look, how they look. The things they do...and the way they do them. The way their attention works. How they focus. Charismatic people never **react.** They're one step ahead. They're *that* step ahead. They're proactive. Some people are naturally charismatic. Very few actually. But everyone has the potential to be. Especially you. **To be...** ********* Charismatic people have: Confidence, purpose, intent, high self esteem, passion, desire, vulnerability, and absolutely no fucks to give. Charisma is what you call someone whos reached the top of social skills. Its lvl 9000. SSJ God. Gear 4th. Floyd Mayweather. Every topic in social skills revolves around one thing. **Confidence.** Without it, you cant truly immerse yourself into a passion. You cant express desire for the things or people you want. You cant make yourself vulnerable to the world to see and people to judge. You cant walk into a room and be comfortable with everyone saying there you are!"" Becoming socially skilled starts out as an effort to just not be awkward. Then after that, you want to be able to make people like you. To make friends. From there its the opposite sex. Seduction. After that, you develop your own style. What emerges from this originality is Charisma. Your own unique, personalized, magnetic variety of charisma. A weird quirk can quickly transform into the price of genius. Eccentricity is your friend. Similarity is your rival. Something you need to outrun. [The reverse-flash.](URL **Or not to be.THAT is the question!** ********* Charisma isnt something that anyone can tell you how to be. Its not like eye contact or body language. There are things you can do to help the effect, but ultimately charisma is attitude. You cant fake a mindset. The how to guide for Charisma is called self improvement. Become confident and have high/healthy self esteem, fear no judgment, and become a vulnerable risk-taker, and itll happen. For me, this is charisma. And this is my goal.

155,vulnerability,socialskills,Used to think being lonely was great.... Having second thoughts now.,157,4dq2tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/4dq2tv/used_to_think_being_lonely_was_great_having/,2016-04-07 17:50:32,"Hello, This is just an entry I wanted to post. I've lived a relatively lonely life up until this point (Age 28). I want to say that I have a loving family, but I never really felt it inside, until recently. I never really was able to develop any strong or close relationships with friends. I also was never in a serious, intimate relationship with a girl. Loneliness is a state/feeling I've lived with for a long time, and I thought I accepted the fact, years ago, that being alone was something I'd be content with for the rest of my life. However, if I want to be honest with myself, I've realized that there's a deeply embedded desire of wanting to connect with others, being around other people more, and experiencing the joy of soaking in their company. I've only been suppressing this desire and convincing myself that I'm either not worthy of it, or I'm just lonely by choice. People, who know me, call me the lone wolf, but they say that I take that characterization to another level. I thought I loved being alone, but I feel as if that's beginning to change. I don't know why. I used to think solitude was my greatest friend, but now I'm beginning to question this. I've felt emotionless and numb for quite some time, dealing with serious social anxiety, and mild depression (at certain periods in my life). But, thankfully, my social anxiety is slowly beginning to dissipate, and by this happening, I'm able to observe more how people bond, connect, and create warmth amongst each other. It pains me to think that I never truly experienced love and felt any intimacy with someone, before, but I want to hope that I'll be able to experience it, someday, without any fear or prejudice. I'm not a saint. I can be judgmental at times, and I'm very selective in who I trust and maybe have higher standards than most, but I'm trying to change that. Vulnerability is new to me. Self-expression is something I'm working on. I'm trying, everyday, to be a better person. I thought striving for perfection was a good thing, but now I feel conflicted by this idea for some reason. If happiness/joy is my ultimate goal, I hope I'm headed in the right direction. Thanks for reading."

I was originally going to title this ""First Steps"" but then I thought that it would just be better if I gave out my definition of what it means to be socially skilled first. So this post will be relatively short. Being socially skilled means going into any atmosphere, setting, or interaction and getting what you want out of the situation. Any interaction with anyone. Old people. Young people. Hipsters. Jocks. Smarties, Jokesters. Kind people. Nice people. Interesting people. Boring people. Condescending assholes and prissy bitches. It's meeting any type of person, in any type of setting and creating a friend if you want one, potential love interest, making someone interested in you, or making them go away. It's everything. It's about getting what *you* want out of the situation. The first thing you need to do if you want to be socially skilled is to figure out what your goal is. What do you want to be able to do by the end of this? The second (and most important) part is to figure out where you are now. Analyze yourself, figure out what areas you need work and what areas you're good at. There are some of both. The third part is to compare the two. Where are you now, and where do you want to be? See the distance you have to cover, and we'll make a plan to get there. In the further parts, I'll be discussing topics like confidence, being awkward, asking questions, listening, body language, texting, vulnerability, receiving/giving out criticism, being assertive, negativity, misconceptions and anything else that I can think of (suggestions welcome). I have no idea how many posts I'm going to make, and I'm not even sure if they're welcome in this sub. I think I'll make one every other day or something like that. Some comments or no comments, some upvotes or million downvotes. I'll keep going until I'm done. Or until I'm forcibly removed. -Gumbo Edit: Going to update this post with links to the other parts, as they come out. * [Pt2: The Biggest Fear](URL * [Pt3: Judgment](URL * [Pt4: The Pinnacle of Confidence](URL * [Pt5: Nice Guy Syndrome](URL * [Pt6: Eye Contact](URL * [Pt7: Intent](URL * [Pt8: Charisma](URL"

I realize that when I am around people, if I stare into their eyes too long, I start to feel noticed, and an intense feeling of vulnerability. It is very uncomfortable and I start to feel angry and I can see the person I am talking to start to feel uncomfortable. I was wondering how I could maintain eye contact with someone even though it creates an ""angry vibe"" for lack of a better word?"
158,vulnerability,socialskills,"It seems like most posts here are written by people who struggle with social skills, so I'm writing this 'guide' as an outgoing extrovert to give you a different perspective.",370,3wzxtm,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/3wzxtm/it_seems_like_most_posts_here_are_written_by/,2015-12-16 09:10:35,"This is a really interesting subreddit and I've had a lot of fun the last hour reading through the top posts. But I came across [this](URL post and couldn't help but agree with the point OP is making. It's hard to learn from people who experience the issues themselves. Just as you couldn't learn chess from an amateur or learn a language from somebody who has only spoken it for three months, you can't learn social skills from others who struggle with it. So in this guide I'll try to give you guys a few pointers from my perspective. As a sidenote: I'm going to focus on social skills, not dating. In my experience dating is relatively easy for people who are easy going and have social skills. One of the most important pieces of advice I can give you is that social skills develop over time. You cannot expect to read a guide or book and get instant results. You need experience and allow yourself to internalize the things you learn. But make sure you work on them! **Step 1: You** The most important factor in social success is your state of mind: how you feel, how you experience different different situations and your overall confidence. This is also the hardest thing to change. It's easy to learn a few tricks, it's hard to build confidence and create a mindset where social interactions come naturally. But no worries! Brains are plastic, and you can improve. Here are a few pointers from my perspective: * **Anxiety.** The big one. Also the issue with the largest amount of bullshit written around of it. 'Just go out and do it!' is common but horrible advice. Don't try to 'shock' yourself into a confidence. It won't work. Psychology is pretty clear on this, flooding is more traumatic and less effective than systematic desentization. Take baby steps. Look at what you fear, try to find a less frightening version of that, face it and go on to the next step. As a example: if you're afraid of talking to pretty girls go around town and ask the least intimidating looking girl for directions. Move your way up by talking to gradually more and more attractive (for a lack of a better word) girls. If that first step is too intimidating, lower the bar by talking with girls on omegle or something like that. The important part is that you progress, keep putting yourself outside of your comfort zone but avoid pushing yourself to the point of it becoming traumatic. * **Getting your shit together.** This one can be summed up as putting long term progress before short term gratification. We all engage in counterproductive behaviour. Even socially successful people. There is no clear cut guideline for what you can get away with. You don't need to give up on video games. You don't need to stop watching porn. You don't need to stop smoking weed. We all have our guilty pleasures, and that's okay. But it's easy to take it too far. Ask yourself: why am I doing this? Is it because I think it's fun, or am I putting instant gratification in front of my long term goals? Take a good look at what you do and decide for yourself if you engage in destructive behaviour that could hinder your progress. If you find one, try to put a stop to it. * **Therapy.** Don't be afraid of the T-word! Some of the things I read on reddit about how people feel in social situations are really crushing. A lot of people have deeply rooted issues which are going to be hard to solve on your own. Books or guides might not do it. Professionals can help you solve those issues, or at least make your progress a lot easier. **Step 2: Connecting With People** Now that we're feeling a bit more confident and comfortable in our skin, we can continue to the next step. Actually connecting with people. Your mom probably told you to 'put yourself out there'. Your mom sucks at giving advice, because if you actually knew how to put yourself out there you wouldn't have read this far into this guide. * **Talk with people.** Even if you appear to have nothing in common. Even if you think they're ugly. Even if you're 90% sure the conversation is going to shit. One common misconception is that social butterflies never fail. We never get rejected, we never have a conversation die out, we never face 'awkward' silences. That's just not true. If Jordan can miss a shot sometimes and Warren Buffet can buy a shitty stock once in a while, then we can fuck up social interactions. So don't be afraid of failure. This does require confidence, so make sure you didn't skip step one! * **Small talk.** I can sense you shiver as you read the word. The trick is to be selfish. Basically try to have fun yourself first and have a conversation second. Make funny obsverations, talk about random thoughts that spur to your mind. If you have fun, chances are the person you're talking with is as well, and you can often steer the conversation to something more interesting or meaningful if you want to. Just be selfish, talk about what you want to and see how it goes. If you're consciously thinking about what to say, just bail. One common misconception is that you absolutely need to be good at small talk. That's not true. End the conversation if you find it boring. * **Vulnerability.** This is your cheat code. Your secret weapon. The key to the chamber of secrets. This is what your shitty-advice-giving mom meant when she said 'be yourself'. No, really. Being truthful to yourself in the way you act and talk is the most valuable trait you can have in creating meaningful connections with people. It's a hard to put into practice though. **Never refrain refrain from saying or doing anything because you fear judgement or rejection. Never.** Always show your true personality, even if it could put some people off. In fact, you probably will put people off, but the upside is amazing: you will attract likeminded people who like you for who you are. But again, this one requires a lot of confidence, so you have to work on your anxiety and any possible deeper issues first. * **The Usual Crap.** Join a club. Go volunteer. Play a sport. Invite people to go drink a beer together. blablabla. Just meet people. You already know this, you're just not doing it because of anxiety. But once you did work on your anxiety, you still have actually go out and do it! **Step 3: Ruin Shit** (Most people who struggle with social anxiety and social skills would be pretty happy and content to get past step 1 and 2, it could take years. Step 3 is absolutely optional and only for you sicko's like me out there ;) ) So now we've reached a pretty good point. We largely got rid of our anxieties, and through talking to a lot of people while being vulnerable and selfish we've filtered out some good friends who like us for who we are and are easy for us to talk to. Now it's time to go out there and ruin shit. Sharing crazy experiences is the most foolproof way to create deep, long lasting friendships. This is why frat initiations work the way they do. This is why David Cameron put his dick in a dead pig's mouth. Now even though I personally advise against receiving fellatio from deceased mammals, the point stands. Really. Go out and ruin shit. Try to pick up girls speaking only Norwegian, but only if you don't actually speak Norwegian. Go protest and try to get arrested. There is absolutely no reason you shouldn't hire a transsexual stripper to your friends birthday party. Go streak at a football game. Live in another country for a year. Travel around Southeast Asia with a backpack, 100 dollars and a couchsurfing account. If you're at the mall and your favorite song is playing, fucking dance. Go to the sea and swim swim naked. Sleep on the beach. Get chased by a raging bull in the streets of Pamplona. Go to a shooting range and rent fucking machine guns. So there's the end of my guide. I hope you get something from it. If you don't, please understand that it is hard to put social skills into words. At least I had fun writing it :) TL;DR: work on your anxiety, meet people, be genuine, have fun, **ruin shit**"
159,vulnerability,socialskills,Don't fake who you're: give yourself the permission to be yourself and to be who you're,0,3xlr5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/3xlr5t/dont_fake_who_youre_give_yourself_the_permission/,2015-12-21 05:39:48," *Know who youre, then be who you are* A lot of people these days are complaining about not having enough self-confidence, and a lot of people are afraid that people around them wont actually like them. To be more specific, a lot of people are afraid that if they were themselves, then people wont like them for who they truly are. Actually its true that all of us care about what people think of us, to some extent. We all want to feel special and loved, and we dont want to feel that nobody likes us. We want to be liked by others, we cant deny that, and only when that becomes an obsession and stops us from enjoying life, then its said to be a problem. In this article were going to talk about being yourself, not as a vague advise when someone doesnt feel confident,but as a mindset that we can adopt to have a better relationship with ourselves. Before we get into details, lets first explore the opposite of being yourself. **Why its a very bad idea to be two-faced?** First of all, we all have a dark side that we dont want people to see, we all have our little secrets, things that we dont feel comfortable sharing with people. We all have bad things, past mistakes, bad behaviors, and even bad beliefs. After all, were just human beings and were not perfect, and most of the time we dont share these things with people/most people (only one or two). I just want to clarify that Im not talking about these things. What Im talking about here is the fact that some people change their entire personality in front of certain people, only to get liked and accepted. And dont get me wrong, those people are not bad people or weak people, you and I have done this at least once in our lives. I guarantee that. For example posting something on Facebook about being courageous and brave, while deep within, that person knows that hes a coward and he cant really do what he claims. Another example is acting tough around women to be perceived as a strong and dominated man, while deep within, that person knows that hes just putting an act. In brief, you try to be something that you know youre not, only to get approval or to hide your true self from people. Those things may sound like little things that wont hurt anyone, but in fact, the devil lies in these little details. If we kept doing these behaviors, we would end up hating ourselves. If we keep on putting an act so that people dont see the real person inside of us, were already rejecting ourselves. And as we said above, it will make you hate yourself!! Why?! Because you know that this act is not you, and youre the only one who knows the truth about yourself (which you think that nobody will like it). **What to do instead?** Give yourself the permission to be yourself. But  how to do that? Great question, here are some tips: **First of all**, you need to be aware of your behavior. Sit on the back of your own mind and observe your behavior; you need to catch yourself wearing a fake mask! For example, youre in a social gathering, and all of a sudden you start to try to make yourself funny or something, so that people would judge you well. Even if everybody judged you well, you forgot about yourself, you would judge yourself in a bad way because you know that youre only putting an act. Im guilty with the example above, there was a time where I used to be around some people, and I would wear a mask, because actually I was hiding something from them, my true self and my true intentions. So, awareness in the first step. You need to recognize whether youre being for real or youre just hiding your real face from people or wearing a mask you think people would love to see. **After that**, dont feel bad because youre doing that. It doesnt make you a bad person and it doesnt make you less than anybody else. Instead, realize that youre just trying to reach a certain goal with this behavior. Everything that you do has a purpose, you want to reach a certain goal, if we look at behaviors this way, its much easier to understand all of our actions. Most likely youre doing this behavior because you either want to get approval from people, you want to feel special and loved. And thats totally OK, nothing to be ashamed of, we only need to balance our needs. Or youre doing this behavior to hide your true self, because deep within you believe that people wont love you if they find out who you really are (which is an irrational belief). Anyway, catch yourself doing the behavior of being two-faced, then realize that you do it with good intentions. Now, let me give you the hard truth. **Heres the shocking truth** People dont really like two-faced people, even if those same people were two-faced themselves!! And not only that, people can tell whether someone is two-faced or not, maybe not on the first sight, but overtime they will. One good example is the narcissists; I talked about this in my previous article about the first impression. Narcissists can make a charming first impression, but when people get to know to them, they actually start to sense that theres something wrong, and they start to get away. As they say, you can run but you cant hide, the true intentions and motivators will come to the surface sooner or later. So, the people youre trying to impress are not impressed anymore, you cant impress anybody wearing a mask. Thats the key point, starting to see that wearing a mask to impress people is really pointless. Not only that, but also its going to backfire at you leaving you with nothing but self-hate. **People like genuine people** Just think about it, wouldnt you like a person who doesnt fake his actions? A person who talks his/her mind? A person who opens up with you because he is not afraid of showing his true self? Wouldnt you like to be that kind of person? We all want to be around such people, they feel so real. And as time goes on, theyre still genuine, they simply dont look for any approval, they seek real connections and real love. Theyre truly confident, because they dont need to change who theyre to prove anything, and also theyre not ashamed of just being who theyre. Theyre the same in front of everybody, you, me or their boss; they dont have to fake anything. Also one important thing to mention is that faking and acting are actually not easy things to do, they require so much energy. And also its a reason they dont like to be around certain people, because they have to put on a mask in front of them, and its just exhausting. **But what about the fake it until you make it?** While I do believe in the fake it until you make it school, but first we need to make sure of few things. You need to **double-check** your intentions. I mean are you faking something to get people to like you? Or are you faking it to help you on your long-term goal of improving yourself? Its OK to act like you know what youre doing or like youre confident. We all feel weak sometimes, no body is confident all the time, NO ONE. What isnt OK is to fake something to make people believe/think that you actually have it , but you dont. and youre doing that only to get their approval. **Conclusion** So, dont ever act or fake something just to make people like you or to hide something about yourself, vulnerability is power. Acting and faking things will exhaust you, plus people can spot those who put on an act in front of them, sooner or later the truth will reveal its self. People also love genuine people, those who talk from the heart, those who arent hiding their true self and those who arent concerned about peoples approval. As Will Smith said in his movie hitch: act with what you already have, if youre shy, then dont try to be outgoing. Sure always try improve yourself and become better (for example overcome shyness), but dont just fake being outgoing so that you actually hide shyness and make people think youre outgoing. In brief, do it for yourself, not to impress anyone, in the words of Jim Rohn: **learn to *express*, NOT to impress.** Hope you liked it, here's the [original article](URL you can take a look at it.

I know why my self-steem is so incredibly low: People treating me like crap because of my poor social skills and my bold attempts at self improvement (which leads to insecurity as I'm opposing the opinion of pretty much everyone I know).

Hope it helps.* When I was about seventeen, I joined an international public speaking group called Toastmasters. While I had become increasingly self-assured in general, I still felt great nervousness when I was speaking in front of other people. Even an environment like a classroom, where participation in the discussions was just a part of the daily chores of a student, caused me discomfort. As soon as I got too much attention, I expected to blush. When I noticed that others were looking at me for an long time, even when I commented in class, I felt a tingling sensation announcing that I would soon turn red. I got especially anxious when I made a mistake as I talked. It had already gotten better, but I was determined to eliminate the last bit of blushing from my life. *Sounds Familiar?* When I was still going to my old school, it had been really bad. I used to avoid being asked to share an opinion because it would almost always result in the same scenario. The teacher asked me to say something, whereupon I did as requested. Noticing that others were looking at me as I spoke, which people always do, I gradually became more nervous. I felt a heat wave emanating in my belly and slowly rising up to my head, sending heat waves through my entire body. It was when I noticed this sensation, that I tried to finish speaking really fast. If the teacher inquired about details, though, it was too late. I felt the tingling warmth spread through my face, painfully aware that I was blushing. My thoughts started to race. I was hectically assessing whether others had noticed, which made it worse tenfold. Often I bent down to my bag and tried to hide my head under the table while I pretended to drink something. Only after I felt the flushing wear off did I stop fumbling around with my bag and reappeared. Sometimes, insensitive as teenagers often are, someone commented on the redness in my face while I was speaking. **Possible the Worst Feeling In the World** Those situations made me first want kill the commenter and then myself as I could not bear sitting there being socially humiliated, which used to be one of the most terrible feelings I knew. People tend to rank public speaking higher than death if asked what they fear most, a statistic which speaks for itself. It was only when I learned that fear can be an important tool for personal growth that I started to accept it, even love it. Earlier in my life, I avoided discomfort like the plague, but suddenly, I started to purposefully search for situations that were humiliating me in a social context. I looked for circumstances that were challenging, conflicts that triggered my deepest anxieties. I knew that every time I faced the fear, it would become smaller. A little bit of freedom would be gained. **How to Eliminate Blushing From Your Life** Firstly, the underlying reason anyone blushes is because they feel anxiety. Why did I say anxiety and not fear? Because anxiety is, by definition, an illusion. Its not justified. And thats exactly what the feeling that makes you blush is; unjustified. But thats not the whole deal. Most people, experience an additional anxiety of blushing itself. Not only do you feel anxiety because you speak to an attractive person, or give a presentation. You also get nervous because you anticipate your own blushing. *Isnt that ridiculous?* Zoom out, and try to look at it from the outside. As if you were an Alien from another planet. Objectively, all that is happening is that one human is speaking in front of other humans. And suddenly the human whos speaking turns red. But nothing has happened. So why can that be? Its because that human feels inadequate and therefore develops anxiety to speak in front of others plus anxiety about the mere possibility of blushing. So we have three levels here. **1)** You feel inadequate, which is an illusion. **2)** You feel anxiety, which is based on a illusional sense of inadequacy. And now comes the kicker **3)** You feel anxiety about the illusional anxiety based on an illusionary sense of inadequacy. But lets stop making fun of the human brain for a second, and look at the phenomenon of anxiety. **Heres What Causes Your Anxiety of Blushing** Your anxiety causes a hormonal response in your body. This response is inherently positive, because a couple of years ago it might have saved you from a sabertooth tiger. Your hormones are designed to help you. Whenever there is a treat, and you do perceive speaking in public as a treat, your body prepares you for fight or flight. Realize that whats going on in your body is actually a good thing. When your ancestors spoke to each other, they had to be on guard. They were in imminent danger of being kicked out of the tribe or worse. Imagine you made fun of the king and he heard it. Or others would think youre insane. In prehistoric times, that would have meant death. Thats why public speaking is so scary. On a genetic level, youre facing death. But youre not in a tribe anymore. If someone thinks you weird, all that happens is that someone thinks youre weird. Even if youre entire city thinks youre crazy, they wont just kill you. And if they do, you just move to another city. Realize it is primal fears that make you blush. Acknowledge that youre not an ape anymore. You still want to eliminate blushing? Okay, Lets get on with it. **You Blush Because Youre Trying to Control** Its a form of perfectionism really. Youre trying to control how others perceive you. But thats impossible. During every act of communication, information will be lost or added, and there is nothing we can do about it. Except trusting that it will be okay. So realize that the root of blushing is your need to control. But here is the key: Not only are you trying to control. Youre trying to be perfect. You think, that others will consider you less worthy because you blush. Not true. Do you remember the last time you saw someone blush? How did that make you feel? Did you silently laugh at him or felt compassion. Did you think he sucked because she displayed human behavior? I dont think you did. **Solving the Problem In Your Mind** Meditate on what I just told you. Realize that your anxieties are irrational, and that even if you have them, no one will condemn you. It is all about vulnerability. Imagine if you didnt give a damn about social reputation. You felt totally comfortable in your own skin, and even if you have faults, youre not afraid to expose them. If you speak to people from that mindset, youll be fine. You wont be nervous because there is nothing to be nervous about. You wont blush because there is nothing to blush about. And even if you do flush a little, you dont care. Its fine. Youre comfortable with yourself,. But lets turn that into practice. In order to eliminate blushing from your life, you want to do two things simultaneously. **1) To Stop Blushing, FORGET About Blushing** Deny its existence. Ban the notion from your mind. Finish this article, and then never in your life read about blushing again. Dont google for help, think about it or talk about it. Blushing is the result of illusionary thinking, so it needs to be treated as such; an illusion. If you blush at some point, do not entertain thought about it. Do not analyse. Just pretend that nothing has happened. Its not real, so forget about it. You cant blush if you dont know you can. **2) Lean Beyond Your Edge** (Thats the part where you actually need to do something). If you fully comprehended what I just wrote, youd never have to worry about blushing ever again. But thats just not how the brain works. Knowledge doesnt teach. Experience teaches. So get out there. Those things that make you feel nervous and create that tickling sensation in your chest and head; do them. Hold that speech, talk to that pretty lady, do speak up. Its not a process of adding confidence. Its the opposite. Its about returning to that child like state, back that when you didnt bother about what anyone thought of you. Stop controlling. Youre not in control. Nobody is. Just get out there and make yourself vulnerable. Remain open and dont try to fight your nervousness. Try to find peace in that state of uncertainty. Forget about mind games like imagining your audience naked. Those kind of things make you feel temporarily superior, but do not attack the root of the problem."

Part of it is a wall I've built around myself from being hurt so many times by people I've cared about, but I've been working on that for a while. I try to reach out to people, help them out, offer an ear or shoulder hoping they'll think of me as someone they can trust or depend on. This winds up with me going out of my way to help a lot of people and then having no one around to help me when I need it. I don't hold it against anyone, it just makes me feel bad about myself, like no one cares. Sometimes I try to show a little of my own vulnerability in hopes it will make them feel like they can do the same, but I think this method is actually counterproductive and makes people feel uncomfortable most of the time."

I dont remember the movies name, but it was about a boy who started chatting with a girl (who supposedly went to his school) online, and they decided to meet up after school the next day. So while hes waiting for the girl, a man who claims to be the girls father pulls up in his car saying his daughters at home and offers the boy a ride. The boy actually gets in the car with the man and they start to drive away, but then the boy realizes he made a bad decision and jumps out of the car. He then runs back toward the school, with the man driving his vehicle across the lawn after him. The boy makes it inside the building, so the man eventually has to get out of his car and chase after him on foot. He catches up to the boy and tackles him to the floor, where they struggle for a bit before police officers arrive and arrest the man (I forget how exactly the police officers were alerted). One of the officers then tells the boy that the man doesnt have a daughter, and the boy is shocked to realize the girl who spoke with him online was this man all along. At the part when the man and the boy are struggling on the floor, the boys on his back kicking his legs (and probably screaming or attempting to scream; that detail eludes me as well) while the mans trying to subdue him. The boys vulnerability at that part  contrary to how it was supposed to make me feel  ended up turning me onas in sexually aroused. I realized then that I had pedophilic tendencies myself. But I was still only 13 at the time, so I was wary about coming across to other people (especially potential sexual predators) as a target myself. Consequently, Ive tried repressing those aspects of myself that I found attractive when exhibited by others: swinging your legs or letting them dangle off the ground, showing visible enthusiasm/excitement, looking up to someone or putting all your trust in them. Even stupid little things like letting your lips look moist, or leaving your mouth hanging open; anything that could be associated with naivet or appearing childlike. Likewise, I tend to be attracted to guys who are shorter/younger than me and who generally act/look younger than they really are (yes, Im gay), but the attraction is usually coupled with a power trip or sense of dominance over the other guy. Im 23 now, and although I know I dont need to worry about becoming a victim as much as I used to, I still feel somewhat vulnerable. For instance, Im 510, which some guys might still consider short, and Im not built because I hate exercising. But more importantly, my insecurities (coupled with anxiety problems) have affected my social skills. I dont show emotion that much when I talk to others and my voice is monotone. Im reluctant to hang out with people to get to know them on a more personal level, and instead resort to being a creeper and stalking their social media accounts. But especially, I dont feel enthusiastic or passionate about anything besides browsing the internet, playing video games, or being around my pets. This last point hurts me because Im in an applied mathematics graduate program that requires me to complete an internship to graduate, and although math is my favorite school subject and I like solving math problems, its not something Id do in my free time. But employers seem to only want people who are truly passionate about their field and genuinely interested in the companies they apply for, while all Im looking for is a job I like at least somewhat so I can earn money and make a living. Most of the topics here ask for help with broader insecurities, but mine have several psychological layers behind them. I do have a psychiatrist and I plan on discussing all this with him (finally) during my next appointment with him in early November. In the meantime, do any of you happen to have advice on how to begin tackling my issues, or know a website (or some other source) that deals with this specific thing? **DISCLAIMER**: I was never molested or raped as a child, and I have never acted on my tendencies to do anything illegal (nor do I ever intend to). I know pedophilia and homosexuality arent related, but I know Im both gay and have pedophilic thought patterns. The age range of the people Im attracted to has generally increased as Ive gotten older, but I believe my tendencies still affect who I find attractive and what I find attractive about them."
164,vulnerability,socialskills,"My social skills are going to hell fast. Advice, thoughts?",11,3fjfma,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/3fjfma/my_social_skills_are_going_to_hell_fast_advice/,2015-08-03 05:56:04,"Hi everybody. So there's a lot of background story that is definitely going to be relevant. A lot of the context is dating related, so you might think it's more appropriate to post this in /r/dating_advice, but the actual challenges I'm dealing with right now are more overarching social skills and not exclusively dating problems. I'm a 15 year old high school student going to an all boy's school. I am an introvert. I know that doesn't mean that I am by nature bad at talking to people or anything, but I figured I'd mention it. I've always had my group of friends and making friends was never particularly hard (things would just fall into place after a while and I'd form a group) but I've never been good at meeting new people or starting conversations with people I don't know very well. With people I don't know too well, I'm very reserved and I have trouble thinking of things to say. I also tended to be kind of awkward in groups and I never liked being in an environment with a bunch of new people (I always avoided those types of situations whenever possible). Last year I wanted to put an end to my shyness (which was also extremely prevalent when talking to girls that I was attracted to) and I took steps to do so. I talked to more people, made some new friends, pushed my comfort zone a little bit. For a while, I got really into men's dating advice and stuff like that (not ""pick up"" or anything because it was too gimmicky and logical and manipulative for me, but things like introducing myself to girls, expressing my interest, etc.). I started to get becoming more comfortable with talking and flirting with girls and I felt great. At one point I went to hang out with an old friend, who brought some friends of hers. One of her friends was cute (we'll call her Jess) so I introduced myself, complimented her quite boldly, she was kind of impressed and we went on a date. I didn't continue seeing her because I felt like she was a little needy (looking back, I often wonder if that warranted not seeing her anymore). We're friends/acquaintances now. More romantic-related backstory (I promise I'm getting to the point and this isn't a dating question): My best friend since about a year ago is a girl. My friendship with her has been the most fulfilling of my life. Recently, however, I've come to terms with the fact that I've developed feelings for her. She is in a sexually active relationship with her boyfriend and I'm the unlucky bastard who gets to hear about it. Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for advice on what to do about that. I know what I'm doing (or rather, I'm comfortable with the fact that I don't know what I'm doing). Now to the point: The fact that my best friend doesn't know how I feel about her and I am currently unable to express myself to her leaves me feeling a sense of disconnect and a gap in our relationship. She likely doesn't feel this (as she has no idea), but I do and it's rather painful. I've been uncovering a lot of insecurity and anxiety that I had been suppressing for a while. A lot of this is insecurity about being awkward, unattractive, shy and weird, etc. I realized that all the stuff I had learned/read/practiced from the dating advice wasn't real confidence. It was get-psyched-up-and-feel-energetic-and-nice confidence but not deep, profound, self-accepting confidence. I have so much trouble having sincere, deep conversations with people and I instead use constant sarcasm, teasing, and joking as a crutch. As I came to terms with this I realized my current relationships are lacking. I find it difficult to connect with people. Mainly, I feel unable to be understood by almost anyone-- even my best friend, since she doesn't know about everything that's going on with me. I feel like I'm backsliding and my social skills are getting worse (or, more likely, I had never developed the confidence, authenticity, and vulnerability that are crucial to social interaction to begin with). Yesterday Jess invited me to her birthday party, where there were many new kids that I didn't know. I was pretty sociable in the beginning, and then more people came and I felt kind of out of place and didn't really know how to get myself into the group conversations. Things really sunk in when Jess and I were talking on Facebook this morning and she said ""You changed a lot."" I asked how so, to which she responded something like, ""You became unsociable and really shy."" This hurt coming from a girl who had been previously attracted to my boldness and sociability. I'm trying to re-learn my social skills, this time with more authenticity and vulnerability. I want to express myself more honestly, and not feel the need to feign confidence and extroversion. The romantic-related struggles that I'm dealing with now are both part of the problem as well as a possible source of it. I didn't even know how to start a conversation with this girl I'm volunteering with whom I want to get to know (and I have trouble talking to a lot of people there in general). How am I to get myself out of this rut? Do you think this has to do with common social skills that I'm not yet experienced in, or do you think it has more to do with emotional baggage? Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you so much."

I know I've compromised a few romantic relationships because I clam up whenever I feel like I should give a compliment. It's almost like giving someone else a compliment opens up a vulnerability within myself - like expressing my feelings about something will show them something I don't want them to see, a weakness or vulnerability. I know this is probably pretty illogical, but it's gotten to the point in the past where boyfriends have asked me to say something nice to them because I just...can't seem to do it unprompted much of the time. It's not that I don't think nice things about people, or appreciate them, or admire them. I want to give compliments - I do - but I freeze, or feel generally uncomfortable, vulnerable and even somewhat insincere. Any advice on how I can meld my mind or use social tricks to make it feel more natural and genuine, even pleasurable to give compliments to others? Thanks in advance for your advice and suggestions.

I've come to terms with my weaknesses and acknowledge/accept them since they are part of me. In conclusion, I've changed a lot ever since I've taken advice and let myself guide from Models. My desire to share my true feelings, opinions, etc. has been marred prior and I've gained the ability to express myself without remorse. My posture has improved and I'm exchanging words in a confident manner: Chin up, no sluggish and loose shoulders, back and speaking intelligibly. Now, I'm miles away from being completely vulnerable, honest to myself, you name it and I know that. But despite all that, I haven't acquired the skill to look people in the eyes without feeling uncomfortable. It's not that bad because I've practiced it with successful results. However, sometimes my body pays the conversation no heed and only focuses on looking the person in front of me in the eyes thus not completely capturing the given information. It's still difficult to mantain constant eye contact because I'm used to speaking to people whilst looking at the sky or or other distant places in front of me. Are there any particular reasons why I haven't learned that skill and formed such a bad habit? I will do my best to improve that further."

Recently though, and my phone was stolen. I only recently found out about this i stopped contact probally 4-5+ months ago. I dont want to talk to her cuz its awkward but i still kind of miss her. She likes me and she had her bestfriend post the video for her class i was talking about to her. She just graduated highschool, but this guy sexually harrased her. Used my journal to send a text like. ""hi i just want to tell you that your really sweet and i dont have any freinds but wanna turn it around. and then it sucked that i didn't go swimming with her. (I went to her work after a few weeks of building her up to do something but had no freinds to go with me so i just dissapointed her) I feel bad for her best freind just graduated and i don't think shes seen him for a while. I was informed by someone i know online that goes to another school. I fucking hate this situation but i was vulnerable enough to let her in a little bit... and she really seemed to like that. The worst part is her sister moved away recently, Her sister was autistic and so am i. Its sad really. I may never get to see her again and know i caused her to feel this way but i accept that. Vulnerability is life. I live by this beleif, because i have a series of circumstances that make me vulnerable my entire life. Im seriously upset about this, She may be in the same situation i was in and responded well when i talked to her. Ive been on reddit for a long time Talked people out of suicide, I know how to make them feel nice. TLDR girl likes me phone gets stolen, harrassed am told she's sad about not seeing me in several months guy states things in my journal that i keep saved on my cell and depresses her with upsetting messages then her best friend leaves and she's graduating highschool. and her sister has aspergers and so do i and she just moved away, it doesn't prevent me from functioning like a normal human being, Moreso it gives me a few small little quirks that most dont get."
