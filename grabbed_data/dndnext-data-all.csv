I'm back with an update for the Skinchanger class that I've been working on. A few commenters gave some very good pointers, and lots of things were changed about the class, but mainly its subclasses. I plan to keep updating this, as each subclass still doesn't have a very well-defined role. This update is more like a foundation for that, y'know? So without further ado, here's what I have for the second (and most likely not last) draft of the Skinchanger class: &amp;#x200B; Transformations: 1st - 2nd level: 2 3rd - 5th level: 3 6th - 11th level: 4 12th - 16th level: 5 17th - 19th level: 6 20th level: Unlimited **Class Features** As a Skinchanger, you gain the following class features. **Hit Points** Hit Dice: 1d10 per Skinchanger level. Hit Points at 1st level: 10 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per Skinchanger level after 1st **Proficiencies** Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons, improvised weapons, whips, nets Tools: Cooks Utensils, Weavers Tools, Woodcarvers tools, or one musical instrument of your choice Saving Throws: Wisdom, Strength Skills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Intimidation, Medicine, and Survival **Equipment** You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: * (a) a whip or (b) any simple weapon * (a) a bow or (b) any martial weapon * An explorers pack and 20 arrows ### Unarmored Defense Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. **The Wilderperson** Outside in the wilderness is where you belong. It is your home, and you know it like it's the back of your hand. This grants you the following benefits, starting at 1st level: * You ignore difficult terrain. * You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. * You gain proficiency in the Nature skill if you dont already have it. When you roll a Nature check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the roll, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when travelling for an hour or more: * Difficult terrain doesnt slow your groups travel. * If led by you, your group cant become lost except by magical means. * Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. * If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. * When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. **Skinchange Ability** When you reach 2nd level, choose one animal that you can change into. * Unicorn * Giant Spider * Giant Wolf Your choice grants you features at 2nd level, and again at 5th, 10th, and 15th level. Some are for while you are in your animal form, some are not, and some are for both scenarios. As a Bonus Action, you can turn into an animal like a changeling changes its form. It is not always active, but always swiftly in reach. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: * Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. * When you transform, you gain an amount of Hit Points equal to your Skinchanger level + your Constitution modifier + your Wisdom modifier. * You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast. * You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense. * When you turn into an animal, unless that animal has usable hands, you drop your weapons. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. Once you transform and expend a usage of your transformations, you must take a long rest to regain any expended usages of your transformation. **Beast Sense** Starting at 2nd level, you gain Darkvision if you dont already have it. Darkvision gained in this way has a range of 60 ft. If your race already grants you Darkvision, its range increases by 30 ft. Additionally, you gain proficiency with Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see or smell something. **Wilderpeoples Fighting Style** At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty, which you have learned after years of spending time in the wild. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. * Primal Savage: You can channel the savagery of an animal, allowing you to nonmagically replicate the effects of the Primal Savagery cantrip at will. This functions as an Unarmed Strike, adding your Strength modifier to damage dealt from your Primal Savage attacks. * Throwing Weapon: You can throw any weapon that you wield, and you can draw it as part of the weapons attack. The thrown range is equal to your Strength score. * Aimed Fighting: As a Bonus Action, which you take before your next Attack action, you can choose to aim more specifically with your weapon, granting a +2 to that attacks Attack Roll. * Distracting: As a Bonus Action, you can distract your opponent, imposing disadvantage on their next Attack Roll. * Impede: As a reaction after an ally that is within 10 feet of you takes damage, you can intercept the blow, reducing the amount of damage they take by your Constitution modifier + your Proficiency Bonus. * Brawl: When you grapple a creature, they take bludgeoning damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier. Additionally, grappling does not lower your movement speed. These function both inside and outside of animal form. When you use the modifier to your Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution ability scores for any of your wilder fighting styles while in animal form, use the modifiers of the animal form instead. You can choose an additional wilder fighting style at 9th level, and again at 17th level. **Ability Score Improvement** When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. **Primal Weaponry** Starting at 6th level, while not in animal form, you can use your Bonus Action to channel your savagery into your next attack, allowing it to overcome nonmagical and magical resistances and immunities to bludgeoning, piercing, and clashing damage. Additionally, while in animal form, your natural weapons are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. **Supreme Health** Starting at 11th level, thanks to the healthy and purely natural condition of your body, you are immune to disease and poison. **Fleet of Foot** Starting at 14th level, you can take the Dash action on your Bonus Action. Additionally, you and your party (as long as they are with you) can no longer be tracked by nonmagical means. **Stalker** At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. **Nature Unleashed** Starting at 20th level, you have become so close to nature that you are practically a beacon of its own ferocity. Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. &gt;I'm probably going to change this one, as a commenter pointed out that 20th level should be used for something related to skinchanging. I still wanted to go with stat increases previously, which is why they're here. And because I haven't thought of anything skinchange-related for 20th level (any ideas?). &amp;#x200B; **Skinchange Ability** Spider Changer You have mastered the ability to turn into one of those who lurk in natures darkest corners: the Spider. **Giant Spider Traits** Starting at 2nd level, while in your spider form, you gain 1 attack trait, 1 active trait, and 1 passive trait. **Attack:** Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1d8 + Strength modifier piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, the target is stable but Poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining Hit Points, and is Paralyzed while Poisoned in this way. **Active:** Spider Climb: You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. **Passive:** Web: Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is Restrained by webbing. As an action, the Restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). &gt;See, I know that calling them attack, active, and passive sounds a little metagamey. I worded them that way mostly for my own convinience, and I might change the wording in the next update. **Spider Bite** Starting at 5th level, your spider forms Bite attack trait gets stronger, granting it the following benefits: * The poisons damage dice increase to d10s. * The saving throw increases to 13. * The poison overcomes resistance and immunity to poison damage. **The Eyes in the Trees** Starting at 10th level, you gain an additional active trait to use while in and out of animal form. **Superior Darkvision:** You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. This works in both nonmagical and magical darkness. **Superior Webbing** Starting at 15th level, your spider forms Web passive trait gets stronger, granting it the following benefits: * The webs range increases to 60/120 ft. * The DC to escape your web increases to 15. * The webs AC increases to 17. &amp;#x200B; **Skinchange Ability** Unicorn Changer You have mastered the ability to turn into one of natures most beautiful specimens: the Unicorn. **Unicorn Traits** Starting at 2nd level, while in your unicorn form, you gain 1 attack trait, 1 active trait, and 1 passive trait. **Attack:** Horn: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: 1d8 + Strength piercing damage. **Active:** Charge: If you move at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hit it with a melee Horn Attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. **Passive:** Teleportation: You magically teleport yourself and up to three willing creatures you can see within 5 ft. of you, along with any Equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location you are familiar with, up to 30 feet away. **Celestial Horn** Starting at 5th level, your unicorn forms Horn attack trait gets stronger, granting it the following benefits: * The horn now deals radiant damage. * You can fire a laser through it, increasing its range to 60 ft. * It deals an additional d8 of damage. **Supernatural Healer** Starting at 10th level, you gain an additional passive trait to use while in and out of animal form. **Heal Ally/Self:** You touch another creature either with your hands or your horn, depending on the form you are taking when you use this. The target magically regains 9 (2d6 + 2) Hit Points. In addition, the touch removes all Diseases and neutralizes all Poisons afflicting the target. You can use this on yourself. &gt;I might rework that into healing an amount of Hit Points equal to 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier so Wisdom feels a little more relevant. What do you think? **Superior Teleportation** Starting at 15th level, your unicorn forms Teleportation passive trait gets stronger, granting it the following benefits: * You can teleport up to 120 feet away. * After teleporting, you and up to three creatures of your choice that were teleported gain a +2 to their AC against the next attack that targets them. * You can teleport with up to three creatures. Not necessarily willing ones. &amp;#x200B; **Skinchange Ability** Wolf Changer You have mastered the ability to turn into natures ultimate team player: the Wolf. **Wolf Traits** Starting at 2nd level, while in your wolf form, you gain 1 attack trait, 1 active trait, and 1 passive trait. **Attack:** Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 2d6 + Strength modifier piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone **Active:** Pack Tactics: You have advantage on an Attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't Incapacitated. **Passive:** Howl: By howling as your turn, you can bolster your allies temporarily if they are within 30 feet of you. If they are conscious, they can take one additional action on their next turn. **Team Player** Starting at 5th level, your wolf forms Pack Tactics active trait gets stronger, granting it the following benefits: * Your Pack Tactics range increases to 10 feet. * While in range of your Pack Tactics, you and your allies attacks deal additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. * Pack tactics functions outside of animal form, but while outside of animal form, it uses the 2nd level version, not having increased range or damage. **Wild Barrage** Starting at 10th level, you gain an additional attack trait to use while in and out of animal form. **Multiattack:** In wolf form, you either make two bite attacks, or one bite attack before howling. In normal form, you either make two weapon attacks, one weapon attack and an Unarmed Strike, or two Unarmed Strikes. **Superior Bite** Starting at 15th level, your wolf forms Bite attack trait gets stronger, granting it the following benefits: * The bites damage dice increase to d10s. * On a hit, the target is knocked prone. &gt;Not gonna lie. I kinda miss Inhumane Boldness. Maybe I'll put in a Hellhound skinchanger? &amp;#x200B; So how is this? I know it's a pretty big update, and I *think* some good things were done here, but I still plan to do another update, as there's bound to be something to improve upon here. What do you think? **Is it any better? How would you change/improve what's here?** If you have any questions, comments, or criticism, put 'em down in the comments and I'll be there!"
1,vulnerability,dndnext,A Comprehensive Guide to Monster Resistance/Immunity in 5e,1,i2r595,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/i2r595/a_comprehensive_guide_to_monster/,2020-08-03 15:09:00," For the past year of playing D&amp;D and enjoying D&amp;D content (blogs, youtube videos, exc.) Ive heard time and time again a lot of things about different damage types in D&amp;D. The most common two things I hear are poison damage is the worst type and force is the best type. Ive always been a naturally skeptical person so I was curious to see if these were true in every case, and if so, to what degree. So I decided to actually look through the games stat-blocks and tally up *EVERY. SINGLE. MONSTER.* And its resistances to try to notice common patterns in resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities. Before I get started I want to lay down some ground rules and explain the way Ive prepared my research. For the sake of my own sanity Ill only be including stat-blocks from official, published WoTC books, Planeshift packages notwithstanding. What I define as a stat-block is one where, with no modifications or changes, you can take it and put it into a campaign and have everything you need in order to use it, hp, ac attacks, all just by looking at its page(es). This comes up more than you think. There are two variant vampires for example, I didnt include them because you have to derive parts of their stat block from the original vampire stats. The same applies to all the variant half dragons, shadow dragons, and dracoliches. Im also placing the bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage types separate from the others, because there are no other damage types with a non magical specification, something with fire resistance always has fire resistance, even if the fire is magical. I should also note that Im ignoring specific circumstances to resistances. For example, the Rakshasa has vulnerability to magical piercing damage, but ONLY if that damage is caused by a good aligned creature. I put this down as vulnerability to piercing damage, even though said vulnerability is only triggered under unique circumstances. The inverse applies towards monsters with resistance to non-magic and non silver weapons, its just counted as non-magical resistance. Another case to discuss with these damage types is the Demilich. The demilich has immunity to non magical damage, and resistance to magical damage. I counted this as non-magical immunity, and standard resistance even though the immunity is universal and the resistance is only active under specific circumstances. The one exception to this, is any resistance caused by a spell effect rather than an innate ability. One Final Disclaimer is that I counted all of this by hand, so its very likely the final results are off by +-5 for some of the larger numbers, and especially the number of monsters per book; so take these numbers with a grain of salt, Im only human. With that out of the way heres how I formated all my work. Terminology: NMRes = Non-Magical Resistance NMImm = Non-Magical Immunity Res = Resistance Vun = Vulnerability Imm = Immunity Formatting: Bludgeoning: 0 NMRes, 0 NMImm, 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Piercing: 0 NMRes, 0 NMImm, 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Slashing: 0 NMRes, 0 NMImm, 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm &amp;#x200B; Acid: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Cold: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Fire: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Force: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Lightning: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Necrotic: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Poison: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Psychic: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Radiant: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Thunder: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm &amp;#x200B; Calculating score: Vulnerability +4 Non Magic Resistance -1/2 Non Magic Immunity -2 Resistance -2 Immunity -4 These scores are very arbitrary and just based on my opinion. Im leaving all the information here if you want to score things based on your own opinion on how much these effects influence the value of an effect. Books Included in this study: 5e Monster Manual, Volos Guide to Monsters, Mordenkainens Tomb of Foes, Guildmasters Guide to Ravnica, Ebberon: Rising from the last War, Explorers Guide to Wildemount, Tales from the Yawning Portal Inn, Acquisitions Incorporated, Curse of Strahd, Descent into Avernus, Dragon of Icespire Peak, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Hoard of the Dragon Queen, Hunt for the Thessalhydra, Lost Mine of Phandelver, Out of the Abyss, PRinces of the Apocalypse, Rise of Tiamat, Storm Kings Thunder, Tomb of Annihilation, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage **Part 1: Big Three** If youre only interested in information from the main three books (Monster Manual, Volo's Guide, and Mordenkainen's), you can stop here, below is the final scoring under my arbitrary point system, the notes I have on the different elements, and the different scores I have for all of them. Total Monsters: 443 Bludgeoning: 132 NMRes, 32 NMImm, 11 Res, 5 Vun, 0 Imm Piercing: 132 NM Res, 32 NMImm, 17 Res, 1 Vun, 0 Imm Slashing: 132 NM Res, 32 NMImm, 9 Res, 0 Vun, 2 Imm &amp;#x200B; Acid: 30 Res, 0 Vun, 25 Imm Cold: 110 Res, 3 Vun, 27 Imm Fire: 82 Res, 13 Vun, 59 Imm Force: 1 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Total: -2 Lightning: 83 Res, 0 Vun, 18 Imm Necrotic: 26 Res, 0 Vun, 22 Imm Poison: 11 Res, 0 Vun, 189 Imm Psychic: 3 Res, 1 Vun, 18 Imm Radiant: 5 Res, 2 Vun, 1 Imm Thunder: 23 Res, 3 Vun, 1 Imm The scores are as follows ranked from highest scored to lowest: Force: -2 Radiant: -10 Thunder: -38 Psychic -74 Bludgeoning: -132 Necrotic: -140 Slashing: -156 Piercing: -160 Acid: -160 Lightning -238 Cold: -316 Fire -348 Poison -778 I want to stress now that just because something is highly resisted doesnt make it inherently bad, I certainly hope no one is going to see this and start making arguments on the internet about how fireball is actually trash because it deals the second lowest damage type. This does however, put into perspective just how underpowered poison is as an element, according to the (reasonably inaccurate) number of monsters for each book, in total over the three, 43% of all monsters are flat immune to poison damage. I genuinely didnt expect Thunder and bludgeoning to perform so well, I had a gut instinct that they would be good but I never would have thought that Thunder outperformed necrotic damage. A similar mindset goes for bludgeoning, I thought that skeletons were the only things that had a unique effect from one of the three and not the others. For those of you like me who want to know what these statistics are for the settings exclusive monsters like Eberron and Wildemount, the next section is for you. **Part Two: Setting Books** I should note that as of me writing this, I do not have Mythic Odysseys of Theros, and cant include anything from that book. If someone is willing to provide me with the properly formatted statistics from that book I will add it into this part. **Total Monsters: 138** Bludgeoning: 27 NMRes, 7 NMImm, 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Piercing: 27 NMRes, 7 NMImm, 0 Res, 2 Vun, 0 Imm Slashing: 27 NMRes, 7 NMImm, 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Acid: 2 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Cold: 14 Res, 1 Vun, 4 Imm Fire: 11 Res, 1 Vun, 6 Imm Force: 0 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Lightning: 10 Res, 0 Vun, 3 Imm Necrotic: 21 Res, 0 Vun, 3 Imm Poison: 8 Res, 0 Vun, 39 Imm Psychic: 17 Res, 0 Vun, 4 Imm Radiant: 8 Res, 3 Vun, 1 Imm Thunder: 6 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm **Part Three: Adventure Modules** For the sake of completion I decided to include the monsters in the assorted adventure books. I will make a disclaimer now, that while I did not count duplicate monster stats for overcoming resistances, I did count them when it comes to tallying the number of monsters in a book. This is pure lazyness on my part. I also want to note that I don't have a copy of 'D&amp;D vs Rick and Morty' so if there are any monsters in that, they weren't included. **Total Monsters: 465** Bludgeoning: 25 NMRes, 7 NMImm, 3 Res, 3 Vun, 0 Imm Piercing: 24 NMRes, 7 NMImm, 4 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Slashing: 24 NMRes, 7 NMImm, 1 Res, 0 Vun, 0 Imm Acid: 11 Res, 1 Vun, 2 Imm Cold: 18 Res, 1 Vun, 7 Imm Fire: 30 Res, 1 Vun, 10 Imm Force: 0 Res, 2 Vun, 1 Imm Lightning: 16 Res, 0 Vun, 11 Imm Necrotic: 8 Res, 0 Vun, 6 Imm Poison: 17 Res, 0 Vun, 55 Imm Psychic: 1 Res, 0 Vun, 7 Imm Radiant: 0 Res, 2 Vun, 0 Imm Thunder: 3 Res, 0 Vun, 2 Imm &amp;#x200B; **Part Four: Grand Total/Final Score** Monster Total (all books): 1046 Bludgeoning: 184 NMRes, 46 NMImm, 14 Res, 8 Vun, 0 Imm S: -180 Piercing: 183 NMRes, 46 NMImm, 21 Res, 3 Vun, 0 Imm S: -213.5 Slashing: 183 NMRes, 46 NMImm, 10 Res, 0 Vun, 2 Imm S: -211.5 Acid: 43 Res, 1 Vun, 27 Imm S: -190 Cold: 142 Res, 5 Vun, 38 Imm S: -416 Fire: 123 Res, 15 Vun, 75 Imm S: -486 Force: 1 Res, 2 Vun, 1 Imm S: +2 Lightning: 109 Res, 0 Vun, 32 Imm S: -346 Necrotic: 55 Res, 0 Vun, 31 Imm S: -234 Poison: 36 Res, 0 Vun, 283 Imm S: -1204 Psychic: 21 Res, 1 Vun, 19 Imm S: -114 Radiant: 13 Res, 7 Vun, 2 Imm S: -6 Thunder: 32 Res, 3 Vun, 3 Imm S: -64 &amp;#x200B; The new ranking from highest score to lowest is as follows: Force: +2 Radiant -6 Thunder -64 Psychic -114 Bludgeoning -180 Acid: -190 Slashing: -211.5 Piercing: -213.5 Necrotic: -234 Lightning: -346 Cold: -416 Fire: -486 Poison: -1204 Compared to the scoring for the main three books, not much has changed, Force damage is the only one to have a net positive, Poison is only resisted by 23% of the catalog instead of 43%, and Bludgeoning is now clearly the superior damage type for martial classes Coming into this project I was honestly hoping for some sort of big revelation that would change the way I thought about damage in 5E, and honestly I pretty much got the results I was expecting. I thought that bludgeoning would be better but only slightly, I knew force was the best and poison was the worst going in. Still I did really enjoy going through everything here. For a detailed list about this information per book/adventure module you can look at the google doc here: [URL"
2,vulnerability,dndnext,Does anyone have any suggestions for a good way to balance homebrew material?,1,i76tit,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/i76tit/does_anyone_have_any_suggestions_for_a_good_way/,2020-08-11 01:22:21,"I've been homebrewing for awhile, so I have experience on what's OP and what isn't. That being said, my current project has kept me occupied by its complexity. It's ready (I've posted the pretested information weeks ago) but my challenge is balancing things. The volume alone is an issue. The idea is to offer a lot of new companions/enemies of a new monster type. What I'm trying to do is put a numerical value on every little thing for these monsters (both as companions and enemies) so that I can a) gauge CR, b) make sure those with the same CR are within a certain range, and c) are reasonably balanced with official material. My current methodology is: 1. AC 2. Base HP - the number added before dice 3. Hit Dice average * 20 4. All 6 ability scores 5. 3 points/skill 6. -3 points/vulnerability 7. 3 points/resistance 8. 6 points/invulnerability 9. 9 points/immunity 10. 3 points for special senses (double for longer range or super powerful like tremorsense) 11. 3 points/non-combat ability 12. 6 points/combat ability 13. 12 points/legendary ability 14. average DMG/attack (without modifiers) If there's a better way, please tell me. I'm comparing multiple companions right now and my range goes from 163-218 between the first 10! I decided to compare them all on level 20 because of different hit dice, and base HP means some start off with more HP than others. I'm not sure if I should put more/less weight on certain aspects to offer a better comparison. The worst part is when there are multiple attack options for range/melee because they have different damage rolls, may have a multiattack option, saving throws, special effects, etc. Any help is appreciated! TL;DR I'm trying to ensure homebrew balance for companions and enemies and am seeking a way to measure each one. I have my own conceptual method above but would be happy to use something that already exists. I want enough balance because playtesting all of it would be exhausting and would help with future homebrew."
3,vulnerability,dndnext,Classes with negative effects?,1,i8uda3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/i8uda3/classes_with_negative_effects/,2020-08-13 15:48:06,"I've seen a few homebrew classes where they give you a negative trait, such as sunlight sensitivity, or vulnerability to a damage type. Are there any official classes or even subclasses that give negative features like this? It seems like classes are all meant to be 100% good and races are the part that can have negatives."
4,vulnerability,dndnext,Path to the Grave questions,1,if7w5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/if7w5v/path_to_the_grave_questions/,2020-08-24 04:03:23,"XGtE, pg20 &gt;Channel Divinity: Path of the Grave As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends. Is a save spell such as fireball an attack and therefor affected by Path to the Grave? Something like Fire Bolt seems to be an attack since it has you make a spell attack roll but PHB pg 193 only talks about attack rolls as part of a spell under Making An Attack and pg 192 lists Attack &amp; Cast A Spell separately. What about non-spell damage dealing abilities such as a Long Death monk's Touch of the Long Death? &amp;#x200B; If something is resistant to a damage type how does Path of the Grave modify that, if at all? Crawford's [answer](URL doesn't seem like much of an answer since the section in the PHB he seems to reference doesn't actually address resistance/vulerability conflicts. PHB, pg197 &gt;Damage Resistance and Vulnerability Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage. If a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has vulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it. Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage. Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as w ell as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters."
5,vulnerability,dndnext,Lycanthropes: Should they Regenerate?,1,iii3bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/iii3bg/lycanthropes_should_they_regenerate/,2020-08-29 09:34:11,"Okay, so I'm a perma-DM and I had a design thought. More of a thought experiment really. Should Lycanthropes regenerate or have some sorta healing ability? When you think of werewolves, maybe you're like me. Maybe you picture strong, savage animal hybrids who are tough to kill, resilient and can shrug off most minor injuries and even some major ones that would kill lesser men. And should they be critically injured, they're back on their feet in only a matter of days or even hours. In short, they have increased healing. In 5e however, lycanthropes are instead just immune to non-magical non-silvered BPS damage. And honestly it works well enough, but you you've ever played CoS or ran a group where there is infighting amongst the lycanthrope groups, you start to have some questions. Namely, how do werewolves kill other werewolves without help? In CoS specifically (not really a spoiler but just in case) &gt;!there is a werewolf group where there's some infighting and one leader killed another with their claws, IIRC!&lt; and RAW, this is sorta impossible. So here's my thought. If lycanthropes had a regeneration ability, instead of a damage immunity, that might make it more like the image in my head. Maybe they have something like: Regeneration. At the beginning of each of their turns, if they have at least 1 hit point, they regenerate 5 (or 10, or whatever other number) hit points. This ability doesn't work if they took damage from a magic weapon or a silvered weapon last turn. (Quick example, not a final edit on wording) This would make werewolves able to kill other werewolves, but it would take a long LONG time to do so. But that only further matches how I imagine that fight would go. ""Two werewolves, fighting for dominion over the herd, start tearing and biting at each other. Hours of savage combat later, one werewolf emerges victorious. Their skin torn to ribbons, their claws and fangs dripping with blood."" Something like that. Additionally, magic weapons and silvered weapons are still useful. Now, if you're running a session where there is a LOT of werewolves to keep track of, regenerate could quickly become a handful and difficult to track. For a solo boss, sure, but for an entire herd? Gross :/ So what about another approach to their increased healing factor? What if instead, they had this: Damage immunities. None Damage resistances. Bludgeoning, piercing and slashing Damage vulnerabilities. Silvered weapons Regenerate. Every minute, the werewolf regenerates 1 hit point. Wait, VULNERABILITY to silver damage? Okay okay, here's my thinking. Having flat resistance to BPS means that werewolves can 1: Be killed by early level adventurers without magic/silver gear and 2: Werewolves can still kill each other, but it'll still take longer. Then, by giving then vulnerability to silvered weapons (and magic weapons dealing BPS if you wanted) it would make them hit harder and be vastly more effective, but not a one-shot kill since they're still resistant to the BPS. Basically, damage would look like this. Normal weapon = 1/2 damage (resistance). Silvered weapon = full standard damage (2 from vulnerability then 1/2 from resistance). But, that basically works out to what they have already, right? Essentially yes, but it makes them able to be killed by parties without magic gear (still hard tho) and narratively it fixes some of the issues I see with lycanthropes. And then the little extra regeneration ability fits the narrative more, without giving you something to worry about in the midst of combat itself. 1 hit point every 10 rounds isn't going to do much to swing battles (which usually end 3-5 rounds in). But now a typical werewolf, with its 58 hit points, can take a short rest and be back to full without spending any hit dice (but what DM actually tracks that stuff?). But should the party be attacking some werewolves, and the werewolves start losing, they can run away, wait an hour, and come back at full for another round. Start losing again? Retreat, heal, and their back again. Every. Single. Hour. And it's not the DM fudging die rolls either (""oh yeah, they rolled max healing on their short rests, 3 short rests in a row, and yeah of COURSE they have that many hit dice""). Makes them a bit scarier as a repeat encounter in my book. Knowing they can heal back up quickly, why wouldn't they just charge through, hit the party for a bit, then leave. Sure, the party can heal too, but every time they get attacked, they're (likely) spending spell slots, hit dice, or other resources that only come back on a long rest (unless your party is entirely composed of fighters and warlocks). But the werewolves will always be back to their full fighting potential. And seeing who casts spells, etc, they'll know who to target with each attack. But I digress (tactics isn't really the focus of this post) So to recap, should werewolves of some form of regeneration? Either a rapid regen mid-combat that's disrupted via silver? Or a slow regen, and silver just hurts them more than other attacks? What do y'all think? Would you implement something like this into your campaign? If so, how?"
6,vulnerability,dndnext,Advice on the balance of a Homebrew,1,hkipws,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hkipws/advice_on_the_balance_of_a_homebrew/,2020-07-03 23:06:15,"I'm trying to create a homebrew race that is a sentient mannequin. It uses most of the warforged's racial features with a few small changes, but also comes with a few significant drawbacks. I'm trying to work out if the benefits outweigh the drawbacks or vice versa, as I want to make them balance each other out. \---------------------------------------------------- **The Mannequin** ***Ability Score Increase:*** Your Intelligence score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. ***Age:*** Mannequins come into life at full maturity, and their maximum lifespan remains a mystery; so far, mannequins have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects. ***Alignment:*** Mannequins find themselves attracted to rules and order, and possess no inherent inclination towards good or evil deeds, thus tending towards a Lawful Neutral alignment. ***Size:*** Despite possessing a humanoid build, mannequins are most often thinner and lighter than humans. They can be between 5 to just over 6 feet tall, and weigh between 90 to 135 pounds. Your size is Medium. ***Speed:*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. ***False Face:*** You have no real facial features, and both speak, hear and see via magic. You cannot be blinded, deafened or silenced by non-magical means. You cannot ingest anything. Your voice is a lesser form of telepathy, and travels as normal at the volume that you are trying to speak at, but is heard directly in the minds of those in range rather than audibly originating from any specific location. ***Construct Resilience***: You are a construct, not a humanoid. As a construct, you do not possess the same bodily requirements or vulnerabilities as mortals. You have Immunity to poison, poison damage and disease, and dont need to eat, drink, or breathe. You also don't need to sleep and cannot be forced to sleep by non-magical means, and when you take a long rest, you must spend at least six hours in an inactive, motionless state, rather than sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but it doesnt render you unconscious, and you can see and hear as normal. ***Hidden Compartment:*** Mannequins possess a number of hollows in their bodies accessible only via hidden latches that can be used for concealed storage of additional items. A mannequin may hold up to 1 cubic foot or 30 pounds of equipment in their chest cavity, as well as 5 pounds of equipment or  of a cubic foot of equipment in each of their 4 limbs. Items stored in these compartments only qualify as half of their normal weight for the purpose of carrying capacity. Weapons stored in limb compartments may be equipped as if drawing a weapon. ***Anti-Magic Vulnerability:*** As a creature animated entirely by magic, Mannequins are extremely vulnerable to antimagic effects. When within an anti-magic field at the start of your turn, roll a Constitution Save at the beginning of your turn with DC 20. On failure, you suffer Disadvantage to all Attack Rolls, Ability Checks, Saving Throws, and other checks modified by an Ability Score modifier, and halved speed for 1 round (this effect immediately ends if you exit the anti-magic field that caused it). Additionally, when targeted by Dispel Magic from a hostile creature, roll a CON Saving Throw against the casters spell save, receiving the above penalty on failure. ***Cold Hard Flesh:*** As a construct, your body does not naturally heal on its own. Resting does not restore your Hit Points. Healers Kits can stabilise you but may not restore your hit points with the Healer feat. ***Mendable:*** As a construct, you are healed in a very different way to biological creatures. You have the following effects: * When the [Mending](URL spell is cast on you, it has the following alterations: It has a casting time of 1 action. If you have 0 hit points you become stable. As part of the casting of mending the caster may expend any level of spell slot to cause you to regain a number of hit points equal to 1d8, plus their spellcasting ability modifier. For each level of the spell slot expended you regain an additional 1d8 hit points. Similar spells designed to fix objects may also heal you in the same way - in this case, the d8 becomes a d9 if the spell is level 2-3, d10 if the spell is levels 4-5, d11 if the spell is level 6-7, and d12 if the spell is level 8-9. Mending may also reattach your severed body parts as long as the body part is nearby, and the wound is smaller than a 1 foot wide cube (the width is increased by 1 foot per level of the spell slot expended to cast Mending). * Carpenter, metalworker, toymaker, or anyone else with the appropriate skill proficiencies and/or tools (such as carpenter or woodworking tools) are able to repair you. If they repair you, you regain your choice of hit points up to your missing amount, and can also have any missing body parts restored. Repairs take time equal to 1d5 minutes per restored hit point, and an additional 1d20 minutes per restored body part. **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice. \---------------------------------------- Hoping to get the opinions of people who've played a lot of campaigns and have a good idea of how often these features would come up in the average campaign."
7,vulnerability,dndnext,Storm cleric sorcerer and the grave cleric's channel.,1,hn5ppz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hn5ppz/storm_cleric_sorcerer_and_the_grave_clerics/,2020-07-08 09:28:50,"I've been playing in a game over discord recently due to the quarantine business and we have been testing out some 5e modules that aren't featured in adventurer's league. While exploring the new content our party unintentionally broke the game at 5th level. Our party consisted of an arcane archer, a grave cleric, and a storm sorcerer/tempest cleric (I was playing the sorcerer). During an encounter with a xorn and an umber hulk the grave cleric pointed out that chromatic orb synergises with his own channel divinity (which forces the next ATTACK on the target to be treated as vulnerability). I knew that if my next chromatic orb hit I would be able to maximize the spell damage using a channel of my own. However I didn't hit, I rolled a crit. Making the original total of 80 damage from a 3rd level chromatic orb become a whopping 160 damage. This is ridiculous considering we were only 5th level. Not much could stand up to an attack like that at our challenge rating. This combination of holy fury from two questionable cleric's channel divinities is a hilarious stunt that I couldn't have predicted if I tried. I will definitely remember the potential when building my own grave cleric. P.S. tl;dr"
8,vulnerability,dndnext,Death Knight Subclass,1,hpw3uo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hpw3uo/death_knight_subclass/,2020-07-13 01:24:46,"Ive never tried home brewing before, so this is a pretty rough idea for the Paladin subclass id like to implement one day. By all means, any changes and ideas are welcome. If its good, bad, or shit tier, let me know how I can fix it. Im still trying to come up with a reasonable Channel Divinity too, so ignore that section. Death Knight Subclass **As a Death Knight, you are an agent of Undead might. Discuss with your DM how you may have come into these new abilities. Attempted assassination? Cut down by another Death Knight? Cursed with a necrotic illness meant to resurrect you? Make sure to discuss this decision with your party as well to avoid any confusion. Or, take your helmet off and surprise them, either way works! Base Features **Typically, Paladin Oaths dont come with new features beyond spells and certain gains at higher levels. But choosing to be a Death Knight would change your character into an undead version of yourself. Like the Hollowed One from Matt Mercers Wildemount book. So these base features help reflect your new life. Revenance: You register as Undead to effects and spells that detect the undead creature type. Undeath: As an undead creature, you no longer require food, drink, or sleep. But you must still take time to focus yourself and refrain from any difficult activities to benefit from a short or long rest. Forsaken Mark: Death Knights retain their divine spell casting, but you find it nearly impossible to cast healing magic. Lay on Hands now heals for half of the original amount, rounded down. Necrotic Nature: You gain resistance to Necrotic damage, and vulnerability to Radiant damage. Spells/Abilities Channel Divinity: At 3rd level you gain the following Channel Divinity option. Plagued Blade: Starting at 3rd level, you can add your Constitution modifier to one damage roll from a melee attack per round. Starting at 7th level, you add your Strength modifier and Constitution modifier to the damage roll. At 15th level, you can apply this bonus to all melee attacks. Aura of the Dreadlord: Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you cant Feared while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of those aura increases to 30 feet. Extra Attack (2) At 15th level, you make three attacks when using the Attack action. **Death Knights have three attacks at a CR of 19. This seemed like a fair addition to the class. Brothers In Death: At 20th level, you gain the ability to summon a Death Knight by offering the skull of any humanoid creature and pouring that very same power into it. The Death Knight remains until its hit points go to 0 or the player who summoned it dies. The Death Knight follows your commands without question. In combat, roll for its initiative, and it will fight the same target to you do. The player decides when and what spells the Death Knight will use from its available list. Or you can use your bonus action to give it a new command such as protecting an ally or fighting a different enemy. You can only have one Death Knight summoned at a time. And if the Death Knight dies, the Paladin must finish a long rest before summoning another. **For Death Knight stats, please see page 47 of the Monster Manual. Death Knight Spells: These follow the same rule set as Oath spells. 3rd: Command, Compelled Duel, Searing Smite 5th: Hold Person, Magic Weapon 9th: Dispel Magic, Elemental Weapon 11th: Banishment, Staggering Smite 17th: Destructive Wave, Hellfire Orb **Hellfire Orb is nerfd down to the same dice rolls as Destructive Wave (5d6 Fire) and (5d6 Necrotic). Giving both a great closeup and ranged option without being way too strong for a 5th level spell. For reference, a 5th level Fireball has the potential for the same amount of damage at 10d6. **Keep this in mind when choosing to roleplay as a Death Knight. Much like monstrous creatures, many common folk may avoid you or even become hostile if they catch a glimpse of your undead appearance. Members of the churches would almost certainly see you as nothing more than an enemy. It might be best to keep that helmet on or any form of mask that will help hide you."
9,vulnerability,dndnext,Psychic Vulnerability on a Homebrew Race,1,hrvwpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hrvwpe/psychic_vulnerability_on_a_homebrew_race/,2020-07-16 06:55:24,"Background: In my homebrew campaign, the first session takes 50 years after a war (cliche, I know) where, in short, a mage opened up portals to other planes to use their creatures as soldiers. He also created a new race of people to use as soldiers, performing essentially an unholy abomination of a ritual that fused captured humans with energies from the Shadowfell and Feywild. The end result was supposed to be soldiers with the cunning of a shadar-kai, the chaos of an eladrin, and a pinch of human ingenuity. The result was just that, but with a bit of a mental illness problem resulting from the conflicting nature of creatures' origin. None of my players wanted to play the race at start, so I didnt have to worry about the effects of this mental problem immediately. So far, I've simply run them as being more like manic-depressives, switching between a joyful chaotic to a solemn lawful. However, the group is going to be having an ally of this race (named the Nequior) and my initial idea was to give them psychic vulnerability. But, that's a crazy big weakness. No other playable race has a damage vulnerability. The problem is, I want to create a mechanical weakness that stems from this inherent trait of theirs. Any suggestions?"
10,vulnerability,dndnext,Fighter Barbarian Advice,1,hwn7zo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hwn7zo/fighter_barbarian_advice/,2020-07-24 06:17:26,"Hello people of Reddit! I think I might need a new character soon, and I'm really tempted to try multiclassing. My loose character concept is a lizardfolk who was accidentally raised by dragonborn and taught emotional vulnerability (we are a pretty chill group when it comes to race conventions). Because of our character creation rules, I would take +2 constitution and +1 strength (instead of +1 wisdom). I think we will start at level 4 or 5. THE MULTICLASS PART BEGINS HERE Firstly, I'm not multiclassing for pure optimisation, but I do wanna make sure I'm not just wasting my levels. I'm thinking I should start with a level of barbarian, then 3 fighter levels (champion for more crits). After that I want to get to Berzerker barbarian path. I think I wanna use a shield and warhammer, with the duelist fighting style for the +2 damage. I would also have the bonus rage damage, would critical on 19 and get to attack with my bonus actions because of battle frenzy. I imagine I can also get quite a high AC, high con and the hungry jaws thing could be good for temporary HP, so I think I would be very hard to kill with second wind and rage resistance. I'm not sure if this build would be considered ""optimal"", but would it keep up with most level 6 characters? Ultimately, the build just sounds fun to me. What do you think? Thanks for reading. I've never looked into multiclassing before so I'm very new to it."
11,vulnerability,dndnext,Eldritch Adept (UA) - Here are the invocations you can take without being a warlock,38,hwtkxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hwtkxt/eldritch_adept_ua_here_are_the_invocations_you/,2020-07-24 12:34:13,"The recently released Eldritch Invocation Feat allows you to _ learn one Eldritch Invocation option of your choice from the warlock class. If the invocation has a prerequisite, you can choose that invocation only if youre a warlock and only if you meet the prerequisite."" I thought that others might find a clear list of the invocations that have no prerequisites useful. This list does not include other Unearthed Arcana Invocations. In a few cases I have commented on a borderline cheese use: Armor of Shadows You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. Note: this can be used by an Abjuration wizard to keep their arcane ward charged up. Beast Speech You can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot. Beguiling Influence You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills. Devils Sight You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. Eldritch Sight You can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell slot. Eyes of the Rune Keeper You can read all writing. Fiendish Vigor You can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components. Gaze of Two Minds You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creatures senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings. Mask of Many Faces You can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot. Misty Visions You can cast silent image at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. Note: Amazing for Wizards of the school of Illusion, particularly after they have ""Illusory Reality"" at 14th level. Thief of Five Fates You can cast bane once using a warlock spell slot. You cant do so again until you finish a long rest. Note: since this specifies a warlock spell slot, it hardly seems to matter on this list.but it fits the criteria. ----_----------- It's an interesting list. A lot of powerful abilities. Out of interest, below are the list of Invocations that have a level or spell prerequisite, but nothing else. As the feat is written, you could take 1 level of warlock and as long as your total level meets the requirements, you could use this feat to take these Invocations. I am not bothering with those that require a particular pact. Edit: Pluto_charon pointed out that the Eldritch Invocation description specifies that prerequisites are specifically referring to Warlock levels. So scratch the utility of most of the rest of this post. Ah well. Agonizing Blast Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip When you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit. Ascendant Step Prerequisite: 9th level You can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. Bewitching Whispers Prerequisite: 7th level You can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You cant do so again until you finish a long rest. Cloak of Flies Prerequisite: 5th level As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until youre incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action. The aura grants you advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage). Once you use this invocation, you cant use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Dreadful Word Prerequisite: 7th level You can cast confusion once using a warlock spell slot. You cant do so again until you finish a long rest. Note: again, the requirement of a warlock spell slot of 4th level or higher limits the utility of this for the feat. Eldritch Spear Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip When you cast eldritch blast, its range is 300 feet. Ghostly Gaze Prerequisite: 7th level As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you dont already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your concentration ends (as if you were concentrating on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images. Once you use this invocation, you cant use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Note: this may be the most unique and flavorful use of this feat. Gift of the Depths Prerequisite: 5th level You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. You can also cast water breathing once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Grasp of Hadar Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your eldritch blast, you can move that creature in a straight line 10 feet closer to you. Lance of Lethargy Prerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with your eldritch blast, you can reduce that creatures speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn. Maddening Hex Prerequisite: 5th level, hex spell or a warlock feature that curses As a bonus action, you cause a psychic disturbance around the target cursed by your hex spell or by a warlock feature of yours, such as Hexblades Curse or Sign of Ill Omen. When you do so, you deal psychic damage to the cursed target and each creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The psychic damage equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage). To use this invocation, you must be able to see the cursed target, and it must be within 30 feet of you. Note: could be interesting for a Ranger Master of Myriad Forms Prerequisite: 15th level You can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot. Note: one of the most powerful uses of this feat, though not likely worth both a warlock dip AND a feat. Minions of Chaos Prerequisite: 9th level You can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot. You cant do so again until you finish a long rest. Mire the Mind Prerequisite: 5th level You can cast slow once using a warlock spell slot. You cant do so again until you finish a long rest. Note: another requiring warlock slots, so you need 5th level warlock dip. One with Shadows Prerequisite: 5th level When you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction. Note: fun for rogues but hard to justify a feat and a level dip. Otherworldly Leap Prerequisite: 9th level You can cast jump on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components. Note: Fun for Monks and Grung! Relentless Hex Prerequisite: 7th level, hex spell or a warlock feature that curses Your curse creates a temporary bond between you and your target. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the target cursed by your hex spell or by a warlock feature of yours, such as Hexblades Curse or Sign of Ill Omen. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the cursed target. Note: another good ranger option. Sculptor of Flesh Prerequisite: 7th level You can cast polymorph once using a warlock spell slot. You cant do so again until you finish a long rest. Shroud of Shadow Prerequisite: 15th level You can cast invisibility at will, without expending a spell slot. Note: Holy Baggins ****ring! Now we are talking. If you were already considering a warlock dip, this feat just got a lot more interesting. Sign of Ill Omen Prerequisite: 5th level You can cast bestow curse once using a warlock spell slot. You cant do so again until you finish a long rest. Tomb of Levistus Prerequisite: 5th level As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in ice, which melts away at the end of your next turn. You gain 10 temporary hit points per warlock level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. Immediately after you take the damage, you gain vulnerability to fire damage, your speed is reduced to 0, and you are incapacitated. These effects, including any remaining temporary hit points, all end when the ice melts. Once you use this invocation, you cant use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Note: this is an interesting option. Quite a benefit for a squishy sorcerer or rogue who was considering a dip. Sorlock just got a lot tougher. Also handy for a fighter or even a barbarian. Trickster's Escape Prerequisite: 7th level You can cast freedom of movement once on yourself without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Visions of Distant Realms Prerequisite: 15th level You can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot. Note:. Edit: mystickord pointed out that the Divination feature requires the use of a spell slot, so my note below about it being broken is not relevant. So ignore this next part which I leave in purely to keep the comment understandable. I am on mobile and can't do strike through text. again WOW. On a Divination wizard this is straight up BROKEN. Writing this whole list was worth finding this. Level 6 divination ability says ""When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and cant be higher than 5th level."" Arcane Eye is 4th level. So with this you can refill ALL your level 1-3 slots. Can someone check me on this? Whispers of the Grave Prerequisite: 9th level You can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot. Witch Sight Prerequisite: 15th level You can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight."

Hit Points at 1st level: 12 + your Constitution modifier Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d12 (or 7) + your Constitution modifier per Skinchanger level after 1st **Proficiencies** Armor: None Weapons: Simple weapons, improvised weapons, nets Tools: Cooks Utensils, Weavers Tools, Woodcarvers tools, or one musical instrument of your choice Saving Throws: Wisdom, Constitution Skills: Choose two from Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, and Survival **Equipment** You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: * (a) a whip or (b) any simple weapon * (a) a bow or (b) any martial weapon * An explorers pack and 1d12 arrows ### Unarmored Defense Beginning at 1st level, while you are wearing no armor and not wielding a shield, your AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier. **The Wilderperson** Outside in the wilderness is where you belong. It is your home, and you know it like it's the back of your hand. This grants you the following benefits: * You ignore difficult terrain. * You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena. * You gain proficiency in the Nature skill if you dont already have it. When you roll a Nature check, you add double your proficiency bonus to the roll, instead of your normal proficiency bonus. In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when travelling for an hour or more: * Difficult terrain doesnt slow your groups travel. * If led by you, your group cant become lost except by magical means. * Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. * If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. * If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. * When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. **Skinchange Ability** When you reach 2nd level, choose one animal that you can change into. * Unicorn * Giant Spider * Giant Wolf Your choice grants you features at 2nd level, and again at 5th, 9th, and 13th level. Some are for while you are in your animal form, some are not, and some are for both scenarios. Your transformation lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious. You can also end your transformation on your turn as a bonus action. Once you have transformed the number of times shown for your Skinchanger level in the Transformations column of the Skinchanger table (merely shown as bullet points in this post), you must finish a long rest before you can rage again. While you are transformed, the following rules apply: * Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them. * When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious. * You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Call Lightning, that you've already cast. * You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense, or unless the features of your animal say that you can. * You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form. **Wilderpeoples Fighting Style** At 3rd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty, which you have learned after years of spending time in the wild. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. * Primal Savage: You can channel the savagery of an animal, allowing you to nonmagically replicate the effects of the Primal Savagery cantrip at will. * Throwing Weapon: You can throw any weapon that you wield, and you can draw it as part of the weapons attack. The thrown range is equal to your Strength score. * Unarmed Brutality: Your unarmed strikes deal 1d6 + 2 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage. You gain benefits from your Wilder Fighting Style only while you are not in animal form. **Ability Score Improvement** When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. **Animalistic Fighting** Beginning at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Additionally, while in your animal form, you can take one additional action granted to you by the animal that you choose. **Fleet of Foot** Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. **Supreme Health** Starting at 10th level, thanks to the healthy and purely natural condition of your body, you are immune to disease and poison. **Transformation Duration** Starting at 14th level, the duration of your transformation increases by an amount of minutes equal to one half of your Proficiency Bonus (rounded down) (minimum of 1 minute). **Feral Senses** At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened. **Nature Unleashed** Starting at 20th level, you have become so close to nature that you are practically a beacon of its own ferocity. Your Strength and Constitution scores each increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24. &amp;#x200B; **Skinchange Ability** Unicorn Changer You have learned to transform into one of the worlds most beautiful specimens: the Unicorn. They are known for their radiant and healing magic, and it is just as potent in you as it is in other unicorns. **Unicorn Fighting** Beginning when you choose this Skinchange Ability at 2nd level, both while you are and are not transformed, you can charge straight towards your opponents. Charge: If you move at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hit it with an Unarmed Strike on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. **Unicorn Actions** Beginning when you choose this Skinchange Ability at 2nd level, while transformed, you have three additional uses of your action. * Charge: If you move at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hit it with a Horn Attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. * Heal Ally/Self (3/transformation): You touch another creature with your horn. The target magically regains 9 (2d6 + 2) Hit Points. In addition, the touch removes all Diseases and neutralizes all Poisons afflicting the target. Alternatively, you can use this on yourself. * Horn: Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft ., one target. Hit: 1d8 + Strength piercing damage. **Magic Resistance** Starting at 5th level, while you both are and are not transformed, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. **Unicorn Actions** Starting at 9th level, you gain two additional uses of your action to use while in Unicorn form: * Teleport (2/transformation): You magically teleport yourself and up to three willing creatures you can see within 5 ft. of you, along with any Equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location you are familiar with, up to 120 feet away. * Counterspell (2/transformation): As a reaction, you can cast the Counterspell spell if you or an ally that is within 5 feet of you are the target of a spell. **Nonmagic Resistance** Starting at 13th level, while you both are and are not transformed, you are resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. &amp;#x200B; Wolf Changer You have learned to transform into natures ultimate team player: the Wolf. They are known for their keen senses, bravery, and their capabilities within a team. **Keen Senses** Beginning when you choose this Skinchange Ability at 2nd level, both while you are and are not transformed, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to track a creature or lead your group through wild lands. **Wolf Actions** Beginning when you choose this Skinchange Ability at 2nd level, while transformed, you have three additional uses of your action. * Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 2d6 + Strength modifier piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone * Howl (3/transformation): By howling, you can bolster your allies temporarily. If they are conscious, they can take one additional action on their next turn. If they are unconscious and they have 0 Hit Points, they now have 1 Hit Point. * Multiattack: You make two bite attacks. **Wolf Heart** Starting at 5th level, while you both are and are not transformed, you have advantage on an [Attack](URL roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't Incapacitated. The range of this trait increases to 15 ft. at 13th level. **Wolf Actions** Starting at 9th level, you gain two additional uses of your action to use while in Wolf form: * Pounce (2/transformation): You can jump onto a creature that is within range of your long jump distance. The target must succeed a DC 13 Strength check or be knocked prone, and the target is restrained (escape DC = 11). While you restrain the target, your movement speed drops to 0. * Snarl (2/transformation): You can snarl and growl in an attempt to frighten an enemy that is within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier) or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration. While frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesnt have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature. **Inhuman Boldness** Starting at 13th level, while you both are and are not transformed, you cannot be frightened or charmed, and magic cannot put you to sleep. If an ally of yours is within 10 feet of you, this affects them as well. &amp;#x200B; **Skinchange Ability** Spider Changer You have learned to transform into one who lurks in the deepest and darkest of lands: the Spider. The dark is where you belong, and when foes cross your path, the dark is all theyll ever see. **Lurker in the Black** Beginning when you choose this Skinchange Ability at 2nd level, both while you are and are not transformed, you can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Additionally, your attacks have advantage while you are fighting in dark conditions. **Giant Spider Actions** Beginning when you choose this Skinchange Ability at 2nd level, while transformed, you have three additional uses of your action. * Spider Climb: You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. * Web (3/transformation): Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is Restrained by webbing. As an action, the Restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). * Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1d8 + Strength modifier piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, the target is stable but Poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining Hit Points, and is Paralyzed while Poisoned in this way. **Web Sense** Starting at 5th level, while you both are and are not transformed and in contact with web, you know the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web. Additionally, you ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing. **Spider Actions** Starting at 9th level, you gain two additional uses of your action to use while in Spider form: * Web Terrain (2/Transformation): By spraying web on the ground in front of you, you can turn a 45 ft. cone of ground in front of you into difficult terrain for 3 rounds. While you move in this terrain, your movement speed increases by 5 feet. * Greater Bite (2/transformation): Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2d6 + Strength modifier piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, the target is stable but Poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining Hit Points, and is Paralyzed while Poisoned in this way. The poison damage from this attack ignores resistances and immunities to poison damage. **The Eyes in the Trees** Starting at 13th level, while you both are and are not transformed, you cannot be blinded, you can see invisible creatures, and you can see in both nonmagical and magical darkness perfectly. Additionally, you gain a +5 to your Passive Perception score. &amp;#x200B; So... What do you think? **Is this any good? Is it in dire need of balancing?** Let me know in the comments, and I'll be there! I know that there is a LOT to unpack here, so **don't be afraid to type up some lengthy comments.**"
13,vulnerability,dndnext,Homebrew Vampire PC Race,1,i0t0p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/i0t0p3/homebrew_vampire_pc_race/,2020-07-31 06:00:17,"Im trying to put together a balanced homebrew vampire race for player characters for a setting where (at least young) vampires might be at more of a player character power level than a legendary monster. Im using Detect Balance (URL a beautiful resource if you dont already know about it) to keep this race balanced. Vampire: Ability Score Increase: +1 int Superior Darkvision: darkvision 120 feet Sunlight sensitivity Necrotic resistance Radiant vulnerability Disease resistance Undead Nature: No need to eat or breathe. May fill rests with light activity instead of sleep. Martial training: light and medium armour proficiency, and proficiency in one martial weapon of choice. Fangs: a 1d4 piercing natural weapon that can only be used on humanoids or beasts grappled by you, restrained, or incapacitated. If the target is not reduced to 0 hit points, make a wisdom saving throw with dc 8 + the number of days since you last Fed. On a failure, you spend your next turn attempting to attack the same creature with your Fangs. The Thirst: at the end of every day, make a con saving throw with dc 1 + the number of days since you last fed. On a failure, suffer one level exhaustion that can only be cured by Feeding. Feeding: You can feed by reducing a creature to 0 hit points using your Fangs. When you do, cure one level of exhaustion caused by the Thirst. You may also attempt to feed on deceased beasts or humanoids that have been dead for no more than 10 day. If you do, make a con saving throw with dc depending on how long the target has been dead, as shown in the chart below. On a success, take poison damage shown in the chart below, cure one level of exhaustion caused by the Thirst, and reset the number of days since you have fed. On a failure, take twice the amount of poison damage listed. 0-24 hours: DC 12: 1d4 1-3 days: DC 16: 1d6 4-10 days: DC 18: 1d8 Language: Common + 1 other language spoken in life Subrace: When a vampire awakens, they find themselves with an affinity for a kind of animal vampires have connections with. These aspects influence the way that the individuals vampirism manifests, and is usually determined by the persons inclinations and aptitudes when they were alive. Known vampire aspects include the Wolf, the Bat, and the Spider. Wolf Aspect: Ability Score Increase: +2 str Skill proficiency: athletics Vampiric magic Bat aspect: Ability Score Increase: +2 dex Skill proficiency: stealth Vampiric magic Spider aspect: Ability Score Increase: +1 int, +1 dex Skill proficiency: arcana Vampiric magic This is still an early work in progress, so I know it isnt perfect yet. I chose int as the stat they all get because I want them all to have an aptitude for necromancy (as inspired a little by warhammer fantasy vampires). The vampiric magic feature for each subrace will be a standard delayed magic feature (cantrip, 1st level spell at 3rd level, 2nd level spell at 5th level) using int, with spells thematic to each subrace. I am considering replacing this with a cantrip, or some other spell arrangement. I am also debating what to do about their creature type: I could make them undead instead of humanoid, which makes sense, but does vary significantly from how official races tend to work (even warforged are humanoid!). I could make them two types, humanoid and undead, like the UA centaur, but this could get even weirder than just making them undead. I could also just leave them as humanoids, and justify it as vampires in this setting sitting in a strange realm between life and undeath, and still being affected by healing spells etc because they do still have blood in their veins. I know this is quite different from classic dnd monster manual vampires, but Im trying to make it fit in with player character races as best I can. I would love any feedback you have on the balance, as well as any suggestions or ideas you might have for modifications or added features. Thank you!"
14,vulnerability,dndnext,I enjoy kobolds that are more than low-level punching bags or dragon-obsessed PCs. Maybe you do too. Everything you need to make kobolds unique in one page.,15,gz4qo4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/gz4qo4/i_enjoy_kobolds_that_are_more_than_lowlevel/,2020-06-09 04:21:52,"*This is an excerpt from One Page Lore: Fantasy Folk, which covers 20 folk in addition to kobolds. Its in the wild now, and theres 3 ways to get it listed at the bottom.* Whether you love them or loath them (I personally love them), someone at the table is trying to dunk on kobolds. Theyre often used as low-level fodder, but theyre way more unique and fun than that. Theyre tiny, distant relatives to dragons, and they have many of the same features and abilities as dragons, though to a far lesser extent. Their dragon-like form also grants them features even dragonborn lack. So lets look at kobolds as a folk, focusing on what makes them unique as a group occupying our fantasy worlds. And I like to keep it brief but dense, so we'll keep it at one page worth of text. # Kobolds Kobolds look unmistakably draconic. Their serpentine bodies, long snouts, talons, and vestigial wings make them appear like miniature dragons. However, every feature that invokes the draconic is a lesser imitation compared to those of a dragon. **Physicality** Kobolds are small, dragon-like creatures. When on their hind legs, they stand 3-4 ft. tall. Their slender tails can be as long as half their standing height. Their tail can possess several different dragon-like weapons, such as a thagomizer, bony club, poisonous stinger, spines, or quills. Kobolds often have other draconic characteristics, such as horns, spines, dorsal fins, or whiskers. Their arms and legs all end in matching three-taloned claws, and they can use any of them as hands. Protective scales cover them from head to tail, and the color of their scales can range drastically from bright hues to deep blacks. Combinations of colors are common. A kobold's large eyes aid them when seeing in the dark but also make hiding their emotions difficult. **Vestigial Wings** Most kobolds have 2-4 pairs of vestigial or malformed wings. Some are too small to use for flight, while others are simply nubs that never fully sprout wings. Smaller kobolds can sometimes train enough to use their wings for gliding, so long as their wings are large enough to do so. While rare, some kobolds grow wings that are both functional and large enough to fly as effectively as birds of prey. **Draconic Heritage** While inconsistent, kobolds possess qualities seen among dragons. These can include breath weapons (such as fire, ice, acid, etc.), projecting an aura that invokes powerful emotions or produces other effects, or astounding senses. Some also have limited power over specific elements or energies, such as fire, earth, and sound. This heritage also comes at the cost of a specific vulnerability. Dragons are weak to different elements or energies, and those who know a kobolds draconic heritage may exploit this weakness. Kobolds' connection to dragons goes further back than recorded history, leaving much of their origins a mystery. **Blood of Dragons** Legend states bathing in the blood of dragons will allow the anointed to see the future. Since kobolds have dragon blood within them, some can use this rare gift. When a kobold bleeds from a wound, the blood rushing over their scales grants them the gift of future sight. This moment of clarity allows them to survive desperate situations and become triumphant when the odds are against them. In their greatest time of need, the blood of their ancestors comes to their aid. **Life Cycle** When reproducing, Kobolds lay 100-200 eggs at once. The eggs are very small, making freshly-hatched kobolds minuscule in size and extremely vulnerable. It's rare for a kobold to nest more than once in their life. Hatchling kobolds are ravenous and will eat whatever fits into their mouths. The nutritional value of the food given to kobolds within their first few months will often determine how big they will become. If well-fed, kobolds reach full size in about two years. Despite being full size, they do not mature as quickly as they grow, reaching full mental maturity at around 20 years. Kobolds live around 50-60 years. As they reach an advanced age, their scales begin to soften, eventually falling off entirely. The skin beneath their scales is smooth and glossy, still displaying the color of their draconic heritage. **Qualities** **Small of Stature**  Your small form grants you advantages larger folk miss out on **Serpentine**  Your long body grants you greater stability **Prehensile** **Feet**  You can use your feet as effectively as your hands **Resistance**  Due to your draconic heritage, you have resistance to specific elements, such as acid, fire, or magic **Draconic** **Heritage**  You have powers directly related to the dragons in your ancestry **Scales**  Thick scales protect you from head to tail **Tail** **Weapon**  Your tail is a powerful weapon **Claws**  Your claws make for an effective tool in many situations **Optional Bipedal**  You can walk on two or four legs, each granting different advantages **Powerful Aura**  You have a single, powerful aura that induces fear, stirs compassion, or even burns those who get close **Drawbacks** **Small**  Your size can lead to bigger folk pushing you around **Draconic** **Heritage**  You have the same weaknesses as your draconic ancestors **Prehensile Feet**  Tools designed for folk with 10 fingers can be difficult to use **Tail Weapon**  With a weapon always available, some will see you as a threat **Powerful Aura**  Sometimes you dont want to affect others with your aura *This is an excerpt from One Page Lore: Fantasy Folk, which covers 20 folk in addition to kobolds.

With Shared Burden, can you give yourself damage that an ally might normally take? When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to choose up to 5 other willing creatures you can see. Distribute the damage taken between the original target and the chosen creatures. Each creature must take at least 1 damage. Apply any damage resistance or vulnerability of the creatures involved after you distribute the damage. And I dont think I can for this question, but can I share my damage with others?"
16,vulnerability,dndnext,Now that it's had time to simmer what do people think about the Dark Tides of Bilgewater content?,5,h8k9oz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/h8k9oz/now_that_its_had_time_to_simmer_what_do_people/,2020-06-14 11:18:56,"[Crossover content with ~~League of Legends~~ Legends of Runeterra was released on D&amp;D Beyond about 3 days ago](URL and a lot of people got hyped about it. Now that people have had time to look everything over and think about it I'm curious what people think about the content. In my opinion: #SUBCLASSES ###Path of the Depths Barbarian It's... odd. Some of the abilities feel a lot stronger than others. I think the Dredge Line ability gives this Barbarian a very unique role that puts it somewhere between Cavalier Fighter and Battle Master Fighter. Ghostwater Dive feels OP but looking at it objectively it's not *that* bad, though I still think it should have a limited number of uses equal to your CON mod or something. My sentiments to Ghostwater Dive only grows when you get access to Depth Charge. Manifestations of the Deep really vary in utility. Eyes of the Deep is amazing if you need it, Arms of the Deep would be crazy if grappling in 5e didn't suck, Heart of the Deep feels weak as shit (it's Second Wind but with a d12 instead of a d10 :v), Soul of the Deep is literally just what Beserker Barbarians can already do, and Armor of the Deep is kinda just universally good. ###Renegade Fighter Easily one of the best ""gun"" subclasses I've seen in some time. My previous pick for the best ""gun"" subclass would be various homebrew versions of the Cannonsmith Artificer, which could apply upgrades to their weapons. Seeing as Renegade can do the same it's quite good in my eyes! Both guns have their strengths and weaknesses, the level 10 ability is interesting if you want to play more close-ranged (which is an option!) and the level 18 ability is pretty crazy and a lot of fun. It kinda ticks me off that the guns you make aren't actually ""weapons."" The fact that you don't have to track ammo with the guns is a little odd however, but I've never liked tracking ammo in 5e to begin with. The big issue however is that you can't get a +1 gun or anything like that which is why the level 7 ability effectively only exists to make your ""weapons"" usable akin to Monks with Ki-Empowered Strikes (instead of giving you new abilities.) I think most DMs would just rule the guns as weapons for the sake of +1 weapons and the likes I have a few other minor nitpicks. For one it's another Charisma class; *joy.* I get that Miss Fortune and Caitlin are titty-babes but I still groan seeing a CHA class that really doesn't have an excuse to be CHA-based. I also think that Scoundrels Wit feels like it's giving the subclass added skill proficiencies for proficiencies' sake. You can easily stack this subclass with Rogue and Ranger to have a character with an ungodly amount of skills, and that isn't even mentioning the Skilled Feat. But I mean Bards get Jack of All Trades at level 2 so... But probably my biggest nitpick is the power level of the upgrades. It really seems like your meant to swap between upgrades (especially with Right Gun for the Job at level 15) but the strength of the upgrades vary massively. I'm getting very Warlock Eldritch Invocation-esque feelings towards the gun upgrades, where some are a lot stronger than others. Just to sum up my thoughts: **Minor Firearm Upgrades** * *Blade and Black Powder* is literally mandatory to play this subclass as a pseudo-melee build, which is what the level 10 ability encourages. It also gives you an extra attack which is very strong. It's not something you're always going to take but it feels like there's no reason not to take this unless you're planning to keep as far away as possible at all times. (And at that point just grab the sniper rifle.) * *Caliber Net* is only good if you have the pistol, which is ironic given that it's directly lifted from Caitlin in LoL. (The ""sniper"" champion.) It's neat but it feels gimmicky. * *Collateral Damage* is fucking bad. Beyond situational. Good at dealing with hoards but at that point just play Hunter Ranger. * *Crosshairs* is INSANE. I like how they saw all the complaints with Class Feature Variants for Rogue being able to sit still for Advantage and decided ""let's give that to *Fighter*, the class that attacks FOUR TIMES."" This is definitely better for the Sniper form but it feels like there's literally no reason not to take the ability to just *give yourself Advantage.* * *Double-Barrel* is MANDATORY if you want to use the Sniper Form. It literally doubles your chance to hit and potential damage output. Have no idea why you'd ever not take this upgrade since there's very little that stands in comparison. * *Smoke Screen* is very interesting and definitely feels like the most well-balanced upgrade. I think it will result in the most interesting and exciting gameplay moments (much like it's LoL counterpart on Graves) but it definitely feels weaker than the likes of Crosshairs or Double-Barrel. **Major Firearm Upgrades** * *Barrage* is bad. Too situational to be once per short rest. * *Double Up* is overly situational. It's more damage yeah but the poke you do to the other target is so negligible, and focus-fire is the name of the game in 5e. * *Lightning Round* is okay? It suffers because it's effectively a Dragonborn's breath weapon. It's basically on-par with Barrage really. * *Trial by Fire* is by FAR the best major firearm upgrade. It's flat out better than Double Up except for at very early levels. Even if Fire damage is commonly resisted that doesn't matter by the point you hit level 7. It's obviously better for the pistol form (since you can hit 4 times with the pistols as opposed to once with the sniper) but even then the sniper does better with TbF instead of DU. But the one good thing about the Renegade Fighter is that it's very easy to homebrew new upgrades for the subclass, akin to Warlock Invocations. I'm interested to see if homebrew upgrades pop up, particularly major upgrades that are better than the ones we have currently. ###Wild Card Rogue Wild Card is really cool but I'm going to be honest it feels like they designed half a subclass and then had an intern do the rest. I mean let's start with the obvious: Loaded Dice and Dragonchess feel like they had far less work put into them than the Playing Cards. The cards all have unique abilities while the dice are just Lore Bard's Cutting Words, and the Dragonchess set just feels weird since none of the options really feel that impactful imo. (Not to mention that all the Dragonchess options eat up your Bonus Action that you could be using for Cunning Action.) The teleport feels a bit overpowered to me but I guess it's balanced since it's once per short rest. It's effectively a Warlock spell (which makes me think this subclass would be fun for a Warlock multiclass.) Joker Wild feels OP (and is more-or-less a direct lift from Shadow Sorcerer) but it's a capstone ability so it's fine; no worse than ""you can sneak attack twice"" (Scout) or ""you steal someone's spell."" (Arcane Trickster) Twist of Fate is **very** interesting. I've been playing XCOM: Chimera Squad a lot and the ability to swap initiative around in that game plays a great deal of strategy in that game. I think it makes the Wild Card subclass very interesting for more tactical players. My only complaint is that it essentially forces DMs to reveal initiative, unless they tweak the ability to allow the Rogue to swap initiative places at any time (except for at Round 0.) But I do think the ability to let a low-initiative tank or crowd-control caster go first would help Rogues a lot, since usually Rogues want to go later in initiative to get Sneak Attacks off. Again it really feels like half the abilities were really thought out (Twist of Fate, playing card Wild Cards Gambit, arguably the teleport) while the other features were copy-pasted from other subclasses. But I think the class functions well and is very fun. Also 30 foot range bonus action Guidance sounds good until you realize that the only in-combat skill checks anyone is going to do is Grapple checks (rare) or you doing stealth checks to hide so you can sneak attack (which you're probably going to succeed at anyways.) I didn't know where to mention that other than here. #MAGIC ITEMS It's all lifted straight from League of Legends which is cool to me as a LoL fan. A little ticked that there weren't more LoR items though, as there are a lot of cards in LoR that are pretty cool. Also ticked that they still use League's item artwork which is extremely low-res. * **Adaptive Helm** - Feels like an objectively better Armor of Resistance if you can spare the reaction. It's particularly good since it isn't actually ""armor"" which means that Monks and Barbarians can use it. I feel like non-Bear Barbarians will get a lot of use out of this item if a DM gives it out, though any class that doesn't use its reactions too much will find use for it. * **Banshees Veil** - Part of me wishes that this could be used by non-spellcasters but Counterspell is never a bad thing. Obvious pickup for characters who can't get Counterspell innately: Bards are always good at counterspell, Warlocks don't get many spell slots, and for some reason Cleric really jumps out at me. * **Bilgewater Cutlass** - +1 Scimitar with a slow. Slightly cooler magic Scimitar; great in a pirate campaign. (Ghosts of Saltmarsh?) Where's my Hextech Gunblade magic item Rito plz. * **Blade of Ledros** - Talk about cursed item! I feel like the curse is a bit much but if a party has Remove Curse they can easily just un-curse the wielder every night so they can sleep without the blade. But it's definitely a great RP item and I feel like it would be fun to see how PCs react in-character. * **Boots of Swiftness** - Ring of Free Action that also gives 10 extra movement speed. Just universally useful but not something you're going to actively search for. * **Dead Mans Plate** - Honestly a little disappointed by it since it's so unlike the League of Legends counterpart, but it's certainly not a bad thing. Being able to bodycheck people for a d8 of extra damage and knock them over is definitely helpful. I actually think this might be a favorite among Medium Armor Barbarians (yes you can wear armor as a Barbarian!) since you'd get advantage on the Shove. * **Powder Keg** - Just a very well designed common magic item and I could easily see DMs selling these at something like 50 gold a pop. There have been dozens of different ""gunpowder"" magic items in 5e's lifespan and this is another to add to the pile. #MONSTERS * **Abyssal Eye** - I like it as low-level underwater Beholder. A very good monster to put into early levels of a Saltmarsh campaign I feel. * **Barkbeast** - This is my favorite creature from this book. This is a great low level undead that still poses a threat due to pack tactics and the ability to reduce your max HP. Remove the fire vulnerability (or even just keep it) and you have the perfect zombie dogs! * **Dragon Shark** - Kinda sucks that we don't have artwork for it, *really* sucks that this monster is really underwhelming for a low CR dragon. But ""low CR"" is sort of the start and end of this monster. Can't give breath weapons to a CR 5. * **Ironback** - Tortle lol * **Pool Shark** - I actually really like these guys! I think it's a great stat block for a bar patron in case the party wants to start a bar fight! Rename ""Cue Stick"" to ""Broken Bottle"" and boom you've got a rabble-rouser for the Barbarian to lock heads with! * **Powder Monkey** - Congratulations DMs here's another creature that ""the Pokemon trainer"" of the party is going to want as a pet. Also yes they do shit out gunpowder and throw it at you. Jokes aside I do feel like they're good, low CR enemies to put on a more magical pirate ship... such as one in Bilgewater! * **Wharf Rat** - This is pretty much the definition of a +1 Rat. I really don't think this fits any setting other than Bilgewater. That being said Druids are going to have a blast turning into these fucking things if you run a Bilgewater campaign. As far as the NPCs go: * **Commander Ledros** - More menacing in the card game lol. I think he's definitely good as a boss for a low level party but as a character he's rather underwhelming. * **Miss Fortune** - Probably my favorite of the NPC stat blocks, and I'm not just saying that because I play Miss Fortune in LoL. She can easily be reskinned to serve as a Big Bad dashing Rogue for a mid-level party. Could serve as a great boss in a Saltmarsh campaign or even an Eberron campaign! * **Gangplank** - IDK why he doesn't impress me as much as MF; it's probably mostly that his Legendary actions suck compared to Sarah. But dat Cannon Barrage tho! I can guarantee that the first time Gangplank shouts [""Bathe 'em in iron!""](URL and you tell the party that *fucking cannonballs start raining from the sky* they'll freak out! --- I haven't really read the Bilgewater setting guide or the prewritten adventure, but as a fan of League I do think it's nice that they're giving such a detailed lore book for anyone who wants to use the setting for their games. This is why I'm really hopefully for other settings ~~Piltover *please!*~~ since a full collection of Runeterra setting books would make a full-on League of Legends campaign much easier to design, and a lot of fun to play!"
17,vulnerability,dndnext,"A revision of ""Aim"" from the UA: Class Feature Variants",1,hb4kjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/hb4kjq/a_revision_of_aim_from_the_ua_class_feature/,2020-06-18 11:10:00,"The 2019 ""Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants"" included a playtest feature for rogues copied below: &gt;**Aim** &gt; &gt;2nd-level rogue feature (enhances Cunning Action) &gt; &gt;You gain an additional way to use your Cunning Action: carefully aiming your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself advantage on your next attack roll on the current turn. You can use this bonus action only if you havent moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn. I liked some parts of this feature but thought it was a bit too powerful. What I liked was it provides ranged rogues with a good use of their cunning action when hiding is not an option and they are not worried about being attacked. It also helped non-dual wielding rogues to keep up with dual wielding rogues with regards to damage. But it is still, to my mind, a bit OP, especially if the player takes the Elven Accuracy feat (90% chance to hit and 15% chance to crit at level 4 with 16 Dex against AC 15). So I designed a revised version of the feature that hopefully helps out single weapon rogues without making them too powerful and fits with the theme better. &gt;**Aim** &gt; &gt;2nd-level rogue feature (enhances Cunning Action) &gt; &gt;You gain an additional way to use your Cunning Action: carefully aiming your next attack. As a bonus action, you give yourself +2 on your next attack roll on the current turn. That attack is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. You can use this bonus action only if you havent moved during this turn, and after you use the bonus action, your speed is 0 until the end of the current turn. &amp;#x200B; Damage-wise this more or less keeps up with dual wielding two short swords (assuming the dual-wielder will disengage as a bonus action if they hit on their first attack). I compared expected damage for the two at levels 5, 10, and 20 against AC 8-25. * At level 5 dual wielding did better against AC's 15-23 to a max (AC 19) of +0.7 points of damage. ""Aim"" out-damaged dual wielding most at AC 11 for +1.7 points of damage. * At level 10 dual wielding did better against AC's 16-25 to a max (AC 21) of +1.5 points of damage. ""Aim"" out-damaged dual wielding most at AC 13 for +1.9 points of damage. * At level 20 dual wielding did better against AC's 17-25 to a max (AC 23) of +3.7 points of damage. ""Aim"" out-damaged dual wielding most at AC 15 for +2.1 points of damage. This seems to balance out the damage between dual wielding and single weapon rogues fairly well. The dual wielder accepts a greater chance to be hit by being unable to disengage if they don't hit on their first attack. The ""Aim"" user accepts a greater chance to be hit because they cannot retreat, dodge, or take cover on their turn. The dual wielding rogue generally does better against higher ACs whereas ""Aim"" does better against lower AC's. Dual wielders gains greater advantage at higher levels (a CR 10 monster is more likely to have high AC than a CR 5). In addition I think my variant makes more sense. If taking time to aim could grant advantage then everyone should be able to do so as an action. Instead it is only available as a cantrip (True Strike). Instead we already have the Archery fighting Style (+2 to hit with ranged weapons). A rogue giving up time and movement to carefully aim seems to be similar to what a trained archer can do instinctively. The bonus to criticals is fun for rogues because they benefit so much from criticals and it works thematically because the rogue is looking for a vulnerability as they aim. Lastly my variant prevents the rogue from being independent of teammates/the environment for getting sneak attack and incentivizes the rogue to search for ways to get advantage."
18,vulnerability,dndnext,Thrice-Cursed Man,5,helha3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/helha3/thricecursed_man/,2020-06-24 05:42:34,"In my current game, I've accidentally created a fantastic plot hook with nothing to hang on it. The Party has found themselves in a city where they have found that the two underground factions warring for control of the offshore mines - and the family that outright controls them - are an Illithid (that they have yet to realize is an Alhoon) and a Rakshasa. One member of the party - a Genasi Ranger, whose Djinn father is held captive by the Alhoon - has managed to collect three separate curses with no relation to each other. First, he contracted a magical disease that changed his gender. He then laid hold of a cursed sword that he hasn't yet unbonded from. Finally, he took on the role of Governor, unaware that it bound his soul to a well of previous governors that functions as both a way to dissuade wannabe rulers and a magical WMD. The thing is that ""Thrice-Cursed Man"" is an absolutely brilliant turn of phrase, but I haven't got anything to do with it. With luck, he'll break one curse and then have to get it back in order to fulfill the role; but that's looking too far forward. Any ideas as to what I could do with this? So far all I've got is swapping the ""Good character"" requirement from the Rakshasa's damage vulnerability to ""thrice-cursed"" given that there aren't really any Good members of the party."

I was expecting to have a week or two extra to work on it, but the party has barreled through the portion that I did have ready, and is closing in on the culprit. To sum it up, a number of wealthy individuals in the city have had their safes broken into, which is quite remarkable since before now they had been pretty much uncrackable. They followed the clues back, found out that the manufacturer had gone bust and sold their extra stock off to the local blacksmith as raw material some years back. They managed to, rather cleverly, figure out that the blacksmith was protecting someone. His niece. The blacksmiths niece tinkered with the mechanism for a summer or two until she figured out how it worked, and discovered a vulnerability in the design. Now the original plan I had was to have some part of the case hinge upon her guilt, then reveal that she had been in the custody of the guards durring one of the robberies. But by the time this came to light there was already too much connecting her with the crime. Basically the party figured out a little more than I wanted them to, and now my mystery is lacking a twist. It's been a mostly straightforward trail of breadcrumbs. The only peice of the puzzle they are missing is who was the blacksmiths niece working with, and where did the money go. I'd love some ideas or inspiration on how to end this with a bit more flair."
20,vulnerability,dndnext,Resistance and Vulnerability is such an underutilized mechanic,1,gecqem,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/gecqem/resistance_and_vulnerability_is_such_an/,2020-05-06 13:50:17,"Out of the 700 or so creatures in the basic rules, monster manuel, Volvos guide, and tome of foes, only 28 have a vulnerability. I think it could be a cool mechanic to expand, to make you think about what spells youre using or what weapons you want to strike with Im surprised there isnt a spell that lets you surpass resistance (maybe a level 3 spell that requires melee range and allows you to remove all resistances for 1d4 rounds). Im even more surprised that there isnt a single spell that can give you an immunity for a short period (if its a high level, maybe 8th, or the effect of a powerful magic item) It seems like such an essential mechanic for an RPG, but it feels like such an afterthought. Was it big in previous editions and it had to be included because its an important relic of the past (the alignment system barely matters and backstories and backstory traits are much better ways of determining character traits, but this is dnd so you have to have alignment)"
21,vulnerability,dndnext,A summary of cRPGs Campaign Starts and what we can learn from them,1,gf61pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/gf61pi/a_summary_of_crpgs_campaign_starts_and_what_we/,2020-05-07 22:57:44,"Campaign Start. Arguably the most important part of a campaign as it sets the tone for the rest of it and gets your players interested in playing. As a DM that likes running one-shots and shorter campaigns to get to know group chemistry and spot issues beforehand, I've run a few campaign starts. Over time, I've veered away from the usual ""you start in a tavern"" scenario. I'm always looking for ideas from media I've consumed and I realized I've never really looked at cRPGs for inspiration despite playing a lot of them. So I summarized here the cRPG campaign starts that I have played and the notes I got from them: 1. **Baldur's Gate 2** Summary: You start in a cell. You are rescued by a fellow prisoner and she says you all have to escape. You enlist the help of other prisoners and make your way through the prison to the city above. Notes: A prison start but the difference here is that one, the PC starts at tier 2 levels and two, it's not a conventional prison. The high level offsets some of the vulnerability of a typical prison start and executed well, could probably empower your players while allowing for more creativity. Another thing the high level offsets is the mentality that prisoners have to work together. BG2 kind of works around this since it's not a conventional prison and more of an evil mage's lair. The threats aren't mean prison guards or other inmates but mysterious and deadly magical contraptions. 2. **Baldur's Gate** Summary: You start in Candlekeep as the ward of a mage. You are asked to leave. A powerful threat arrives and kills your mentor. You escape. Notes: A classic Call to Adventure. I'm always a fan of introducing the BBEG right from the start. The best thing about this start is the threat of the BBEG is established and that threat is looming over the PC, hot on his heels. For a one-shot, there's an immediate goal or target like escape or revenge. For a long term campaign, it lends itself well to a CoS kind of deal where the BBEG is always present. 3. **Tyranny (by Obsidian Entertainment)** Summary: You are a high ranking officer. You make decisions where you manage factions and the siege of a city. You begin the game in the middle of the assault that eventually ends the siege. Notes: Admittedly the cRPG that inspired this post. There's two parts to this - worldbuilding and the siege. The worldbuilding half is a potential Session 0 activity. It could get your players invested in the game as their decisions make an impact in your world. The siege is a pretty intense In Medias Res start and seems very difficult to pull off. Executed well however, it's a unique start and gives immediate reasons for combat, political intrigue, and introductions to factions. 4. **Planescape Torment** Summary: You start in a morgue with no memory of how you got there. A floating skull wakes you up and says he can help you escape. He also mentions the tattoos you have which mention someone named ""Pharod."" Notes: An amnesia start. There was a post somewhere that outlined a potential campaign start where players started with a blank character sheet, gradually filling it out as they used their abilities. It's a cool idea but one that requires a lot of trust in the DM. A big strength of this start (and the game) is in the setting - the floating skull companion, the shambling docile zombies, and the weird city of Sigil. An interested DM might want to read Planescape sourcebooks. A concern with an amnesia start would be how to give the PCs direction. Torment solved it with the tattoos. 5. **Arcanum (by Troika Games)** Summary: You start in an airship where an event is taking place. The airship is attacked and crashes. You wake up in the wreckage. A dying passenger gives you a ring and tells you to deliver it to ""the boy."" Notes: An interesting spin on the shipwreck start. The crash itself wasn't playable in the game but for a campaign start, roleplaying the crash would've been an immediate way to get the players to be creative and utilize their skills to survive. The dying request also gives the session immediate momentum. I remember picking through the corpses in the aftermath of the crash. A DM could use that to plant other plot hooks if the dying request isn't enough. &amp;#x200B; tldr; I play a lot of cRPGs and I want to steal some ideas from them These are 5 I have off the top of my head. Thoughts? Got any more interesting campaign starts inspired by cRPGs?"
22,vulnerability,dndnext,Vulnerabilities are a poor design choice and it is good that only a few Monsters have them,1,girljs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/girljs/vulnerabilities_are_a_poor_design_choice_and_it/,2020-05-13 14:08:17,"Here is my reasoning why Damage vulnerabilities are a poor design choice: 1. It limits player creativity as combat now becomes all about exploiting the damage type the monster is vulnerable to. 2. It makes balancing difficult. There is a lot of swinginess between a party who does not have an option of exploiting the vulnerability and a one that does. 3. If vulnerabilities are a big thing and a lot of monsters are balanced around that then every party must have options to deal all kinds of damage. This limits player options and creative choices. 4. It punishes martial characters and spontaneous casters. Your wizard with his wide repertoire of spells is never going to run out of things to use in combat. But it would suck to be a fighter who can't do fire damage to a monster vulnerable to fire or a bard who did not choose the 'correct spell' while leveling up. 5. It makes metagaming worse. If published monsters have a significant weakness, then monster knowledge ooc can change things a lot. I'm honestly surprised that people want literally all monsters to have vulnerability. This isn't pokemon and damage types should just be flavor text most of the times. What's your opinion?"

The party is about to reach level 5, and I wanted to give her a new ability to act as a progression of this connection. I am considering offering one of three choices that each represent certain ""gifts"" the sun could grant. They are as follow: **Gift of Protection:** The suns protective aura wraps around you. Attuning to this aura grants you resistance to radiant and fire damage. Once per day, as a bonus action, you can extend this aura to any chosen creature within 30ft of you and give them resistance to radiant and fire damage for 1 minute. **Gift of Power:** The suns radiant energy surges through you. Harnessing this energy allows your melee weapon attacks to deal radiant damage instead of its normal damage type. Once per day, as a bonus action, you can focus this energy on a creature you can see within 30 ft of you and give them vulnerability to the next attack that deals radiant damage. **Gift of Light:** The light of the sun shines within you. Releasing this light allows you to shed 10 feet of bright light that pierces through magical darkness. Once per day, as a bonus action, you can emit a dazzling sphere of light in a 30 ft radius around you and reveal any invisible creatures or illusory effects for one round. I'm not sold on the specifics of each ability, mainly just the themes and basic abilities of each. I was wondering if these abilities seem balanced relative to each other and to the overarching ""meta."" Do any of these look like they could be tweaked at all?"

One that I've especially been confused about is necrotic... it seems to lower max hp permanently? Or no, there's just necrotic spells that *also* do that? Does force damage push the target back somehow? I see a lot of people excited that you can get force damage from magic missile and apply it to other spells with the new UA order of scribes. Why would that matter? Does lightning do extra damage (or have a better chance to hit) in water? These are all things that have confused me Hopefully this question makes sense - what effects (if any) does using a different damage type have beyond the monster potentially being resistant/immune/vulnerable.

The DM puts out a world building task to earn inspiration for that week's game. This week's challenge was to come up with a magic item that makes sense in the setting. One of my suggestions was the following: &amp;#x200B; Unpierceable Shirt AC: 14 + DEX Stealth: No Disadvantage Attunement: Yes, by a creature with medium armor proficiency Special Ability: Resistant to slashing and piercing damage that doesn't exceed 20 to hit. Vulnerable to bludgeoning damage. &amp;#x200B; The DM rated it as overpowered, and I see where he is coming from. I was hoping some of you guys could help scale it back and give what you come up with a rarity rating. I really like the idea of reducing damage instead of upping AC, because the energy still dissipates into your body. Real bullet proof vests are likely to leave you with broken ribs. The upper to hit boundary to the resistance is meant to represent a hit good enough to pierce the shirt. On the other hand, tightly woven enchanted fabric isn't going to do much good if you get hit by a big stick. Hence the vulnerability."

You can cast the *detect magic* spell without using a spell slot or components. Constitution is your spellcasting ability for this spell. You faintly glow a colour corresponding to the school of magic you detect (you choose the colours). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of one). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. **CHAOS STRIKE** Starting at 3rd level, magic erupts from you strike forth at your enemies. Before the end of your Action phase on your turn, if you attacked at least once with a Melee Weapon Attack or a Thrown Weapon Attack as an Action, roll on the Chaos Table to determine the magical effect produced. If the Wild Surge effect requires a saving throw, the target must be the creature you attacked and hit, and the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier. If the Wild Surge effect requires an attack roll, the target must be the creature you attacked and hit, and the Wild Surge attack modifier is equal to + your proficiency modifier + your Constitution modifier. If you attacked and hit more than one creature during your Attack Action, you choose the target. **STACKING THE ODDS** Starting at 6th level, you can force the residual magical energy within you out in stronger force than it would do normally. Before you roll on the Chaos Table, you can choose to roll a d20. On a roll that equals 10  your Constitution Modifier or greater, you roll twice on the Chaos Table and you apply both effects. If you or your allies are required to make a saving throw, you and your allies have advantage on that roll. On a roll that equals less than 10  your Constitution Modifier, your DM rolls twice on the Chaos Table and you apply both effects. If you or your allies are required to make a saving throw, you and your allies have disadvantage on that roll. You can use this feature once per short rest. **ARCANE REBUTTAL** At 10th level, the magic crackling within your soul lashes out. When a creature withing 30ft of you forces you to make a saving throw while you are raging, roll 1d12 and apply one of the following effects. When applying the effects, you choose the damage type from the available choices. 1) You take 3d6 damage of your DMs choice, or you take 1d6 damage of your DMs choice and your DM rolls on the Chaos Table. You must apply the Chaos Table effect. 2) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw must make a Dexterity Saving Throw. On failed save, they take either 3d6 Acid damage or 3d6 Fire damage. On a successful save, they take half. 3) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw must make a Constitution Saving Throw. On failed save, they take either 3d6 Cold damage or 3d6 Necrotic damage. On a successful save, they take half. 4) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw must make a Strength Saving Throw. On failed save, they take either 3d6 Force damage or 3d6 Thunder damage. On a successful save, they take half. 5) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw must make a Dexterity Saving Throw. On failed save, they take either 3d6 Lightning damage or 3d6 Radiant damage. On a successful save, they take half. 6) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw must make a Constitution Saving Throw. On failed save, they take either 3d6 Poison damage or 3d6 Psychic damage. On a successful save, they take half. 7) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw takes either 3d6 Acid damage or 3d6 Fire damage. 8) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw takes either 3d6 Cold damage or 3d6 Necrotic damage. 9) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw takes either 3d6 Force damage or 3d6 Thunder damage. 10) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw takes either 3d6 Lightning damage or 3d6 Radiant damage. 11) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw takes either 3d6 Poison damage or 3d6 Psychic damage. 12) The creature that forced you to make the saving throw takes 3d6 damage of your choice, or the creature takes 1d6 damage of your choice and you roll on the Chaos Table. You must apply the Chaos Table effect. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution Modifier per long rest. **CHAOTIC FURY** At 14th level, you become a wellspring of chaotic magic while you are raging. As a reaction, you can reroll one effect you have rolled for on the Chaos Table, replacing the current effect with the new one. **CHAOS TABLE** 01-02) Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent turns. 03-04) For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it. 05-06) A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. 07-08) A stream of 1d4  10 gems, each worth 1 GP each, shoots out magically from you. Each creature within a 15ft radius must make a Dexterity Saving Throw. On a failed save, the target takes 1d4+1 bludgeoning damage. 09-10) You cast Magic Missile as a 5th-level spell. If you cannot target a creature other than yourself, you take the damage instead. 11-12) Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow. 13-14) You are *Stunned* until the start of your next turn, believing what you just did was awesome. 15-16) For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns. 17-18) Grass grows on the ground in a 60foot radius centred on the target.

Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get older (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get younger. 37-38) An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest the target. The animal isn't under your control and acts as it normally would. Roll a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 0150, a rat appears; on a 5175, an elephant appears; and on a 76100, a rhinoceros appears. 39-40) You regain 2d10 hit points. 41-42) You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts. 43-44) For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns. 45-46) You cast Levitate on yourself. 47-48) You roll 1d4.

27,vulnerability,dndnext,He Rises from the Depths: Evil Crab Druid and a Salvage Operation Reflavor,1,gsynk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/gsynk9/he_rises_from_the_depths_evil_crab_druid_and_a/,2020-05-30 04:43:05,"u/dumbfuck-trombone's [CRAB DRUID](URL started it all. Now I'd like to share a crab druid statblock for use in your games, as well as a guide to reflavor *Salvage Operation* into a crab-themed adventure. I am a big fan of this dungeon: it's a trim 10-page adventure that has lots of battles, tons of atmosphere, and a pretty epic and challenging conclusion. I highly recommend you check it out in *Ghosts of Saltmarsh*. Even if you don't own that book, below you'll find several encounters you can place in any appropriate crab den: a grotto, a coral reef, or even a portal to the Elemental Plane of Water. I've also dredged up some interesting tidbits from 2nd edition. I hope you enjoy. The Crab Druid is at the bottom. **Salvage Operation at the Crustacean Station** This document presents a crabification of the adventure Salvage Operation published in *Ghosts of Saltmarsh*. It changes the monster roster, backstory, and some of the mechanics of the adventure, emphasizing a crab-worshipping cult, crab-like enemies throughout, and a crab-influencing druid as the boss. Crabs have been put on everything, a distinct flavor sure to delight and horrify your players. **Changes to Background:** After *The Emperor of the Waves* was blown off-course, its crew landed on a distant island and were killed by an evil tribe that worships the crab god [Karrrga](URL A small group of Karrrgans, hoping to plunder distant lands, took the ship, bringing with them armies of freshwater jungle crabs. However, none aboard knew how to operate the vessel, and the boat floundered. As the weeks dragged on, the starving cultists began to turn on each other, eating the losers. Krell, a half-orc simic hybrid, was finally the last alive. As a reward for his strength, Karrrga sent a mysterious crab-headed creature floating up from the oceans depths. The creature is in a state of hibernation as it moults. Krell has stored this beast, a Sartani, in the boats larder, waiting for it to fully shed its magical shell. Believing the octopus to be a final challenge sent by Karrrga, Krell is determined to persevere, and lead the crabs to a distant shore, the first wave of an unrelenting assault that will net Karrrga new adherents and lands. **Changes to Monsters:** Certain monsters are swapped with others of appropriate level and crabbiness. In other cases, the original adventures monsters require simple crab flavoring. *Giant Spiders:* Giant Spiders can be described as Giant Crabs. Giant Crabs can extrude a sticky mass used to bind their egg sacs to surfaces, ejecting it at foes to produce the same effect as the Giant Spiders Web attack. **Variant:** If you want an extra challenge for your players, you can describe such a web attack as inciting the crab eggs to hatch, producing a **swarm of crabs** directly atop the hopefully restrained player. *Note:* Apparently most crabs carry their eggs on their bodies, but these are magical crabs. *Swarm of Spiders:* Use the Swarm of Insects (beetles) statblock. The rotted wood of the *Emperor* is porous enough for crabs to burrow through it. *Maw Demons, now a Hill Giant, but actually a* [*Sartani*](URL The Sartani in Food Storage is a huge creature with a crabs head. Its skin is hard like a crabs. Use the Hill Giant statblock for its statistics. The Sartani also has a swim speed of 40 feet, and can breathe underwater. Replace its Greatclub attack with a bite attack: +8 to hit, 10 ft. reach, 3d6 + 5 piercing damage. ***Wounded variant***\*:\* At your discretion, the Sartani can be at minimum health (50), to represent its vulnerable state while moulting. *Spider Climb, Web Sense, Web Walker.* All creatures with these features now have Crab Climb, and Eggsac Walker. * *Crab Climb:* The creature can climb difficult surfaces, but not ceilings, without making an ability check. * *Eggsac Walker:* The creature ignores movement restrictions made by eggsacs. Additionally, the creature can detect other creatures moving through terrain with eggsac secretions. **Roster** The following table shows which stat blocks to swap in the adventure. |Giant Spider (1)|Giant Spider **reflavored** (1)| |:-|:-| |Ettercap (2)|Meenlock (2)| |Swarms of Insects ()|Crab Swarm ()| |Giant Wolf Spider ()|Giant Crab (CR  x 2)| |Phase Spider (3)|Cave Fisher (3)| |Maw Demons (1 x 4)|Hill Giant **reflavored** (5)| |Ghasts (CR 2 x 4)|Deep Scion (CR 3 x 2| **Changes to Environment** *Webbing:* Mentions of webbing or sheets of webs can be described as clusters of eggsacs, either strung across rooms on long gooey tendrils, or stuck on the walls, ceiling, and floors in thick secretions. Pinhead-tiny crabs also walk along the eggsac slime, to emphasize the sheer volume of crabs. The goo is difficult terrain, and the hanging tendrils and sheets of eggsacs limit vision to no further than 10 feet, as in the original adventure. *Changes to Rooms* 2. Altar to ~~Lolth~~ Karrrga *A shell-covered stone altar dominates this cabin. Anenome and other sea elements cover its surface, sand is piled around it, and large shells ring the wall above. The floor is pockmarked with holes, some as large as a fist, with soft piles of mulch gathered around each hole.* The holes are crab burrows. The creatures are hiding amongst the rubble and eggsac strands, as in the original. New Roster: **Giant Spidercrab; Meenlock; 4 crab swarms** (stealth 14) Captains Log - change to mention of orcs and humans with crab-like appendages, crab eyes, extra spindly legs, or wearing giant hermit crab shells. Offering to Karrrga (gems): unchanged 3. Navigators Room The door into this room is blocked by egg sacs, and sheets of egg sacs obscure vision, as in the original. New Roster: **Giant Spidercrab; Meenlock** (stealth 17)**;** 1d4 rounds after, **4 swarms of crabs** begin to arrive, one swarm per round. 4. ~~Webbed~~ Threaded Doorway The hidden web (DC 17) to area 5 is now a thread from a cave fisher. 5. ~~Spider~~ Crab Nest New Roster: **Meenlock; 4 Giant Crabs (stealth 16); 6 Swarms of Crabs** (2 per round) Cargo Hold Access: The cargo hold hatch is obscured by the calcified eggsacs. 6. Food Storage *Crammed into this room is a giant humanoid with a crabs head and hard, milky skin. Its form is so large that its torso is folded over its legs. It breathes laboriously, inhaling and exhaling once every minute. With each exhalation, a slight cracking sound can be heard.* This **Sartani** is in the middle of a lengthy moulting process. Its chitin will make extremely valuable material for armor-making. The Sartani does not stir unless party members try to speak to it, or help it out of its casement, which provokes it to fury. If this creature remains undisturbed until the conclusion of the module, it reacts to the flooding of the ship by bursting from its half-readied skin, a bit raw, but ready to eat. At your discretion, the Sartanis HP can be as low as its minimum, to represent the vulnerability of its new shell. The Sartani must squeeze to navigate the ships interior. At your discretion, it can burst through the rotting deck into area 1. New Roster: **1 Sartani,** molting. 7. Krells Cabin : The shield bears the symbol of a crab with a skull for a shell. 8. 1st Mates Cabin : No change except to webbing. 9. ~~Spider~~ Crab Chamber : No change except to webbing and spiders. 10. Unholy Shrine *The floor of this chamber has two mostly decomposed bodies completely covered in tiny crabs. A crab symbol has been carved into the floors wooden planks, and crusty eggsac resin covers the walls of the room.* New Roster: **Crab Druid; 2 Giant Crabs; 1 Cave Fisher** Krell, the crab druid, is a stronger challenge than the original adventures druid, which is why his posse is weaker. Krells wildshape and conjure crabs actions allow him to summon even more forces into the fray, and then join them as he believes he is meant to: as a crab, defending his brethren in savage battle. Krells entangle, thorn whip, and crab claw abilities give him lots of battlefield control, which he employs to allow his crab friends to get the kill and enjoy the meat. ***Note***: *Because Krell has 3rd level spells, wildshape, and a reaction, he is considerably more dangerous than the CR 2 druid, especially for a 4th level party. Monitor your partys resource expenditure, and consider ignoring Krells biggest hitter, Tidal Wave, as well as his reaction ability, if necessary.* 11. Galley : No change except to spiders 12. Cargo Hold : No change to the boxed text. Krell cast the last two members of the cult into this hold after he vanquished them in combat. This act of sacrifice to Karrrga was rewarded, as thousands of crabs poured onto the ship from the sea to feed on the corpses, imbuing them with foul magics. The two cultists have transformed into **Deep Scions.** These two followers live again as voracious monsters with crab claws, mandibles, and eyestalks, themselves representations of Karrrgas insatiable hunger. They behave identically to the ghasts in the original adventure. New Roster: **2 Deep Scions** **Treasure:** One deep scion has a silver bracelet representing a lobster (50 GP), the sworn enemy of Karrrga. Another has a worn leather belt with intricate carvings. The rarity of this items make can fetch a fair sum, but only if adventurers find a buyer who appreciates archaeology or history. Octopus Attack: This portion requires no changes. The enemies aboard behave in the same fashion, since they are freshwater crabs. **Thank you** to u/dumbfuck-trombone for inciting this whole idea with the post [CRAB DRUID](URL on /r/DNDnext. Thanks also to u/PhysicsCentrism for the crab-webbers suggestions, u/UppityScapegoat for making that suggestion far creepier, and u/farlet10 for the scion suggestions and crab resources. # Crab Druid Medium Humanoid (Simic Hybrid), Neutral Evil **Armor Class** 11 (16 with crabskin) **Hit Points** 32 (5d8 + 10) **Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft. |**STR** 14 (+2)|**DEX** 10 (+0)|**CON** 14 (+2)| |:-|:-|:-| |**INT** 12 (+1)|**WIS** 15 (+2)|**CHA** 11 (+0)| **Saving Throws** Con +4, Int +4, Wis +4 **Skills** Athletics +5, Stealth +3 **Senses** passive Perception 12 **Languages** Common **Challenge** 3.5 (700 XP) ***Spellcasting.*** The Crab Druid is a 5th level spellcaster (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). The Crab Druid has the following spells prepared: Cantrips (at will): *druidcraft, shape water, thornwhip (the crab druids claw magically extends and pulls a target closer)* 1st level (4 slots): *speak with animals, absorb elements, find familiar (crab only), entangle\* (crab claws emerge from the ground to grasp targets)* 2nd level (3 slots): *animal messenger, crabshell\* (barkskin), spiritual weapon (spectral crab claw)* 3rd level (2 slots): *conjure giant crabs\*, tidal wave* **ACTIONS** ***Grappling Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* \+4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage. On a hit, the Crab Druid can use a bonus action to attempt to grapple the same target. ***Wildshape (once per long rest).*** The Crab Druid magically transforms into a Giant Crab with 24 hit points. It can remain in this form for two hours, or until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it transforms back into the Crab Druid. **REACTIONS** ***Shell Dodge.*** *When the* Crab Druid *would be hit by an attack, it can partially withdraw into its shell, providing +5 to its AC against that attack.*"
28,vulnerability,dndnext,Can anyone help me with editing a build?(long post),1,gu10qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/gu10qx/can_anyone_help_me_with_editing_a_buildlong_post/,2020-06-01 01:28:06,"Ok so I'm trying to make a build that hits as hard as possible in one attack basically a one hit kill character. What we after a day came up with is Warlock 5 hexblade for Eldridge smite and thirsting blade(Thirsting blade is incase your first attack misses or if it hits and they dont go down you can attack again to try and kill them) and the smite spell branding or wrathful smite plus your weapon can use charisma and be +1 if you choose improved pact weapon. Fighter 2 action surge Paladin 2 divine smite (9th level is my current cap as that's the party level.) So far you can do 1d4/12 +8d8 +1d6 or 1d4/12 + 4d8 +1d6(wraithful smite) but you choose the following option instead of Paladin so you can force vulnerability to all your damage. Then death domain cleric (2) because channel divinity let's you force vulnerable on a your target. With this before bonuses and all that depending on weapon you can do anything from 1d4/12(dagger - great axe) +8d8(Eldridge and divine smite) +1d6(wrathful smite) in one strike with a round of prep and that's at level 11. (Because im capped at 9 I dropped the Paladin levels for cleric) and going forward in the build level 12 you can then go for battle master fighter menacing attack or precision attack so you dont miss or can add a d8 of damage or go for 3rd level Paladin for branding smite to go for 3d6 instead of one and go for i think vengeance gets you the ability to just get +10 to hit or go third level cleric it has no down sides more heals? Your next levels should go to get all this stuff order is up too you. Now to truly hit the hardest we gotta pick a race to start I'd say go fallen aasimar (or protector) So you can grow them power up wings. If I'm doing this right you first warlock hex ,summon your wings action surge cast wrathful smite then use cleric hex on target end turn then next turn strike Stats if you go standard array Str 8(+1 race) Dex 10 Con 14 Int 12 Wis 13Char 15(+2 race) I know these dont meet multiclass requirements but my group doesn't use them. Asi can go for great weapon master or +1 dex and strength. Unless you rolled for stats you should have 18 charisma so +4 I'm not the best with math so this might be wrong but you should be able to do 74/82 +17 assuming max damage plus you force vulnerable so double that and on a crit triple it so 148/164 +34 and 222/246 +51 This is the build we came up with anyone have other ideas? edits? Better builds? More possible builds for people that use stat requirements? Edit: tried to format and fix spelling but mobile sucks."
29,vulnerability,dndnext,DND5e: which basic damage type is most prolific?,1,fx2aui,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/fx2aui/dnd5e_which_basic_damage_type_is_most_prolific/,2020-04-08 17:53:38,"so i wanted to craft a magical suit of resistance armor for my steel defender....which i told my DM looked like a mecha dragonborn copy of our actual dragon born paladin lol.... its a medium construct of any shape i desire so why not. well i want to super upgrade its survivability but i dont want to go the elemental resistance route i just want to give it an armor that gives resistance to a basic damage type but not all of them.... and with our home brew crafting rules we can do that provided we do skill checks and sink resources(read gold and down time) into it. &amp;#x200B; so the question is which of the three damage types do creatures deal most often in the monster manual? behold: [URL link to my pie chart cataloguing all instances of the phrases bludgeoning ,slashing ,piercing followed by the word damage IE (bludgeoning damage) &amp;#x200B; i recorded every instance of all 3 phrases....and figured that the one with the most mentions/hits in the search would be the most prolific damage type and ergo the best investment for resistance. my methodology. doesnt: account for spells cast by creatures in the manual. does: account for when resistance and vulnerability to the damage phrases was used results: 'piercing damage' is mentioned 375 times in the monster manual this makes sense to me after i saw it... but it wasn't what i thought was gonna be the top contender. but most creatures in the monster manual have a BITE type attack that does piercing damage...(i mean even a beholder does this) followed by creatures who use weapons often have a ranged attack that deals piercing far more often then it deals bludgeoning (though this can also be weighted in the fact that bludgeoning's options are often far heavier in the number of dice rolled). 'bludgeoning damage' is the 2nd place winner , not surprising to me, with 211 mentions. Bludgeoning may have less mentions due to the fact that the monster manual doesnt have many monsters that bite with bludgeoning damage... and that of those monsters most of the ones that do this damage are a step above in the size department. though i will continue researching number of dice attached to each damage phrase... im assuming that bludgeoning is gonna weight(pardon pun) heavy enough there that it might the most prolific in damage numbers if not instances of attacks that use it. 'slashing damage' is mentioned only 190 times in the monster manual. now most creatures that have slashing also have a bite that deals piercing.. so alot of this overlaps.... in fact one could argue it overlaps harder then bludgeoning does with either piercing or slashing. but slashing shines in the fact that most humanoids have a weapon that deals slashing....even still slashing is still the least among equals when it comes to the standard damage types IMO the only time it really shines is with rediculous weapons of sharpness and vorpal blades. lack of monsters with bleed effects attached to claw attacks also hampers. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; so having gone to the trouble of rambling to you fair folks about my opinions of why my shoddy pie chart is cool to me... i have decided that while bludgeoning as a resistance is great in an adventuring setting... piercing is the greatest. &amp;#x200B; PS. one of my dms crafting options is granting proficiency so if i make a magical armor and invest additional time and gold i can make even something with no armor proficiencies wear a cool magic item.....though the crafting dcs on a armor of resistance is gonna be hella difficult. artificer life."
30,vulnerability,dndnext,I've created my first homebrew anything out of boredom. Anyone willing to give advice or suggestions to improve it?,1,fzpmrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/fzpmrl/ive_created_my_first_homebrew_anything_out_of/,2020-04-12 13:59:10,"It's a subclass for the Warlock. I've seen a couple of takes on patrons centered around voodoo dolls and things like that, but I wanted to give it a shot for myself as I didn't really care for the ones I found. Any tips on balancing and feedback in general are appreciated. I'm a little nervous about putting this out in the wild, but Warlock is one of my favorite classes, and I put a lot of thought into this. Hope you like it! # The Doll &gt;You have found a cursed puppet, broken dummy, voodoo doll, or some other haunted object which houses some unknown yet powerful entity who has deemed you worthy of ownership. Perhaps the object you now possess contains a piece of a powerful magicians soul, or maybe it was created by some hag or fiendish entity for their amusement, and left behind to be found by an unsuspecting mortal. In exchange for untold power, you have agreed to be the steward of its vessel, and carry your patron with you on your travels, to protect it, and perhaps learn its secrets if you listen close enough. &gt; &gt;The objects are often found by people who werent looking for them, after hearing the detached and hypnotic voices coming from them. As they cannot move on their own, they require others to act on their behalf. It often becomes difficult to distinguish between the desires of the warlock and those of the Doll. &gt; &gt;**Expanded Spell List** &gt; &gt;The Doll lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you. |Spell Level|Spells|| |:-|:-|:-| |1st|Command|Inflict Wounds| |2nd|Blindness/Deafness|Locate Object| |3rd|Animate Dead|Glyph of Warding| |4th|Locate Creature|Staggering Smite| |5th|Bigbys Hand|Telekinesis| &amp;#x200B; &gt;**Grim Token** &gt; &gt;At 1st level when you choose this patron, you find a humanoid toy, effigy, or mannequin. This is your Token, which houses your patrons being and power. You must carry this Token on your person in order to cast spells, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. Should the Token be lost or destroyed, you lose the ability to cast spells other than cantrips or those granted by invocations until you can find your Token or make a replacement for it. You then perform a ritual to restore your patron to the vessel, which takes an hour of uninterrupted meditation and supplication. &gt; &gt;**Creepy Toy** &gt; &gt;Starting at 1st level, your Token makes you an unnerving sight to behold. You gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks when you hold your Token. &gt; &gt;Additionally, as an action, you can hold out your Token to a creature you can see. It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw versus your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is frightened of you for a minute. While frightened of you in this way, the creature cannot take any actions except cowering in place. On a save, the creature is immune to this effect until the next dawn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) and regain all uses after a long rest. &gt; &gt;**Bizarre Ventriloquist** &gt; &gt;At 1st level, you learn how to misdirect and confuse your enemies. You can use a bonus action to make it seem as though your voice is coming from a creature or object up to 60 feet away, provided you are hidden or otherwise unseen. A creature can make a Wisdom (Insight) check versus your Charisma score to determine where your voice originated. &gt; &gt;**Curse of the Doll** &gt; &gt;Starting at 6th level, you can use your Token to inflict pain on others from afar. As an action, you think of a specific creature you have seen and heard before, then pierce a piece of your Token with a pin or other sharp object. The creature must then make a Constitution saving throw versus your spell save DC, taking 5d6 psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success. The effect fails if you are not on the same plane as them. A creature can only be affected by this feature once per day. &gt; &gt;**Secrets of the Doll** &gt; &gt;Starting at level 10, your Token begins speaking to you in unheard whispers, granting you the knowledge of its past owners. Whenever you make an Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (History) check, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower as a 10 while holding your Token. &gt; &gt;**Macabre Puppeteer** &gt; &gt;Starting at 14th level, you can manipulate an attacker to damage itself. When a creature attacks you or by an ally within 30 feet, you can use your reaction to redirect the attack to itself. The creature makes a Charisma saving throw versus your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature directs the attack towards itself. &gt; &gt;After it attacks itself in this manner, the creature you affected is dazed, unable to put up a defense. It has vulnerability to the next attack that hits it. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all uses of this feature after a long rest."

I'm one of those GMs who like to more-or-less plan for the 20th level showdown pretty early in the campaign, just for the fun of imagining this balls-to-the-wall final battle that the players might find themselves into if everything goes right and the campaign does not untimely fizzle out. So, my players are coasting 8th and - after their fair share of investigating, goose chasing, and sidequests - got introduced to actual lore about this darkness-dwelling, sun-eating, sphinx-slaughtering demigod of the desert and, hopefully, are going to kick into hoverdrive on the main overarching quest to defeat it before the (setting specific) two-weeks-long eclipse at the end of the year. (Btw, if anything of the sort sounds familiar, you might be one of my players so scram out of here!) I admit that I'm more of a ""stat-bashing"" guy, as in that instead of building new items/classes/monsters from scratch I prefer to take what's already into the system and tweak it slightly into something new, if not just re-fluff existing rules with only cosmetic changes. So, now that I'm starting to piece together what the BBEG of the entire campaing could be, I'm more or less orbiting around a spell-oriented Mummy Lord on steroids. After a bit of deliberation, I landed on both the ML and the Lich, and I was thinking about just combining the two statblocks in a new, slighly different monster. On a first draft, it would probably be something with: **ABILITY SCORES/PROFILE + TRAITS from the Lich**, with maybe Vulnerability to Fire to keep the Mummy Lord theme. Also Swap INT and WIS on the statblock, and use cleric, WIS-based spells for the ""Spellcasting"" trait (this would change a few details on the statblock, of course). **ACTIONS from the Mummy Lord** **LEGENDARY ACTIONS from the Mummy Lord** **LAIR ACTIONS from the Lich** Such a statblock would fit the bill pretty good. But at this power level, with so many options to consider (many offensive options, some of which impose conditions, and a whole bunch of resistances and immunities), I'm a bit at a loss with assigning a fair CR. I'm tempted to just go for the highest of the two (so, 21) and be done with it, but I can't help but wonder if that solution would overlook any major issue. Even if I suppose that, by the time the PCs hit capstone levels, Challenge Rating is more of a set of guidelines than a strict rule, I wanted to give (at least in theory) a fighting chance to everyone involved, and coming up with an appropriate CR would at least be a first, crunch-worth way to be sure of that. So, what do you think?"
33,vulnerability,dndnext,Custom Class Option [In Need of Critique] - 5th Edition,1,ffw8ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/ffw8ur/custom_class_option_in_need_of_critique_5th/,2020-03-10 02:21:13,"Happy Monday DNDReddit! I'm a prospective game designer and writer working on a custom campaign setting. Below is a custom class for a campaign guide I'm writing. It's going to be the first of two classes included in the guide and I could use some player critique from the community to help balance and flesh it out more if needed. If you could either comment below or DM me with ideas and critiques, that would be fantastic! Also, if this is not quite the right subreddit, leave a link that points me in the right direction. Thanks! **The Wiccan** **Control The Prime Magics Or Be Consumed By Them** Wiccan have chosen to find the sources of the ancient, primal magics of the world by any means necessary, often though great personal sacrifice. To understand the deep knowledge of the first magics and how they came to be is considered the greatest of endeavors. Some have come to prominence with their mastery, and some have fallen deep into madness in their pursuit. Because of the controversial nature of their journey into the unknown, most Wiccan who have attempted the search have never returned. Only a few with the strongest of bodies and minds survived to spread their knowledge to those few who deem it a worthy endeavor. Most live as nomads on the fringes of society, playing at healers and protectors of those they deem worthy. Some slipped into darkness and use blood and soul magics to enslave, corrupt, and hold dominion over those lesser than themselves. **With Ancient Magic Comes Ancient Power** The true nature of how a Wiccans abilities came to them and where they learned their magics is relatively unknown to those who practice the Arcane and Divine arts. The subject of Wiccan Power is controversial at best, and many of the students under an Arcane or Divine servitude are forbidden to study it. Because of this, Wiccan are kept at a distance from society, and generally reviled as blasphemers and apostates to the true magical arts. To be a Wiccan is to accept this life, and do with the power that was sought what you will to shape the world. **Creating a Wiccan** As you create your Wiccan, keep in mind how your character has sought this power and what trials and tribulations occurred in your search. Also, how does your character view civilized society, the other magical arts, and divinity? Do they wish to use their powers for the good of the people, seeing the ancient magics as a boon to those who need it? Or do they see it as power incarnate, and wish to use it to assert dominance on the lesser beings? Do you enjoy the company of others or stay within your solitude, certain that the primal power you sought after need be your only friend? While a Wiccan begins their journey to find the primal powers on their own, they also acknowledge the benefits of companionship and trust between folk. The Wiccans known to society, while controversial and nomadic, are often seen as alternative choices for a multitude of purposes. Healing the sick, defending townships ill equipped to hire mercenaries or seek help from the nobility make Wiccans a useful service. #### Quick Build You can make a Wiccan quickly by following these suggestions. First, make **Wisdom** or **Strength** your highest ability score, depending on whether you want to focus on the Primeval Magic path or the Primeval Warrior path. Make Wisdom your highest score if you follow the Primeval Magic path, which allows a Wiccan access to the Wiccan magic table and spells much like a Wizard or Sorcerer. Choose either Constitution or Dexterity as your second highest ability score if you choose this path. Make your highest score Strength if you choose the Primeval Warrior path, which grants access to bonuses and abilities in melee or ranged combat. Choose **Dexterity** or **Constitution** as your second highest ability score. **Class Features:** As a Wiccan, you gain the following features. **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Wiccan level **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8+ plus your Constitution modifier **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Wiccan level after 1st. **Proficiencies** **Armor:** Light Armor **Weapons:** Simple Weapons **Tools:** Alchemists Supplies **Saving Throws:** Wisdom, Constitution **Skills:** Choose three / History, Deception, Medicine, Persuasion, Religion, Survival **Equipment:** You start with the following equipment. In addition to the equipment granted by your background: * A component pouch * An explorers pack * 1 Regular Healing Potion **Bound Weapon:** In your search for the ancient powers that once were, you stumbled upon the knowledge that initiated your journey as a Wiccan. This ancient knowledge allowed you to summon a simple weapon of your choice at will that is bound to you. Beginning at 1st level, You may use a bonus action to summon your bound weapon. You have proficiency and are considered trained with this weapon and may summon it as many times per day as your Wisdom modifier. Any attack or effect that would knock you unconscious dispels the weapon and you must summon it again. Upon reaching 6th level, you may use a free action to summon the weapon. **Primeval Call:** At 2nd level, you have learned to call upon the ancient powers that you have discovered to aid you. As a bonus action, you may invoke the Primeval Call to summon a creature from the netherworld of the ancients to aid you in battle. This creature must be of a challenge rating, (CR), of 1/4 or lower. The creature aids you for rounds equal to half your Wisdom modifier. You must be able to verbally command the creature each round or the creature vanishes. Once used, this power resets after a long rest. At 6th level, the challenge rating raises to 1/2, at 9th level it raises to 1, at 13th level it raises to 2. After 6th level, the creature lasts until you choose to dispel it. **Primeval Path:** At 3rd level, your Wiccan must commit to a Primeval Path. Choose Primeval Warrior or Primeval Magi, all detailed at the end of the class description. The order you choose grants you features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. **Primeval Warrior** The Primeval warrior is the most martial of the Wiccan, pursuing mastery of all weapons as well as the mind and body. The Primeval Warrior strives for physical and mental perfection as well as training to resist many of the maladies that strike the normal populace. Those that are known have been commissioned to defend towns and villages from monsters, and aid in the wars of the outside world. **Weapon Mastery:** When you join this order at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the Martial weapon type and you may change your Bound Weapon to mirror this type. **Warriors Way:** At 7th level, your physical body has been trained to be more resilient and resistant to wear and tear. As a bonus action, you use your training and advanced techniques to reduce damage from weapons that deal Piercing, Bludgeoning, and Slashing damage by half. You may do this for rounds equal to half your Strength or Dexterity modifier. **Battle Superiority:** Beginning at 10th level, your mastery of battle has made you a force to be reckoned with for opponents. You may choose 2 combat maneuvers from the Battle Master subclass in fighter and add them to your abilities, (attributes for each maneuver stay the same). You may use these maneuvers a number of times equal to half your strength modifier. **Eyes of a Killer:** At 15th level, you have mastered the art of viewing the weak points of your enemies and exploiting them. For as many rounds equal to 1/4 of your Strength modifier, you may turn a regular hit into a critical hit. **Of The Ancient Death:** Upon reaching 18th level, you channel the secrets of the ancient powers to such a degree that you can inflict the maximum punishment on an enemy. Before attacking, you can declare your next strike to be Of The Ancient Death. On a hit, the target makes a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to your level. If failed, the target is reduced to 0 hit points. If saved, the target takes damage equal to half his/her hit points rounded down. You may do this once per day. **Primeval Mage** The Primeval Mage has learned the secrets of the Primeval Magics and the ways in which to employ them. Long ago the secrets of the Primeval Magics were contained into volumes and secreted away to places long thought forgotten, until the Wiccan found it. Using this newfound magical prowess, the Primeval Magi was able to utilize spells different from the Arcane and Divine to work wonders or exact terrible curses upon their foes. **Primeval Magi Spellcasting:** As a Wiccan Primeval Magi, you have gained access to spellcasting and have augmented your combat techniques with the ability to cast Druid spells. See Chapter 10 (phb) for the general rules of spell casting and the Druid spell graph for slots and other information. **Spell Slots:** The Primeval Magi spell casting table shows how many spell slots you have. You have access to Druid spells. To cast one of your spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 8th level, you have four 2nd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell \_, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 2nd-level spell. **Spellcasting Ability:** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Wiccan spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. ***Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier*** ***Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier*** **Wiccan Channeling:** At 3rd level, you now have the ability to channel an effect of the ancient powers of old. As an action, you can choose to channel your body or the body of a character with an effect of your choice. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier. You may channel a number of times equal to half your level rounded down. **Channel Fortitude:** You or another player gain advantage on Strength and Constitution checks **Channel Mind:** You or another player gain advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks **Channel Reflexes:** You or another player gain advantage on Dexterity checks **Channel Vitality:** You or another player regain 5 hit points **Channel Focus:** You or another player gain advantage on their next attack **Wiccan Frenzy:** Beginning at 7th level, when you use your action to cast a spell, you may make one weapon attack with your Bound Weapon as a bonus action. **Splice Magic:** At 10th level, you combine two magical effects of your choice in a single attack, dealing double the amount of energy and effects to a devastating degree. Doing so requires a massive amount of concentration and energy on the part of the Primeval Magi and leads to an adverse effect after the splice is completed. As an action, you may combine two spells of an equal level and type into one, spending two spell slots in the process. On a hit, a target takes both damage and any peripheral effects of the spliced spells at once. The following after effects apply when Splice Magic is used. ***1st level:*** *You take 10 points of psychic damage* ***2nd level:*** *You take 10 points of psychic damage and your maximum hit points are reduced by 5* ***3rd level:*** *You take 15 points of psychic damage and fall prone* ***4th level:*** *You take 15 points of psychic damage and must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned. Your maximum hit points are reduced by 10 and you incur 1 point of Exhaustion* ***5th level:*** *You take 25 points of psychic damage and must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or fall unconscious.* **Curse of the Ancients:** Upon reaching 15th level, you have mastered the ancient powers to curse your opponents through magical means. As an action, you may invoke the Curse of the Ancients to identify any damage immunities from a target or targets and remove them. You may also give one vulnerability of your choice to a single target or a group of targets if they share the same race or type. **Ancient Gift:** Upon reaching 18th level, you are given a spectacular magical gift by the Primeval powers. You may learn one 9th level spell. If used, the spell cannot be regained for one week. **Ability Score Improvement:** When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you cant increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. **Extra Attack:** Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. **Runes of Ancient Power:** At 6th level, youve learned to harness the powers of the ancients to create magical markings that do a variety of effects. As a Wiccan, you may take one day to prepare a rune of your choice that may be placed on a weapon, a piece of armor, or an artifact of importance. This Rune is bound to the weapon and, when activated, the effect is triggered and lasts for a number of hours equal to your Wisdom modifier. You may choose one rune from the list provided below. **Rune of Protection:** *(must be added to armor)* Gain a +1 bonus to AC when wearing armor. **Rune of the Mind:** *(must be added to armor)* Gain advantage on Skill checks that use the Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom ability score. **Rune of the Body:** *(must be added to the skin of a character)* Gain 10 temporary hit points. **Rune of the Elements:** *(must be added to a weapon)* Gain 1d6 damage of an elemental type added to normal damage. \- Fire \- Force \- Cold \- Lightning \- Poison \- Acid **Rune of Luck:** *(must be added to a weapon)* Change a regular hit to a critical hit successful hit with a weapon imbued with **Ancient Fortitude:** Upon reaching 11th level, you call upon the powers of the ancient Primeval Magics to empower your body. Once per day as an action you may choose one of the following, \- Remove one condition \- Restore half your total hit points \- Gain advantage on ability checks of one ability score for rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier \- Attacks made with your Bound Weapon deal an extra 3d6 points of damage \- Attacks made against you have disadvantage for rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier **Changeling:** At 17th level, your knowledge of the ancient powers and magics has given you the ability to change your appearance. Once per day as an action you may change your appearance and physical form to that of a creature with a challenge rating (CR) of 8 or below. You gain all abilities and characteristics of the chosen creature. Any attack that decreases the creature to 0 hit points also reduces you to 0 hit points. **Avatar of the Ancients:** Upon becoming 20th level, you have become an avatar of the ancient powers that be. You no longer age or can be diseased and your Changeling form increases to a challenge rating of 10."
34,vulnerability,dndnext,A thorough review of Matt Mercer's 2020 Blood Hunter,1,fhagsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/fhagsc/a_thorough_review_of_matt_mercers_2020_blood/,2020-03-12 15:02:51,"A foreword: I'll warn you this review is very long and hopefully quite comprehensive. I wrote this over the course of about two days and I apologise in advance if I sound uncouth or maddened at any point, it was an interesting process/experience. I never really looked at the previous version of this class and I'm unfamiliar with the majority of Mercer's work (besides the Gunslinger Martial Archetype which I thought to be alright), but I ended up checking this out when it shot to number 1 on DMsGuild and people were raving about how good the class was in the reviews. After having thoroughly read it, I may just have a few words to say about it. About 10,000 or so... ___ **The Good** * The artwork is well made. * The class concept/idea is novel, even if it does lean a bit towards ""edgy"" tropes, and could fill a comfortable slot in the class roster. * It only gets extra attack once, this is balanced. * Additionally it only gets 5 Ability Score Improvements, another balanced choice. * The 14th level feature ""Hardened Soul"" is fine, and makes sense thematically. * ""Blood Curse of Binding"" in isolation as a ""not-spell"", is actually okay. It's a strong ability, as it's a bonus action, but it finds a niche as a budget hold person; at most I'd suggest a low level requirement (3rd level) or a change in action economy (requires an action) for balance. * ""Blood Curse of the Marked"" in isolation as a ""not-spell"", is good. It's seemingly balanced to be strong but not over powered, although this does push it towards ""auto-take"" territory. * ""Blood Curse of the Muddled Mind"" in isolation as a ""not-spell"", is good and thematic for a class inspired originally by ""The Last Witch Hunter"". It's a shame this is really the only ""anti-mage"" aka ""witch hunter"" feature in the class. **The Bad** So now we'll get to the bad, I'll go through the class feature by feature and I'll add headers for easy scanning: **The Base Class** The class has a d10 hit die, which is fine for a martial class sure but this runs into an issue I'll no doubt bring up a few times. Whilst this is seemingly done to match the Fighter's hit die it starts to butt heads with the ""hit points for magic"" ""risk for reward"" mechanics. By 4th level a character with 14 Constitution has 36 HP on average and loses 5 HP on average between short rests depending on their usage of Crimson Rite and Blood Maledict's Amplify (assuming 1 use of each, keeping Crimson Rite active until the next rest). This gets exacerbated even further at higher levels, at 20th level a 14 Constitution character will have 164 HP and will lose only 24 HP on average (assuming 4 uses of amplified Blood Curses and a use of Crimson Rite, accounting for Sanguine Mastery's re-roll and pick the lower feature) between short rests. This gets worse if you're dealing with a character that's improved their Constitution score higher than 14, in a test build I built a human Blood Hunter with 14 Constitution at 1st level whom would put at least two more points into it, so their average would be 184 HP but they'd still only be losing 24 HP on average; which means you're risking next to nothing to fuel your main class abilities. I'm torn between suggesting a change however as reducing the hit die to a d8 would lower the martial capabilities of the class (inability to be a front-line fighter) although it would make the choice to use Blood Maledict/Crimson Rite at early levels (and somewhat at late levels) more of the ""risk vs reward"" it seems it should be; that and it would make the class' combat role closer to say a Swords Bard or Hexblade Warlock. **Proficiencies &amp; Equipment** I'm unsure that the class should be able to use shields, which I'm assuming is inspired from the Cleric's armour proficiencies, as it appears to clash with the depictions of the class (which feature either one-handed or two-weapon fighting), as well as the class' inclination towards Dexterity as an attribute (Dexterity save proficiency, the Lycan subclass making your unarmed strikes finesse weapons, offering Studded Leather as starting equipment, and Strength builds having to juggle four attributes: Str, Dex, Con, Int). This class seems to borrow an aspect of the Ranger for the skills which is mostly fine, although the choice to include Acrobatics in the skill list but leave out Perception (something that someone whom is a Hunter of Monsters might need to be aware of their surroundings) is quite odd. I'm assuming the idea is you use your background and/or race to pick up the skill but that seems to clash with the aforementioned theme of being a monster hunter. The class equipment seems mostly fine, although the choices of armour are strong for first level (the best light armour or the second best medium armour for a dexterity build) as well as the ranged options, whilst nicely thematic, will hamper ranged builds at 5th level due to the loading property preventing them from using their extra attack unless they replace their weapons. Due to the wording of the first option they could take a longbow with no arrows for their martial weapon or take a shortbow with no arrows for one of their two simple weapons, but this would mean they'd then gain a redundant crossbow/hand crossbow. **Hunter's Bane** Hunter's Bane massively steps on the toes of the ranger, giving you the 14th level version of Favoured Enemy at 1st level although your choice is locked to fey, fiends and undead (likely something you'll be fighting if you're playing this class in a campaign) and doesn't include learning their languages. I get the need to put across that ""monster hunter"" theme/idea for the class but taking another class' ability at its strongest version nearly wholesale isn't the way to go. In a module such as Descent into Avernus/Curse of Strahd you're on par with the party's potential Ranger and vastly outshining them in any campaign that involves any combination of the three. Additionally the text-blurb for the Hemocraft save DC feels like it should be apart of the class' second 1st level feature ""Blood Maledict"" rather than in this feature; this might make more sense in your own setting (referring to the class creator) but as someone unfamiliar with it this seems out of place in terms of formatting. **Blood Maledict** Speaking of, Blood Maledict. One of the class' core gimmicks it relies on a powerful but novel idea of giving the player ""pseudo-magic"" to cast not-spells called ""Blood Curses"", the majority of which are bonus actions or reactions (7 bonus, 1 action, 4 reactions) with a 30 foot range, that can be amplified for additional/more powerful effects at the cost of your hit points (1d4 from 1st-4th level, 1d6 from 5th-10th level, 1d8 from 11th-16th level, 1d10 from 17th to 20th level). A novel idea but the mechanics don't hold up, you start with only one use of the feature and one known Blood Curse with uses recharging on a short rest; which means you're going to be using this in most if not all encounters (I'll cover the curses themselves later) especially since the basic use doesn't actually use any of your hit points to do. It's only when you amplify that it uses a number of your hit points equal to a roll of your Hemocraft die, something that only leaves you vulnerable at 1st level (can use anywhere between 1/12th to 1/3rd of your health if you have 14 Con). When you gain additional uses of this feature the cost is even more negligible when expending all uses: 6th level costs you 7 of your average 58 HP (with 10 Con), 13th level costs you 13 of your average 82 HP (with 10 Con), and 17th level costs you 22 of your average 106 HP (with 10 Con, 123 HP with 12 Con, 140 HP with 14 Con). In keeping with the idea of the feature you can't affect creatures without blood unless you amplify it, meaning quite oddly you're at a bit of a disadvantage when fighting low CR undead such as Skeletons despite supposedly being adept at hunting them. Finally the recharge on a short rest begins this class' trend of fast recharge for nearly all of its abilities, meaning your Blood Hunter will be entering most fights with all of their resource based abilities ready to go after a brief sit down between encounters; if Blood Curses are this class' parallel to Warlock Spells then you're getting a comparable level of ""not-spell-slots"" on top of the martial foundation of the class. **Fighting Styles** Fighting Styles are a staple of martial classes, although having them here plays a bit of havoc later so keep that in mind (it mainly concerns dueling and the class' leaning towards Dexterity). **Crimson Rite** Crimson Rite is another good idea done badly; for the mere cost of 1d4 hit points at 2nd level (average of 2 hp cost from your 16/18/20 HP depending on if you have 10/12/14 Con) and a bonus action (something this class uses a lot) you can cast part of the 3rd level spell elemental weapon without using concentration that lasts for a potentially infinite amount of time (play a Warforged and keep a hold of your weapon, since you don't need to sleep your Crimson Rite will remain active forever unless you are knocked unconscious). Ignoring the Warforged example you will likely only ever have to cast this once (or twice for dual-wielders) between rests. The damage flavour for the first 3 options are fairly equal choices (fire, cold, lightning), granting you a second one of those three at 7th level; but the choices for the esoteric rites are unevenly weighted between necrotic, thunder and psychic (the latter being one of the least resisted damage types alongside force damage), which means most players will pick psychic damage due to it turning up in other class features later on (as well as it's usefulness as a damage type). With the progression of the Hemocraft die you're out-doing the damage of elemental weapon by 5th level and doing double by 11th level and over double at 17th; all for a bonus action (instead of an action), without concentration, and the small cost of 2/3/4/5 HP depending on Hemocraft die size. Finally I understand why this isn't limited to melee weapons so ranged builds aren't locked out of class features but it does mean at minimal cost you can deal equivalent damage to a greatsword from up to 150ft away using a longbow at 2nd level (you have the same min/average/max with 1d8+1d4 as you do with 2d6), which gets worse at 5th level and beyond when you're doing more damage than a greatsword from up to 150ft away. **A brief word on Subclasses** Blood Hunter Orders, aka the four subclasses we'll cover in detail later but briefly: we've got ""Ghostslayer"" that's a pseudo-cleric who can walk through walls, ""Profane Soul"" that's a warlock-wannabe for those who want to multiclass but won't, ""Mutant"" that just for boosting stats so you're good at everything, and ""Lycan"" that's a best-of-both monk-barbarian hybrid with legendary-tier magic weapons for hands. Needless to say they've all got issues (and that's not a joke about the dark/edgy class theme). **Brand of Castigation (the root of many problems)** Brand of Castigation, the root of many later problems. This feature is very strong, acting like a pseudo-smite (because we're really borrowing from nearly all classes in some fashion) when you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite (something you can use for very little cost, and do from up to 150ft away from a target, but could theoretically do from an infinite distance away if you had a weapon with that range) you can brand them without requiring any kind of action. This free action branding lasts until you dismiss it (or you brand something else), which in realistic terms is when the creature is dead, requires no concentration, and means that if the creature deals damage to you or anyone within 5ft of you it takes 1-5 psychic damage depending on your Intelligence modifier; it also counts as a spell of a level between 3rd-9th depending on your class levels for the purposes of dispel magic but not counterspell so good luck getting rid of this thing if you're not a spellcaster. This also recharges on a short rest so you'll near-always have this ready to go in an encounter, meaning the monsters are incentivised into not hitting you, as they will take damage at whatever range they do it at because the brand has no range, meaning the hit point cost of your other features is even more trivial because you're taking less damage. **Grim Psychometry** This is the most niche ribbon feature, a tiny crown made of ribbon if you will, and like with most areas this class enters it's the best at it. If you're playing in a campaign where you're not investigating dark and evil objects/places often then this feature is practically useless and 9th level is effectively a dead level in the class besides your improving proficiency. If you are playing in a campaign involving that then you're going to be a Know-It-All when it comes to lore, especially since the feature suggests that if you roll well enough the DM provides your character ""visions of things previously unknown to the character"" to quote the text; considering you can take History as a skill and it uses one of the classes main stats you're looking at a +7/+8 (based on 16/18 Intelligence) bonus to the roll you make with advantage, so those visions may be quite frequent. **Dark Augmentation** If you happened to have the misfortune of a dead level from Grim Psychometry not being useful then Dark Augmentation, your 10th level feature makes up for it in spades. You gain 5 feet of speed and your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saves gain a bonus equal to your Intelligence modifier, so your Strength and Constitution saves are at +3/+4 (based on 16/18 Intelligence, and 10 Strength/Constitution) and your Dexterity saves are at +10/+12 (based on 16/18 Dexterity/Intelligence). This is strong at the level you get it, stronger when your Intelligence modifier is higher than your proficiency (effectively giving you better proficiency in Strength/Constitution saves) and becomes ridiculous at 17th level where you've got near-proficiency in Strength/Constitution saves (based on 20 Intelligence) and your Dexterity saves are at +16 (based on 20 Dexterity/Intelligence) meaning you have only a 15% chance to fail a DC20 Dexterity save. Combine this with the Order of the Mutant for even more shenanigans I'll cover later. **Brand of Tethering** Up next is Brand of Tethering. Whilst it may sound like another type of brand you can cast it is in fact an addition to your existing Brand of Castigation (because why have players choose between two features they can do without action economy when you can let them do both?). Your Brand of Castigation now does twice as much psychic damage when the branded creature hits you or a creature within 5ft of you, which will be around 8/10 (based on 18/20 Intelligence) of one of the least resisted damage types. Additionally this free action feature (that you'll practically always have ready in an encounter) which only requires you damage a creature with your Crimson Rite (something that can be done from up to 150ft away) stops the branded creature from dashing and, when they try to escape you and your two buddies who're hitting it (that it can't hit back at all without slowly killing itself) like any sane person would want to by using a teleport or plane shift of any kind they take 4d6 damage they don't get to save against and then have to succeed a Wisdom saving throw or the teleport/plane shift fails. This practically forces the DM to have the BBEG (or one of his lackeys) know dispel magic to remove the brand so they can escape the party (the lack of dashing means they will be out-run by the party) but even then the chance of success at this level is 25% (the brand counts as a 6th level spell at this level, so the dispel DC is 16), which slowly diminishes down to 10% at 18th level when the brand is equivalent to a 9th level spell that you can cast without any action economy and recharges on a short rest. **Sanguine Mastery** As far as capstone features for classes go, Sanguine Mastery is a very strong one. It also destroys any remaining vestiges of ""risk vs reward"" when it comes to using your hit points as a resource to fuel your abilities. At 20th level you'll have on average 124/144/164/184/204/224 HP (based on 10/12/14/16/18/20 Constitution) and you'll be using on average 30 HP for your base class features (based on 4 uses of Blood Curses and 1 use of Crimson Rite, without Sanguine Mastery) before this feature comes into play, with the HP cost reducing to 24 HP on average after re-rolls which makes the cost even more negligible than before. The other part of this feature, regaining uses of Blood Curses on a crit, seems harmless but like Dark Augmentation you combine it with the Order of the Mutant for shenanigans. **The Order of the Ghost Slayer** Finally onto the subclasses, first up Order of the Ghostslayer. **Rite of the Dawn &amp; Curse Specialist** At 3rd level you gain a new Crimson Rite flavour that's just better than the others you have access to: you 1d4 deal radiant damage (which scales up), you weapon gains the effect of the light cantrip without the dim light radius, you gain resistance to necrotic damage (which in real terms means you're always resistant to necrotic damage during encounters), and you roll two dice of radiant damage instead one when hitting undead (Curse of Strahd might be a breeze eh?). In addition to the only Rite you'll be using until 14th level (or when fight a celestial which goes against the class' theme and the Hunter's Bane feature) you gain an additional use of your Blood Curse(s) and remember that limitation about the target needing blood? Well this now ignores that limitation so skeletons are now fair game, as much as that breaks the premise of how the blood curses work as well as making the need to amplify the curses non-existent which means you're only losing 2 HP on average between short rests for your abilities. Seems like any potential drawback from the pseudo-magic feature the class has as a pillar just got roundly ignored by this subclass huh. **Ethereal Step** At 7th level you get ""Ethereal Step"" and the simplest way to describe this feature is thus: you can cast the spell etherealness without requiring any action, that lets you affect both the material and ethereal planes at the same time, also lets you walk through objects and creatures like difficult terrain and lasts for 1-5 rounds (based on your Intelligence Modifier). You can only use it once to start with but don't worry, it recharges on a short rest and you can use it twice between rests at 15th level. So to recap, you can cast controllable version of the 7th level spell etherealness that still lets you interact with/attack creatures on the material plane, 1-2 times between short rests, that requires no action or bonus action at 7th level. **Brand of Sundering** At 11th level you gain an upgrade to your Brand of Castigation called ""Brand of Sundering"", whilst this feature might seem reasonably innocuous at first hear me out. Whenever you do damage to the creature you've branded, you do an additional Hemocraft die of rite damage and the creature can't move through creatures/objects. Sounds fine, until you realise that your longbow now does 1d8+2d8+Dex damage to the branded creature from up to 150ft away. Something that gets even worse when your Hemocraft die size goes up to 1d10; making it 1d8+2d10+Dex damage per hit from up to 150ft away against a creature that can't attack you back without taking 4/8 damage (based on 18 Intelligence at 11th level/13th level) per instance of damage against you or anyone within 5 ft of you (so if you're ranged it's the wizard/warlock chilling with you or if you're melee it's the martials you're fighting next to). The ""can't move through creatures and objects"" part just adds to the 13th level base class features list of reasons why the BBEG/Monster can't do anything to escape. **Blood Curse of the Exorcist** At 15th level you gain your unique Blood Curse, ""Blood Curse of the Exorcist"". As a bonus action you can end a charmed, frightened or possessed effect on an ally within 30ft. Hey, that seems fine... However amplifying for the low low average cost of 4 HP makes whatever caused said condition on the ally take 3d6 psychic damage that they are unable to save against and then they must make a Wisdom save or be stunned until the end of your next turn. So to recap as a bonus action you can undo a condition on an ally, damage an enemy and cast an auto-hit stunning strike on them by giving up just 4 of your 94 hit points (based on only having 10 Constitution); you can also repeat this madness 3 more times before you need to rest (5 times total at 17th level). **Rite Revival** For the subclass' final feature you get... drum-roll please Rite Revival! Which is literally just Relentless Endurance from the Half-Orc racial traits but it only activates as long as you have a Crimson Rite active, which would make it less useful (although realistically you should always have a Rite active) until you realise that there's no recharge on this feature so you will just never die as long as you have some form of healing such as a potion of healing since, on average, you'll regain 7 hit points which is more than the average damage of 5 you'll take from your Crimson Rite, or have the party Cleric/Bard/Healer use ranged healing (like healing word) to keep you on your feet and keep your Rite active. **The Order of the Profane Soul** Next subclass and arguably the weakest of the four: Order of the Profane Soul. A subclass that's the awful half-way between ""I want to multiclass into warlock"" and ""I want the capstone feature for my class"" where you gain ""3rd-warlock"" spellcasting and basically no other features of Warlock. Otherworldly Patron, Spellcasting &amp; Rite Focus At 3rd level you get spellcasting, which is just warlock spellcasting but less of it. You also get an upgrade to your Crimson Rite depending on what flavour of warlock you would have multiclassed into: * The Archfey gets a free cast of the spell faerie fire on a hit (instead of advantage they can't use cover). * The Fiend feature does nothing unless you picked the Rite of the Flame in which case it means you're rolling a 3 on average for your Fire damage. * The Great Old One gives you a free cast of cause fear on a crit that lasts only a turn (but can frighten undead). * The Undying gives you a Hemocraft die of HP back when you kill something with a rite weapon. * The Celestial lets you cast healing word with Intelligence using your ""not-spell slots"". * The Hexblade gives you your proficiency in flat damage on the next attack that hits a creature you targeted with your Blood Curse (bit niche, also does nothing if your curse killed the creature you targeted). A mixed bag indeed. **Mystic Frenzy &amp; Revealed Arcana** At 7th level you borrow the Eldritch Knight's feature word for word. Whilst also borrowing that feature, you also get a spell depending on your patron that you can use one of your two spell slots to cast: blur, scorching ray, detect thoughts, blindness/deafness, lesser restoration, and branding smite. The spells you get aren't too bad, but they're nothing stellar to compete against your four chosen spells for your meagre two spell slots. **Brand of the Sapping Scar** At 11th level you borrow another feature from Eldritch Knight for your Brand of Castigation upgrade, although this one has been re-flavoured to fit the class. Combined with everything else the Brand can do even a feature as relatively mundane as this is strong; the most basic example of why that is concerns casting hold person on the branded creature that already can't run away (not dash) or use magic to escape (without hurting itself) and now has disadvantage on avoiding being restrained. **Unsealed Arcana** At 15th level you gain another free spell depending on your patron but this time you can cast them without using a spell slot once per long rest. This is okay, unless you didn't want that specific spell in which case this is basically a dead level for you. The balance between the spells is a bit askew too, since being able to get a free cast of slow or haste is often a lot more powerful than something like bestow curse or blink. **Blood Curse of the Souleater** At 18th level you get this subclass' arguably most powerful feature, your unique Blood Curse ""Blood Curse of the Soul Eater"" which is one of those features that can be potentially abused with a bag of rats/spiders. Using your Soul Eater Blood Curse you use your reaction to gain advantage on your next turn's attacks when a creature is reduced to 0 hit points, spending on average 5 of your average 112 hit points (based on 10 Constitution) to gain back a spell slot too. Cumulatively you're spending only 5 hit points on average (based on 4 uses, one amplified) out of your average 112/148/184 hit points (based on 10/14/18 Constitution) to effectively have 3 spell slots and advantage for four turns which is a bargain of a trade. Additionally you could use the demise of your allies to your benefit with this feature since despite saying you usher the soul to your patron the doesn't say it kills the creature that dropped to 0 hit points, meaning your ally can go unconscious and power you up in the process; enjoy trying to reconcile where exactly that player character's soul is when they get healed though. **The Order of the Mutant** Third subclass is the Order of the Mutant and this is one of the two strongest. For this one we've got to talk about it's gimmick of ""Mutagens"" before we talk about the features. **Mutagens** In somewhat alphabetical order we have: * ""Aether"" where you can essentially cast fly for an hour but it's only a 3rd of the fly speed (20ft) and you've got disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saves which renders the benefits it provides not worth using; especially when someone else in the party will likely have fly for multiple people at 11th level when you get this Mutagen and/or you're already a race that can fly so your racial flying speed is better. * ""Alluring"" is next, it gives advantage on Charisma ability checks but disadvantage on initiative rolls; situationally useful but otherwise nothing amazing. * ""Celerity"" is next and this one is a doozy too; your Dexterity increases by +3 (increasing to +4 at 11th and +5 at 18th) but you have disadvantage on Wisdom saves, meaning at 3rd level you can have 20 Dexterity using point-buy (15 from point buy, +2 from racial stat, +3 from Mutagen) further making a Dexterity build the way to go and even better, this means you can have 24 Dexterity by 11th level (15 from point buy, +2 from racial stats, +3 from ASIs, +4 from Mutagen). * ""Conversant"" is similar to alluring, advantage on Intelligence ability checks but disadvantage on Wisdom ability checks; rather underwhelming especially since, unless you're a bookworm, you'll be using your Wisdom skills more than your Intelligence skills but your mileage may vary. * ""Cruelty"" is next, it requires you to be 11th level and lets you take another attack after using the attack action as a bonus action but you have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saves; whilst an extra attack may be nice the crippling blow to your saves makes this not worth using unless you really need that extra swing. * ""Deftness"" is similar to ""Conversant"" but with Dexterity and Wisdom ability checks respectively; as such it has the same issue. * ""Embers"" &amp; ""Gelid"" seem like a decent pair, granting you resistance to fire &amp; cold damage as well as vulnerability to cold &amp; fire respectively; that's until you realise you can only have 3 of these ready at one time and there's others that eclipse the benefits these mutagens bring. * ""Impermeable"", ""Shielded"", &amp; ""Unbreakable"" form a triangle of giving resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing whilst giving vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing; a neat idea that makes use of these damage types but it has the same issue as ""Embers"" &amp; ""Gelid"" have, although having a 3rd of a Barbarian's Rage active until you rest is quite a strong thing depending what you're fighting. * ""Mobile"" is incredibly strong: you gain immunity to the grappled and restrained conditions until you rest and at 11th level this gives immunity to paralyzed too, and the side effect? You have disadvantage on the Strength ability checks you no longer need to make because you're not being grappled, so this is practically an auto-take for this subclass. * ""Nighteye"" just gives you darkvision up to 60ft if you don't have it and gives you an extra 60ft if you do, the downside is sunlight sensitivity; so this is only really useful if you're fighting often at night and don't have darkvision or are fighting in expansive caverns underground, pretty situational but not awful. The exception being if you're a Drow, where you end up with 180ft of Darkvision with no additional penality as you're already dealing with sunlight sensitivity. * ""Precipient"" is a clone of ""Deftness""/""Conservant"" but with Wisdom and Charisma; same issues apply. * ""Potency"" is ""Celerity"" but for Strength instead of Dexterity and gives you disadvantage on Dexterity Saves, meaning at 3rd level you can have 20 Strength using point-buy (15 from point buy, +2 from racial stat, +3 from Mutagen) and you can have 24 Strength by 11th level (15 from point buy, +2 from racial stats, +3 from ASIs, +4 from Mutagen); this means you can get half of the Barbarian's 20th level feature at 11th level which is insanely strong for a Strength build, completely stepping on the toes of another class' theme/style/gimmick with just one element of this subclass. * ""Precision"" requires 11th level and lets you crit on a 19-20 whilst giving you disadvantage on Strength saving throws; a rather late feature considering Fighters can get this at 3rd level with no drawback, this gets thrown in the same group with the other ""okay at best but comparatively useless"" mutagens. * ""Rapidity"" increases your speed by 10ft (15ft at 15th level) and gives you disadvantage on Intelligence saves; potentially useful if you want to keep up with the party monk but is overshadowed by the other, vastly better mutagens. * ""Reconstruction"" requires 7th level, gives you your proficiency in hit points back each turn for 1 hour when you're under half, and only reduces your speed by 10ft for it; the effect itself seems a decent enough balance but then you remember this class uses its HP as a resource and using this mutagen you regain, on average, equal to or more than the amount you use when rolling Hemocraft die on your turn (3 HP cost for an average hemocraft die at 7th level, regain 3 HP each turn when under half) meaning any vulnerability you might get from using your Hemocraft die-based abilities whilst low on health is roundly negated. * ""Sagacity"" is just ""Celerity"" with Intelligence and Charisma respectively; exact same issues apply here. * ""Vermilion"" gives you an additional use of your Blood Curses and gives you disadvantage on death saving throws, I'd say this is a neat mutagen but the cost rather outweighs the boon; although considering how hardy this class can be it's a rare day you'd be making death saves so if you're in dire need of more Blood Curses then it's at effectively no cost. **Formulas &amp; Mutagencraft** So for actual subclass features now that's out of the way we have ""Formulas"" at 3rd level. This gives you access to 4 of the aforementioned Mutagens, gaining another one at at 7th level, 11th level, 15th level, and 18th level; each time you get a new one you can swap out an old one too so they're a bit like Eldritch Invocations from the Warlock, a fine idea ruined by everything around it. You also get Mutagencraft, a feature that lets you make the aforementioned mutagens at a rate of one per short/long rest, upping to 2 at 7th level and 3 at 15th level; you consume them with a bonus action which last until you rest (2 that last 1 hour instead) and you can get rid of effects of them with an action. They can't be used by anyone else and ones you make but don't use stop working when you rest. So some things here, firstly these concoctions require no materials/components/items to make meaning you're never going to be without these bonuses that last until you rest (mostly); three levels in and you're comfortably sitting at 20 in Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution (depending on mutagen/stat choice). Secondly with the exception of the two that only last an hour there's no downside to just drinking your mutagens as soon as you make them, take ""Celerity"" as an example: for having 20 Dexterity when everyone else could at most only have 17 (assuming your party is using point-buy, example is: 15 from point-buy, +2 from racial bonuses) giving you a big advantage over other classes at that level and the only downside is disadvantage on Wisdom saves that'll only come up if the enemies you're fighting are spellcasters or have an ability which targets Wisdom but should you fail you can just end the disadvantage when you need to with an action. **Strange Metabolism** At 7th level ""Strange Metabolism"" gives you immunity to poison damage and immunity to poisoned, which is strong out the gate but wait! There's more! Remember those negative effects of the mutagens? Well you can use a bonus action to just ignore the negative effects of a mutagen for 1 minute, once per long rest; that disadvantage you had on Wisdom saves to get your 20 Strength, Dexterity or Intelligence (now as high as 22 thanks to the 4th level ASI), well you can get rid of that when you get into an encounter that might challenge those saves. 20-22 Strength, Dexterity or Intelligence at 7th level with no downside? Broken. **Brand of Axiom** At 11th level you get a new brand, or you would if this was balanced; you get an upgrade to your Brand of Castigation! Remember when I said it was the root of a lot of issues? This time around your on-a-hit free action, unlimited range, no saves allowed Brand will: automatically cast dispel magic on any illusions or invisibility the branded creature has going, dispel polymorph and true polymorph and undo natural shape-shifting if the creature fails a Wisdom save, stun them on said failed save until the end of your next turn, cast an auto-success version of counterspell if they or someone else attempts to use any illusion/invisibility magic on them (even if someone else cast blur, mirror image, or greater invisibility on them it would fail automatically), and if they attempt to shape-change or use polymorph again they must make a Wisdom save or be stunned until the end of your next turn. Remember, the only pre-requisite to activate your brand is to damage this creature once with your Crimson Rite; you do the equivalent of cast two or more 3rd level spells without any action economy using a resource that replenishes on a short rest. This ability cripples shape-changing enemies like Lycanthropes and could potentially counterspell an infinite number of casts of true polymorph (several mages trying to cast on the branded target), with only a single DC 16/17/18 saving throw (based on 18/20/22 Intelligence) between it working and the creature or caster (wording is unclear) being stunned for the next round. Additionally the wording of this feature is very vague. Does ""any illusions disguising or making a creature invisible when you brand them"" apply to all illusion school spells on the creature, specifically ""disguise"" and ""invisibility"" spells, or all illusion school spells both on the creature and those nearby that may render it disguised or invisible such as silent image? If a branded creature succeeds the Wisdom saving throw to change shape or polymorph, do they have to then make a save because they're now ""a creature branded by you is polymorphed or has changed shape"" and ""must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or revert to their true form and be stunned until the end of your next turn""? The wording needs to be cleaned up here to specify what spells/effects ""illusions disguising and making a creature invisible"" concerns as well as to whether or not a polymorphed/shapeshifted creature needs to save all the time it is branded. If it does have to save say every turn it's polymorphed whilst branded then this feature is incredibly powerful since it's able to potentially inflict stun every 6 seconds for the rest of the creatures life. **Blood Curse of Corrosion** At 15th level you get your unique Blood Curse: Blood Curse of Corrosion. This lets you inflict the poisoned condition on a creature within 30ft as a bonus action if they fail a Constitution save, which they make again at the end of each of their turns until it ends (which could potentially be forever since this effect doesn't have a time limit). That may seem underwhelming or even okay considering you can do this 3/4/5 times (depending on level and/or mutagens) but it becomes very strong when you amplify it; for the low cost of an average of 4 HP you can deal 4d6 necrotic damage to the target, which it takes each time it fails the saving throw for this not-spell that has no time limit. The vague wording bugbear strikes again here too since it's not clear whether or not the creature takes the initial 4d6 necrotic damage before taking the Constitution save or after it fails the Constitution save. This is also something you can do to 3/4/5 different creatures, again as a bonus action, without requiring concentration, meaning you can potentially kill up to 5 creatures in an encounter without lifting a finger after casting. It's worth noting that by this level your save DC can be as high as 20 (based on 20 Intelligence, ""Sagacity"" mutagen +4, and +4 proficiency); meaning creatures with 10 Constitution have a 5% chance of not taking 4d6 necrotic damage every 6 seconds for the rest of their (now short) lives. **Exalted Mutation** At 18th level you gain ""Exalted Mutation"" which completely removes any scarcity to your mutagens. Rather than only having three mutagens to use, as long as you've currently got one active (and you will do for most of them because they last until you rest at which point you get them back) you can swap the active one to another one of the 8 you know; effectively granting you up to 7 more uses of your mutagens (depending on how high your Intelligence modifier is). There's one small mote of balance here though, rather than recharging on a short rest this ""hot-swap mutagen"" feature recharges on a long rest; however I'd be hard pressed to believe you'd run out of uses of it by the time you take a long rest. ___ Continued in a comment because of reddit's limit to 40,000 characters."
35,vulnerability,dndnext,My own take on the homebrew vampire race,1,fhymuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/fhymuz/my_own_take_on_the_homebrew_vampire_race/,2020-03-13 23:09:11,"Would like to get your opinion, I used a point system made by [u/JamesMusicus](URL : Vampire *Vampires are sleek demons for good times.""* *Adam Cohen* # Vampire Traits (5) **(+3) Ability Score Increase.** Your charisma score increases by 2 and your dexterity or strength score increases by 1. **Age.** Vampires are immortal, frozen in time. You keep the age you had before you were embraced. **Alignment.** Most vampires are evil, believing in their own strength and progress towards power. They tend towards lawful as well, believing firmly in the hierarchy of power and submission, with vampires being at the top of the food chain. **Size.** Vampires keep the height of their previous race. **Speed.** Vampires have a speed of 30 ft. **(-0.5) Forbiddance.** You cant enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants. Furthermore, you have no reflection. **(+1) Undeath.** You do not need sleep, food or air. **(+0.5) Undead Resistance.** You have resistance to necrotic damage. **(-0.5) Undead Vulnerability.** You have vulnerability to radiant damage. **(+1) Deadly Hunter.** You are proficient in stealth and persuasion. **(+1) Superior Darkvision.** You have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray, except for the vibrant color red. **(-1) Sunlight Sensitivity.** You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. **(+1.5) Vampire Magic.** You know the friends cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the charm person spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the Spider Climb spell once with this trait and regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells. **(+1) Feral Claws.** Your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes as both a main and offhand weapon attack. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Dexterity or Strength modifier. When you reach 5th level, your feral claws are magical. **(+1) Hunters Bite.** Your bite is a natural weapon, which you can use to make an unarmed strike as a main weapon attack. If you hit, you deal magical necrotic damage equal to 1d6 + your Dexterity or Strength modifier. If you convinced a humanoid target through enchantment magic to let you feed on them, they experience the Hunters Bite not as an attack, but as ecstasy and are a willing subject to feed on. Furthermore, they will not take lethal damage from the attack. Afterwards, they will not be hostile towards you because you fed on them, though they might not understand why. They will not be aware magic influenced their mind even if the enchantment spell says otherwise. Feeding prevents Starvation and Sunlight Hypersensitivity for 24 hours. However, you can choose to drain and kill your target in this way. If you do, Starvation and Sunlight Hypersensitivity will be prevented for 72 hours. **(-1) Starvation.** Unless you fed (see Hunters Bite), starvation causes you to gain 1 level of Exhaustion that cannot be removed by any means except by drinking blood. **(-1) Sunlight Hypersensitivity**. Unless you fed (see Hunters Bite), you take radiant damage equal to your player level when you start your turn in sunlight. This damage is not affected by your Undead Vulnerability. **(-0.5) Harmed by Running Water**. You take acid damage equal to your player level if you end your turn in running water. **(-0.5) Stake to the Heart.** If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into your heart while you are sleeping, incapacitated, restrained, or as part of a critical hit, you are Paralyzed until the weapon is removed. **Languages.** You can speak, read, and write all languages you knew before you were embraced."
36,vulnerability,dndnext,Path to the Grave question,1,fijelz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/fijelz/path_to_the_grave_question/,2020-03-15 01:44:40,"Just wondering how exactly path to the grave (grave cleric channel divinity) interacts with more attacks and additional damage. The general consensus seems to be that only the first attack gets the vulnerability. So just to confirm, the very first attack only? No additional rolls from extra attack or from using a bonus action attack. Assuming that is the case, how does it work with extra damage sources such as hunters mark/hex or a rogues sneak attack? Lets assume a ranger / assassin multiclass with hunters mark up. Would the damage rolls from the attack itself + hunters mark + sneak attack all be doubled because of the vulnerability?"
37,vulnerability,dndnext,"I'm homebrewing a wild magic warlock subclass, would like help with the magic surge table.",1,fk0w7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/fk0w7k/im_homebrewing_a_wild_magic_warlock_subclass/,2020-03-17 18:08:06,"You know how there're warlock options for the Good and Evil axises (axes?) of the Outer planes, but not the Lawful and Chaotic ones? I'm trying to fix that. This warlock pact is called the pact of the Anarchist, and it can be granted by a demon prince or princess of the Abyss, a Slaad Lord of Limbo, an Asuran Commander of Arborea, or anything inbetween (and before you say anything, a given diety is able to grant multiple cleric domains, so it's perfectly logical for a warlock patron to be able to grant multiple warlock subclasses.) Anyway, here's what I've got so far for the magic surge table: ## Wild Magic Surge Starting at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately after you cast a warlock spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you roll a d12. If you roll a 1, roll a d100 and check the result on the Wild Magic Surge table below: 1-2)You cast *Hold Person* on yourself. 3-4)The last creature you dealt damage to that still has hit points is enlarged as though you had cast an *enlarge/reduce* spell on it. 5-6)At first, nothing seems to happen. But at the end of the turn of the creature immediately after you in the initiative order, your head explodes, dealing 1d4 piercing damage to all creatures and objects within 5ft of you, causing your body to slump to the floor, incapacitating you. This does not actually kill you, however, as the chaotic magical energy coursing through you keeps you alive but unconscious until your turn 1d4 rounds later, at which point your head regrows. You cannot be healed by any means until your head regrows. You retain no memories of anything that transpired while you were headless. 7-8)For 1d4 rounds, you gain vulnerability to the type of damage you most recently received. If the last attack you received dealt more than one type of damage, roll between them randomly. 9-10) A soft noise of flatulence is heard throughout the room (100ft radius centered on you if you are outdoors or the room is larger than 100ft), but does not seem to originate from any one point. 11-12) the 1d6 creatures nearest to you, friend or foe, take a number of d4s equal to your charisma modifier in Force Damage 13-14) A modified *Delayed Blast Fireball* bead manifests in your hands (if you were holding anything at the time, everything you were holding is transported to a special demiplane and reappears in your hands after the fireball goes off). It has a blast radius of one creature, and does not take up your concentration slot, instead going off on its own after 2d4 rounds, rolled for randomly by the DM, who does not tell you the result. On your next turn, you can use your action to pass the bead into the hands (or barring the presence of hands, another suitable anatomical structure) of a creature within 5ft of you, which is magically compelled to accept. A creature currently holding the bead has its base movement speed doubled for as long as it holds the bead, but it cannot use its action for anything but passing the bead onto another creature, which is the only way they can get rid of it. Once the requisite number of rounds has elapsed, the bead explodes, dealing 12d6 points of fire damage to whatever creature is currently holding it at the start of its turn. 15-16) You cast *Darkness*, centered on yourself. 17-18)For 1d4 rounds, you gain resistance to the type of damage you most recently received. If the last attack you received dealt more than one type of damage, roll between them randomly. 19-20)You regain 2d8 hit points. If you were already at maximum HP when you used this feature, you instead gain 2d6 temporary hit points, which can be dismissed with a bonus action. 21-22)The last creature that dealt damage to you but which still has hit points is reduced as though you had cast an *enlarge/reduce* spell on it. 23-24)You cast *Tenser's Transformation* on yourself and a magic +3 greatsword appears in your hands (if you are already holding something in one or both hands when you activate this feature, everything you were holding is temporarily transferred to a special demiplane and reappears in your hands when the effect wears off). The spell fades and the greatsword disappears after 1d8 rounds. 25-26) Nothing happens. 27-28) A Slaad chosen by the DM appears within a space within 5ft of you and immediately begins dancing, not acknowledging anything around it. It continues to dance until either attacked or directly verbally addressed; in either of these situations it will angrily shout What did you just say about me?! and then attack the offending creature, going back to dancing if it kills it. After being summoned, the slaad disappears after 1d10 rounds. 29-30) Your body swells up like a balloon, granting you 1d12 temporary hitpoints, but also giving you disadvantage on dexterity checks and saving throws, and reducing your speed by 10ft. This effect lasts for 1d6 rounds. 31-32) You gain telepathy for a 60ft radius for 1d8 rounds. A creature does not need to know a language you speak to have a conversation with you, but it does need to know at least one language."

So if you find too easy or strong for your party it's easy to change values, and still, use the mechanisms of the trap. &amp;#x200B; Trigger: A specific place at the forest has been gifted with too much power by an entity, maybe a crazed druid, or powerful fey, or even a cruel ancient god. If the characters make too much noise or disturb any natural process of the forest, the wilderness around suddenly comes to life. On the trigger, Bulbous Plants will emit a strong light, and if the characters were on low/no-light environment, anyone affected must make both a Constitution saving throw \[18\] and a Dexterity saving throw \[18\]. If the target succeeds on both saves, nothing happens. If the target fails one save but succeeds on the other, it is blinded until the end of its next turn. If it fails both saves, it is blinded until the end of its next turn and stunned until the end of its next turn. &amp;#x200B; Active Elements: The traps have three active elements: Bulbous Plants, which emits light; Poisonous Vines, which is (duh) poisoned; Giant Carnivorous Succulents, which will try to eat and digest some players. &amp;#x200B; Initiative: Bulbs \[30\]; Vines \[20\]; Succs \[10\]; Bulbs (Again) \[0\] &amp;#x200B; Bulbs \[30\]: Bulbs start to emit some lights, shedding bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet. This light is the area of the Bulbs attacks at the end of the turn (Init 0) and serves as a tactical way for your players to know there is something wrong in the area. Bulbs have 10HP and an AC of 10. Really easy to hit and to be destroyed. Inside the Bulb there is an inflammable saline solution. It should be inoffensive, unless someone has the already terrible idea to use flames in the forest... I'm using about two Bulbs per player. &amp;#x200B; Vines \[20\]: Vines along the ground and branches rapidly springs into life, slashing creatures around 15ft of it (imagine a whip being pulled side to side). Any character within the range must save from a Dexterity Save \[16\] or be hit for 1d8 Bludgeoning Damage + 2d6 Poison Damage. Any creatures who take any Poison Damage from the vines must make a Constitution Save \[16\] or take another 1d8+3 Poison Damage and get 1 level of Exhaustion. The Vines don't have AC or HP but are really vulnerable to Slashing Damage. Piercing damage of 20 or more should cut them too, and only really high Bludgeoning damage should cut it. Elemental Damage, such as Necrotic, Radiant, Acid, and Thunder, should cut it easily. Fire dehydrates it to a point where any damage breaks it, as well as Ice damage freezes it so any damage destroys it. Electric Damage is propagated, and any other creature touching the vines takes half of the damage, but the vines should not be destroyed by Electric Damage. I'm using 3 Vines, covering most of the ground. &amp;#x200B; Succs \[10\]: These Succs are anomalies created by magic alone, so you can go wild on these. Make them be on the ground, or maybe hanging from a tree. They try to reach and eat any enemy within 5 feet of it, attacking them with a ""bite"" attack. They hit with a +10, and have an advantage if the enemy can't see them, use an 18 Stealth for them, or roll with a +9 Stealth Modifier for each. If they hit, the enemy takes 2d10+4 piercing Damage. Any creature hit by this attack is considered Grappled and Restrained. A Succulent who has any creature Grappled can't attack another creature but uses the entire turn to digest anything inside it, causing 3d6+6 Acid Damage, and healing itself for half of this. At the end of a Grappled creature's turn, it can try to Strength Save \[18\] to open the ""mouth"" of the creature to get out. If a Succulent is attacked with a creature inside, you should offer two choices to the attacker: 1 - it can get Disadvantage on its attack to carefully attack the plant without causing any damage to the grappled creature; 2 - it can attack normally, causing half of the damage to the grappled creature (and a half to the plant). The Succs have 8d10+24 HP, and an AC of 17. They have Vulnerability to Cutting, Necrotic, and Ice Damage; and Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, Electric, and Thunder damage. &amp;#x200B; Bulbs (Again) \[0\]: Every Bulb who has lighted up emits a strong flash of light, anyone affected must make both a Constitution saving throw \[14\] and a Dexterity saving throw \[14\]. If the target succeeds on both saves, nothing happens. If the target fails one save but succeeds on the other, it is blinded until the end of its next turn. If it fails both saves, it is blinded until the end of its next turn and stunned until the end of its next turn. Any creature who has already experienced these flashes gain Advantage on the tests, and, with a successful Nature \[16\] test, they can gain Advantage (or pass automatically, if you prefer), as they already know how these plants survive."

With that I had the idea of having the old emperor come back as a mummy lord. My general question has to do with the fire resistance of tieflings and the fire vulnerability of mummies. Should I just keep it as is or maybe change the vulnerability to radiant?

41,vulnerability,dndnext,Balance these Boons for my players,1,f5nbvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/f5nbvy/balance_these_boons_for_my_players/,2020-02-18 17:16:28,"Each player will be given a boon from Chronepsis, the Draconic god of time. Help me ensure there are no exploits! Boon 1: Soul Dragon Basically a familiar. You can cast it once a day. When doing so, you sacrifice a number of your own HP, and a glowing soul dragon (about the size of an owl, sharing all owl characteristics except HP) comes out of your chest. Its HP is equal to the HP you sacrificed. Your max HP drops that amount until the dragon returns to you. It acts like a familiar, except you cannot assume direct control or see through its eyes, and it can only communicate with emotions and rough concepts. You're linked to it no matter how far you are, even if you're on different planes. The dim light emanates from the dragon for 15 feet, and is immaterial, meaning it can move through objects and creatures. When taking damage on a turn, it has resistance to the first instance, and vulnerability to any of the following times it takes damage that turn. If it dies, you must complete a long rest to recover your HP max. If you fall unconscious, the dragon returns to you at the start of your next turn no matter where it is in relation to you, restoring your max HP and healing you the amount of HP it had at that moment. While you are within 5 feet of your soul dragon you can use a reaction to gain advantage on any saving throw or perception check. Boon 2: Blinding Dragon Rage Once a day, as as a reaction before taking damage, you are bathed in golden light as the aspect of Chronepsis fills you and aids you. Spend a number of hit dice, and take that much damage. You gain resistance to all damage that turn including damage from the hit dice. All creatures within 10 feet must make a charisma saving throw of 10+ your charisma modifier or be blinded until the end of their next turn. The first time you hit any single target with an attack roll in the next minute, double the damage you took while you had resistance and add it as force(radiant?) damage to your damage roll. Whatever you hit gets pushed 10 feet back. This damage is not increased by crits. Boon 3: Dragon Soul Shield Once a day as a reaction you can call upon Chronepsis to protect you and bathe your enemies in his rage. Roll a number of hit dice. You gain all of that as temporary hit points until the end of your next turn. A blast of force and light bushes out from you in all directions. Every creature within a 10 ft radius takes that much force damage, gets pushed back to the outside of that radius and if large or smaller must make a Strength saving throw of 10+your Con modifier or is pushed prone. At the end of your next turn when the temporary hit points disappear, take damage equal to half of your remaining temporary hitpoints. If this would take you down to 0, you instead fall to 1hp. After this, healing effects on you are twice as effective for 1 turn. Boon 4: Time Dilation Once a day as a reaction, call upon Chronepsis to turn back the clock. Everything reverts 12 seconds to the past. Hitpoints, spell slots, creature locations, everything reverts. Only you are aware of this occurring. Roll all your hit dice and take that much force damage. If this would bring you below 0, you instead fall to 1HP. Time has frozen. You get 1 free turn to do anything. When time begins again, you are at the top of the initiative order, no matter what it was before and you take 2 levels of exhaustion which disappear after 1 minute."
42,vulnerability,dndnext,"nobody asked, but I calculated how much self-damage could you theoretically take in one action",1,f7ipb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/f7ipb4/nobody_asked_but_i_calculated_how_much_selfdamage/,2020-02-22 09:14:28,"So we're going to need a level 20 Evo wizard, a Hill Dwarf who rolled an 18 for con, took the tough feat, and rolled 6s for every health increase. We also need the boon of fortitude and a cleric with 9th level spell slots. At base, our Hill Dwarf Evo Wiz has 320 health. After the cleric casts both Aid (9th level of course) and heroes' feast you have (assuming max rolls on heroes' feast) 380 health, now we can begin Start by using and overchanneling all of your spells, make sure to use the highest level slots first to minimize early damage, use all but one 5th level spell slot. After this you will take 17d12 per level of spell cast. or 184 necrotic damage (RAW it seems as though the necrotic damage gets maxed as well). Next, take a short rest to get back all of your first level spell slots, cast magic missile 4 times and overchannel it every time, do this 4 more times. The damage per spell level is now 37d12 necrotic. Now we've run into a slight issue, that's 444 necrotic damage. At this point, you'd have gotten knocked unconscious 5 spells ago. Luckily, plenty of ways to get temporary hit points exist. This varies from false life, to inspiring leader, to heroism, to celestial resistance. As long as we can meet the largest sum of damage, our wizard friend can feel the entirety of the pain without a break. Unfortunately, the highest we can go up to with false life is 423, so after 36 spells, he will finally fall unconscious. but 37 is still the highest. So now we have to cast wish and wish for something besides replicating an 8th level or lower spell. That's an extra 5d10 after we cast that last 5th level spell. So here comes the final part, a fifth level casting of life transference. 6d8 necrotic, overchannled, in total it's 6d8 + 5d10 + (37x5)d12. Coming out to a total of 2318 necrotic damage. That is a dead wizard. But it has already been established that there's a high-level cleric so they can resurrect him. Additional note: As the bounds of wish are theoretically infinite, I decided not to have the wish be anything along the lines of ""let me use arcane recovery again without taking a long rest"" or ""give me necrotic vulnerability"" You definitely could do things like this, but it is a bit outside the scope of this post. If I made any mistakes please point them out to me."

Included in this will also be mispronounciations of common phrases or words. Some examples I have right now are: 1. A polester going around poleing the electorate for an upcoming election - literally beating people with a pole and asking who they're voting for. Or taking poles from tents. 2. If someone is gravely injured you can simply cut off their left side off so that they're all right. 3. If somone is described as terrible it means they can be torn apart easily so they have vulnerability to slashing damage. 4. An NPC is devoid of emotion because his sole was destroyed - his shoe's soles have worn out. 5. When served food people will say ""bone-apple-tea"" and that is what is being served - tea with floating bones and bits of apple 6. All pedestals are stools made of pedals (pedal stools) Anyone ever do something like this before? Any ideas to add? I have more but didnt want to list them, but I want as many as possible. I am known in my friend group for being ""that guy"" with dad jokes and puns so I really want to beat my players over the head with this idea to the point they feel like their characters are in hell even tho they're in the wonderful mystical feywild. I will also use this mechanic to their favour. If they come up with puns or similar things that benefit them or help them leave the feywild I will reward them accordingly!"

For example * a bracelet that provides resistance to frost damage, but imposes vulnerability to fire, lightning, thunder, and acid. * a Ring that sets all stats to 13. * Armor that adds +1 to AC, but is permanently under the effects of the Fairy Fire spell. * a Bag of Tricks that can summon beasts, but every beast so summoned is hostile to you. * Hat of disguise that lets cast disguise self at will with the caveat that whatever form you take has Ostentatiously bright Blue skin.

Some quick notes: - The following is collected from VGM, MM, MTof, GGtR, and ERftLW. - It is possible I missed something or a monster or two, but to my knowledge, this is the complete list. I did try to incorporate stat blocks that included resistances/immunities/condition advantages in features instead of directly stating them (I'm looking at you elves and dwarves). - The bludgeoning/piercing/slashing damage info is generally talking about nonmagical B/P/S. There are some fringe cases where a monster will resistant both magical and nonmagical (ex. treant) but that data was still recorded. - There are other fringe cases like being vulnerable to magical piercing from good-aligned creatures (ex. rakshasa), but that was not recorded due to being so niche. From what I found, there are 824 creature blocks in those five books, the last column of each table will be the percent of total monsters that are strong against that damage type/condition. |Condition|Immunity|Resistance|Vulnerability|Imm.+Res.|Percent| :--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |Blinded|38|1|0|39|4.7%| |Charmed|163|16|0|179|21.7%| |Deafened|29|1|0|30|3.6%| |Exhaustion|144|0|0|144|17.5%| |Frightened|152|1|0|153|18.6%| |Grappled|37|0|0|37|4.5%| |Paralyzed|100|6|0|106|12.9%| |Petrified|72|0|0|72|8.7%| |Poisoned|237|7|0|244|29.6%| |Prone|71|0|0|71|8.6%| |Restrained|40|0|0|40|4.9%| |Stunned|22|1|0|23|2.8%| A LOT of monsters (fiends, undead, and constructs) are straight immune to poison, charmed, frightened, and paralyzed.

Like the poisoned condition immunity, almost 1/3 of monsters are immune to poison damage. We can see different 'tiers' of elemental damage with fire, cold, and lightning being the worst, and psychic, thunder, radiant, and force being the best. Having a magic weapon also goes a very far way as ~27% of monsters are resistant or straight immune to nonmagical weapons.

51,vulnerability,dndnext,Homebrew Magical Rebalancing,1,dtfkc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/dtfkc4/homebrew_magical_rebalancing/,2019-11-09 00:39:25,"Hey there, DMs and experienced players of Reddit. I'm about to start my first homebrew campaign set in a FR-like (but not FR) world, and since this is unlike any of the previous games I've run (being a modded setting), I will also be taking the opportunity to heavily modify both the weapon and spell lists in the hope that options which are essentially never used by players for good reasons will be viable choices in the campaign. However, because the choice someone makes with regards to class for casters is greatly influenced by the spells they have access to, I am modifying and pre-declaring all modifications at one shot so that people will know what they are getting into, and can choose not to join the campaign if they prefer a more faithful representation of the current Rules As Written. To this end, I would like to request for feedback regarding the proposed modifications to spells, especially negative feedback when possible. Specifically, if one of the proposed buffs I'm making either A: screws over a particular class's utility or B: screws over the relative power balance with the others spells of comparable level, I'd like to know. As this exercise is done for a purely utilitarian reason, feedback along the lines of 'modified D&amp;D is not D&amp;D' or 'the current rules are the way they are because they are the best they can be' will not be helpful. In addition, as I will also be enabling all standard source books (PHB, SCAG, XGtE, VGM, MToF) simultaneously (that is, PHB + X), as well as the most recent UA Class Variants (with minor modifications to fix the wording errors with Interception and Magical Inspiration), interactions/synergy between the sources will matter. My primary aim is to make sure my players will have as much agency as possible, and I will deal with the obvious power-ups they get by similarly powering-up the AI and abilities of the mobs they face to ensure they still have a fair challenge, rather than restricting the players' freedom to make choices. If a proposed change reduces their agency by making a spell a must-pick (like Healing Spirit currently is), I will revert it, and I want to ensure that the set of rules I bring into Session Zero is final, to honour the choices they make based on them. --- Without further ado: **Cantrips:** * Blade Ward: Now uses a bonus action instead of an action to cast. * Dancing Lights: The caster loses control of the lights upon losing concentration, but they persist until the end of their duration. * Infestation: The caster can choose the direction in which the target will run. * Poison Spray: Range increased to 30 feet. * Spare the Dying; No longer requires a verbal component and can be used as a Bonus action. Grave Clerics who use this spell can apply its effects at 60 feet instead of 30, and gives the target the chance to roll one saving throw with advantage, and no negative effects if the throw is failed. * True Strike: Now uses a bonus action instead of an action to cast, will affect the next attack made in the same turn it is cast. **Level 1** * Earth Tremor: Now only affects creatures of the caster's choice in tthe area of effect. * Goodberry: No longer provides nutrition, but heals for (spellcasting modifier) with a minimum of 1 per berry. Cannot be used in combat. * Illusory Script: No longer consumes its material component. * Ray of Sickness: Applies poisoned for up to one minute, repeating the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of the target's turns. * Witch Bolt: Now requires a bonus action to maintain instead of an action. * New spell: Zagha's Banquet (All spellcasters): Provides one day's worth of food for the caster. **Level 2** * Continual Flame: No longer consumes its material component. * Crown of Madness: Affected targets can now move before they use their attack. * Darkvision: Now affects up to (spellcasting modifier) creatures of the caster's choice. * Find Traps: The caster can choose to focus hir attention on the spell for up to 10 minutes, in which time the absence or presence of traps within 30 feet of the caster can be detected. * Flame Blade: Now does 3d8 damage instead of 3d6, and no longer requires concentration. * New spell: Fumbling Fingers (Sor, War, Wiz): Causes (spellcasting modifier) humanoids of the caster's choice to have a disadvantage to their next attack roll if they fail a Wisdom saving throw. No concentration required. Casting the spell at a higher level affects targets for one additional attack per slot level. * Healing Spirit: Now requires the use of a reaction to apply its effects. (This was the only spell that was directly nerfed because of how negatively it affected every other healing spell in the game.) * Magic Mouth: No longer consumes its material component. * Magic Weapon: No longer requires concentration. * Skywrite: The effects of Illusory Script are active on the writing; creatures not intended as targets will see normal cloud patterns. **Level 3** * Clairvoyance: Can now be cast as a ritual. * Conjure Barrage: Now does an additional 1d8 damage per slot level above 3rd. * Daylight: The light created by the spell is now sunlight. * New spell: Dehydrate (Dru, Sor, War, Wiz): A targeted creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take one level of exhaustion. Plants and water elementals also take 2d10 Force damage on a failed save. On success, no ill effects occur. When cast at 6th level, the target takes 4d10 Force damage and two levels of exhaustion on a failed save, and plants and water elementals have vulnerability to this damage. On a success, the spell does halved damage and no exhaustion effects. When cast at 9th level, the target takes 10d10 Force damage and three levels of exhaustion on a failed save, or halved damage and one level of exhaustion on a success. Plants and water elementals are instantly destroyed. *(This spell replaces both Blight Lvl 4 and Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting Lvl 8.)* * Flame Arrows: No longer requires concentration. * Protection from Energy: No longer requires concentration. **Level 4** * Blight: Replaced by *Dehydrate*. * Grasping Vine: Now applies Restrained if the Dexterity saving throw is failed, and the caster may choose to pull the target any distance from 0 to 20 feet directly towards the vine. * New spell: Hasty Exit (All spellcasters): Instantly teleports all creatures of the caster's choice towards the surface, descending towers or ascending pits safely. Can be blocked by any effect blocking teleportation. * Phantasmal Killer: Now also deals 4d10 damage at the moment its saving throw is failed. * Stoneskin: No longer requires a material component or concentration. **Level 5** * Far Step: No longer requires concentration. * Insect Plague: Can now be moved 30 feet with a bonus action. * New spell: Thoughts Like Clouds (Bar, Cle, Dru, Pld, Ran): Creatures of the caster's choice within a 30 foot radius must pass a spellcasting ability check against their own spell save DC or be subjected to the effects of the Confusion spell. At the end of each of their turns, affected creatures will repeat the ability check. Automatically fails against targets who are unable to cast spells. **Level 6** * Drawmij's Instant Summon: No longer requires verbal or somatic components (and can be cast subtly). * Find the Path: No longer requires concentration. * Tenser's Transformation: Allows its caster to equip up to two weapons or a weapon and a shield, as well as a suit of armor, from the caster's inventory when the spell is cast. These items return to the caster's inventory when the spell ends. **Level 7** * Heal: Also heals the effects of maximum HP reduction. * Mordenkainen's Sword: Its attacks are made with advantage, and deal 5d10 Force damage instead of 3d10. **Level 8** * Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting: Replaced by *Dehydrate*. **Level 9** * Weird: Targeted creatures are automatically affected by the spell without a saving throw, and affected targets make a Wisdom ability check instead of a saving throw to break out of the spell (at disadvantage). ~~P.S. People who recognize the names of some of the new spells may realise what the inspirations for this campaign is.~~"

The DM decided that in doing so he was brought back to life. I want to talk to the DM and player about the consequences of that and Im interested in what you creative sorts can cook up. I've considered either Sharindlar or Moradin being one of the ones responsible for bringing him back. \-He can never harm a dwarf. \-Moradin brings him back with a metallic skeleton, vulnerability to lightning damage and resistant to blunt. \-Being very heavy from the metallic skeleton causing disadvantage on related checks. \-Being veery thirsty for alcohol."
53,vulnerability,dndnext,Way of the Astral Self Rebalanced,1,e0q0gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/e0q0gv/way_of_the_astral_self_rebalanced/,2019-11-24 10:23:09,"# Astral Self Rebalance The Astral Self that came out in the Barbarian and Monk UA over a month ago really interested me. As many people noted, there were a few problems. * The damage prior to level 11 was highly lacking since you couldn't use flurry of blows with your arms. There was little reason to use your arms except if you encountered a creature with radiant/necrotic vulnerability, if you needed to make a strength check, or if you needed an extra bit of reach for some reason. * The damage from level 11 to 16 was a bit too high, having a free flurry of blows for 10 minutes for only 3 ki points. This allowed them to spend nearly no ki points during an encounter while an Open Hand monk would need to use at least one ki per round to keep up in damage. This would be fine since most battles last ~3 rounds, but the 10 minute duration might let it overlap into another battle. * The damage post level 17 was way too high, a monk could spend 10 ki points to have 6 attacks per round for 10 minutes, and then you see the same problems from the second point with the exception of the Open hand monk not being able to keep up without spamming quivering palm and hoping for the best. The 10 ki point cost could've taken care of over use, but... * The Ki regeneration they get recovers 5 ki points every time any creature within 10 feet goes to zero hit points. It's not always 5 but a 17th level character using wisdom as their attack stat will almost certainly have a +5 in wisdom. This allows the monk to completely offset the ki cost of summoning their astral self. In order to solve these issues, I changed how the ki costs worked and how the attacks scaled: # Arms of the Astral Self At 3rd level, your mastery of your ki allows you to summon a portion of your astral self. On your turn, you can spend ~~2~~ **1** ki point as a bonus action to summon the arms of your astral self. ~~for 10 minutes~~ **At the start of each of your turns, you must spend 1 ki point to maintain your arms.** These spectral arms hover near your shoulders. You determine the arms' appearance based on the qualities of your character. While your astral arms are summoned, you gain the following benefits: * You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws. * The arms are monk weapons and have a reach of 10 feet. The arms deal radiant or necrotic damage (your choice). When you attack with the arms, you can use your Wisdom modifier instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. * **The first creature you hit with your astral arms on each of your turns takes extra damage equal to half your proficiency modifier (rounded down).** * Immediately after you use the Attack action with your astral arms on your turn, you can make ~~one~~ **two** extra attack**s** with your astral arms as a bonus action. ~~The number of extra attacks increases when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to two at 11th level and three at 17th level.~~ # Visage of the Astral Self Starting at 6th level, you can summon the visage of your astral self. On your turn, you can spend 1 ki point as a bonus action, or for free as part of summoning your astral arms to summon this visage for 10 minutes or until the arms are dispelled. The spectral visage covers your face like a helmet or mask. You determine its appearance based on the qualities of your character. While your visage is summoned, you gain the following benefits. * Wisdom of the Spirit. You have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Intimidation) checks. * Astral Sight. You can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet. # ~~Awakening~~ **Torso** of the Astral Self Starting at 11th level, you tap into the greater power of your astral self. While you have both your astral arms and visage summoned, **you can summon the torso as a bonus action using 1 ki points, or as part of summoning your astral arms and visage. At the start of each of your turns you must spend 2 ki points to maintain the form, alternatively you may spend 1 ki point to dispel the torso and keep the arms and visage summoned. While the torso is summoned,** you gain the following benefits. * Deflect Energy. When you take acid, cold, fire, lightning, or force damage, you can use your reaction to deflect it. When you do so, the damage you take is reduced by 1d10 + your Wisdom modifier + your monk level. * ~~Empowered Arms. Once on each of your turns when you hit a target with your astral arms, you can deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die.~~ * **Immediately after you use the Attack action with your astral arms on your turn, you can make three extra attacks with your astral arms as a bonus action.** * Word of the Spirit. When you speak through your visage, you can direct your words to a creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of you, making it so only that creature can hear you. Alternatively, you can amplify your voice so that all creatures within 600 feet can hear you. # Complete Astral Self Starting at 17th level, your connection to your astral self is complete, allowing you summon it entirely. On your turn, you can spend ~~10~~ **3** ki points as a bonus action to summon the arms, visage, and body of your astral self**, or summon it for 1 ki point as a free action if the others are already summoned**. ~~for 10 minutes~~ **At the start of each turns, you must spend 3 ki points to maintain your astral self, you may dispel it and keep the arms, visage, and torso for 2 ki points, or you may dispel it and keep your arms and visage for 1 ki point.** This spectral body covers your physical form like a suit of armor, connecting with the arms and visage. You determine its appearance based on the qualities of your character. While your astral self is summoned, you gain the following benefits. * Armor of the Spirit. You gain a +2 bonus to AC while you aren't incapacitated. * Astral Barrage. ~~Whenever you use the Extra Attack feature to attack twice, you can instead attack three times using your astral arms.~~ **Immediately after you use the Attack action with your astral arms on your turn, you can make four extra attacks with your astral arms as a bonus action.** * Ki Consumption. When a creature within ~~10~~ 30 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, you can use your reaction to regain **3** ki point~~s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1)~~. # Justifications ## Arms of the Astral Self I chose to increase the amount of attacks the Astral Self got initially because they couldn't use flurry of blows with the arms, I made the ki upkeep cost to counteract spamming. The ki cost remains the same for any monk who chooses to use flurry of blows, but the Astral self gains the benefit of magical damage, a bit more reach, and using wisdom for strength attacks, strength saves, and strength checks. It was modeled after the Open Hand's direct upgrade to flurry of blows. It lacks the versatility and combos that the Open Hand can pull of but supplements that with other things. The extra bit of damage from your proficiency bonus keeps it almost equal with Open Hand two-handing a quarter staff from levels 5-10. ## Visage of the Astral Self This remained the exact same, every archetype needs a little ribbon and I think that this is fine the way it is. ## Torso of the Astral Self I made this as a direct upgrade to the arms and because of this, I increased the amount of attacks it can make and increased the upkeep cost. The rest of the features were balanced, the Deflect Energy feature worked like Deflect Missiles without the throw back, Word of the Spirit was just a neat feature, but the Empowered Arms contributed to their massive damage increase at this level. When I removed this, it appeared that the damage was slightly lacking until level 17, to counteract this, I added the bonus damage to the arms. ## Complete Astral Self Once again, this is a direct upgrade to the torso, so I increased the upkeep cost and attacks. I also lowered the ki regeneration to be equal to the upkeep, so instead of being able to regain all of your ki, you can only maintain it. I also moved the extra attack on your action into the bonus action to maintain consistency. ## General Notes I liked the idea of a resource being consumed at a constant rate, it'll give you a sense of urgency and force you to consider which form you need in a given battle. If you're up against the BBEG, maybe you should go full astral form but if you find that it's not needed, you have the option to go down or up a level freely. Whenever I mentioned an Open Hand Monk's damage, the parameters were: * +3 Dex / Wisdom form 1-3, +4 at 4-7, and +5 at 8+ * The Open Hand monk two-handed a quarterstaff for 1d8 damage * All damage was averaged over 10 rounds of combat * The Open Hand monk spammed Quivering palm every other round and the enemy always passed. Here are the numbers: |Level|O.H.|A.S.| Comments| |:-:|:-:|:-:|:-| |1|Same|Same|| |2|Same|Same|| |3|14.65|14.1| Since the arms take a bonus action to summon, you can't use your free 2 attacks on your first turn, this accounts for the lowered damage. |4|17.6|14.65|The Astral Self monk is forced to use 1d4 until the next level, the Open Hand monk is able to use 1d8, this accounts for the lowered damage| |5|28.25|27.75|From here until level 9, the Open Hand monk is less than 1 damage ahead| |6|29|28.5|| |7|29.75|29.25|| |8|34.3|33.6|From here until level 11, the Astral Self deals 0.3 more damage per round| |9|35.15|35.45|| |10|36|36.3|| |11|38|40.1|From here until the end, the Astral Self monk deals up to 7 more damage on average, averaging on 6.01 damage. On the other hand, the Open Hand monk will have plenty of ki free to do other things like disengaging, dodging, or dashing, the Astral Self monk has to use all of their ki to maintain this | |12|38|41.05|| |13|38|43|| |14|38|43.95|| |15|38|44.9|| |16|38|45.85|| |17|45.35|51.15|This is assuming the creature passes all quivering palm saves, which is unlikely unless it's a legendary creature| |18|46.4|52.2|| |19|47.45|53.25|| |20|48.5|54.3|| I also compared the damage to Kensei, but they shine the most with a weapon like Flametongue and by spamming their Deft Strike every turn (which eats away their ki). # Final Comment The role of the Open Hand monk seems to be versatility, they gain 3 things they can do while flurrying and they can combine any two of them. The reaction canceling is a very powerful tool, it lets you take a slightly weakened Step of the Wind with your flurry for the price of 1 ki, ad it disables counterspells. The Astral Self's role to me, is to combine a strong offense (a zillion attacks) with a strong defense (Deflect Elements, +2 AC from the full astral form, and using wisdom on saves and checks). In my opinion, the defensive features were well balanced and interesting, but the damage scaling was far too delayed and too much. My redesign lowers the damage near the end and makes the increase more gradual. ### Sorry if this was a bit lengthy, thoughts and feedback are appreciated!"
54,vulnerability,dndnext,People overcomplicate things (example: thread about resistances),1,e2d7eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/e2d7eo/people_overcomplicate_things_example_thread_about/,2019-11-27 19:37:35,"First of all, I want to tell, that TTRPG is not a competitive game, it is cooperative game, where players cooperate with each other and DM cooperates with them to create a good story and fun adventure, because of this, reasoning of what is ok and what's not is quite different from other game. Afaik, Jeremy Crawford, said somewhere in dragon+, that the reason they choose resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities is a monster's theme. Undead? You get a fire vulnerability, water elemental? You can't get poisoned and so on. Why would you even need balancing and think about damage types? Yes, there's some discrepancy between damage types, and resistances, but it's not a balance issue (I don't even thing it's an issue), but because these resistances are thematically appropriate for monsters in MM and other sourcebooks. And it so happens, that lots of enemies have such resistances. And there's no problem with that. If your setting was set in somewhere in deep space, in outer realms, you could expect lots of psychic resistances, less elemental resistances, but our default setting is FR. There's no need to balance and put resistances where they're not thematically appropriate. It is not a competition, where everyone should be the same and have the same opportunities. I am talking about PCs and Monsters. Balancing between classes is another thing."

This includes Aberrations, Constructs, Dragons, Elementals, and Monstrosities. * **History**: Humanoids (since they have culture, language, and history that isn't so obscure as to be considered ""Arcane"") *I would allow a player to argue in favor of crossovers; for example History may allow them to recognize specific elder dragons, or nature may allow them to identify a monstrosity that is similar to a normal beast (such as an owlbear).* ---- The character will get more info the higher they roll.

I could see also using this to restrict metagaming as well. For instance if I know they're going to get trounced if they don't play an encounter right, maybe I'll let that 12 Nature roll reveal an important weakness that will help them strategically."

62,vulnerability,dndnext,Should shields have a strength requirement?,0,d8nawl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/d8nawl/should_shields_have_a_strength_requirement/,2019-09-24 23:36:42,"It seems odd that a dex fighter can dump strength, be weaker than a commoner, and still wield a shield as well as a strength fighter. A dex-based sword and board fighter does the same damage as strength-based, has higher initiative, more skills for their main stat, better at range in general, and their armor is cheap. A str-based fighter gets 1 more point of ac, disadvantage on stealth, a ludicrous price tag, vulnerability to stuff like heat metal and rust monsters, long donning and doffing times, and one single skill for strength. Does anyone else think that putting a strength requirement on shields would balance things out?"
63,vulnerability,dndnext,Does anyone have any experience with homebrew rules or stat block tweaks to make different damage types more useful and/or interesting in 5e?,0,d8ua22,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/d8ua22/does_anyone_have_any_experience_with_homebrew/,2019-09-25 08:08:17,"I've often heard people repeat the sentiment that damage types are kinda boring in 5e and I'd have to agree. They're all functionally the same, except for immunity/resistance/vulnerability. Vulnerabilities are also pretty rare, which I understand is partially because 5e easier in general, and having tons of vulnerabilities would make it more so. Still, doing *more* damage feels better than *not doing less* as a player, even if the outcome is the same. I think the slashing/bludgeoning/piercing damage trio is the most boring, more often than not they're rolled into one for resistances. While I appreciate the streamlined rules of 5e, part of me wishes that the damages had different uses, I might actually want to play a fighter if I had to consider which weapon (sword, mace, spear, etc.) to use in a given situation. One idea I had was crits with different damage types give a bonus effect, such as bludgeoning crits lowering target AC, but idk how well that would work. So do any of you have experience in homebrew rules, tweaks, or even just re-flavoring that make damage types more different, useful, or at least more interesting?"
64,vulnerability,dndnext,It's a bit silly that there are only 28 vulnerabilities among printed monsters,2107,dapjwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/dapjwi/its_a_bit_silly_that_there_are_only_28/,2019-09-29 12:39:45,"And it isn't 28 monsters with vulnerabilities, because a few have two vulnerabilities like the ice mephit. Tallied up they are: Fire: 13 Bludgeoning: 5 Cold: 4 Thunder: 2 Radiant: 2 Psychic: 1 Piercing Magic Weapons Wielded by Good Aligned Creatures: 1 (this one is just hilarious, it's the Rakshasa for reference) And that's it, throughout all of the monster manual, Volo's and Mordenkainen's. There are a lot that you'd think would make sense that just end up not having any vulnerability at all, for example fire elementals to cold, or maybe water elemental to lightning. Or even the really counterintuitive stuff, like the Shambling Mound being resistant to fire, despite it being a **PLANT**. Not a single classical undead is vulnerable to radiant. The only things that are are the Shadow and the Shadow demon. No vampires, no skeletons, no zombies. On the contrary, immunities and resistances are out of wack. There are 192 monsters immune to poison damage. At that point why even bother using the poison damage type. Nothing is even vulnerable to it, and 11 monsters resist it. Fire is another big one, 65 immune and 80 resistant. Cold has 29 immune and 107 resistant. Having different monsters have vulnerabilities could make it a lot more interesting and required to have different damage types, for example martials will need to swap between piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing weapons in order to fight enemies that might be resistant to specific types and vulnerable to others in order to maximize damage. Spellcasters might be incentivized to take things other than fireball if there was anything at all vulnerable to things other than fire. It just seems silly to me that this is such a minor part of the game when it could be a good way to make combat even more intricate and interesting."
65,vulnerability,dndnext,"""Why is Chaos Bolt just a worse Chromatic Orb?"" - An analysis into spell balance and game design",23,dbob1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/dbob1l/why_is_chaos_bolt_just_a_worse_chromatic_orb_an/,2019-10-01 14:52:01,"So I was talking to some people about Sorcerer and the subject of their spells came up, and in particular the discussion eventually went into how Sorcerers have so few unique spells, and a lot of their unique spells aren't that impressive. The main spell to be mentioned in this discussion was Chaos Bolt, which lead to the title of this post: ""Why is Chaos Bolt just a worse Chromatic Orb?"" At first the criticism was quite apt. Chromatic Orb is 3d8 while Chaos Bolt is 2d8 + d6. Essentially the same but Chaos Bolt has a theoretical maximum of 2 less damage, which doesn't even mention the fact that upcasting the spell only increases the damage by a d6 instead of a d8 like Chromatic Orb does. What's more is that while you can pick any element for Chromatic Orb, Chaos Bolt chooses two at random, which makes the ability to counter resistances far harder and does also mean that you can occasionally hit an enemy with an element they are resistant to. ""But you can hit two enemies with Chaos Bolt!"" I hear you say. Yes but the chances to get two of the same numbers on two d8s is an 8/64 chance, or 1/8 chance for short. This chance then further decreases with every continuous roll, to the point that hitting more than three enemies with Chaos Bolt is nye-impossible. &gt;!I'd give the math but I'm too stupid and lazy to do so.!&lt; At first I was going to talk about ways to improve Chaos Bolt (increase its damage, increase its chances to hit multiple targets, let the caster choose more damage types, etc) but then I started to look at the other damaging 1st level spells and made a surprising discovery: Chaos Bolt is actually **above** the average power level for a spell. Yes when compared to other first level single-target spells like Dissonant Whispers (3d6), Ice Knife (1d10), and Ray of Sickness (2d8) the damage of Chaos Bolt is actually incredibly high. The only spells with damage that could really compare to Chaos Bolt (other than Chromatic Orb) is Guiding Bolt (4d6), Inflict Wounds (3d10), and Catapult (3d8). This got me thinking about why these other spells are so strong. The obvious one to judge was Inflict Wounds as its a melee-ranged spell, meaning that the high damage is balanced out by the incredibly short range. Catapult is also fairly easy to judge: for one it does Bludgeoning damage which while not commonly resisted (if it's magical) is also not a damage type enemies commonly have vulnerability to. What's more is that Catapult does require ammo, and while that ammo isn't necessarily hard to find (nowhere in the spell's description does it specify that you need something that weighs 5 pounds, so you could technically use a copper coin as ammo) it's still a restriction that the DM can build encounters around. Add in the fact that it's a Save-or-Suck spell for Dexterity (a stat a lot of monsters have very high) and catapult is balanced. As for Guiding Bolt... it's a Cleric spell. I know this sounds like a copout but Clerics are incredibly starved for prepared spells and spell slots which is why *all* of them are so good. But leading back to the main question: why is Chaos Bolt so strong when compared to other single target spells? And on that note: why is ""better Chaos Bolt"" IE Chromatic Orb so incredibly far above the power curve? Chromatic Orb already does insanely high damage and the additional utility of being able to chose your damage type would obviously make it overpowered, right? Well there's one teensy insey little line of text that a lot of players and DMs tend to miss about Chromatic Orb which makes its incredible potency balanced: &gt;**Material Component:** a diamond worth at least *50 gp* Material Components of spells are parts of D&amp;D that a lot of people tend to forget in favor of Arcane Focuses or just ignoring spellcasting requirements all together and imagining a Wizard waving their hands around to cast the spell. Indeed most modern fantasy like Harry Potter and Lord of The Rings doesn't have the spellcaster use a ball of bat poop and sulfur to cast a Fireball. ~~Yes that is really the material component of Fireball. And you wonder why people mostly use Arcane Focuses.~~ As a result few people really understand how material spell components work in D&amp;D. While there are a lot of resources explaining these rules [Zee Bashew's Animated Spellbook](URL video on the subject does it quite well. In short the main thing to remember is that if a spell has a material component with a gold cost you **have** to have the component for the spell in order to cast it. In other words in order to cast Chromatic Orb you need to sink 50 gold into a shiny hunk of rock to be able to cast magic through. So in short: Chromatic Orb is OP if you cast it without the material components? Well, that's part of it. I've always personally referred to Chromatic Orb as a ""trap spell"", especially for Sorcerers who can't change their known spell list after the fact. Why is that? **Cantrip scaling.** Cantrips, as you level up, have their damage scale along with your level. This should be known by anyone who's played a character to level 5 and suddenly learnt that ""Oh hey my Firebolt does 2d10 now instead of 1d10!"" By level 11 most damaging cantrips use 3 damage dice instead of 2 which... tada! Suddenly your At-Will Ray of Frost does the same damage as a level 1 Chromatic Orb! To be fair low level spell slots becoming obsolete is a problem that all spellcasters face but especially for spells that are ""just damage"" they do face power scaling problems at higher levels. This does mean that at higher levels Chromatic Orb becomes largely redundant unless you're upcasting it, and most spellcasters favor casting actual high-leveled spells as opposed to upcasting lower leveled ones, especially ones that are ""just damage"" like Chromatic Orb. Chaos Bolt moves away from this problem somewhat by having a slight secondary effect of the 1/8 chance of targeting two people but it still suffers from scaling issues in higher level games. ##So what's the tl;dr takeaway from this? Chromatic Orb and Chaos Bolt are overpowered but they have their balance limitations. Chromatic Orb has a heavy initial gold investment and also scales very poorly into the late game, giving it very limited shelf life in the average D&amp;D campaign. All the weaknesses that Chaos Bolt has are justification for its heavy damage die. All of the ""overpowered"" first level spells have mechanics in place to balance them in the grand scheme of D&amp;D. There are some spells that are purposefully overpowered (Fireball comes to mind) but especially at early levels most things have been tested and are fair overall. #tl;dr of the tl;dr - Chromatic Orb requires a 50 gold diamond to be cast for a reason, and we should all use Chaos Bolt and Guiding Bolt since they're overpowered."

My group felt that Rangers needed help. My group also felt that the Favored Terrain/Natural Explorer changes proposed by Mike Mearls were a step in the right direction. From the Happy Fun Hour on 11/20/2018 this is what came about: &gt; **Natural Explorer** &gt; When you select a terrain type for the Natural Explorer feature, you can instead gain the following benefits based on the terrain type. If you are proficient in Nature and you choose this option, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses it. &gt; **Arctic** You gain resistance to cold damage. &gt; **Coast** You gain a swim speed equal to your speed. &gt; **Desert** You gain resistance to fire damage. &gt; **Forest** If you are proficient in Perception, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses it and when determining your passive Perception. &gt; **Grassland** Your speed increases by 10 feet. &gt; **Mountain** You gain a climb speed equal to your speed. &gt; **Swamp** You gain resistance to poison damage and are immune to disease. &gt; **Underdark** You learn Undercommon. If you do not have darkvision, you gain it with a range of 30 feet. If you have darkvision, you instead gain blindsight with a range of 5 feet. Taking this as inspiration we have taken this a step further and created an alternate Favored Enemy progression that gives Rangers more of an ""always on"" ability based on how they chose to specialize. The general idea behind these changes were ""What would a Ranger learn from fighting this kind of enemy?"" and we wanted to run with it from there. *This is still something we are actively testing, and should be considered a Work in Progress. If you have constructive criticism, feedback, or balancing ideas I am happy to hear them, though that is not the goal of this post.* &gt; **Favored Enemy** &gt; You gain favored enemy points at each designated level.

After clearing it out they saved a Ranger who was a Monster Hunter by trade who promised them a reward for saving her life. I was thinking that after harvesting the remains of the Spiders (which my party had left behind) she would call in a favour and get a friendly enchanter to make them a Spider-themed Magical Item. I was initially going to give them Slippers of Spider Climbing but as the Druid gets Spider Climb as one of his Circle spells (Forest) I didn't want another party member to overshadow his niche. So instead I made up my own item based on the Giant Spider's Web attack: **Glove of Webbing** \- The white and light blue, almost translucent, colouration of the glove is uncomfortably familiar. The Glove has 3 Charges. While the glove is worn, as part of the Attack Action you can expend a charge, by making the correct hand gesture, and will shoot Webbing as a Ranged Weapon Attack targeted at one creature with +5 to hit at a reach of 30/60 feet. On a hit the target is Restrained by webbing and, as an Action, the Restrained target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage) The glove regains One charge per dawn. If the last charge is expended roll a D20, on a 1 it becomes permanently non-magical. &amp;#x200B; My question is on the balance of this item for the party's current power level, if any changes should be made (like it requiring attunement) and if anyone has any other spider-related items that I could use instead?"

Part 1: Worldbuilding: As I touched upon in my previous post, the world has been changed dramatically to both make room for new lands and magic, and made smaller to bring everything closer together. In short, Europe and Asia have been shrunken into one continent, with much of the area between the Mediterranean and the eastern quarter of China being deleted, and Indias western side merging with the eastern side of the Arabian Peninsula. Africa remains mostly the same, but on a smaller scale, only going south about half the current distance, while retaining the same width. The Americas have been shrunk as well, also being squished into a shorter north/south distance, as well as being rotated so that its southernmost part nearly meets Africas southernmost part in a 10 oclock and 2 oclock fashion. The islands between the bulk of Canada and greenland are gone as well, and the distance across the Pacific ocean is only  its current distance. Now for the different regions/powers. Eurasia: Easily the greatest power on this continent is Britain, which is also true for the whole world, discounting Atlantis. Contrary to actual history, in this world Britain has been isolationist for centuries, much like Japan was in the real world. Unlike Japan, Britain used this time to rapidly overtake the rest of the world in terms of technology, existing at the levels seen in the Atlantis movie. However, guns and submarines are very new and very expensive, as most of the technological advancements made were focused around making Britain function better within its borders rather than looking outward towards travel and military. Aside from Britain, France and China are the two other main powers, due to Chinas use of gunpowder in warfare and Frances mildly successful attempts at copying British advancements. Colonies: The old french colony of New Orleans was long abandoned by its mother country, and has since learned to thrive within its isolated world, with the aid of some British technology traded away for goods that can be acquired in the New World alone. Aside from New Orleans, the only colonies in the Americas are new British colonies created once the country finally turned its gaze outward. Untouched Lands: Aside from the few colonies in the Americas, the vast majority of the world, including Africa, Australia, India, and the Americas remains untouched aside from their native inhabitants. These lands are home to wilderness for the most part, with the rare trade posts set up by the Eurasian countries that are used to export goods found in those areas alone. Magic Kingdoms: Greenlands outer cliffs and seemingly inhospitable ice covered glaciers rapidly give way to an inner, isolated land divided amongst many different lords and rulers, and home to magical beings and beasts and vast forests. Avalon its much smaller neighbor, is equally isolated, though this is due to the warlords that rule its lands and the constant wars they have fought. The only city open to the outside world is Arendelle, but even it is mysterious and closed off at times. Villains: Ursula: Since the alternate ending to Ariels story leaves Ursula as ruler of the seas, with Triton her prisoner thanks to him taking Ariels place in the contract. Additionally, since this world has the Olympian Pantheon, Triton being the son of Poseidon could absolutely tie into the story, with a possibility of the newly reemerged Atlantis playing a roll in the whole dynamic (more on that later). Literally Anything from the Arthurian Tales: I mean, come on, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, Morgan le Fay, invading armies there is so much to draw from, so many potential plot points to challenge the players, hell even Mordred could be altered to be some other relation to Arthur (as opposed to his bastard son). As for the movie, Madam Mim is alive and kicking, and Merlin can be old enough to have any number of enemies to be dealt with. Maleficent: With the alternate ending, she is, apparently, dead. However, Maleficent does not strike me as the kind of villain to not have a backup plan. She most definitely will be a black dragon, either Ancient or Adult, and most likely changed as a result of her death. The Monster Manual has guides to creating a Dracolich or Shadow Dragon, of the two I am leaning towards Dracolich, with her phylactery being the sword Prince Philip used to slay her, remaining imbedded in her chest. Evil Stepmother/Stepsisters/Duke &amp; King: Cinderellas alternate ending leaves the possibility for her to return to her prince, and a more political intrigue arc with the semi-corrupt King and Duke (though that corruption is really just being against the prince marrying a commoner). As for the stepmother/sisters, A Twist in Time has an interesting take. I dont plan on using time travel, but if the Fairy Godmother loses her power, what happens to the Pact Cinderella gains her power from? Hans/Duke of Weselton: Arendelle being caught in an eternal winter, and ruled by two usurpers out for power and wealth. Plus, Ana could possibly be in suspended animation rather than truly dead, a modified form of petrification perhaps. Again, a political intrigue possibility, especially when Arendelle is on Avalon, King Arthurs island domain. Mother Gothel: I am a huge fan of Mother Gothel as a villain. She is less of an evil character than she is a selfish one, being perfectly content to live life so long as she remains young. Maybe she could become an Undying Warlock, or a revenant, out for revenge against Rapunzel and Flynn. Not an endgame villain, but an early-mid game threat. Hades: Probably the BBEG of the campaign. Since the Greek gods exist, alongside other possible gods/godesses/higher powers, it would make perfect sense to have the endgame plot revolve around them. And, since Hades is the god of death and the Underworld, any villains that have died (such as Maleficent or Mother Gothel) could have returned due to his interference and desire to kill Hercules and any potential allies. Even if Hercules or Ariel or anyone else related to the Olympians arent chosen, there are a number of ways to work Hades in as an endgame villain. Atlantis Return: The return of Atlantis is going to be a turning point for the world, for certain. In my version, Poseidon was responsible for the sinking of Atlantis, due to them turning away from Olympus in favor of the Heart of Atlantis. This opens up a lot of other ways to connect Atlantis to other stories, plus the actual repercussions of its return. Depending on which characters are chosen, and how interactions go, Britains monopoly over technological advancement clashing with the ancient power of Atlantis, plus the Lost Empire possibly returning despite the changed geography and political climates of where they once ruled, Atlantis could be either a threat or an ally to the players goals. Mordu/Clans: Meridas alternate ending leaves the rabid bear in her lands, and her father even more enraged against it and other bears. Additionally, the other Clans could still be angry due to her fleeing from the betrothal offers, and the witch could be worked into it some way. Regardless, there is family drama that needs to be cleared up, which could turn into other problems if not addressed soon enough. Vulnerability of the Chinese Empire: Though the Huns were defeated and for the vast majority killed, so too was the Chinese army (which had conscripted most of the able-bodied men of the country already). Any number of people could want to take advantage of this, such as the British wanting to remove the one other country that has managed to utilize gunpowder. Scar/Hyena Tribe: Though the Pridelands fell into drought and Scar and his cronies were nowhere to be found, they are still out there, with the Pride their hostages/prisoners. Definitely an earlier villain, but absolutely one that will be used if I can manage it. Governor Radcliffe/Colonists: With Pocahontas departure and John Smiths death, the tentative peace between the current colony and the tribe has nobody to keep it intact. With the arrival of new colonists, or the return of Radcliffe (as seen in the largely ignored Pocahontas 2), this conflict is one that will involve the party with the greater power of imperialist Britain. Clayton/Hunters: Tarzans alternate ending left the status of his gorilla family largely unknown, with the hunters/poachers Clayton hired roaming free to capture and kill animals. Friends on the Other Side: Though the Shadowman is gone, there are others in New Orleans and the surrounding area that practice voodoo. The Friends want the souls of the citys population, and there could be any number of reasons for this, and any number of people to deal with who seek to aid the Friends in gaining those souls. Other Disney Villains: I havent decided or even thought about many of these yet, but here are a few I have considered: Jafar the Genie, who will act like any Djinn in D&amp;D, and the Horned King from the black Cauldron, who will be a lich residing in Avalon. Otherwise, suggestions are more than welcome!

73,vulnerability,dndnext,How The Hell Are Shadows Only CR 1/2?!,1418,c18uyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/c18uyv/how_the_hell_are_shadows_only_cr_12/,2019-06-16 21:18:27,"Having a look at Shadows, nothing seems too odd until you see their only form of damage: Strength Drain. Drops a target's Strength score by 1d4, killing it if the score reaches 0. Meaning that, hypothetically, it would take a mere 7 Shadows to kill the bloody Tarrasque! A CR 3.5 encounter can wipe out one of D&amp;D's most powerful non-god monsters ever. And the Strength reduction lasts until the target finishes a rest, allowing them to slowly but surely whittle away at anything unlucky enough to draw their wrath. And when (not if; *when*) a creature dies to this attack, they spawn another goddamn Shadow, turning a small village with a single Shadow into a hellscape made of all your nightmares and fears combined. And *then* you realise that you haven't even started yet. It has a whopping **six** damage resistances (assuming 'nonmagical bludgeoning, slashing and piercing' is a single damage type) and immunity to **two** damage types. Ridiculous. But wait! There's more! Shadows are immune to no less than **eight** conditions. You can't grapple them. You can't restrain them. You can't frighten them. There are only a few saving graces with these f*ckers. Their low AC and health means they're less ""boss fight"" and more ""glass cannon"". Their sunlight weakness and radiant vulnerability makes them a slightly less challenging fight for most divine-type characters. In short: DMs, don't treat Shadows like just another CR 1/2 creature, because these little monsters will kill your party faster than a Paladin in a party of Rogues. They will reach out of the game and strangle you with the combined might of all the players they've killed, assuming your party doesn't strangle you first."

75,vulnerability,dndnext,Interesting Ways to Diversify Trolls,5,caikn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/caikn6/interesting_ways_to_diversify_trolls/,2019-07-08 18:52:07,"I've always had something of a soft spot for trolls in fantasy literature. From the nocturnal trolls of Tolkien to the regenerative bastards that most every D&amp;D player has encountered at some point in time! As I work on the fauna of my world, I've decided to create variations of trolls. These subspecies have adapted (or were originally born in) various environments, and have adapted traits to reflect the evolution they've had to develop in order to thrive. As a side note, I think I'm going to write a series of Bestiary entries for most of the setting-specific fauna in my world, all written by some researcher to educate people, like a setting-appropriate Volo. Fun for me to write, and fun for players who want to go and do research! Without further ado, I present some of the various troll species of Xandria! &amp;#x200B; **Stone Trolls.** Contrary to the classic green-skinned, messy haired troll, the entirety of a stone troll's hairless body is covered in small growths, giving it a stone-like texture. This increases their natural protection, and gives them some amount of natural camouflage (for as long as a troll can stand to wait before attacking!) in their native, rocky terrain. Perhaps more importantly, these growths offer stunning protection against fire, forcing many would-be hunters to retreat upon discovering their regeneration continues to mend burned flesh. Curiously, while durable against most forms of attack, these growths show signs of becoming brittle when exposed to intense sonic vibrations, which seems to delay their regenerative process by forcing it to focus in equal parts on flesh and ""armor"". Similar to the Stone Giants, from which some scholars believe the stone troll to be descended from, many specimens have taken up a habit of attacking from a distance with great rocks. While often blunt, some clever stone trolls collect stalagmites and stalactites to carry, for the purpose of spearing enemies with brutal force. &amp;#x200B; **Sea Troll (The Saltwater Scrag).** A well-known threat to sailors, the sea troll, or scrag, as it is more commonly known, possess webbed fingers and toes, allowing them to maneuver beneath the waves. A saltwater scrag is clearly designed to be an oceanic predator, as its (relative to a troll) shorter, stubbier legs complicate overland movement. Meanwhile, the larger distance between the creature's fingers and toes allow it to swim at truly stunning speeds. Complimentary to its aquatic nature, the scrag can breathe underwater just as well as it can on land. Interestingly enough, while no less potent than that of a normal troll, the regenerative power of a scrag seems to be limited to the creature's proximity to salt water. In the wild, scrags rarely chase prey onto land for very long, as they lose the advantages provided by their swimming speed and regenerative powers. Note: specimens of scrag flesh, when collected and placed in salt water, seem capable of growing new scrags - approximately 10 pounds of scrag flesh seems sufficient. It is unknown if each scrag created in this way is a clone of the original, or an entirely new creature. Approximately 10 percent of scrags created in this way seem to show signs of possessing vague memories of the original specimen - must examine further. Scrags prefer to dwell in underwater caves, preferably ones that are near ship-routes, or places where a great deal of fish pass through. &amp;#x200B; **River/Swamp Troll (The Freshwater Scrag).** Much like the aforementioned Sea Troll, the River Troll is an aquatic creature that lurks in freshwater rivers, swamps, and lakes. River Trolls are crocodilian in appearance, possessing an extended jaw and lengthened arms for hunting. The creature's head, back, and tail are covered in a green, moss-like fur, aiding in camouflage. Ambush predators by nature, a river inhabited by a river troll is heavily landscaped - riverbeds deepened, widened to accommodate the creature's entire body. The river troll lies in wait beneath the surface, exposing only the top of its head and its hump-like back above the water (commonly mistaken for moss-covered rocks). Unlike the sea scrag, the river troll cannot breathe underwater, but possesses lungs large enough to allow it approximately three hours of time beneath the surface before needing to return to the surface. Additionally, the river troll trades some of the swimming speed possessed by its oceanic kin in exchange for better land-to-water transitioning. While somewhat clumsy on land, the river troll can move at startlingly fast speeds by placing some of its weight on its knuckles The regenerative properties of the river troll seem functional while on land, but at a decreased rate. While partially submerged in fresh water, however, the river trolls regenerative potency skyrockets. An interesting evolution of the river troll are its arms and jaws, which seem perfected for its style of hunting. A river trolls jaws lock into place upon striking, forcing an unfortunate victim to struggle free should they find themselves on the receiving end of a river troll ambush. The creature's arms are lengthy, allowing it to reach nearly ten feet out of the water to grab prey. The river troll is responsible for the common depiction of the troll under the bridge, as bridges spanning freshwater rivers provide ample cover from which to reach up and grab passing travelers. Besides the undersides of bridges, river trolls prefer to dwell in muddy tunnels, dug into the side of riverbeds. These entrances are often plentiful, allowing a river troll access to as wide a range as possible, and are often covered with mud, sticks, or a makeshift trap door to hide their presence. A note on identifying river troll activity: River Trolls smell like filthy, wet dogs, and an area in which one or more river trolls dwells in is sure to reek. &amp;#x200B; **Mountain Troll.** Among the largest of all trolls, the mountain troll is covered in thick fur, providing it protection from the bitter colds of the high mountain altitudes in which they dwell. Solitary and easily irritated, the mountain troll seems to be the only species of troll incapable of speech. Whether this be a result of their lack of education or their desire to be left alone is not yet known. Unfortunately, one can hardly ask a mute troll whether its silence is a choice, that is, assuming one is even permitted to get close enough to be heard over the howling mountain winds. Feasting on large goats and other animals that live in the mountains, the mountain troll rarely if ever leaves their den - most often a shallow cave set into the face of a peak, just large enough to escape the most grueling of weather. Mountain trolls, despite their fearsome appearance, prefer to leave others alone, and to be left alone, in turn. Many are omnivorous, and cultivate cold-weather items such as berries or root-vegetables in private so as to avoid having to travel far from their dens. Unfortunately, my knowledge of mountain troll dens is very limited, as I have yet to encounter a specimen that was willing to welcome me into its home. Since I have yet to encounter an openly hostile mountain troll, not including their displays of power (intended, I suspect, to encourage intruders to choose another route rather than trespass) I did not feel it necessary to pry or force entry. &amp;#x200B; **Cave Troll.** Having developed to live in subterranean environments, such as the underdark, the cave troll is unique among trollkin, as it is entirely blind, relying on its incredible sense of hearing and smell to navigate its underground hunting grounds. The den of a cave troll is dark, pitch-black, and often far enough underground that sunlight is hours away. This is because the cave troll is incapable of functioning in direct sunlight. Much like a vampire, a cave troll will burn while the rays of the sun touch its skin. Though they do not burst into flames, a cave trolls' regenerative powers are negated in natural daylight, and, should a cave troll perish in such conditions, their bodies turn entirely to stone. Some nights, it may be possible to locate cave trolls above ground, although they rarely do so unless they are forced. Though it does not possess the vulnerability to acid and fire that other trolls do, the cave troll aggressively removes things that produce them from its presence, as they can cause harm to a cave troll's lair. The only time I encountered a (relatively) friendly cave troll, he revealed that a cave trolls ears are very sensitive, and send waves of sound to create a ""mental map"" of their surroundings, similar to the echolocation of bats. Cave trolls meticulously cultivate these ""mental maps"", carving the cave walls as they see fit and altering the floors to suit their desires. They become extremely aggressive should their their homes be altered. This has led to my belief that cave trolls possess some form of OCD, as any slight alteration to their lair will result in a remodeling of the entire cave, or even the relocation of the troll. One might suggest this as an excellent strategy for distracting a cave troll - this is not the case. First and foremost, a cave troll will seek to destroy the source of its frustrations before attempting any reparations to its home. Having developed adaptations to aid in hunting in pitch-black environments, the cave troll has developed an eidetic memory, as well as a form of blindsight - capable of expertly navigating its home tunnels with absolute precision. The claws of the cave troll are also developed to dig into solid stone, or to latch onto hanging shelves of rock, allowing it to maneuver along the walls and ceilings of its cavernous dwellings. &amp;#x200B; There are lots of different types, and, for entertainment purposes, I avoided the specifics of the mechanical abilities that they have, but I suspect most people can gather some of the additions I made! That said, if you enjoyed, and want to know what exactly I did, feel free to ask! I'm also happy to hear YOUR ideas for new troll subspecies ideas! The cave troll was my nod at the Tolkien (and some other) trolls, which turn to stone if they're exposed to natural daylight. Obviously in D&amp;D, trolls do not do this, but I enjoy the idea, so I just had to include it somewhere! I figured, hey, if any troll should turn to stone in the light, it should be the nocturnal/underground variant! Thanks for reading!"

Being a vampire is a disease. I have a rough sketch of what I want. Vampirism would come in stages and at certain levels when you finish a long rest you process to the next stage unless you find a cure. Each stage requires you to reach the milestone levels (5, 11, and 17) At stage one or the pre vampirism it has been about a few minutes since infection. You gain sunlight sensitivity. Nothing exciting yet but hold on. As of now vampirism can be cured with basic healing such as a potion. At stage 2 or vampire fledgling you are an official vampire. You gain darkvison of 120ft and a bite attack. Im thinking 1d6 + str or dex, and a once per short rest thing that lets you absorb hp by drinking blood, and a normal blood drink that only counts as a ration of food. For weakness I have an idea. Not vulnerability to radiant and fire damage, but whenever you take radiant damage or radiant damage you take an additional 1d4 damage and this die increases either in size or amount at later stages. Stage 3 you would get vampire magic stuff. Some once per short rest spells, need to once over the spells and find which ones are a good fit. Fire and radiant damage thing I mentioned goes up as well. Stage 4 is where Im stuck on what to add. I need a stage for 11th level to 17th level. Maybe just more magic? Have stage 4 be themed around combat spells and stage 3 non combat spells. Probably damage resistances too Stage 5 is the almost final evolution, the near grand finale. A master vampire. Im not sure what I would add but probably shapeshifting into mist, a bat, wolf (yes wolf, go read the original Dracula). Maybe add in something else idk And then two off pathways. The ancient vampire and the feral vampire. Feral vampires have been blood starved for so long they went insane. Ancient vampires are the next step after master vampire and are more like a grand boon that you get after level 20. To become ancient you need be... ancient. An ancient vampire is just someone who spent a long time as a vampire. You just gain all the vampire effects from the vampire stat block or something ridiculously powerful because this is not something i intend a player to use until the very very end. Its a rough sketch like I said but I think I have something. What do you guys think? If this works out I may end up doing werewolves in the same fashion, possibly more as well"

This works well when someone heals you, or you heal yourself with either potions or spells (if you have those), but one thing I noticed is that you can also regain much more HP during rests. Ghostly Gaze (XGtE p56) sounds very cool, and quite unique to have. Tomb of Levistus (XGtE p57) is incredibly useful not only in combat, but if you accidentally set off a trap. Even if the damage that set it off is fire damage, you have Vulnerability to it **after** the initial damage. Aspect of the Moon (XGtE p56) allows you to keep watch, or even have time to yourself to do what you want.

Conceptually I am thinking of a Gnome tinkerer with an army of toys, or a wizard like Mickey from Fantasia, or perhaps a pied piper kind of character. Does anyone have suggestions about how to up the power of these scrappy little constructs through character choices? As I see it the weaknesses of the spell are the vulnerability of tiny servants to area-of-effect damage, and the fact that the tiny servants do non-magical damage. Here are two builds, each of which can address only one of those problems: 1. Lore Bard 6+. Choose tiny servant and crusader's mantle as your level 6 magical secrets. With a lot of servants, the 1d4 radiant damage added to each of their attacks is none too shabby. Plus it gives you some magical damage. 2. Enchanter: With Hypnotic Gaze, you can lockdown the enemy you are most worried about throwing down area of effect spells to incinerate your poor tiny servants. Admittedly however, enemies that throw out spells usually have pretty good wisdom saves. Can you think of a better way to approach this? **TLDR;** What can I do to make tiny servant even better?"
84,vulnerability,dndnext,Opinions on cleric for potential homebrew alterations?,0,b25p7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b25p7q/opinions_on_cleric_for_potential_homebrew/,2019-03-18 01:30:05,"So, I'm only one person with one opinion and I don't know what the general consensus is on the cleric class, so before I go changing it around for my own home campaign I'd love to hear people's opinions on it. So, having played in a campaign with another cleric from about 9 all the way to 20 his most common complaint was that the cleric spell list was an absolute trashfire, and I kinda have to agree. Clerics really lack a lot of cool stuff they used to get in previous editions like Wind Walk, Destruction, Slay Living, Darkness, Divine Power, Righteous Might, Spell Immunity, Animate Objects, Energy Drain, Implosion and more. His other sticking point was destroy undead, which may as well not have even existed because he used it successfully literally once in the entire campaign despite fighting undead quite a lot, usually the CR was just too high to even bother using it. I definitely also have some flavor hangups with some of the domains, like the fact that potent spellcasting seems to have just been thrown at a bunch of domains because they couldn't figure out an on theme ability for level 8, and the fact that the knowledge domain's channel divinity only grants you skills and not your allies, seems kinda terrible. So what do people think about the cleric? I mean every class has a few really bomb spells but I feel like the cleric basically subsists only on the very very few really powerful spells in their repertoire with little variance, how do other people feel about the cleric and the way it plays? Also, I was planning on going oldschool with undead, making it so healing damaged them and that necrotic healed them, and giving them vulnerability to radiance, how do you think that would affect the cleric?"

86,vulnerability,dndnext,[5e Homebrew] Critique and Suggestions on Homebrew Race - Sha'Rax-Ti,1,b5v1p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/b5v1p8/5e_homebrew_critique_and_suggestions_on_homebrew/,2019-03-27 07:47:04,"I'd like to get some input on any improvements I could make on a homebrew race I'm building for my world. They're called the Sha'Rax-Ti, a race of insect-like creatures that form a consciousness once enough have gathered. Due to the ease in which the swarm can get separated, they infest the bodies of other deceased humanoids as to keep their form together. (Lore is still being developed, but that's the jist.) It's mainly the traits I'd like help balancing. I've tried to use Detect Balance's ratings as a guideline, which you'll see the value next to each ability on what I believe it was rated. Overall, the race comes out to a 24, when 26.5 is considered 'average'. Key Words \&gt; Xkrith - Single drone within the collective \&gt; Host - The body the Sha'Rax-Ti is infesting &amp;#x200B; **Ability Score Increase (12).** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Intelligence score increases by 1. **Age.** Individual Xkrith live around three months, though through replacing lost of drones, you are effectively immortal. **Alignment.** A complex relationship with mortality and physical existence leads most Sha'rax Ti to be Chaotic, often tending towards evil alignments. **Size.** Though your swarm's total number varies considerably from day to day, you require enough drones to fill a Medium Humanoid to maintain consciousness. **Speed (-2).** The restriction of inhabiting a body reduces the speed it would normally be capable of. Your base walking speed is 25 feet. **Aberrant Nature (0).** You have two creature types: aberration and humanoid. You can be affected by any game effects that target either of these types. **Buzzing Swarm (0).** You can perform verbal components for spells through the chittering, writhing and quivering sounds of your bodies. **Cyclic Rest (4).** You rotate the time when your drones are resting, keeping many awake at all times. You do not need to sleep and can complete a long rest by performing 6 hours of light activity. **Infested Host (6).** You survive by infesting the corpse of a medium humanoid. This corpse is considered your *Host*. While the swarm can replace the drones lost from injury or time, it cannot repair the corpse it inhabits. When you are reduced to 0 hit points, your *Host* will become damaged. While your *Host* is undamaged, you are indistinguishable from an ordinary member of your *Host's* race, though your actions may give you away. While your *Host* is damaged, other creatures are more easily able to recognise you as Sha'Rax-Ti. If you have access to a medium humanoid corpse, you can choose to infest it over the course of a Short Rest and make it your new *Host*. You must complete a long rest before you can infest another corpse. **Mental Touch (6).**The collective mental prowess of your swarm allows you to reach out to the minds of others. You can speak telepathically to any creature within 30 feet of you that you can see. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language. You can speak telepathically in this way to one creature at a time. **Psychically Unstable (-8).** The psychic connection that holds your swarm together is a fragile thing. You have vulnerability to psychic damage. **Purge the Infected. (6)** By removing weakened drones from the swarm, you can prevent the spread of dangerous substances. You have resistance to poison damage, and advantage on saving throws against poison and disease. **Languages (0).** You are not capable of speech yourself, but you can understand, read and write Common and one other language of your choice."

He uses his sense of smell as way to compensate, which I assume is pretty good compared to most other races and with the ranger's added feral sense. I really like the idea of a handicapped character and want to give some vulnerability to a hairy giant with reach and strength. &amp;#x200B; But I don't really how to implement that into my stats.

91,vulnerability,dndnext,Items that upgrade under certain circumstances,1,ai7bbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/ai7bbm/items_that_upgrade_under_certain_circumstances/,2019-01-21 17:22:43,"So for my next campaign (which I have already started planning, ah the life of a dm lol) I came up with a brilliant idea to work Tiamat in as kind of a bonus/secret boss. However I am not quite sure how to implement it. So the idea is the party obtains 6 Ioun Stones over time (I love Ioun Stones and feel they are underappreciated) 5 of them are associated with the 5 Chromatic Dragon Flights and the 6th either has a portion of Tiamat's Essence in it or is bound to some like mutant dragon flight she created. The idea being the stones were created with the souls of great wyrms. These beings know how to free Tiamat but can't from the state they are in. Partly from being stones and partly that it's just been literal ages since they were activated and used. So now that the lore part of the idea is out of the way I basically want these to upgrade over time to make the players want to continue to use them as the campaign progresses. Because I don't want it too easy that they accidently summon Tiamat and get obliterated before they know what happened, but I don't want it so hard that they will never accomplish it. To better help in unlock requiement thinking the progression in terms of bonuses I was thinking 5 tiers, the base tier when they find it and 4 upgrades upon doing certain things. When they first find it that the stone gives resistance to specific dragons damage type. At some point maybe around tier 3, that would become immunity but give them vulnerability to a different damage type. And maybe a +2 to an ability at the final tier. Not sure what to do for the Tiamat/Mutant Flight stone, so suggestions for that would be cool too."

The players could choose any of the 7 choices as listed below for their color. While building this campaign it quickly became on of my hardest challenges yet. The players were so overpowered I would have to design monsters that could eat a stack of dragons like pancakes. The players could not be fooled by any conventional means, given how they can see anything coming at them, cast every spell in the game multiple times a day, and move to entirely different planes at a moments notice. Keeping the players engaged with the story and keeping their power levels in check was an insanely fun experience and I just thought I would share my crazy rules that I home brewed. 3rd level 8th level 13th level 17th level Blue - Blue is seeks knowledge, perfection, experience education, and emboldens the bettering of the self Magical Superiority- As a reaction you gain advantage on spell saving throws until the start of your next turn.

I wanted AoE and damage over time effects, I wanted to know actual chances that enemies would succeed against a given spell save type, I wanted crits accounted for, and miss chance based on average enemy ACs. So, over the past few weeks Ive spent far too long entering data, analyzing intermediate results, and picking over absurdly long equations. Now, I think Im finally to the point where I can make some conclusions and share my work with the community. --- So, whats first? How about an exercise in the absurd, fun, and completely useless: **Which single spell is capable of causing the most damage, using only one spell slot?** That means we assume enemies are packed into the area of effect for the full spell duration and you roll full damage with all crits and failed saves. (Though we'll ignore vulnerability as &lt;5% of monsters are vulnerable to anything) You might first think of 9th level *[Meteor Swarm](URL but thats instantaneous so its out of the running. So what about 9th level *[Prismatic Wall](URL then, with waves of enemies forcing themselves through all the layers round after round? Nope. Its actually the humble 6th level *[Forbiddance](URL With a border length of 800 ft (40000 sq ft, or a 200x200 square) that means endless waves of undead, 160 per round, totaling in the millions (literally, something like 2.3 million skeletons) can heedlessly rush every foot of your perimeter for the full 24 hour duration and produce a total of 115.2 *million* damage. All from the single cast of a 6th level spell. And it blows away the 2nd place contender [*Maddening Darkness* (XGtE)](URL with its measly 0.92 million total damage. Also note that if you did want to account for vulnerabilities, *Forbiddance* would still win, just by a larger margin. Its capable of radiant damage to which [Shadows](URL are vulnerable, so that damage would be doubled. --- Next, grounding our feet a bit more in realism let's consider spell slot efficiency. For a given spell slot, which spell is expected to do the most damage? Heres the top 3 list: **Overall Expected Damage per Spell** Spell Level|Gold||Silver||Bronze|| -|-|-|-|-|-|- 1st|Burning Hands|14|Arms of Hadar|12|Inflict Wounds|11 2nd|Dragon's Breath|82|Moonbeam|64|Tidal Wave|54 3rd|Spirit Guardians|123|Call Lightning|113|Dragon's Breath|109 4th|Spirit Guardians|163|Call Lightning|151|Dragon's Breath|137 5th|Dawn|342|Conjure Volley|284|Animate Objects|221 6th|Dawn|342|Otiluke's Freezing Sphere|298|Forbiddance|286 7th|Reverse Gravity|467|Symbol|414|Dawn|342 8th|Illusory Dragon|831|Maddening Darkness|770|Reverse Gravity|467 9th|Meteor Swarm|1590|Illusory Dragon|831|Maddening Darkness|770 This is an rounded average expected damage when cast against a random enemy with no class modifiers. It accounts for: - Potential save chance - Calculated for each damage type from average monster stats - Resistances, immunities, vulnerabilities - Attack miss/crit chance - Expected number of enemies in AoE area - Expected combat duration - Assumed 5 round hard limit - Can be lower based on continuous saves or enemies being smart and walking out of an area - Upcast damage/target/duration scaling where applicable You may not be surprised to notice that most, well actually all, of those spells are AoE, and most last for a few rounds. Not really shocking when youre looking at spell damage efficiency though, right? --- What about if youre in a fuck this one thing in particular kinda mood, but but youre short on slots? Heres that list: **Expected Single Target Damage per Spell** Spell Level|Gold||Silver||Bronze|| -|-|-|-|-|-|- 1st|Inflict Wounds|11|Magic Missile|10|Chromatic Orb|10 2nd|Dragon's Breath|55|Moonbeam|43|Heat Metal|40 3rd|Call Lightning|76|Spirit Guardians|61|Dragon's Breath|58 4th|Call Lightning|81|Spirit Guardians|65|Dragon's Breath|62 5th|Animate Objects|221|Dawn|103|Call Lightning|86 6th|Animate Objects|230|Sunbeam|105|Dawn|103 7th|Animate Objects|239|Melfs Minute Meteors|112|Sunbeam|105 8th|Animate Objects|248|Illusory Dragon|138|Melfs Minute Meteors|131 9th|Animate Objects|257|Crown of Stars|164|Melfs Minute Meteors|150 The real standout here is obviously *[Animate Objects](URL When cast on 10 (or more when upcast) objects of tiny size, they have the ability to absolutely rock the socks off a single target over a number of rounds. Honorable mentions are [*Crown of Stars* (XGtE)](URL and [*Melfs Minute Meteors* (EE &amp; XGtE)](URL which both upcast very well. But most of those spells have one thing in common, they take a few rounds to do their full damage. --- What if that one thing needs to get dead, and it needs to get dead *now*? **Expected Single Target, Single Round Damage per Spell** Spell Level|Gold||Silver||Bronze|| -|-|-|-|-|-|- 1st|Inflict Wounds|11|Magic Missile|10|Chromatic Orb|10 2nd|Tidal Wave|18|Inflict Wounds|15|Hellish Rebuke|15 3rd|Lightning Bolt|26|Lightning Arrow|26|Fireball|25 4th|Lightning Arrow|34|Vitriolic Sphere|32|Lightning Bolt|29 5th|Animate Objects|44|Lightning Arrow|43|Vitriolic Sphere|37 6th|Mental Prison|66|Animate Objects|53|Disintegrate|50 7th|Mental Prison|66|Animate Objects|62|Disintegrate|57 8th|Animate Objects|71|Mental Prison|66|Disintegrate|64 9th|Meteor Swarm|132|Power Word Kill|100|Animate Objects|80 Again, we have *Animate Objects* as a strong contender amongst the more obvious *[Disintegrate](URL and maybe less-obvious *Meteor Swarm* (hey, 40d6 is 40d6, even if its just 1 target). *[Mental Prison(XGtE)](URL also has a strong showing, assuming that the target is moved out of or tries to break free from the prison on the same round it was cast. In general though, I suppose the lesson here is to never underestimate a swarm of very angry little things. --- And finally, what if you have a lot of things you need dead quick?

The players notice stuff has been disappearing, and that they apparently started as 5, not 4 adventurers before coming here. After running the typical False Hydra investigation part of the game, I am planning on them fighting the hydra under the village. I saw some stat blocks for it but they didn't fit with the type of boss fight I had in mind. So I created one myself, but as this is the first time I've created a monster, I would greatly appreciate someone telling me if it's too weak (or, most probably, too strong). For context, I warned my players that the last fight would be very hard, and that they should maximize their characters. This is for a one-shot, and so they have all the choices in the world to make this work. They will be level 10, and are 4 players. TL;DR: here's the planned stat block. It's probably overpowered, but you can see what I'm going for theme-wise. Thanks for any feedback :D The hydra lives under the village, in a field of germinating heads taken from its victims. It lies here, feeding on flesh and memories.

99,vulnerability,dndnext,Of Shadows and Sacrifice [Potential CoS Spoilers],1,a3hbkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/a3hbkz/of_shadows_and_sacrifice_potential_cos_spoilers/,2018-12-06 09:21:00,"Our game last night was probably one of the most intense I've ever played. For some background, we've been playing a heavily modified version of Curse of Strahd. For context, we have a six person party: Maris, a pirate captain[gunslinger](URL Desmond, a nobleman vengeance paladin with a penchant for killing lawbreakers, David, a disgraced nobleman tempest cleric that may have made a pact with the Dark Powers, Borovik, an alpha werewolf bear totem barbarian mercenary, Fish, a chef with strange powers and an even stranger past, and Bearhugger, a goliath mystic exiled from his clan because ""his use of Psionics made him weak."" It's been an emotional 18 months as we've travelled through Barovia. We've had characters die and come back not quite the same (shout out to David and his lack of a mouth since he came back). We've made friends with many NPCs and watched them die or be abducted out from under our noses. We've fought rampaging divine beasts sent by spurned gods, and rescued children from cannibal witches. We explored an ever-shifting labyrinth and slayed the dragon experimenting on the Vistani in the center. We've befriended (and united) the wereravens, the Vistani, and Vallaki. We raided Castle Ravenloft, recovering the sun sword and the mad mage's staff, and we'll likely have to go back to rescue Ireena (if Strahd hasn't drained her already). We met our companion, Viktor, who has been revealed to be a descendant of the Morning Lord. Bearhugger overcame his insecurities and accepted his strength and power, Desmond was revealed to be a reincarnation of Sergei, Borovik became the Alpha of the werewolf pack, David has become the chief Cleric of the Night Sister (changed from the Night Mother, I believe), and Fish and Maris are still in the middle of their final character arcs. To top it all off, we've come face to face with the power behind the vampire several times now, the most recent of which was last night. To get to our story, the Death House had made a resurgence, and, as we were busy working on problems in Krezk, Van Richten went to investigate it on his own. Several days passed with no word from the elf, so we decided to go in after him. As we're all level 8 at this point, the Death house has been cranked up to eleven. We learned a lot more about the family that lived there once, and we have learned that the house is a projection of the Dark Powers (like I said, heavily modified version of Curse of Strahd), as it soon transformed into a haunted hospital. The night's session started off normal enough. We fought a ghost and some sentient puddles of vomit, and some sort of ooze. We fell for some traps. Standard dungeon stuff. After an encounter with eyeless, jawless nurses, we encountered a corridor filled with dark, shadowy smoke, which was familiar to us at this point. It seemed there was no way forward except through the smoke. While debating whether we should turn back and try to find another way forward, Maris, ever the impatient one, stepped into the smoke. Bearhugger, the loyal first mate, and Fish the loyal cook to the pirate captain, followed him in. David failed to push Borovik in, and got carried by the werewolf into the black mist. That left Desmond, who alone knew what could happen from stepping into this fog, having been warned by the sun sword, alone in front of the mist. Rather than leave his friends to destruction, he ventured onward. This led us to our most recent encounter with the Dark Powers. They have been manifesting themselves as a female lich to us, so I'll be referring to them as a she. When our party entered the black mist, we had to make a saving throw. Maris, Borovik, and Fish failed their saves, and the rest of us succeeded. This is when it got emotional. The Dark Powers began to speak to us, telling us that the others were lost to her, unless we were willing to make a deal with her. If one of us would offer ourselves to the Dark Powers to take Strahd's place as ruler of Barovia, and consequently set her free, she would return our friends. Bearhugger immediately offered himself, as his honor, and his close friendship with the captain, Fish, and friendly rivalry with Borovik demanded. The Dark Powers proceeded to hit him in every weak point he had. He had everything to lose and nothing to gain from this deal. Bearhugger had not doubted his honor before this point, so this shook him. Then David offered himself, as he truly had nothing to lose, and nothing to return to. Desmond objected to this; he would never willingly free her. Viktor also offered himself as a sacrifice, as we all had people and homes to return to, and he, in his teenage idealism thought that he could be better than Strahd. We all shut him down on that, he had his whole life ahead of him. After tense, emotional...debates about who should be the one to sacrifice himself, we conceded that David made the most sense. The smoke cleared and we were back in the corridor, with our friends returned to us. However, they didn't return exactly as they had left. They came back with some severe changes. Maris is now ethereal; not quite dead, but not really alive either. He now has an impatience flaw that imposes difficulties on stealth, investigation, and concentration checks. Fish came back physically unchanged, but is now cursed with, get this, incompetence. Even simple tasks are difficult for him: he now has disadvantage on *every* ability check, but with a twist. His incompetence may just lead to unpredictable bonuses. Finally, Borovik, poor Borovik, has been permanently touched by death. His skin (fur when he's in wolf form) is now bone white, and he has a permanent failed death saving throw, and vulnerability to necrotic damage. In short, emotions ran high, friends were destroyed, and came back to us changed, and we may have sacrificed one of our closest friends, and potentially doomed Barovia forever, to get the rest back. Thanks for reading, it's been on my mind all day, and I just had to share."

I like Vulnerabilities because they reward players that try various types of attacks and learning through combat instead of just wailing on creatures with whatever does the most dice damage. Would it be reasonable to add a sensible vulnerability to creatures, while possibly also upping their maximum HP just so that they don't shatter instantly when it's discovered, but still die more quickly than just using a standard option?"

I was just wondering if y'all had any fun ideas for simic hybrid enhancements. Here is one idea I had: **1st Level:** **Spider Climb :** You can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. You also ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing. Your climbing speed is always 30. **Pounce:** If you moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hit it with a melee attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier or be knocked prone. **5th Level:** **Web :** You grow a bulbous sac that contains webs. You can make a ranged weapon attack with range 30/60 ft, on hit, your target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a Strength saving throw against a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier, bursting the web on success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). **Pack Tactics :** Your Charisma and Intelligence decrease by 2. You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isnt incapacitated. --- "

If you skip the wall of text the next 2 chunks are flavor haha. So background, he's going to be a half elf from the fey wild (Eladrin half for flavor). Raised in the fey wild by his mother full eladrin, but father was just a human adventurer that happened across the elf settlement and stayed for a bit before setting off. Anyway no tragic or edgy backstory, accepted and treated well by the community. However they were still a bit uncomfortable bc half elves sleep which is weird to full elves, but primarily (I read Mordenkainen's and want to use some of this knowledge haha) because half elves muddies the whole elf soul reincarnation cycle. Anyway one day he had a dream about Sehanine telling him he needs to set out and do great things. So he sets out to adventure. So with that out of the way I plan on taking first level as a cleric, paladin, or hexblade. Then like 18 bard, saying that I was touched by her unlocking my arcane abilities to make a difference. I see cleric and paladin as easy to make sense of as being given a charge by a god, a hexblade would require some liberties with flavor, but I can make any of them work. I'm leaning towards a cleric of the grave (on of Sehanine's domains) and would leave me a full caster. For 1 level I get spare the dying for free as a bonus action and with a 30 ft range, plus when people are unconscious I do max healing, and medium armor. And if I do a second level a good channel divinity for big nasty monsters giving it vulnerability to all my allies damage. If I go cleric I plan stats to start as (including racial) : 10 14 14 9 14 16. I considered paladin but don't want to put enough into strength to be able to multiclass. If I go hexblade still get medium armor, charisma for weapons which is nice but plan on being a backline support type, the curse which isn't great for my plan. At level 2 I get invocations, but I fall 2 levels behind full caster in slots. If I go warlock I plan stats to start as (including racial) : 10 14 16 8 12 16 So I feel like I get more from cleric and more support type stuff. But invocations are nice and only needing to focus on char va char and wisdom. Is there another good option I'm not thinking of?"

Lycanthrope infectees have vulnerability to damage from silvered or magical weapons. Vampire infectees gain Sunlight Sensitivity (not hypersensitivity) and vulerability to radiant damage, and are restricted by the vampire's forbidance feature. They also have disadvantage against the charm saves of the vampire that infected them. On the upside though, they age at 1/10th the normal rate for their race, and magical aging is only 1/10th as effective. &amp;#x200B; If a character reaches a level that they would normally pick an ASI or Feat at while infected, they must instead take a feat that enables them to become a full lycanthrope or vampire. This works just like the rules for PC lycanthropes or vampires presented in the books, but with the exception that instead of a forced alignment shift the PC must take on a new Ideal befitting their new race and outlook on life. If their old ideals and this new idea come into conflict, this one takes precedent. Once they take this feat, the lesser form of their curse disappears. &amp;#x200B; There's a few goals in mind behind the creation of this ruleset. The first is to change these infections from a sudden thing to something that gives PCs some window to try to fix it. The other is to switch things up so that, while it may make a PC much more powerful than they would be otherwise, there's sat least something being given up in the form of a lost ASI/Feat and having to deal with an actual detriment for a while before the extra abilities come online. Finally, there's the hope that it would allow for some behavioral shift without immediatel plunging into forced alignment shifts and NPC-hood."

108,vulnerability,dndnext,Why you should use a calendar and an example.,39,8z5wvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/8z5wvk/why_you_should_use_a_calendar_and_an_example/,2018-07-16 09:12:46,"This post contains spoilers for the Silveroak Valley campaign. Don't read if that's you. Running sandbox style games for years one thing I noticed is that players really appreciate and enjoy a world that feels like it's alive. That things are happening around them and that the world doesn't just pause when they aren't paying attention to it. That can be a real struggle though because it can be hard for DMs and Players to really get a sense for how long things are taking. If your party is deep in a dungeon you may have 3-4 sessions that take place over two days in the campaign setting. Alternatively your players may travel somewhere and a week is hand waved away in a matter of seconds. The variable amount of attention paid to each second, minute, hour, day, or week doesn't give players an anchor in the world to understand how time is passing. Without that anchor it's hard to get a sense that the world is really progressing in a meaningful way. A huge turning point for me was when I started providing my players a calendar and asking them to keep track of time. This gives the players an easy way to take notes and track their progress through the world and it also let's them start anticipating events and budgeting their time. For example: Rather than saying, ""Your contact will meet you in 3 days in the Villagetown. It will take you 2 days of travel to get there."" you can now tell your party, ""Your contact will meet them at the midweek market in Villagetown"". The party can look at their map and their calendar to figure out when that is and if they need to leave immediately or if they have time to investigate the rumor of giant toads infesting the nearby swamp. It might seem like a minor thing but the more decisions your players make the more they will feel like they are invested in the world and the game. I also make it very clear that I pre-populate my version of the calendar with what is happening in the world assuming they don't change things. So if it's a game about a disloyal baron rebelling against his queen I'll plot out the major events of the rebellion and it's outcome on my calendar. This lets the players know that their are time restrictions on their actions. This is amazingly effective. When players talk about my past campaigns one of the things that always comes up is the calendar and the tension it causes. In my current campaign I've decided to also try and use the calendar to also engage my players more with the religion and culture of the world. I've named each month after one of the gods, added a special effect from the months god, and added some holidays with their own effects that the players can optionally interact with. Below you'll find the months of the year (each month is comprised of 3 weeks of 10 days), the special effect for that month, and the Holiday (If I've come up with it yet.) This is still a work in progress so comments or ideas are welcomed. I've also added the next month in game time so you can see the sorts of notes I have on my DM calendar. These notes are what let me quickly and easily keep up on what happens while the players are off doing whatever they want to do. Season| Month| Description &amp; Effect| Effect |Holiday ---|---|----|---- | ---- Winter| Sceadmor| The longest night of the year occurs during the month of Scaedmor and temperatures throughout the valley reach their coldest. Snow and ice cover the entire valley making travel difficult and dangerous. The mountains, highlands, and upper reaches of the midlands are all but impassable. The dead, undead, and evil spirits are thought to be their strongest in this month. | Undead have advantage on attack rolls and maximum hit points during the month of Sceadmor.| The Dead Night (longest night) - TBD Winter| Segmor| The long winter nights are filled with howls and windblown snow. While the days begin to lengthen the cold wind blows down from the mountains keeping temperatures in the valley extremely cold. The winds of Segmor drive the snow into huge drifts that can bury travelers. Ghosts, wraiths, and other phantasms stalk the night hiding in the chill breezes.| Creatures have disadvantage on death saving throws. A creature that dies in darkness or dim light in this month immediately rise as a specter. The specter is hostile to all living creatures and seeks to slay them. The specter is unable to enter areas of bright light and if it ends its turn in an area of bright light it is destroyed. After one hour the specter fades the shadowlands. | The Gift to the Wind - TBD Spring| Wilmor| The first month of spring is the hungriest and most likely to see starvation throughout the year. The snow begins to melt away while the inhabitants of Silveroak valley eat the last of their winter stores waiting for the first spring crops. The month of Wilmor is also a time for starving among the beasts and monstrous races of the valley. Driven to desperation the hungry monsters raid into the civilized portions of the valley in search of food. Stopping these raids has led to the festival known as the Slaughter of the Beast where hunters compete to see who can kill the most dangerous creatures.| Beasts have advantage on attacks during the month of Wilmor. An intelligent creature that is bitten by a rat, wolf, boar, bear, or tiger must make a DC 5 Constitution Save or become infected with Lycanthropy. | Slaughtering the Beast  On this day Wild Beasts are all affected by the Enlarge spell. Killing an enlarged beast is seen as a sign of skill and hunting prowess.Killing an enlarged beast of at least CR2 in single combat allows you to cast Enlarge on yourself 3 times before the end of the month. The spell lasts its full duration without concentration. Spring| Wedmor| The spring rains of Wedmor nourish the crops and and flowers of the valley. New green shoots can be seen everywhere and the first of the spring crops can be harvested ending the long reliance on stored food. The humans, halflings, and half-elves of the valley ritually wash and formally name any babies that have been born in the past year during the festival of Socain. Socain takes place on the 20th day of the month when Weder ensures the valley is always blanketed in a warm rain. The day of Socain is also celebrated as the start of a new year and is seen as a time for new beginnings and undertakings. It can also be a time of destruction and floods as the rains swell streams over their banks.|Creatures with an intelligence of at least 3 that die while submerged in water have a 10% chance of being reincarnated as one of the following creatures. (see table below) The reincarnated creature appears in the next 5d20 hours in a body of water within 1d20 miles that is large enough to sustain it. The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its original form, assuming the new body allows them. (A fish for example cant hold a shield). It can still speak in the new form. Its lifespan is the longer of the original species or the new one. Its Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution are set at the higher of the new forms scores or 6. It retains its previous Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. | Socian Baptism - TBD Summer| Evemor| The month of Evemor is considered to be the luckiest month of the year. The powers of Evegren are believed to be dominate and the powers of the other realms and the fey to be at their weakest. The elves and fey of Silveroak forest often retreat into the Fey Wilds of Scinlace during the month seeking to escape the long days beneath the watchful eye of Evegren. On the longest day of the year celebrations are thrown across the valley celebrating life and prosperity.| Once per long rest a mortal creature can reroll an attack, skill check, or save.| Sunstede (longest day) - TBD Summer| Beormor| Snow starts falling in the mountains at the end of Beormor. The mountains and stones provide the foundation of the three worlds and during the month of Beormor the roads between the worlds are weakened. The henges of stone, wood, and bone become portals through which travelers can visit other worlds.| Followers of Beorg can use a henge to travel between worlds. Other creatures must pass a religion check DC 15 to use the henge to travel between worlds. On a failed check the character goes to an unintended destination. | Fyrfoda Henge  The Fyrfoda Henge involves the ritualistic slaughter of animals or intelligent creatures as a way to ensure the magical protections of the Henges continue for another year. Fall| Sawmor| The last long warm days of the year are a time of harvest, hard work, and plenty. Feasts are common through the month culminating in the Great Harvest Feasts at the end of the month. | Anyone who feeds and houses at least one guest, free of charge, gains can use the spell guidance on themselves 3 times per day as long as the guest(s) are staying with them. Anyone who turns away a guest is effected by the Bane spell for the next 24 hours | The Harvest Feast  The day of the Harvest Feat is filled with games, song, and dance. In the afternoon each family, town, clan, or city gather together for the great feast. After eating the feast any creature that makes a DC 12 Religion check is affected by the Heroes Feast spell. Fall| Brynmor| The frost and cold begin to set in in earnest during the month of Brynmor. Cattle, sheep, and goats are turned out to forage on the stubble in the fields before being slaughtered as the first heavy snows begin to fall. Great Fires are lit each week and communities gather together before winter makes travel impossible. | Light from fires illuminates twice the normal distance. When rolling damage for fire effects roll twice and take the higher roll. | The Great Bonfires  Fyrst Fyr, Twegen Fyr, and Stor Fyr are the three great bonfire celebrations of Brynmor. Each involves food, drinking, and dancing. Those who wish for the blessing of Brynmor undertake tests of faith. **Fyst Fyr**  Jump through the fire. Athletics Check DC 10. Success: Gain resistance to fire on the rest of the month. Failure: 1d4 fire damage per hit die. **Twegen Fyr**  Fire Dance. Performance Check DC 15. Success: You may breath fire as though you drank a potion of fire breath once per long rest. Failure: 1d6 fire damage per hit die. You have disadvantage on saves against effects that deal fire damage. **Stor Fyr**  Eating the Fire. A coal is picked up and swallowed. The eater makes a Religion Check DC 20. Succeeding grants advantage on all attacks that deal fire damage until the end of the month. If the creature fails it loses any resistance to fire it has and gains vulnerability to fire until the end of the month. The creature then suffers 1d8 fire damage per hit die. If this kills the creature its body is immolated leaving only ash behind.

Currently the party (5 level 3 characters) is headed out into a magical desert to get the help of a queen of a fantastically rich city that mysteriously appeared. What they don't know is that the queen is a Greater Lamia who has created the city using her lair ability of Mirage Arcane to create an illusory city populated by her Jacklwere slaves. The queen would like to conquer Silveroak Valley so the players inviting her army in isn't really a great idea. Hopefully they will figure that out. The goal behind this campaign is to stop orcs from overrunning a valley of ~20,000 individuals. Key events this month are the initial incursions of the orcs before a full scale invasion in a few months and the Bullywugs in the Bonemarsh summon a Froghemoth to free them from a Green Dragon that's been oppressing them. The Bullywugs/Froghemoth is a secondary plot and will cause some confusion by driving the trolls out of the Bullywug swamp and wondering around unpopulated areas during the rain. The Froghemoth will retreat to the swamp at the end of the month without ever making it to a populated town.

As you can see I've tried to provide some major events that are happening around the valley. It's not really possible for the PCs to interact with everything that happens so they will simply hear about many of the events as they go about their agenda. If they do decided to do something like fight the second orcish warband then I simply go update the future events based on their actions. Rather than the army finding the orcs and trolls fighting and driving off both parties the Trolls ambush the army and send them running because the PCs drove off the orcs. It is certainly some prep work to plan things out like this but I find it's well worth the time investment. Somethings you can do to make it easier for yourself. 1. Use the normal calendar. You can rename months if you'd like but you don't have to. 1. Pick a real world city in the same climate zone as your setting and look up it's historical weather. Just reuse last years weather so you have realistic temperatures, rain, sun, and wind. 1. Build out more detail for the time the players will experience over the next few games and less detail further out. This lets you track major plot lines and fill in the rest as needed. 1. Steal events from a published adventure to add as background timelines. Maybe your party is one town over from Phandalin and they hear about a band of heroes going through the events in the Lost Mines of Phandelver adventure. I hope this helps inspire some people and adds some additional depth to your sandbox games. If you have questions, feedback, or stories of your own use of a calendar please share them. "
109,vulnerability,dndnext,Adding more depth to weapon damage types and armor - Thoughts?,0,9086rr,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/9086rr/adding_more_depth_to_weapon_damage_types_and/,2018-07-20 04:01:35,"I've been thinking about ways to add more tactical depth to 5e combat and I came up with an idea inspired by Fire Emblem that I wanted to get feedback on. In Fire Emblem, you have what essentially boils down to a rock/paper/scissors relationship involving weapon types. Starcraft and Warcraft do something similar, with certain damage types working better against certain armors than others. With all of that in mind, what do you think about a similar system involving Piercing, Slashing, and Bludgeoning damage vs. Light, Medium, and Heavy armor? My idea was Piercing damage would be more effective against Light armored enemies and less effective against Heavy armored enemies, Slashing would be more effective against Medium armor and less against Light, and Bludgeoning would be most effective against Heavy and least effective against Medium. To simplify: Piercing &gt; Light &gt; Slashing &gt; Medium &gt; Bludgeoning &gt; Heavy &gt; Piercing For enemies not wearing armor, the GM would determine what kind of ""armor"" the enemy has based on how thick its hide is. So for instance, a dragon might have medium armor because it's got thick scales, while a stone golem might have heavy armor. Now, with the way 5e is structured, I don't think you could go as far as adding straight-up resistance and vulnerability to the damage types. That may be a bit too much. Maybe instead, you could add your modifier twice when your weapon would be more-effective, and not add it at all when it would be less-effective. Or roll 1 additional weapon die vs. only adding your modifier. I'm not really sure. Since in general as an attacker you'd probably go after the targets that are most vulnerable, it would probably raise your team's offensive output by more than not. The advantages of such a system, beyond making weapon damage type matter quite a bit more than it does now, is it would add considerable tactics to your average battle. Suddenly you have incentive to vary your targets and aim for better positioning around not only just the biggest threats, but the most vulnerable to your arsenal. "
110,vulnerability,dndnext,Some advice on executing faster turns,53,95vopf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/95vopf/some_advice_on_executing_faster_turns/,2018-08-09 21:40:46,"Its easy to get bogged down in the game and end up spending minutes on your turn, causing people to become inattentive as combat drags. This is meant to help with that. Much of this may be obvious for veterans, for newer players hopefully some of this will be helpful. 1. First because it is the most important thing. You figure out what you're going to do on the turn of others. Your turn is to execute and describe your actions you already decided upon. As soon as my turn is over I'm thinking about what I'm doing next. For example if I want to place a *Fireball* that will only hit enemies I might be using the ruler on roll20 or counting squares in my head in person. Once I figure out a spot I might make a little mark on roll20 or place a d4 on the battlemap to represent the center of the *Fireball* so I don't forget. In person I'll have already placed aside the dice I need to roll. Use common sense and don't be distracting but that shouldn't be difficult from my own personal experience. Other's actions might shift your plan but that's part of the game. Always have a simple fall back action that you can take. ""Well if I can't *Fireball* then I'll just *Chill Touch* whoever is hurt"" is a perfectly valid option. Often I'll have a plan B in addition to a simple fallback option. 2. If you can't remember something, make a visual aid. For example let's say you constantly get confused on your 5th level character on what to roll between your shortsword attack made with dexterity (14) and *Spiritual Weapon* attack made with wisdom (18). Grab some index cards and have one that says: &gt;**Shortsword (attack action, 5' range):** &gt;Attack - 1d20+5 &gt;Damage - 1d6+2 piercing and another that says: &gt;**Spiritual Weapon (bonus action, move 20' and attack):** &gt;Attack - 1d20+7 &gt;Damage - 1d8+4 force Same can apply to smite damage etc, have the dice per spell slot written on an index card you can refer to or make your own macro on roll20 that let's you select the level of the smite. For example I made a Smite macro: &gt;/me smites the enemy &gt;?{Level of Spell|1st, [[2d8]]|2nd,[[3d8]]|3rd,[[4d8]]|4th,[[5d8]]|5th(don't),[[5d8]]} radiant damage and another [[1d8]] radiant damage if the target is an undead or fiend. and Critical Smite macro: &gt;/me critically smites the enemy &gt;?{Level of Spell|1st, [[4d8]]|2nd,[[6d8]]|3rd,[[8d8]]|4th,[[10d8]]|5th(don't),[[10d8]]} radiant damage and another [[2d8]] radiant damage if the target is an undead or fiend. 3. Minionmancy is probably one of the most maligned slow downs for games. A single minion shouldn't be a big deal if you have the stats in front of you. The biggest thing there is to not treat them as important as a character, spending a great deal of effort to maximize their effectiveness steals the spotlight from actual PCs. For roll20 you might not have a mob sheet setup for a summon so you can make a macro from scratch, for example I had a *Summon Greater Demon* Barlgura reckless attack macro that looked like: &gt;/me Barlgura &gt;. &gt;[[2d20kh1+7]] for [[2d6+4]] piercing &gt;[[2d20kh1+7]] for [[1d10+4]] bludgeoning &gt;[[2d20kh1+7]] for [[1d10+4]] bludgeoning &gt;[[1d20-1]] to beat DC: [[1d0+15]] or starts attacking nearest on each of its turns The 1d0 always rolls a 0 and lights up green, making things like DCs for macros easy to find at a glance. the 2d20kh1 means roll 2 d20s and keep the highest 1, thus rolling at advantage. But basically with that I could resolve the Barlgura's turn in 5 seconds. The main issue comes up with multiple minions, a cleric has animated 12 skeletons, wizard has animated 10 silver coins, druid has dumped down 8 beasts, etc. For the Conjure line I suggest to DMs that: - They're all the same type of thing. - They'll have an easy time swarming 1 target. - They don't have on-hit make save effects like certain poisons or knockdowns. I have the house rule at my table that if the caster picks 1 or 2 things they get to choose the critters and if they pick 4 or 8 things the DM gets to choose, and I will pick things that are quick to resolve action wise as opposed to the most effective thing. Personally I suggest using the Mob Rules on page 250 of the DMG for this unless you're playing on roll20 and have specific macros setup. I'll use an example for 12 skeletons that will be attacking an AC 17 target with shortbows. The attack chart for skeletons would look like: # to hit AC &lt;=9: 1 # to hit AC &lt;=16: 2 # to hit AC &lt;=18: 3 # to hit AC &lt;=20: 4 # to hit AC &lt;=22: 5 # to hit AC &lt;=23: 10 So 1 out of every 3 skeletons will hit the target, 12/3=4 skeletons hit. We could either roll 4d6+8 or refer to a damage chart taking the average (going to round down in this example though you could add fractions together which might make more sense): 1 hit: 5 2 hit: 10 3 hit: 15 4 hit: 20 5 hit: 25 6 hit: 30 7 hit: 35 8 hit: 40 9 hit: 45 10 hit: 50 11 hit: 55 12 hit: 60 Even if the DM doesn't want to reveal the exact AC of the monster, you can hand them the chart and they can tell you the number needed to hit and you should be able to give the total damage within a few seconds or they could even resolve everything themselves. The key here is not to worry about lost damage if the enemy dies 2 arrows early or whatever. Spending time maximizing your zoo of critters is placing your fun above everyone else. 4. Finally, roll all your dice at the same time. Whether it is attack and damage dice, or d6s for a fireball roll them all together unless there could be some confusion on damage types (half x type half y type). Generally for that exception I have different colored dice available so I might put aside 4d6 red dice and 4d6 blue dice to roll all at once for *Flame Strike*, and ask the DM as I'm rolling if the creature has resistance, immunity, or vulnerability to fire or radiant so I know if I need to give the damage together or separately."
111,vulnerability,dndnext,Just a story about a lvl 6 Paladin of Vengeance dealing nearly 140 dmg in a round without crits. Hope you enjoy this as much as we did,0,8v5ywp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/8v5ywp/just_a_story_about_a_lvl_6_paladin_of_vengeance/,2018-07-01 09:46:55,"Alright, first of all the context in which we're playing: we are a party of 6 with a 7th friend as DM who homebrews our campaigns. We are locating and closing 7 gateways across the province which are actually portals to other planes (like the elemental plane of water), that are located on intersections of magical laylines across the country. These gateways are guarded by gatekeepers who sometimes do or don't cooperate (in which case we require their death to close the gateway). 5 closed gates into the campaign, the 6th is a portal to the elemental plane of fire, where we find the gatekeeper and an NPC (who used to be an old PC that had seemingly died in our previous campaign) locked in combat with an large undead shadow and some kind of bone creature at its core (think Obscuriul from Fantastic Beasts and where to find them. This was written right after the session, I have no idea what it actually was). 1 round into combat and our paladin runs straight past the 3 Shadow Demons (summoned by the big one) screaming for justice and retribution upon this foul creature. As a dwarf, its 50ft speed (action-dash) gets him right in front of the big one where he has to end its turn, not before casting Vow of Enmity (bonus action - adv on attack rolls against creature for 1 min). On his next turn he learns that at the shadow's core lies its vulnerability, but requires a STR check to enter its body which he fails, resulting in an attack from the shadow reducing the paladin to 2 hp. Paladin runs back a bit and sits behind a corner, heals with Lay on Hands and casts Branding Smite as a bonus action. Next turn, the shadow attacks our fighter who draws attention to give the rest some breathing space and the paladin walks back up to the shadow and jams his greatsword into the shadow, adding Divine Smite to the pile, dealing around 34 dmg, which turns to 64, because the shadow has a vulnerability to Radiant dmg. He follows it up with a bonus action - Branding Smite and repeats the process for 73 dmg, where the shadow explodes and reveals his core: a boned skeletal warrior (also no idea what monster this is) which we take out 4 turns later. TLDR; Paladin prepares his enemy with Vow of Enmity and bonus action - Branding Smite in turn 1. Next turn hits it with a Divine Smite on top of it and then learns it has a radiant vulnerability (both Branding and Divine are radiant) so repeats the process (bonus action - Branding Smite + Divine Smite + Extra Attack) to deal 137 dmg."

Please come review/critique!",45,8lpai7,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/8lpai7/i_made_the_bbeg_for_my_campaign_the_prince_of/,2018-05-24 12:43:52,"Hi! **It goes without saying that if you are part of my campaign (Fae Folk's Folly) get outta here. Seriously. Shoo!** I've been working on a campaign for about a year (nearly two) now and with some ill-advised downtime from university work I decided to stat out some of the mid- and late game enemies and monsters that my party will be facing over the next year or two. Mordenkainen's made this a lot easier by providing a solid grounds for reference by which to create high CR monsters. This design was based on a combination of the Prince of Frost's stat block created in 4th edition in combination with a variety of the demon princes/devil's and ancient dragons found throughout Wizards' official materials. Any advice, critique or discussion is very welcome! So, in any case, here's my take on the Archfey, and BBEG of my campaign, the Prince of Frost. **The Prince of Frost (Approximately 18-20th level boss monster)** *Large Fey, Neutral Evil* **Armor Class** 20 (natural armour) **Hit Points** 413 (33d10 + 231) **Speed** 40ft. STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS| CHA ---|---|----|----|----|---- 24 (+7)| 26(+8) | 24 (+7) | 22 (+6)| 22 (+5) | 28 (+9) **Saving Throws** Dex +16, Con + 15, Cha +17 **Skills** Arcana + 14, Perception +13, Persuasion +17, Intimidation +17, Insight +13 **Damage Resistances** Necrotic, Fire; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks that arent silvered. **Damage Immunities** Cold, Poison **Condition immunities.** Charmed, Exhausted, Frightened, Poisoned, Sleep **Senses** Darkvision 120ft., Passive Perception 23 **Languages** Common, Elven, Sylvan, Draconic, Giant, Primordial. **Challenge** 25 (75,000 XP) ***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the Prince of Frost can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. When the Prince of Frost uses his Fey Step, one creature of his choice of him that he can see within 5 feet before he teleports must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of him until the end of his next turn. ***Ice Walk.*** The Prince of Frost can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost him extra moment. ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Prince of Frosts innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 24). He can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: At will: *Alter self* (Can become medium when changing his appearance), *Animate dead, Fog cloud, Gust of Wind, Frostbite, Ice Knife, Charm Person, Elemental Bane* 3/day each: *Counterspell, Dispel Magic, Dominate Person, Crown of Madness, Wall of Ice, Cone of Cold, Ice Storm, Freezing Sphere* ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Prince of Frost fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. ***Magic Resistance.*** The Prince of Frost has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. ***Regeneration.*** The Prince of Frost regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes Fire damage, this trait doesnt function at the start of his next turn. The Prince of Frost dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesnt regenerate. ***Sorrowful Presence.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the Prince of Frost must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed by the Prince of Frost for 1 minute. While charmed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatures saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the ability Sorrowful Presence for the next 24 hours. Whenever the Prince of Frost deals damage to the charmed creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. **ACTIONS** ***Multiattack.*** The Prince of Frost attacks twice with his longsword, Bitter Edge. He can substitute Winters Bite for one of these attacks. - ***Bitter Edge.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage, or 18 (2d10 + 7) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 14 (4d6) cold damage. - ***Winters Bite.*** *Melee weapon attack.* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage and the creature must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or its health maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken. **REACTIONS** - ***Frigid Rebuke.*** When the Prince of Frost takes damage from a creature the Prince of Frost can see within 60 feet of it, the Prince of Frost can force that creature to succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) cold damage. - ***Curse the Flames (Recharge 6)*** *This ability is a legendary reaction and can be used whenever it is both available and the triggering condition is met.* ***Recharges automatically when Bloodied (When the Prince of Frost first drops below half of his maximum hit point total).*** When a creature within 60 feet of the Prince of Frost makes an attack that deals Fire damage, the Prince of Frost can teleport next to the attacking creature and make one attack with Bitter Edge against that attacker. If the Prince of Frost hits, the target is stunned until the end of its next turn. **LEGENDARY ACTIONS** The Prince of Frost can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Prince of Frost regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn. - ***Frostbite.*** The Prince of Frost uses the Frostbite cantrip. - ***Attack.*** The Prince of Frost attacks once with Bitter Edge. - ***Blizzard Step (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Prince of Frost teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Each creature within 10 feet of his arrival point must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 20 (2d10+9) cold damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful save. Frost magic tears up the surroundings, turning it into difficult terrain until the end of his next turn and conferring disadvantage on ranged attacks targeting creatures within the area of effect. - ***Blood to Ice (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Prince of Frost targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of himself. The target must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 15 (1d10 + 9) Cold damage on a failed save and its movement is halved. The creature must repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. First Failed Saving Throw: The creature takes 15(1d10 + 9) Cold damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn, as its flesh begins to freeze. Second Failed Saving Throw: The target turns to ice and is Petrified. **LAIR ACTIONS.** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), The Prince of Frost can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he cant use the same effect two rounds in a row: - ***Harrowing Winds.*** The Prince of Frost targets up to 3 creatures within 120 feet of him which must also be within 30 feet of each other. An icy wind, carrying the sorrow of the Prince, whips through the area and all targets must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 25 (3d10 + 9) Necrotic Damage and their speed is halved until the end of their next turn. - ***Grip of Winter.*** The Prince of Frost targets a creature which was damaged by Harrowing Winds in the previous round. That creature must make a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw, on a failure it is healed for 15 (1d10 + 9) hit points and the Prince of Frost can direct the creature on its next turn as it falls under his fey thrall. - ***Fortress of Tears.*** Icy walls block off areas in the Prince of Frosts lair. Each wall is 6 inches thick, and a 10-foot section has AC 5, 15 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If the Prince of Frost wishes to move through a wall, he can do so by treating the space of the wall as difficult terrain, leaving the wall intact as he passes through. Regional effects. The Vale of the Long Night is warped by The Prince of Frosts magic, which creates one or more of the following effects: - The Prince of Frost controls the weather in the area surrounding his lair to a startling level of precision. The area within 6 miles of the lair is permanently under the effect of a control weather spell. - Frozen statues and tombs of ice populate the area, containing the frozen remains of the Prince of Frosts enemies. These icy prisons are frequently haunted by ghouls, zombies and spectres which might attack the party. - A sense of pervasive hopelessness pervades the area within 1 mile of the Princes lair, sapping creatures will to live. A creature that spends over an hour within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become listless and devoid of hope, represented by rolling on the Winter Eladrin Flaw table on pg. 62 of MToF. This saving throw can be repeated at the end of each successive hour, ending the effect on a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw or otherwise ends the effect cant be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. Hope you like it and please let me know of anything you'd change!"

Additionally, difficult terrain composed of roots, leaves and forested terrain dont cost it extra moment. ***Legendary Resistance*** *(3/Day)*. If the Zomok fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. **ACTIONS** ***Multiattack.*** The Zomok can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its slam.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The creature may be freed if it or another creature takes an action to make a DC 19 Strength check and succeeds. For the next minute the ground affected by this ability is considered difficult terrain **LEGENDARY ACTIONS** The Zomok can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

Each creature within 10 feet of the Zomok must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked away 10 feet and prone. The creature takes an additional 1d6 points of damage if this movement forces it into the space of a piece of terrain or additional creature. In the case of a creature, that creature must all succeed on a DC19 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 damage and be knocked prone.

115,vulnerability,dndnext,5 multiclass attempt at maximum assasination damage build (with mystic),2,8pyzb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/8pyzb6/5_multiclass_attempt_at_maximum_assasination/,2018-06-10 16:04:47,"Heyo, so since assassin has always seemed underwhelming in any games I played, I decided to try and break assassin builds to get the most possible damage out of a single round of attacks. So our level 20 character has a neat 5 multiclasses. Rogue (3) - Assassin architype, 2d6 sneak attack Fighter (3) - Battlemaster Architype (action surge, superiority dice damage.) Ranger (3) - Gloom Stalker Architype (extra attack, dread ambusher, zephyr strike, a bunch of sneaky shit) Mystic (9) - It's fucking broken (nomadic arrow, nomadic step and diminuition are the main ones we want, along with potent psionics) Cleric (2) - Grave Domain (for the niiiiiice double damage, rip lvl 17 assassin feature) Sharp shooter and crossbow exper feats for daaamaaaage. So here's the damage breakdown. First turn, our little rogue friend sneaks in with a +30 stealth or something thanks to microscopic form (mystic feature). Activate zephyr strike as a bonus action for that NEAT 1d8 force damage on the attack. We activate speed dart using 7 psi points and use the grave domain channel divinity to mark our target. Action surge on the same turn to attack that suprised creature. Pile on battlemaster superiority dice on that vulnerable damage + crit attack. So that's (using a hand crossbow as an example) 1d6 + 2d6 (sneak) + 1d8 (superiority) + 1d8 (zephyr strike) + 1d8 (potent psionics) + 7d10 (speed dart) +10 (sharpshooter). Let's average that to a nice little 63 damage average without sharpshooter (using anydice.com), it's a crit, so that's 126 damage (136 with sharpshooter). Aaaaand let's add that grave cleric vulnerability for 272 damage on that one attack using just the dice rolls and no modifier, let's say we have +5 to dex (doubled from vulnerability damage), so that's 282 damage. BUT WAIT there's more. Assassin states that every attack on a suprised target is a critical strike. So let's add one more attack with the gloom stalker feature and sharpshooter. 1d6 + 1d8 + 10 + 5 + 1d8 (superiority dice) So with crit, that's 36 damage on the free attack. So that's a neat 318 damage on the round. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE. If you ready Faithful Archer before attacking you get an extra attack at the start of your assassination round. (might need to forgo zephyr strike for this, not sure on the ruling for mystic features and spell concentration.) So that's another attack on the round, for 3 attacks total (faithful archer specifies that you make the attack as a free action, so all the bonuses apply, this will be your main damaging attack now and the following one will be the third.) So another attack for 1d6+10+5 + 1d8 (superiority dice) with crit for 31 damage for a total of 349 so far. Aaaaand we had to use our action surge to use the path to the grave cleric feature this time, however im noooot entire sure if using it breaks your stealth (no saving throw, so it could just be completely unnoticable). If you can use it without breaking stealth, then you can spend your action surge on 2 more attacks on another 42 damage. Using the last superiority dice too that's another 1d8 doubled with crit for 52 damage average on the action surge round So, totalling 401 damage in the ideal condition, not counting any potential magic weapon, favored enemy and other smaller bonuses. After that, you still have the abilities of a 9th level mystic to literally dissapear from the room with teleportation. With a 140ft teleport speed per turn, invisibility, microscopic form and a 1 mile teleport if needed, you'll be perfectly fine on escaping aftet the deed is done, not to mention you can use those abilities to get to your target in the first place. So this was my best attempt at doing maximum assassination damage in one round. I played around with paladin damage too, and pulling back on a few levels in mystic for paladin smites on the crit attacks will increase damage, but that's on melee attacks and you miss out on sharpshooter (unless the DM counts thrown weapons as melee and ranged weapon attacks, in which case fucking go for it.) Cheers for reading, tell me what ya'll think about this build and how it can be improved. "

I'm playing a fighter 1/warlock 2/sorcerer (wild magic) X (in that order). My mate is playing straight assassin rogue. Being able to grapple things and keep our hands free will be fun for both of us. Cold vulnerability will suck until we get rings of warmth. Just wondering what peoples thoughts on it as a player race would be. Especially since there will be 2 of us in the party

Here are the ones I can think of off the top of my head and I'll edit the post with anything people bring up in the comments. Many of these come from [this](URL post, but there have been a couple books since then and maybe there are some things that the author missed. I didn't include things like spells that say ""the target's alignment doesn't change"" or anything like that, because those don't seem to involve alignment in the mechanical sense, but rather as an expression of the target's personality. Monsters * Demilich: first time a non-evil creature enters the demilich's lair they take 3d10 necrotic damage (MM 49) * Lemure: returns to life in 1d10 days unless killed by a good creature under effects of *bless* or sprinkled with holy water (MM 76) * Night Hag: evil creatures killed by Nightmare Haunting have soul trapped in bag (MM 178) * Lycanthrope: PC becoming lycanthrope has alignment changed to appropriate alignment (MM 207) * Rakshasa: vulnerability to piercing damage from magic weapons wielded by good creatures (MM 257) * Shadow: non-evil humanoids killed by Strength Drain become shadows in 1d4 days (MM 269) * Sprite: can detect creature's alignment on failed DC 10 cha save (MM 283) * Unicorn: regional affects maximize healing and suppress curses on good creatures (MM 293) * Vampire: PC becoming vampire has alignment changed to lawful evil (MM 295) Magic Items * Candle of Invocation: creatures with same alignment as candle's deity have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks, clerics or druids with same alignment can cast 1st level spells at-will (DMG 157) * Book of Vile Darkness: non-evil make DC17 cha save or alignment change to neutral evil (DMG 222) * Book of Exalted Deeds: requires attunement by a good creature, evil creatures take 24d6 unavoidable radiant damage (DMG 222) * Blackrazor: requires attunement by a non-lawful creature (DMG 216) * Deck of Many Things: Balance card reverses alignment (DMG 162) * Talisman of Pure Good: requires attunement by a good creature, evil creatures take 8d6 radiant damage (DMG 207) * Talisman of Ultimate Evil: requires attunement by an evil creature, good creatures take 8d6 necrotic damage (DMG 207) * Robe of the Archmage: requires attunement by a character of the appropriate alignment (DMG 194) Classes * Oathbreaker Paladin: must be evil (DMG 97) Planar Travel * Mount Celestia: good creatures gain effects of *bless* while on plane and *lesser restoration* on long rest, optional (DMG 59) * Bytopia: DC 10 wis save or non-lawful/neutral good creatures changed to one of these alignments, optional (DMG 59-60) * The Abyss: DC 10 cha save or become corrupted, corrupted creatures become chaotic evil after 1d4+2 days, optional (DMG 62) * The Nine Hells: DC 10 cha save or become lawful evil, optional (DMG 64) Spells * Spirit Guardians: good and neutral casters do radiant damage, evil do necrotic (PHB 278) * Glyph of Warding: can trigger based on alignment (PHB 245) Edit: all sorts of formatting changes"

They won't know what it does until they attune it. Are these all about equal in power level/not game breaking at early levels? Suggestions are welcome! Ring of punch - once per short rest, the wearer can make an unarmed melee attack if able. Their fist grows 5 times larger during the attack and deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. Requires attunement. Amulet of flame - once per long rest, the wearer can engulf their entire body in harmless, heatless flames, which cannot spread to other things. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until dismissed. Can be dismissed as an action. Requires attunement. Circlet of brain - once per short rest, the wearer can use the circlet to gain advantage on an skill check that uses the intelligence stat or intelligence saving throw. Requires attunement. Slippers of sliding - Once per long rest, you can create an ice path underneath you. Any solid ground or water beneath your feet has a frozen layer created upon it. If you are moving or start moving, you slide the rest of your movement speed in a straight line leaving an ice path behind you. A creature that steps on the ice must make a DC 15 dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. Requires attunement. Cape of billowing - this cape is constantly at billowing, slightly more so than the environment would suggest. In a breeze, it billows as if there was strong winds. In unmoving air, the cape flutters behind you. Once per long rest, you can reach your arms into the air above you, and create a 20 foot line of powerful wind centered on you. This wind can be blowing from behind you or from in front of you. Medium or smaller creatures in the wind must make a DC 15 strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet in the direction the wind is blowing. The gust lasts for 1 round. Requires attunement. Belt of stone - a belt made of stone. Once per long rest, your entire body turns into stone. You cannot move your arms or legs or speak. This lasts for 30 seconds. While you are stone, you have resistance to slashing and piercing damage, but vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. You can dismiss the belt as an action. Requires attunement. Mask of Joy - a mask that attaches itself to the face of who attunes it. The mask moves with their real face to form expressions and mouth movements while talking, but is still clearly a mask. But, the mask has a permanent ear to ear grin. Let's the wearer cast Tasha's hideous laughter once per long rest. Requires attunement."
119,vulnerability,dndnext,I made a couple of artifacts from The Elder Scrolls for 5e. C&amp;C welcome.,6,86xtgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/86xtgk/i_made_a_couple_of_artifacts_from_the_elder/,2018-03-25 12:59:06,"These are three of my favorite unique items from Morrowind/Oblivion, so please enjoy. Use them if you wish. I borrowed a few ideas for the Wabbajack table from[ this picture on imgur](URL made up a few, and converted a few. Nothing has been play-tested yet so they might be really broken for all I know. **Chrysamere** *+3 Greatsword- Artifact* **Requires Attunement - Requires Lawful-Good alignment** While attuned to this weapon you have resistance to Fire damage. In addition, while wielding this weapon, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). If you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster. **Sentience.** Chrysamere is a sentient lawful-good weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. **Personality.** The sword's purpose is to smite evil and protect the weak. Killing evil fiends, undead, cultists, or necromancers, destroying their sanctuaries, and foiling their machinations all help to fulfill this goal. If you commit enough evil deeds that your alignment ever drops from lawful-good, you must make a Wisdom saving throw as the sword attempts to sear your mind with holy fire. On a success, the sword disappears from your hands in a flash of white light. On a failure, you are instantly killed. **Random Properties** 1 Major beneficial property 1 Minor beneficial property 1 Minor detrimental property **Umbra Sword** *+3 Longsword  Artifact* **Requires Attunement** While you are attuned to this weapon, it deals an additional 2d8 Force damage against creatures of Medium size or larger. If Umbra isn't fed a soul within one day after being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma save. On a success, they suffer 3d6 psychic damage. On a failure, they are dominated by the sword (as if by dominate monster) and the sword demands that it be fed a soul. The effect ends when the sword is fed. **Sentience.** Umbra is a sentient neutral-evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 12, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and Darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand all languages. **Personality.** The swords purpose is the consuming of souls, mortal and immortal alike. It has existed for millennia and is a powerful, malevolent intelligence. **Spirit of Umbra.** A dark purple gem sits in the hilt of the sword. When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this weapon, you may have the creatures soul become trapped inside the extradimensional space within the gem. At any time, you can choose to release the soul or let the spirit within the sword consume it. Only one creature may exist inside the gem at any time. Creatures without souls are immune to this effect. While the soul is trapped inside the gem, it retains all of its previous knowledge and mental attributes, and can speak, read, and understand all the languages it knew in life. You may communicate with the creature as long as its soul remains trapped inside the gem. You may attempt to mentally enslave the creatures soul, but this can strain or even break your mind. Make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to 8+ the creatures Wisdom modifier. On a failure, you take 2d6 psychic damage and are Insane until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't read, and speak only in gibberish. A Greater Restoration spell cast on you ends this effect. On a successful save, the creature is permanently Charmed by you. **Random Properties** 2 Minor beneficial Properties 2 Minor detrimental Properties **Wabbajack** *+3 Quarterstaff - Artifact* **Requires Attunement  Requires the Spellcasting feature** When you make a melee attack with this weapon, the number rolled on the damage die determines the weapons damage. 1 Acid 2 Fire 3 Poison 4 Ice 5 Lightning 6 Necrotic When you cast a spell while wielding this weapon, roll a d20.

120,vulnerability,dndnext,Grave Cleric Assassin,6,8aku10,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/8aku10/grave_cleric_assassin/,2018-04-08 06:28:38,"I am trying to come up with my next character concept and thought there was some good synergy with the grave cleric and rogue assassin. Grave clerics have the CHANNEL DIVINITY: PATH TO THE GRAVE ability that states: Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creatures life force for termination. As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn . The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attacks damage, and then the curse ends. I thought this would work well with the rogues assassinate ability to have advantage, sneak attack, and auto crit on a surprised foe. Supposing you are a lvl 10 PC Cleric 2/Rogue 8 then you could conceivably set up an ambush where you mark your target, then sneak attack from range with a longbow dealing a crit roll of 2d8+8d6 (average outcome would be 42 + dex mod) which is doubled. The character would rp as a conduit of the raven queen, ushering those chosen into the afterlife. I think it will be a lot of fun."

An Elf with 10 constitution should not be able to beat a Dwarf with 16 constitution in one roll if the dice are in their favor. Here's my quick and dirty draft: Every character has an Alcohol Tolerance score that's their constitution score. Double it if they have resistance to poison, halve it if they have vulnerability. If they're immune to poison they can't get drunk. Every drink has a point value. You can drink without consequences until you hit your Alcohol Tolerance score, after that, you need to make a save for each drink. Creatures who have advantage on saves against poison have advantage on this save. The DC starts at 10, and increases by the drink's score with every subsequent drink. Fail that save and you're out.

So one of my players is a Warlock whose patron is the Archfey, which we have reflavored to be a malicious version of the tooth fairy. She'll be giving him a wand in the next session called the *Wand of Chaos and Canines* that is essentially a *Wand of Wonder,* but with some extra chaotic effects like those from the sorceror's wild magic table. I've run out of ideas for tooth-flavored effects though (not all of them are tooth based, but for those that are I am struggling to not make near-duplicate effects). Here's what I have so far for the tooth ones: * All creatures within 30ft of (and including) the target must make a Constitution saving throw or gain vulnerability to piercing damage for 1 minute. * You cast the spell Polymorph on the target, except they are turned into a pair of dentures with a move speed of 5ft. The target retains the ability to speak any languages they know. * 1d6 humanoid skulls emerge from the ground around you, clinging to your limbs and clothing with their jaws for 1 minute before fading away. During this time you have disadvantage on Dexterity based ability checks and saving throws. * A stream of 1d4 x 10 fangs shoots from the wands tip in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each fang deals 1 piercing damage, and the total damage of the fangs is split equally among all creatures in the area. * You cast Magic Missile as a 5th level spell. The missiles take on the appearance of jagged fangs. * The target makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed roll some the targets teeth explode, dealing 5d8 piercing damage to them. * You cast Cloud of Daggers, which manifests as a cloud of jagged teeth and fangs. * A 5 feet radius, 10 feet deep maw lined with many needle-like teeth opens up on the ground, centered on the target. The maw thrashes about as if it is alive, causing all characters trying to leap over it to make a Dexterity saving throw or be caught by the teeth and fall to the bottom, taking 2d6 piercing damage, and 1d6 bludgeoning. On each subsequent turn the pit convulses and thrashes, dealing an additional 2d6 piercing damage to any inside. Climbing out of the hole is quite easy due to the ample foot/handholds the teeth provide, and so creatures have advantage on any rolls to escape. Any ideas for additional tooth-flavored effects are greatly appreciated! I'm not worried about rules wording since the player and I agreed that the percentile chart would be kept from him to make the item more surprising, and our group is pretty laid back. Thanks in advance! "

Thanks in advance and sorry for the wall of text! :p Here's my issue: So I'm playing this human paladin and earlier on he ended up drinking a magic potion that messed up his heart, basically giving him a permanent heart disease; the effect is said to be slowly decreasing but never fade away completely, unless with magical intervention. Now this was made up mainly for storytelling, and the campaign my DM set up is very engaging on roleplay, so until now I just acted like the character was actually sick, forcing him to slow down after stressful situations or continuous fights, trying to give the sensation of a physical vulnerability. Though I'm starting to think I need some kind of regulations for this; I thought about giving him 1lv of exhaustion after a series of encounters without resting, but that seemed actually too much of a burden for the party, since we're trying to delve in increasingly more challenging dungeons now. My DM knows me from a long time,he's experienced and pretty good at his job and suggested me to keep this heart disease to roleplay level, but also allowed me to playtest a solution in the case I found one, since we're both used to house rules. Actually this time I don't know where to start though, I've never explored disease in d&amp;d before and it seems that I can't find a way to balance things right now! Any ideas?"
124,vulnerability,dndnext,Tapasya: Expanded Blessing Rules for Indian-influence Campaigns,1,81a8rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/81a8rm/tapasya_expanded_blessing_rules_for/,2018-03-02 11:25:50,"In Hinduism, there are many stories of people performing yogic austerities (tapasya) in the woods or mountains in order to get a blessing (vardaan) from the gods. Kubja and Amba perform austerities to get favorable rebirths as a beautiful nymph or a great warrior. Many demons (asura) perform austerities to get a form of invulnerability and then proceed to attack the gods and take over the three worlds. Etc. Here, I will be providing an expansion to the rules in the DMG for blessings, with an eye towards the sorts of blessings that tend to be common in Hindu stories. Note that some of these rules are primarily intended to be used by antagonists or sages, since the amount of downtime required would be prohibitive to characters in a normal campaign. A character desiring a boon must learn the proper mantras and rituals, a process that is treated like training to learn a set of tools or learn a new language (i.e. it takes 250 days and cost 1 gp per day.) Once you have learned the mantra and rituals you must perform them, doing nothing else except eating and sleeping, for an appropriate amount of time listed in parenthesis. Individuals who are particularly devoted might only take half or one-tenth the time to perform the rituals. * **Death Contingency** (1 month): Just like Jayadratha's boon that his head would explode on whoever caused it to fall to the ground, your death will be quite the show. Name specific death conditions and circumstances, and if those occur one person who fulfills criteria you specify will take half your level times five fire damage, or half if they succeed a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. * **Specific Rebirth** (10 years): You can decide what kind of being you are reborn as in your next life, or some specific feat that your next life will accomplish. Alternatively, immediately reincarnate as if you died and were resurrected by the reincarnate spell, and choose your new race. * **Near Invulnerability** (100 years): Choose between A) immunity to 12 damage types and vulnerability to the remaining one, or B) rejuvenation (like a lich or mummy lord) as long as long as your killer isn't a particular race, monster type or gender. * **Clones from Blood** (5 years): Like the demon Raktabija, your blood produces copies of you. Choose two damage types, and whenever you take those damage types you may use your reaction to split (as a black pudding.) If any clones of yours survive, they grow in size to match the original over the course of a week. * **Half-Strength Opponents** (5 years): Like Bali, you opponents are half as effective when fighting you. Choose between A) resistance to bludgeoning, piecing and slashing damage from opponents you can see, or B) an antimagic cone (as a beholder) originating from one of your eyes. * **Divine Parthenogenesis** (100 years): Like Vyasa and Gandhari, or Durvasa and Kunti - you may grant a woman who desires it, the ability to conceive and birth a child. Such children are often touched by the divine or destiny, spelling great ill or great good for their kingdoms. * **Borrow a divine weapon** (12 years): Like Arjuna getting the Divyasatras, a god gives you a Legendary weapon until you complete a specific task. You may only have one weapon from this blessing at a time. * **Enlarge** (1 year): You gain the ability to cast Enlarge/Reduce once per long rest, using the enlarge effect. * **Reduce** (1 year): You gain the ability to cast Enlarge/Reduce once per long rest, using the enlarge effect. * **Immovable Self** (5 years): You gain the ability to fix your location in space, as if you were an immovable rod. Once you use this ability, you cannot use it again until a week has passed. * **Feather Falling** (5 years): You gain the benefits of a ring of feather fall, permanently. * **Telekinesis** (5 years): You may cast telekinesis once per long rest. **Temptation** Because of how powerful some of these are, the gods may choose to intervene if someone tries to get some of these blessings by trying to tempt the devotee into stopping their austerities early. The most common way this is done is by sending celestial nymphs called apsaras (use the stats of a succubus or dryad, but change their type to celestial), but virtually any divine servant might be sent to temp someone and get them to fall due to one of the six passions (arishadvarga): lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride or jealousy."

The higher the AC you go, the more damage these blocks do on average (since they still do damage on a miss while they have more than half HP). As the AC goes down, these statblocks do less damage. They have vulnerability to AoE because individually they each have less health. So a single 3rd level fireball on average will kill the entire 5th level conjure animals wolfpack thing, as it would if they were all individual statblocks. They have resistance to single target damage so that I could reduce the total health, making AoEs more effective. If two swarms were to fight each other, I'd probably ignore resistance or vulnerability to represent each individual member of the mob fighting one another. Idk though. I have other statblocks I'm still fine tuning involving animate dead. I'm finishing up ones for 20 undead skeletons / zombies.

So, I've been looking at running OotA for my players at some point in the future, and one thing from Ch1 stood out to me: the location of the players' confiscated starting equipment. If Ilvara is in her quarters, she'll roll over a lvl1 party like they're made of tissue paper, doubly so if they couldn't get the manacles off. I don't think it's possible for players to successfully fight her. The other two possible locations for that equipment are easier, but still miles and miles above the recommended CR for lvl1. So it occurred to me -- are players in OotA MEANT to get their starting equipment back? Going for it feels like a trap, and since OotA is so much about anxiety and vulnerability I wondered whether maybe this was an intentional choice. I'm tempted to just leave out the trap element entirely and tell players their equipment was sold off -- make them scavenge every body for weapons and celebrate when they find a rusty shortsword, you know? Have them turn random sticks they find into clubs, and craft simple leather armor from the skin of an animal they find. It's dangerous, but no more dangerous than running into a CR8 fight at lvl1 with no equipment and with your hands literally tied behind your back. But maybe I'm reading it wrong. Maybe clever players have ways of getting their stuff back, or maybe Ilvara ain't all that. How have y'all been dealing with this? "

A couple of days ago, I posted my original draft for my homebrew of a [Warlock subclass, the Symbiote Patron](URL Thank you all for your help in tweaking and modifying it to balance it out and flesh it out more thematically. Presenting, the [Revised Symbiote Patron for the Warlock](URL Changelog: * I modified the extended spell list to be less effective on others and more focused on the symbiote and its host. * The Symbiote is such an imporant part of the subclass, the patron being attached to you the whole time, so I really wanted to focus on what the symbiote was all about. I created a table on the Symbiote Purpose, its reason for wanting survival and goals for its existance, and the Symbiote Dependency, for an alien creature is attached to you, it would affect your cravings and personality in some way. Additionally, I posted on how the symbiote might be physically attached or bonded with your warlock. * After many of you had pointed out, I decided that Primal Savagery and Thorn Whip are thematic enough to the Symbiote, and making Unarmed Attacks like a Monk aren't necessary. I upped the power those cantrips do at level 6 and 14. And instead of creating claws, the Weapon from Pact of the Blade is created from the Symbiotic Armor, so you cannot be disarmed. * Another point all of you have made, I decied to not front load the Symbiotic Armor, and giving it a significant upgrade at level 6, but still making it powerful with vulnerabilities at level 1. I added piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing resistence, while adding a fire and thunder vulnerability, like the Venom symbiote from the comic books. I made the AC = 13 + Charisma to allow for strength and charisma builds, and shifted the movement speed increase to level 6 with advantage on dexterity saving throws. The number of uses of Symbiotic Armor now is Charisma Modifier of times per long rest (minimum of 1). * I combined the previous level 10 and 14 features into one. I still don't believe it is too overpowered, but I would love to hear from you all as to balancing the power vs the thematic influence of the class. * With bumping some traits from level 1 to level 6 and shifting level 10 and 14 together, I made Mnemokinetics a level 10 feature, a free cast once per long rest that increases in power the more you level. Thematically, I think its perfect and although at level 18, you'd have the ability cast this spell at level 9 and a mystic arcanum at level 9, this spell would at least not be busted and break the game at that point. Once again, thank you for your recomendations and I would lvoe to hear from you more as to any changes I should make now."

One of my players wants to play a Grave Domain Cleric. Looking over the sub-class, the thematic concept seems really awesome, especially for CoS, but the mechanics of it are... bleh. I've come up with some minor changes to it to buff it up a little bit because it feels like one of, if not THE worst domains in my opinion. Let me know what you think and if all of it combined is too OP. Circle of Mortality: Heals the highest number possible for the spell **multiplied by two** when the creature is at 0 hit points (instead of just the highest number alone). Eyes of the Grave: **May** tell about the creatures capabilities and identity. Path to the Grave: The creature has vulnerability to all damage until the end of your next turn (not just one attack).

134,vulnerability,dndnext,Can the White Dragon ice wall Lair Action be shaped?,1,7eec8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/7eec8l/can_the_white_dragon_ice_wall_lair_action_be/,2017-11-21 13:13:31,"The MM has the following listed as under the list of Lair Actions for a White Dragon: &gt;The dragon creates an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space; appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies. The wording on this power is a little vague. The specification of 30 ft long and high, 1ft thick implies a set shape, but the specification of 10 ft sections implies that the wall can perhaps be shaped to, for example, trap / surround a creature. As DM, I could easily house rule this, but I'd like opinions. What should I consider RAW to be here? "
135,vulnerability,dndnext,Lore Wizard in-deph discussion and fixes.,3,7fix1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/7fix1i/lore_wizard_indeph_discussion_and_fixes/,2017-11-26 10:33:41,"Let me start by saying that absolutely love the concept of Lore Wizard. A wizard that disregards all magic schools and traditions because of his pure love for all magic and knowledge. I think this opens really good options for roleplay since the character isn't really limited by any of the restrictions or stigmas of the school they belong to. (The classic example being a Necromancer *usually* seen as evil, or at least not of good alignment.) You could have a character who wants to spread knowledge to the world for the good of people or have them reveal terrible arcane secrets to paesants so they can overthrow the government through magic and actually be relevant with the type/archetype the character is. A character with deep, profound knowledge of magic and its implications, a trained mind that can recall information at any given moment and a brain as massive as a whole database that is able to find its result at lighting-speed as the world seems to slow around you. &amp;nbsp; That said, I do understand that some of the abilities can be abused pretty heavily, but I want to make a disclaimer here to clarify my standpoint: **I speak as a player that has a healthy and loving relatioship with my DM, and we both try to better each other every session. I personally try to play with the least amount of metagaming possible, both from me and my party. As such, I will never look up monsters, items and such during sessions unless my DM tells me to do so, and if I happen to know the creature, I play based on what my character knows and not based on what I know. As such, please understand that what I'm gonna write here I write assuming that people don't look up stats, metagame or abuse the game willingly.** Considering all of this, I've been heavily disappointed with the War Wizard and I think that the Lore Wizard is a really interesting concept, so I'd like to propose some minor tweaks and opinions to make the Lore Wizard fair for everyone and give my reasons for them. I'll try to tweak the class with some small changes here and there without changing the general idea of the archetype, because I really like it. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Lore Mastery**: *Starting at 2nd level, you become a compendium of knowledge on a vast array of topics. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion skill if you are proficient in that skill. In addition, your analytical abilities are so well-honed that your initiative in combat can be driven by mental agility, rather than physical agility. When you roll initiative, it is either an Intelligence check or a Dexterity check for you (your choice).* &amp;nbsp; I think this gives the Wizard some really interesting options while being extremely fitting to its own idea of ""savant that dedicates his whole being to knowledge"". You basically get Expertise like a Bard, but the trade-off is that it is only in skills that are picked for you and are relevant to the class. The idea here is that you invest so heavily in your study that you forego everything else. If Wizards are book-worms, you are the book-worm of the biggest tome that ever existed. The second part of this class feature is substantially less powerful and it's basically a small boost in initiative for Wizards, which is honestly nothing major. Almost every class wants a high DEX score and it's one of the better, if not the best, stat in 5e. I would say that a comfortable spot to have DEX is around 16, so you would gain 2 initiative overall (considering that all Wizards want to get 20 INT as soon as possible). Compared to the War Wizard's raw bonus to Initiative equal to his INT modifier, this is almost not worth considering. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Spell Secrets**: *At 2nd level, you master the first in a series of arcane secrets uncovered by your extensive studies. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage, you can substitute that damage type with one other type from that list (you can change only one damage type per casting of a spell). You replace one energy type for another by altering the spells formula as you cast it. When you cast a spell with a spell slot and the spell requires a saving throw, you can change the saving throw from one ability score to another of your choice. Once you change a saving throw in this way, you cant do so again until you finish a short or long rest.* &amp;nbsp; Your deep knowledge of magic itself allows you to change the nature of spells to a certain extent. You basically have a whole database of information and are able to mix and reshape the formulas with your ability to re-think all that information. Marvelous, just marvelous. If you have ever seen a scene where the character visualizes all the options in his head and considers them all in the blink of an eye, choosing the one he think is the right one, *that* is how I imagine this ability, which is in all honestly so fitting. Now, many have pointed that changing damage can be abused by spamming changing the damage type to Force, so you can ignore every resistance with every spell. And the fix for that is: You can't change the damage type to Force. We all know that Force damage is by far the strongest damage type since it works on pretty much anything, always. So you just remove force damage and the problem is solved. Many have also pointed out that you could abuse Vulnerabilities by changing damage. While it is true that you could change the damage type to the Vulnerability of the creature in question, there are only 20 creatures in the whole manual that have vulnerabilities. Also, your character shouldn't know that a creature is vulnerable to a certain damage type unless they have the actual knowledge for it. For example, if your character has spent time in a temple praying with clerics and learning about the undead, they would *probably* know that Undead are somewhat weak to holy power and possibly Radiant damage, but your character would have to know about it. Another example would be if the creature is so obviously vulnerable to a certain element that even a child could understand that, such as a Fire Elemental being weak to water. That's such basic knowledge that even a child would know about it, and as such is acceptable. Otherwise, a player choosing a damage type just because they saw in the monster manual that the monster is Vulnerable to that damage type is not a valid reason. That player is metagaming and choosing to accept that is the fault of the group, not an inherent problem with the class. &amp;nbsp; The second part of the feature allows you to change the saving throw of one of your spells, *once per short rest or long rest*. That is indeed powerful, but you can do it only once per short rest, as we already said. People have said that this can be abused with Hold Person and other Hold spells. This can easily be fixed by making it so that it only changes the **initial saving throw of the spell**. This would mean that, for example, you could cast the Hold Person spell and have it be a Charisma saving throw when you cast it. Every save the creatures make after the initial one will revert to the original saving throw, so it would return to be Wisdom. Some people have pointed out that this would make no sense in the context of the effect for the various spells, for example changing from Charisma to Wisdom. I think this could be easily fixed if the player is willing to actually explain the inventiveness of what they casted. For example, Hold Person could have an initial Constitution saving throw because you create a vaporous invisible toxin that intoxicates the blood and mind of the target when they first inhale it. After that, every turn they have to struggle to free themselves from the influence of the intoxicating effects of the toxin on their mind, reverting it back to Wisdom. And to take back the point that I made about damage types: If a player abuses the lowest saving throws of a creature and their character doesn't have a valid reason for knowing such weakness, they are metagaming, not ""optimizing their class"". &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Alchemical Casting**: *At 6th level, you learn to augment spells in a variety of ways. When you cast a spell with a spell slot, you can expend one additional spell slot to augment its effects for this casting, mixing the raw stuff of magic into your spell to amplify it. The effect depends on the spell slot you expend.* *An additional 1st-level spell slot can increase the spells raw force. If you roll damage for the spell when you cast it, increase the damage against every target by 2d10 force damage. If the spell can deal damage on more than one turn, it deals this extra force damage only on the turn you cast the spell.* *An additional 2nd-level spell slot can increase the spells range. If the spells range is at least 30 feet, it becomes 1 mile.* *An additional 3rd-level spell slot can increase the spells potency. Increase the spells save DC by 2.* &amp;nbsp; I think this is a wonderful ability, but let's get to the numbers and fixes since there's a lot to discuss. First: *Spending an additional 1st-level spell slot*. 2d10 is a lot of damage, but you are sacrificing a spell slot for it, a spell slot that could be used for a whole different spell that could possibly do other stuff or deal just as much damage. People tend to overlook 1st level spells but some of the best value spells in the whole game can be found there. Shield, Charm Person, Comprehend Languages, Tasha's Hideous Laughter, Find Familiar are some of the great spells you could use for that spell slot instead. Don't get me wrong, it's still strong, but you are still burning resources for it. You could lower the damage to 3d6 and it would still be fine if you think 2d10 is too much, but this doesn't scale as well as you think at higher levels. Also, the 2d10 damage increase should be of the same damage type of the spell you cast, and not Force damage. Second: *Spending an additional 2nd-level spell slot*. Increasing the range of a 30-foot-range spell is powerful, but you have to keep in mind something: Line of sight. The majority of spells specify *""A target/creature you see within range""*. You have to see the target to hit him with the spell. If by some means you see the target from 1 mile away, then good for you, because you have probably put in some good effort to achieve that. Otherwise, if you are burning a 2nd-level spell slot because you are just out of range of the target, remember that you are burning a 2nd-level spell slot just to enhance the range of a spell by a couple dozen feet or something along the line. It is indeed strong, but it's far, far from being free. As a matter of fact, quite the opposite. Third: *Spending an additional 3rd-level spell slot*. Increasing the DC of the spell by 2 is good indeed and can be clutch if played properly. You can do amazing things with this and tip the scales slightly in your favor, but the cost for it is heavy. 3rd level spells have some of the best spells in the whole game, such as Fear, Fireball, Haste and Fly. And you are giving up one of your three daily casts of these spells for a DC increase of 2. People generally compare Alchemical Casting to the Sorcerer's Metamagic, and with good reason. They both empower the spells of the caster in various ways. But people seem to forget something when talking about Metamagic and Alchemical Casting: 1. Metamagic consumes a different resource made just for that, while Wizards have to spend spell slots for it. 2. Sorcerers choose 2 Metamagic options and end with 4 of their choosing, while Wizards stay with a total of 3. 3. Overall, Alchemical Casting is weaker than Metamagic by quite a bit. 4. You have nothing that compares to Twinned Spell or Quickened Spell, which are two of the strongest Metamagic and make Sorcerers a force to be wrecking with. Comparing the 3 ways you can change spells with Alchemical Casting with their Metamagic ""counterparts"": - Empowered Spell can be used after you have seen the rolls you ended up with, and can end up changing the damage of the spell immensely. It also only costs 1 Sorcery point. - Distant Spell's effect is weaker than the 1-mile-radius you get by sacrificing a 2nd-level spell slot, but you also only spend 1 Sorcery point for it, making it more cost-efficient. - Heightened Spell is one of the best Metamagic effect out there, and it is mathematically better than the spell's save DC increase of 2. *Rolling one million d20s with a straight roll has total average of 10.50 as result. Rolling again one million d20s with disadvantage results in 7.17 as the average result.* This means that the disadvantage makes the average score of the roll 2.33 lower than a straight roll on average. I think that overall Alchemical Casting is a very good feature, but it's still worse than Metamagic and rightfuly so. Sorcerers are all about changing spells to their linking, you are not. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Prodigious Memory**: *At 10th level, you have attained a greater mastery of spell preparation. As a bonus action, you can replace one spell you have prepared with another spell from your spellbook. You cant use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.* &amp;nbsp; I haven't seen much complaint about this feature and I'm not surprised. As far as flavor goes, this is the creme de la creme for Lore Wizards. Just imagine this: You are in the middle of a raging battle, with your allies shouting and trying to organize themselves and they yell out what they are gonna do to take down this awful abomination. Then you have the ""Eureka!"" moment and it all clicks; your mind trained in remembering the arcane knowledge and as you rush faster than light towards the spell you need with your brain, the world slows around you. This is what I think about when I read this feature. While you can pull of some really clutch moments with this feature. Overall, I consider this good but okay, it's not overwhelming. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Master of Magic**: *At 14th level, your knowledge of magic allows you to duplicate almost any spell. As a bonus action, you can call to mind the ability to cast one spell of your choice from any classs spell list. The spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, you mustnt have it prepared, and you follow the normal rules for casting it, including expending a spell slot. If the spell isnt a wizard spell, it counts as a wizard spell when you cast it. The ability to cast the spell vanishes from your mind when you cast it or when the current turn ends. You cant use this feature again until you finish a long rest.* &amp;nbsp; Once a day, you can cast a spell of your choice of your choosing from any class. In my opinion, Wizards don't really need this for any spell and this becomes the ""OH SHIT OUR CLERIC IS DEAD AND OUR BARD DOESN'T KNOW REVIVIFY"" feature. Generally, Wizards have the biggest spell list and the only thing they are missing is healing or ways to bring back people from the dead. That's what this is for, since you already have everything else. Also, it's worth remembering that Wish is only 3 levels away when you get this feature, and you still have to cast the spell expending the slot for it and using all the components for it. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In conclusion, the Lore Wizard is something that I absolutely love and I'm extremely disappointed that WOTC decided to discard an idea with such potential. The mechanics are fun, interesting and they mix perfectly with the flavor of the class and the general idea of this Wizard archetype being the biggest book-worm of all. I also adore the idea that while all the other wizards specialize in a type of spells, the Lore Wizard is a Jack of All trades but master of none of them. &amp;nbsp; I didn't propose big changes or anything, just small tweaks to types of damage and small restrictions here and there, but I hope I gave good reasons why I think only those were necessary.

I have a player that wants to use a wild magic barbarian at my table, but I'm trying to make it into an actual subclass as opposed to just making a magic item that does wild magic surges. Can you guys give me your reaction on the proposed subclass idea? Does it seem unbalanced? I tried to keep it in line with Path of the Totem Warrior. Bear totem and Eagle totem grants some incredible bonuses, so I figured these should be decently powerful as well. Thoughts? **Path of the Chaos Weave** Some barbarians have a rage so great that it shatters reality in places, opening unstable rifts of wild magic. Whether they're a freak of nature, from a cursed bloodline, or got caught in a magical mishap is irrelevant; when in pain or under great emotional discord, reality can snap under the weight of the barbarians frenzied mind. **Fraying Threads** Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, the depths of your rage and extreme physical exertion awaken an unstable connection with the weave. While raging, after you attack or are hit by a magical effect, the DM can have you roll a d20. If you roll a 1, roll on the Chaotic Magic Surge table. **Forcing Fates Hand** Starting at 3rd level, as a bonus action you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to force an enemy within 60 feet to have disadvantage on one attack, ability check or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Chaotic Magic Surge table immediately after you attack or take damage. You then regain the use of this feature. **See what is not Seen** At 6th level, your unconscious connection to the magical weave allows you to sense things others cannot. You can feel the weave bend around you while raging, allowing you to see invisible creatures within melee range of you. **Tearing the Weave** Beginning at 10th level, if a creature within melee range of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to overload your rage and break the weave around you. Your rage ends on using this ability. This has the effect of the spell Antimagic Field, centered on the ground you stood on at the moment of the reaction. The effect lasts for one round, then disappears as the weave repairs itself. This can be used once per short rest. **The Fabric of Reality** At 14th level, as a bonus action, you can sacrifice an equal amount of movement to instead teleport up to a maximum of 30 ft in any direction to an unoccupied space you can see. **Chaotic Magic Surge Table** 01-02 Roll on this table at the start of each of your turns for the next minute, ignoring this result on subsequent rolls. 03-04 For the next minute, you can see any invisible creature if you have line of sight to it. 05-06 A modron chosen and controlled by the DM appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. 07-08 You cast fireball as a 3rd-level spell centered on yourself. 09-10 You cast magic missile as a 5th-level spell 11-12 Roll a d10. Your height changes by a number of inches equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you shrink. If the roll is even, you grow. 13-14 You cast confusion centered on yourself. 15-16 For the next minute, you regain 5 hit points at the start of each of your turns. 17-18 You grow a long beard made of feathers that remains until you sneeze, at which point the feathers explode out from your face. 19-20 You cast grease centered on yourself. 21-22 You have advantage on your next saving throw. 23-24 Your skin turns a vibrant shade of blue. A remove curse spell can end this effect. 25-26 An eye appears on your forehead for the next minute. During that time, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 27-28 For the next minute, if you take the attack action, you may make an additional attack as a bonus action. 29-30 You teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see. 31-32 You are transported to the Astral Plane for the next minute, after which time you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. 33-34 Maximize the damage of your next attack that hits in the next minute. 35-36 Roll a d10. Your age changes by a number of years equal to the roll. If the roll is odd, you get younger (minimum 1 year old). If the roll is even, you get older. 37-38 1d6 flumphs controlled by the DM appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are frightened of you. They vanish after 1 minute. 39-40 You regain 2d10 hit points. 41-42 You turn into a potted plant until the start of your next turn. While a plant, you are incapacitated and have vulnerability to all damage. If you drop to 0 hit points, your pot breaks, and your form reverts. 43-44 For the next minute, you can teleport up to 20 feet as a bonus action on each of your turns. 45-46 You cast levitate on yourself. 47-48 A unicorn controlled by the DM appears in a space within 5 feet of you, then disappears 1 minute later. 49-50 You can't speak for the next minute. Whenever you try, pink bubbles float out of your mouth. 51-52 A spectral shield hovers near you for the next minute, granting you a +2 bonus to AC and immunity to magic missile. 53-54 You are immune to being intoxicated by alcohol for the next 5d6 days. 55-56 Your hair falls out but grows back within 24 hours. 57-58 For the next minute, any flammable object you touch that isn't being worn or carried by another creature bursts into flame. 59-60 You regain 1 use of rage. 61-62 For the next minute, you must shout when you speak. 63-64 You cast fog cloud centered on yourself. 65-66 Up to three creatures you choose within 30 feet of you take 4d10 lightning damage. 67-68 You are frightened by the nearest creature until the end of your next turn. 69-70 Each creature within 30 feet of you becomes invisible for the next minute. The invisibility ends on a creature when it attacks or casts a spell. 71-72 You gain resistance to all damage for the next minute. 73-74 A random creature within 60 feet of you becomes poisoned for 1d4 hours. 75-76 You glow with bright light in a 30-foot radius for the next minute. Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you is blinded until the end of its next turn. 77-78 You cast polymorph on yourself. If you fail the saving throw you turn into a sheep for the spell's duration. 79-80 Illusory butterflies and flower petals flutter in the air within 10 feet of you for the next minute. 81-82 You can take one additional action immediately. 83-84 Each creature within 30 feet of you takes 1d10 necrotic damage. You regain hit points equal to the sum of the you necrotic damage dealt. 85-86 You cast mirror image. 87-88 You cast fly on a random creature within 60 feet of you. 89-90 You become invisible for the next minute. 91-92 If you die within the next minute, you immediately come back to life as if by the reincarnate spell. 93-94 Your size increases by one size category for the next minute. 95-96. You and all creatures within 30 feet of you gain vulnerability to piercing damage for the next minute. 97-98 You are surrounded by faint, ethereal music for the next minute. 99-100 You cast Time Stop on yourself.

139,vulnerability,dndnext,Flavoring Spells: Damage Type &amp; Visuals,2,770yql,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/770yql/flavoring_spells_damage_type_visuals/,2017-10-18 06:27:28,"Its come up in my game and with other discussions about flavoring spells and abilities to better fit a theme and style of play that a PC is going for. We've had a few mixed results. One person I talked with said that RAW is RAW and by no means should anything be changed. If a spell says it looks like X, Y, or Z then its only X, Y, or Z. Others have been more flexible, so I thought I'd go for a broader audiance. What are the thoughts about flavoring the visual affect and/or damage type of spells &amp; abilities? I've provided some generic examples and my thoughts. I'm curious what everyone else's thoughts on them are. Example 1: Grog the Wise, a Barbarian decides to take the Magic Initiate feat. He chooses Druid, taking Thorn Whip as a cantrip. Grog's player wants to flavor it as a spectral chain that errupts from his hand,piercing the target, and pulling them towards him. For the material, he wants to use a link of chain on his manacles instead of the thorned stem. Example 2: Asle, a female sorcerer took Earth Tremor, but wants it to be flavored as her freezing the ground, changing the potential difficult terrain to always make it difficult terrain. Example 3: Chestnut, a human monk following the way of the Sun Soul wants to change the damage of Searing Arc Strike (Burning Hands) from fire to Radiant damage. He wants this to be done since all of the other damage dealt by the Sun Soul abilities are Radiant and it feels off for one to be Fire. Example 4: Ku'Jo Starjoy, a half-elf monk following the way of the Sun Soul wants to theme the Radiant Sun Bolts as his spectral fists pummeling the opponent. Doing so, he thinks the damage should be Force instead of Radiant. Example 5: A brooding Arcane Triskter Rogue took the Shocking Grasp cantrip. He insists that his jabs with it are so sharp it pierces targets and as such wants it to deal xd4 piecing damage (x is the number of dice it uses for the base damage) My thoughts are as followed. Example 1 is fine, its thematic and has no combat impact what so ever (other than a Barbarian maining Wisdom). Example 2 is a mix. The thematic effect is fine, but the auto-difficult terrain might need a duration (it melts) or another ground type. Example 3 is a no-go since there is no thematic or story purpose for the damage change. It also grants a benifit as more things resist Fire damage than Radiant damage. Example 4 is a different story than 3. It has a thematic purpose (his punches) and trades 4 resistances and a vulnerability (Radiant damage) for 1 immunity (Force), so I'd allow it. Example 5 is a total no and was provided was an example that was presented to me in another discussion as ""if you allow A then you allow B"" argument."

Lycanthropes have a an aversion to fire and silver. You have damage vulnerability to silvered weapons. If you have taken damage from a silvered weapon, you may not regain hitpoints for one minute. If you take fire damage, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of your next turn. Many lycanthropes take on slightly to moderately more wild or animal-like features. Their ears may grow to be pointed, they may become considerably more hairy, or their teeth and nails may appear more akin to fangs and claws than an uninfected member of their race. They may also develope apetites for foods unusual to their normal diet, such as a vegetarian suddenly craving raw meat. The tumultuous union of the primal spirit with their own may cause them to be prone to heightened emotional states, particularly aggressionor jealousy. Select d6 (or 4) from the following table and apply those traits to your character at the time of infection. -Pointed or rounded ears -Dramatically increased facial and/or body hair -Claw-like finger and toe nails -Fang-like teeth -Rounded or finer facial features -Appetite at strange hours or for strange foods -Body weight increases or decreases by 50% -Heightened aggression -Heightened paranoia/jealousy -When you sleep, you sleep hard. Nothing short of a hammer to the head can wake you. -All of your emotional responses are more extreme -You move unnaturally quietly -Your shadow appears to be that of the animal that bit you Primal Shapeshifting: Those infected with the curse of Lycanthropy are subject to the primal urges of the animal spirit within. When suffering damage that takes them below 25% hitpoints, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fly into a frenzied state. On their next turn, they transform into their Primal (animal) form. While in this state, they cannot discern friend from foe, and will attack the nearest creature to them. This frenzied state lasts one minute, or until they are incapacitated, during which time, the player has no control over his/her actions. This transformation consumes Shifter Points as if they had willingly transformed. The DC for this transformation is 12 minus your Proficency bonus Those who have been infected for some measure of time may be able to transform at will a number of times per day. You gain a pool of Shifter Points which equals your proficiency bonus. You may spend these points to transform into your Primal form, or a Hybrid of your Natural and Primal forms with costs as detailed below, and regain all expended Shifter Points after a Long Rest. Primal form: 1 point Hybrid form: 2 points Your Primal form uses the statistics detailed in the Moonster Manual (or other source material as relevant), with the following exceptions: -You retain your hit point total as normal if it is greater than that of the beast -You have Darkvision with a range of of 60 feet -You have Resistance to non-magical Piercing damage and Slashing damage -You maintain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores and personality. -Your movement speed is increased by 15 feet -If your beast has the Multi-attack feature, you must choose a single one of those attacks to use, unless you have the Extra Attacks from another source (such as a Class Feature or Feat), if your to-hit bonus would be greater using your Proficiency bonus plus the creature's ability bonus, than the to-hit bonus outlined in the beast's stat block, you may use that instead. Primal animals use the following stat blocks: -Lion/Tiger: Saber-toothed Tiger, MM 336 [DEX+2] -Boar: Giant Boar, MM 323 [STR +2] -Shark: Hunter Shark, MM 330 [STR+2] -Bear: Cave Bear, MM 334 [STR+2] -Rat/Badger: Giant Weasel, MM 329 **ware-badgers in Primal Form gain a Burrow speed equal to their movement, ware-rats gain a Climbing speed equal to their move speed [DEX+2] -Wolf: Dire Wolf, MM 321 [DEX+2] Hybrid Form: Shapeshifting into the Hybrid Form is a strenuous and difficult task, but affords many of the benefits of both Natural and Primal forms. As a bonus action, you may transform into a Hybrid of your Natural and Primal forms. In Hybrid Form, you gain the benefit of any enhanced senses and enhanced movement types (such as Swimming, or Climbing) mentioned in the beast's associated stat block. You also retain the ability to speak, all damage resistences and vulnerabilities, the ability to wear armor and wield weapons and shields, cast spells, use all race and class features and perform all actions available to you in your Natural form. You also have increased hit point regeneration equal to your proficiency bonus per round (this calculation is used instead of the other calculation mentioned earlier). Additionally, while in Hybrid Form, you gain an Ability Score bonus as shown in brackets on the chart above. The Transformation lasts for one minute and may be exteded for additional minutes at a cost of one shifter point per minute. Damage which takes you below 25% hit points must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fly into a frenzy for the remainder of their transformation. All attacks made while frenzied have Advantage. The DC for this saving throw is 15 minus your proficiency bonus. When returning from Primal or Hybrid form to your Natural form, there is a chance you will suffer a level of Exhaustion. Roll a 2d0. On a 4 or less, you suffer one level of exhaustion. If you are rendered unconscious while Shifted, you when you are restored to consciousness, make this roll with disadvantage. Forever Restless: Whenever you take a Long Rest, there is a chance that the primal spirit within will prevent you from waking refreshed. When you have taken a Long Rest, you regain use of all expended Class and Race Features as normal, but when regerating Hit Points, first roll a d20. On a 10 or less, you regenerate only half of your missing hit points, up to a maximum of half of your hit point total. If you are at or above half of your hit points remaining, you regenerate no hit points. with any result, you regain expended hit dice as per normal Long Rest rules. Curse Breaker: Once cursed with Lycanthropy, the curse can belifted before the following dawn using a Remove Curse spell or a Paladin's Lay On Hands with a cost of 25pts from the Paladin's healing pool. After the first dawn, the cursed has until the end of the next full moon to kill the beast that cursed it, or the curse is permanent. Until the first full moon after infection, they show no measurable symptoms. On the night of the first full moon after being bitten, the Lycanthrope shifts into his/her Primal form as listed in the Monster Manual (see above chart) including alignment, and behaves in a way fitting that alignment. The following dawn, the lycanthrope returns to their Natural form with no recallection of their behavior or whereabouts the previous night. When they wake, if they were unaware of their affliction, they may make a Wisdom check to recall their actions. The DC for this check is 15 minus proficiency bonus. If they fail the check, they go about their business none the wiser to their affliction. They may make this check again after each transformation, and until they become aware, may not willfully shapeshift using their lycanthropic abilities. They do, however, gain all advantages and disadvantages outlined above after the first full moon. The idea of immensities for players (even with a heavy cost) is something that does not appeal to me in the slightest, which is why no immensities. I am playing with the idea of damage vulnerability to fire as well this would be applied to a player race. thoughts about balancing it would be appreciated. "
141,vulnerability,dndnext,An Optimists Guide to (Subclasses in) Xanathars Guide to Everything,89,7d1gfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/7d1gfx/an_optimists_guide_to_subclasses_in_xanathars/,2017-11-15 14:55:02,"Well Ive seen a few of these, with many proposing concerns about things being underpowered or overpowered. Im here to offer my thoughts as more of an optimist. Let me go ahead and step in here and say Im not a white knight for Wizards of the Coast. I do give them the benefit of the doubt because after years of experiencing this edition I havent seen any major breaks in balance. I simply trust them more than I do any one Redditor (including myself!) or any group of them, especially so early with this product. Having said that, I have my concerns and even an idea or two for those that have issues with such and such feature. Those will be voiced too. I plan to talk about pros, cons, balance concerns, and fun ideas I have for characters reading through this. Lets jump in. ##Barbarian: **Ancestral Guardian**: Bear Totems are still the kings and queens of damage resistance, being far more difficult to take down. Ancestral Guardians are the other side of that coin, being extremely potent at keeping the *other* members of the party alive instead of just themselves. The flavor is so freaking cool, and I love how this translates into the mechanics. You literally can see how the spirits of the ancestors are harrying your foes and protecting your allies, focusing your enemies on facing their chosen champion. Flat damage reduction is fantastic as a reaction, and later on you get to punish your enemy even more by having the spirits automatically damage the source of the reduced damage. Oh and that level 10 utility feature is amazing. Awesome scouting potential that fits perfectly and interestingly with the theme and power set. **Storm Herald**: Ive never been super excited about this one but its been a popular option from what Ive seen. An auto damage aura is really nice, but its not friendly. The lightning one is more targeted, but less potent overall, I feel. And the temp HP one is actually pretty cool. Some more hit points is nice for everyone. The secondary features give you a damage resistance and the third feature spreads that resistance to friends, which helps out the auto-damaging fire aura some. And the final feature grants some cool stuff as well, like even more fire damage, knocking an opponent over as with a wave, and freezing your opponents in place. Very cool idea, your rage literally invites the environment to storm and rage with you. This is the Land Druid Variant of Barbarians, which is neat, taking a portion of the land or environment with you fight. What really hurts this is the bonus action to activate the aura each round. Man, that stings. When comparing it to all of the other available options, it seems like the low man on the totem pole. Still viable, certainly, and cool flavor, but the effects of just about every other subclass seem stronger. **Zealot**: Ill admit that this has always been my favorite and I personally think it might be the mechanically strongest of these three. This essentially adds a mini-Smite feature on your rage, but its every single turn, and scaled reasonably well. Great single target damage feature. The next bit is flat-out amazing in any party with a cleric or access to one or anyone with resurrection spells. One of the biggest built in balance factors for resurrection is wealthy material components that can be rare to find if your DM or group is unhappy with how trivial death can seem in 5e. This takes that out of the equation. Its a really neat flavorful ability that you hope doesnt have to be used much, but its stellar when it does come into play. Zealous Presence is quite fantastic as well. Its only one round, but advantage is strong, and giving it to all of your allies is superb. The final ability is another defensive ability, but really it just lets you keep trucking after 0 HP. Again, strong flavor and unique mechanics. I think of Valkyries, Warriors Empowered by the gods to defy death and usher in those warriors to the exalted halls of Valhalla, or an immortal warrior resurrected every few centuries when a major war breaks out by a certain civilization. ##Bards: **College of Glamour**: I really love this one. I know that Crawford and Mearls seem to say that David Bowie was The inspiration for this, and I totally see that, but all I can think of when I read this is a Disney Princess. Ive seen homebrew of a princess class before, and this makes me feel like this has cool features that help with that. The first feature seems deceptively strong. You get a small temp hp buffer (and it scales with level), but you *also* get to basically reposition the party. They can move up to their speed without incurring opportunity attacks out of turn. This is notable because again, it affects multiple people with one use, which usually Bardic Inspiration cannot do. The other level 3 feature is amazing if you can get a chance to perform in front of important NPCs. A chance to charm and they dont have any clue you tried to do that to them if it doesnt work. Very nice feature that encourages performances and roleplay. Mantle of Majesty is neat because *command* is a great spell and it allows you to use it for several rounds in a row, while still having access to cantrips at least. The 14th level feature is really cool to me as well. Again, I think of a princess or Prince Charming type who becomes so beautiful and enchanting that its literally hard to attack them, and even if you do you are more susceptible to their magic afterward. Very cool capstone. **College of Swords**: I thought this would step on the Valor Bards toes, but I think this comes at it from a pretty different angle. Its a much better melee combatant, for one. A Fighting Style and the ability to use your weapons as a spellcasting focus really round out the initial features. The Flourishes are nice extra damage and great secondary effects. Extra AC is going to be the standard, but forced movement is super strong too in the right situation. Post level 5, these resources get a big boost by recharging on a short rest instead of long. Extra Attack is necessary for melee combatant, but its still nice to have, though a level behind. And of course your 14th level feature makes it so you dont have to use Bardic Inspiration and split resources at all! Overall a nice package, by making the Bard a competent melee fighter as long as they have Inspiration, and as they level they can rely on spells to help round your melee skills out or provide a little more support. **College of Whispers**: This is an interesting one. You can activate Sneak Attack for a use of Bardic Inspiration, essentially. Thats pretty cool. I guess its pretty nice for sneaking up on people and Bards have spells like *invisibility* and *greater invisibility* to help that style out. Im a little unsure how to take Words of Terror. Its a really neat and flavorful ability, but frightened as a status effect doesnt seem to be as useful in non-combat situations. And if the target is attacked or damaged, the effect ends. So Im just unclear on where this one goes. Maybe someone can help me there. The 6th level feature is honestly just cool as hell. You basically get to steal a creatures entire appearance *and* some basic knowledge that the creature held after you kill it. The potential for infiltration here is staggering and thats really awesome. The capstone is interesting because it can solve both a social and combat encounter depending on one save, if you can stop you comrades from murdering your target by that point. Super cool and super strong, especially in the hands of a creative player. ##Cleric: **Forge**: As Mearls said, Why wasnt this in the Players Handbook? Its an excellent concept and theme that I feel has been executed beautifully. Youre the guy who can augment weapons and armor. You can create or forge just about anything. Youre perfectly fitted to wade into battle and be an unbreakable anvil that your enemies crush themselves on. Fire damage resistance and eventual immunity, and nonmagical physical damage resistance really make you durable. Divine Strike with fire damage really helps you wade into battle with a forgehammer *spiritual weapon* and just go to town. Its got all tools you could really want to fulfill this concept. **Grave**: This one surprised me with how interested I was. I really like the idea of preserving death, and not viewing death as evil. The mechanics are super neat too. You can help your enemies die, and prevent your allies from feeling its cold touch before their time. More of a caster, than a melee cleric, but thats a good contrast to the DMG Death Domain. *Toll the dead* was practically made for this subclass. Theyre an excellent support class with the ability to stop dying companions at range, hand out single-attack vulnerability, and stop critical hits from happening. Later, when anything dies they can use some of that energy to heal! Super fun, super flavorful, and it adds to that support role that the class is known for by interacting well with the theme upon which it is based. ##Druid: **Circle of Dreams**: I fall in love with this one the more I read it and think about it. The first feature grants some fantastic extra healing. The range is massive, its a bonus action, and its a separate resource than spell slots. The 6th level feature is really pretty nice too, by making your rest areas a tad safer, especially if you still have someone on watch duty. The 10 level feature is pretty strong. Free *misty step*, up to Wisdom modifier times per day, with better range. It that wasnt enough, you can also grant *misty step* to a friend instead. Simply awesome. And the capstone... Crawford talked about it in the video and I thought How cool! but its honestly even better than I thought. The option to use the special teleportation circle is great, but *scrying* and *dream* as options too is just super useful, super cool icing on an already delicious cake. No spell slots or material components needed, all at the very low cost of finishing a short rest! Only once per day, but still. That may be my favorite single new feature in this book. All around an amazing package that really evokes a spellcaster immersed in the feywild and focused on dreams. The flavor also reminds me of a Dalish Keeper, for those who know Dragon Age lore. **Circle of the Shepherd**: I personally want to make one of these soon. Summoning can be tedious, but I hope to find a way to do it that wont muddy things too much. Free *speak with animals* is pretty awesome, and an extra language to boot. The spirit companion is very cool too. Mostly, I cant see why you would choose either Unicorn or Bear over Hawk, but there might be some niche situations where you really want more health. Free advantage on one attack per round is pretty sweet, to say the least. Mighty Summoner is why were here, though. Druids already have by far the best summoning spells and this just makes it all the better. You can use this to great effect right away with *conjure animals*, and you get woodland beings and eventually *conjure fey* for when you want to send a rampaging magical T-Rex at something late game. Extra HP and never having to worry about damage resistances or immunities for your summons is just the bees knees. The 10th level feature means when youre using your totem and summoning cool shit (which will be constantly), they essentially have regeneration on top of their other goodies. And the capstone on this one is also just super damn cool and super effective, if you need it. Its a bit of a bummer that you have to get knocked unconscious to see it happen, but Pelor help those that manage to knock you out. You summon four CR2 creatures with buffed hp to avenge you and protect you. This is just awesome. It also explicitly states that you get to choose the creatures this time, if your DM is strict about RAW for some of the other spells. ##Fighter: **Arcane Archer**: This ones pretty controversial, huh? Lore is a really nice extra feature. A skill proficiency and a cantrip is nice, and I like that you can flavor yourself as Arcane or make a bit of an alternative Ranger out of the subclass. Lots of people say the Arcane Shots arent that much more powerful than maneuvers, so they shouldnt be so limited on use. I happen to disagree, but Ill admit its a fine line theyre walking. The arrows themselves are super cool and flavorful. Banishing Arrow may seem lackluster, but its available at level 3, *doesnt require concentration*, based on a typically weak save, and at the very least wastes your targets next turn if they fail it. Thats a pretty awesome package to me. Grasping Arrow is a big standout, as it does extra base damage, and either forces the creature to waste their action or suffer even more continual damage, all with no save. Seeking Arrow can save the day against that invisible enemy. Bursting Arrow and Piercing Arrow bring some decent AOE that the Fighter normally lacks. The 7th level feature is pretty neat to me, as my groups tend to be a little more stingy about magic bows, since archery is so strong as it is. Never needing to worry about whether you have a magic bow or not is nice, but the second 7th level feature really rounds it out with a more concrete bonus that actually affects the way you can fight. Turn those misses into probable hits, if at least one other enemy is still around. 10th is a bit dead. Id be inclined to offer a 3rd Arcane Shot per short rest at this level, to help with the feeling of being miserly about them. Then at 15 we get a much bigger boost insuring you always have at least one per combat. 18th boosts the Shots themselves and that will be very welcome by that stage of the game. Overall I dont think its bad, like some people say, but I do understand the criticism that it is less fun with so few shots, so a small tweak to help that isnt out of line as far as Im concerned. **Cavalier**: The 4e Fighter has returned! On glorious horseback! I loved the marking mechanic, personally, so seeing it return in a fashion that makes a lot sense for 5e makes me happy. This is the tank Fighter, and he/she is here to punish you for engaging anyone but him/her. The mount is just icing on the cake, and nothing but an extra feature if you can make use of it. This fighter functions perfectly well without it, but many features can also be used in conjunction with it or to help protect it. Warding Maneuver is sweet, and really helps your protect yourself and others as well. You also cant waste it since it triggers on a hit, not just being attacked. Hold the Line prevents enemies from positioning themselves, and it adds even more to your opportunity attacks. Ferocious Charger is awesome because it has no size limit and really presents a cool image, mounted or not. Vigilant Defender lets you break Action economy a little bit and makes you a bit of a super-Sentinel overall. Good luck getting past the line in the sand that the Cavalier draws. **Samurai**: This is another controversial one. I personally thought Fighting spirit was too strong as it was. Granting advantage on so many attacks is really just very powerful. It can be used in conjunction with Action Surge too, making for stunning Nova turns. The temp HP is somewhat negligible, but its not anything to sneeze at until higher levels. I was surprised to see them move the ability to recharge on a long rest though, on top of paring down the length of the advantage on attacks. The temp hp has no time limit though, and again its still a very powerful feature as it is. 7th level gives us proficiency in Wisdom saving throws and thats honestly pretty badass on a Fighter. Especially when most other 7th level features tend to be utility and not applicable in combat. Mental defenses are often a major weakness. You also get some bonus to persuasion, which is a really nice thing to have on a Fighter as well. 10th level really helps out with Fighting Spirit; youll always have at least one use per combat. Rapid Strike synergizes beautifully with Fighting Spirit. Give up advantage for an extra attack: awesome. And Strength Before Death is just really damn cool. You get to take a full extra turn if knocked down to 0 hp. If youve still got Action Surge, Second Wind, or Fighting Spirit left, now is the time to use them. And even if you dont, thats at least 3 extra attacks you wouldnt have normally had, and that can make all the difference on a Fighter. ##Monk: **Way of the Drunken Master**: This monk *loves* fighting groups of enemies. They are even better than regular monks at wading into a melee and wandering back out unharmed. Their crazy mobility really gears them toward the hit-and-run tactics that the class is built for. You get a nice ribbon feature to give you performance. The standout here is the ability to force your opponent to attack one of their allies with a single ki point! Thats so flavorful and cool. Later on we get to attack five different targets at once with our Flurry of Blows. Thats quite a Flurry if youve got enough targets to use it on. As I mentioned earlier, this monk loves lots of enemies, preferably with two standing very close to one another. Its a really fun subclass, but I prefer to have my melee types better at one-on-one combat than mass combat. I do love the flavor though, and think it is translated well mechanically. **Way of the Kensei**: I absolutely love this one. This is how you get Samurai Jack in D&amp;D. Rurouni Kenshin. Basically those mythic, anime Samurai that only wear robes and focus solely on their mastery of the blade. Zen Archer concept is alive and well here too. You get to buff your AC by using your weapon for extra defense, get a small boost to ranged attacks if you need them, and you even get more weapons to master as you go along. The weapons become magical, even if you dont get a magic weapon, and you can get a smidge of extra damage out of them with some ki. Then you get to turn your weapon into a legendary level item, with the bonus to hit and damage, if not extra rider effects. Ask your DM to give you magic weapons without a bonus so you can use this feature with them still! And rerolling a miss is always handy too. ##Paladin: **Conquest**: Very strong mechanics, paired with a strong theme. Great extra spell list. Lots of flavorful options that feel like a hell knight, or a combat oriented Paladin that focuses on might and conquering the opponent. Channel Divinities are nice; induce fear, which works nicely with a later feature. And Guided Strike is a classic and loved by War Clerics. Its great to see on a smiting machine like Paladin. Aura of Conquest can get really nasty of you can get your opponents to receive the frightened condition - again, that channel divinity will come in handy. Scornful Rebuke is awesome; you hit me? How dare you! Feel some pain. And Invincible Conquerer is as amazing as any of the Paladin capstones. Possibly better than many. Resistance, flat out, doesnt matter if its magical. A third attack form Extra Attack. And expanded crit range. Wow. **Redemption**: Ill be honest, I completely lost interest without the no armor/simple weapons features gone. Id have been perfectly fine if they had rolled those into a Channel Divinity that last the full day or something, to keep it in line, design-wise, with the other Paladins. But that fact, as it is, just feels bad so far. Objectively looking at the features, its still strong, and would probably be fun if I didnt have these expectations from the UA. The spells are great ways to shut down encounters and violence; thematic and effective. The channel Divinities are neat. One helps with social encounters, which I find appropriate for the theme. The other is awesome in combat; essentially make your opponent feel the same pain they inflicted on one of your allies - very nice. Aura of the Guardian is pretty awesome; soak up all of your friends damage so they dont have to take it. Protective Spirit is cool, and much needed, as youll be eating a lot of your friends damage. Emissary of Redemption is really neat, and unique from the other super modes that all the other Paladins get at 20. Its always active and makes you much tackier and they essentially have to just take some of the damage they deal to you. Thats pretty stellar for a peaceful emissary type of character. ##Ranger: **Gloom Stalker**: First of all, I want to say how thankful I am for the devs making this concept way broader than just an Underdark only Ranger. That was my biggest criticism on the survey and it looks like I wasnt alone. A bonus to initiative is always great, and some buffs to your first turn in a combat are really nice. Emphasizes the ambusher theme really well. Umbral Sight is just cool as hell. Darkvision, even for your Humans and Dragonborn and such. But the best thing is that you basically ignore darkvision. So cool! Getting proficiency in Wisdom saving throws is fantastic, so this is an awesome feature at 7th level. Stalkers Flurry gives a nice overall damage boost that isnt just locked into your first turn. And Shadowy Dodge is amazing as well. Imposing disadvantage as a reaction with no other limits is a very thematic and strong defensive feature. A great addition to the class. **Horizon Walker**: Ill admit, I thought the theme of this one was pretty niche and a little odd when it first showed up. But man, people loved it, and Ive been convinced too. I think of Plansewalkers, as well as guardians of interplanar portals and such. It is a pretty damn cool theme, if seemingly out of the box. The portal sending ability has been appropriately balanced, but still very cool and thematic. And the extra damage ability on a bonus action is pretty great and universally useful too. It even scales a bit! Casting a high level spell, even for a single turn, is bonkers and super cool, super strong, and very thematic. Distant Strike is amazing because it increases mobility between every normal combat turn, and also adds some extra bonuses if youre fighting several opponents. Spectral Defense is kind of like Uncanny Dodge, but thats an extremely strong feature, and explained well within the concept of the subclass. The extra spells are absolutely killer too. *Haste*?! Damn. This is an overall fantastic implementation of an out of the box concept and I love it. **Monster Slayer**: This was my most anticipated Ranger subclass, and I still plan on playing one. Ill say this upfront though; it is my least favorite mechanically speaking. I think it is a little too niche in its usefulness, especially compared to the other two in this book. Im glad Hunters Sense was given limits, because the benefits of knowing that much meta knowledge about an enemy is huge. However, what bothers me is that Slayers Prey is a tad weak. Its a lesser Colossus Slayer. Its not concentration and it is unlimited in resource, so thats awesome. But I was hoping for a bit more. And maybe some scaling like Planar Warrior gives us in the Horizon Walker. Supernatural Defense is cool, and adds to the feel of focusing on a single creature and taking it down. Magic-Users Nemesis is the worst name ever, and while I think its very, very cool, its pretty niche in its use. Not exactly the offensive boost most Ranger archetypes receive. Slayers Counter is awesome and thematic and strong though. Big fan of that one. Its a bit of a mixed bag, honestly, but I really like the theme and the mechanics arent unbearable. I still want to play one! ##Rogue: **Inquisitive**: I honestly just love this one. Batman/Sherlock, welcome to D&amp;D. The ability to single out an enemy and make them always susceptible to Sneak Attack, regardless of ally placement or advantage. Thats pretty awesome. I love features that generally work around existing rules. As it is, only this subclass and the Swashbuckler can safely engage in one on one combat against another opponent. The rest of the features are all built around rooting out deception and being insanely good at finding the stuff you need to find in and out of combat. Very flavorful, very fun. The final ability makes even more use out of your base feature by granting extra damage on that sweet Sneak Attack. I plan to play one as soon as I get a chance. **Scout**: Ah here it is! The illustrious no-spells Ranger. Some may chafe at that, but that seems the obvious intent here. And I personally think it works extremely well. You get not just proficiency, but full on Expertise in Nature and Survival skills, the benchmark skills for a Ranger survivalist type. Then you are really hard to pin down. You can dodge in and out of combat, using a short sword or rapier to hit heavy in melee, but I think it works best with a shortbow. Then if someone does come into your sacred space, you just have to use a reaction to dodge away. Its a neat trick. Then you get some extra movement to help that out. Later you get a really nice feature that helps out your initiative and gives a boost to the whole party against slow acting creatures. And the capstone is super cool. Sneak Attack twice! It has to be two different targets, but still, its amazing. I have a couple gripes with the subclass though. Id really liked to have had scimitar and longbow proficiency. I guess I can grab those with a feat or what have you, but I still miss it on an archetype like this. And my bigger gripe is that for a character concept that is supposed to operate as a bit of a loner, scouting ahead of their allies, they have no way to reliably activate Sneak Attack. I guess the dont get caught and strike first philosophy is fair, with Stealth Expertise being a thing. Its a small gripe for an otherwise awesome and fun subclass. ##Sorcerer: **Divine Soul**: Lets be honest. Were all here for Divine Magic. Its not overpowered, but it is so strong it makes the other features weak in a kind of necessary way. Having access to an entire different spell list is astounding, and getting an extra spell known to start with is awesome too. Favored By the Gods is super cool, but pretty limited. Really awesome when it comes into play, but once per rest isnt a lot. Empowered Healing is cool, but it honestly disappoints me. I wish this subclass had more options than focusing on healing but the the features seem to encourage it more than enough. Otherworldly Wings is great, but weve kind of seen this before... I like it though. Its strong. Unearthly Recovery is very strong, but again kind of shoehorns this subclass into a healing flavor. Since youre choosing from the whole cleric spell list still by this point, its still a very potent subclass for the Sorcerer and a fun to play with. I just wish it were a bit broader than it seems (healing focus). **Shadow**: Ever since this subclass was released in UA I have been holding onto hope that it gets published. Im a big fan of dark/evil oriented subclasses for basically every class, and this was the perfect way to do it for the Sorcerer. Darkvision right at level one is awesome, and a fantastic range. Then at level 3 you get a free second level spell in *darkness*, and if you cast it directly with Sorcery Points, you can see through the darkness! Thats an amazing combo right out of the gate. And extra spells known is always a boon for this class. Strength of the Grave is also very thematic and cool, if a bit limited. Its very undead-like, and thats very cool. The Quirks table, while were at it, is just super cool and Im so happy they kept it and published it. Hound of Ill Omen is just amazingly cool. Its an extremely unique feature for Sorcerers, and its quite potent as well. Disadvantage on saves against your spells is really great, and being able to use it as a summon that attack and harries on top of that is stellar. Shadow Walk lets you teleport in darkness, which is similar to the shadow monk, but still very cool and thematic. Umbral Form provides an amazing defensive feature that halves all damage except for some very rare types, and some increased mobility to boot. This subclass is very potent, but every feature speaks explicitly to the concept and they interact in a unique and seemingly fun way. ##Warlock: **Celestial**: Im glad this exists. In the same way that I enjoy subclasses that evoke a darker, more evil theme, I think this fills a unique niche within the Warlock class concept. This is the stereotypically good Warlock. An angel, a titan/demigod, a Unicorn, and a ki-rin are all great inspirations for a being of pure light and bliss that might make a Pact. The extra healing isnt as good as Dreams Druid, but its still very nice. The extra cantrips are always great too. Radiant Soul makes this more effective, since you can add your charisma modifier to any radiant or fire damage you do. Celestial Resilience really adds to the overall hp to you and your party as well. An excellent support feature. Searing Vengeance is an amazing feature to bounce back from unconsciousness, regaining a ton of hp and providing damage to all your enemies within range without fear of friendly fire. Overall its a mixed bag, but its a very potent mixed bag that adds a lot of unique features to the Warlock class. **Hexblade**: To begin with, I want to talk about flavor. I love that its hinted heavily that its the Raven Queen because I find that fitting and interesting. But any shadowy entity that crafts weapons or items of power can make a Pact like this. My immediate thought here is Sauron. He is associated with darkness, necromancy (to a degree, as The Necromancer), and most importantly forging items of power that he used as binding contracts to other beings. With that aside, this subclass is mechanically pretty potent for melee Charisma based spellcasters. You get to fold in your casting stat as your melee Attack and damage stat and thats unique in 5e so far (excluding spells like *shillelagh*). It works without Pact of the Blade, but taking Pact of the Blade give you some nice benefits as well, and opens up what I would see as some necessary Invocations to properly make a melee monster out of this class. It also comes with a non-concentration curse feature that really puts the pain on one creature a rest for a full minute. Then... you get to summon a specter from a defeated enemy that can fight for you. Absolutely awesome flavor and some decent power baked in here. It gets more accurate and a teensy bit more tough, which makes it a nice minion that you can still lose pretty easily if you dont play careful. Its on a powerful chassis already though, so if you do lose it youre not necessarily hurting. Armor of Hexes is bonkers and makes your curse feature even more powerful, especially against a duel situation or something similar. And the final ability lets you get more mileage out of the key feature here, which is that awesome curse. Still only good for a single encounter most likely, but you can spread that love around instead of only putting it on the big bad first. Overall a great concept that really makes that melee Warlock a competitive pick with anything else out there. ##Wizard: **War Magic**: Another semi-controversial one. A lot of people are reasonably upset about the nerf to Power Surge. And Ill admit, it is disappointing. I think if I were to play it or DM for it Id be open to buffing it; probably just add Intelligence modifier to the half Wizard level. That way it at least has some oomph to it, being a limited resource and all. With that out of the way, we can talk about all the other features, which are honestly pretty awesome. Arcane Deflection is amazing. The +2 AC is middling but an on-demand chance to give yourself a +4 to a saving throw is just stellar. You give up a turn to cast a leveled spell, but its worth flinging a cantrip for a turn if you get out of some nasty effect. Tactical Wit is awesome, going before others is always excellent, especially as a Wizard. Power surges are a little damage boost, and I love the flavor of getting it back upon dispelling or counterspelling other spells. Very evocative and cool. The bonus to concentration at 10 is fantastic because by that level youll have awesome concentration spells at your disposal like *bigbys hand* or *animate objects*. Making it harder to hit you when you are concentrating is great, and this stacks with Arcane Deflection. And the penalty for Arcane Deflection isnt as bad then too, because youre probably using an action or bonus action on whatever spell youre concentrating on anyway. The 14th feature is cool as well, because its a good damage type and further incentivizes uses of your key feature. Overall I think its a good package, but like I mentioned before Power Surges could use a tiny bump, on initial reading. "
142,vulnerability,dndnext,Homebrew Cleric Domain: My Take on Sune,1,7d2o2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/7d2o2j/homebrew_cleric_domain_my_take_on_sune/,2017-11-15 19:05:02,"My occasional hobby for the past few months has been designing homebrew Cleric Domain rules for those among the Gods of Faerun that that don't fall neatly into the published Cleric Domains. My work so far includes the Frost Domain for Auril, the Fortune Domain for Tymora and Beshaba, and the Moon Domain for Selune and Eilistraee. Today I tried my hand at Sune and found the result sufficiently interesting thematically that I wanted to share it here and see what people thought. I've seen a couple of people here and on Giant in the Playground make stats for a 'Sune Domain' and I'm always a little turned off by the fact that they generally seem to be built around mind control spells. Although I can see why this is done, it's the simplest way to turn the concept of a charm or 'love' goddess into a playable character class, This disturbs me mostly because a) Sune is supposedly a Chaotic Good goddess, b) She's supposed to be the Goddess of Love and Beauty and while I'm no more an expert in love or ethics than the next guy in his twenties who spends his freetime making D&amp;D homebrews I'm pretty sure I learned from Jessica Jones that neither Chaotic Good nor Love mix well with mind control. So what I've attempted is not the Charm Domain, or the Beauty Domain but rather the Love domain in all it's glory. I haven't picked through this for bugs yet, the core mechanic of the class is sufficiently different from anything else I know of in 5e that it's difficult to assess it's balance with certainty and I'm pretty sure the capstone is at least a little overpowered (the maximized healing probably needs a nerf) but I've been playing and DMing since 3.0 started and this at least passes the eyeball test with me so I'm ready to submit this to the judgement of the community: Does this look like a playable subclass? How well is it balanced against other cleric domains? Does it work thematically? Love Domain Spells: 1st Charm Person, Heroism 3rd Alter Self, Warding Bond 5th Haste, Life Transference 7th Charm Monster, Stoneskin 9th Seeming, Skill Empowerment Charming At 1st level the cleric learns the Friends cantrip as well as proficiency in one of Insight, Persuasion or Performance. When the cleric uses the friends cantrip they may use a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check against the target's Wisdom (insight) check to avoid causing offense when the spell wears off, provided that neither the cleric nor their allies have taken any hostile action against the target in the meantime. Shared Fates At 1st level a Love domain cleric can designate a single ally with whom they have a particular bond. The cleric and their ally can use the help action as a bonus action and at a distance of up to 30 feet, but only when one member of the pair is assisting the other. Furthermore when the cleric casts healing spells on their bonded ally these spells are always counted as rolling maximum hit points restored. The cleric can designate a new ally at the end of a long rest. Channel Divinity: Strength of Two At second level, when casting a spell affecting only one target that will affect either themselves or their bonded ally the cleric can use their channel divinity to make the spell effect both themselves and the ally. If the spell requires concentration then the cleric will have advantage on any saving throw made to maintain concentration on that instance of the spell. This effect cannot be used on spells such as Warding Bond or Life Transference that already have effects on two creatures. Channel Divinity: Strength of Sorrow At 6th level, when the cleric's bonded ally is reduced to 0 hit points by an enemy the cleric can use their channel divinity to swear revenge. The cleric gains advantage on all attacks against the enemy that struck down the cleric's ally and the enemy has disadvantage on all saving throws against the cleric's spells. Also, the first time each round the enemy is dealt damage by one of the cleric's weapon or spell attacks they are counted as having vulnerability to that damage. This effect lasts until the enemy is killed, the cleric's bonded ally is raised above 0 hit points again, or the cleric designates a new ally. Potent Spellcasting At 8th level the Cleric can add their wisdom bonus to the damage from any cleric cantrip. Love is Larger At 17th level the cleric can apply all the benefits of their shared fates ability with any ally. "
143,vulnerability,dndnext,Magic Less Ranger,0,72o2rg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/72o2rg/magic_less_ranger/,2017-09-27 08:41:49,"Hello, just wanted some input on some features I will be doing for a no magic ranger in the works. Generally it will be based mostly on the level design of the revised ranger but with the spell casting taken out. I'm planning on making hunter's mark a class feature that you may get low mid / mid level. And I wanted to keep it about the same for simplicity sakes but give it a little bit of Foe Slayer which I like the mechanic but it doesn't fit the awesomeness of a 20th lvl feature. Starting at some level you gain hunters mark, it works basically the same but you decide before any dice are rolled whether the die rolled will be added to attack or your damage rolls. The beginning level you get hunters mark it will start at a d4 but then raise to a d6 later and then possibly a d8 at higher lvl. At these same levels the dice bump the duration goes from 1hour, 8 hours, to 24 hours. Just wanted some input on? I think this gives it a bit more flexibility and choice and works similar to foe slayer. Also it would be an ability you can use a number of times based on your wisdom modifier per long rest. ALso the 20th lvl ability would be called sunder. You aim for the hard to reach weak spot of an enemy. Once per long rest you may before an attack after the die is rolled but before result choose to give vulnerability to the target against the next damage it receives. Also side note, why don't barbarians as a martial class not get fighting style? Never made sense to me."

I based it on the abilities of the drider in the Monster Manual and added some additional spider powers and increased poison damage for higher levels. Feel free to use or abuse it as you see fit. Enjoy! --- **DRIDER (multiclass only)** **Requirements:** *Drow, level 5, fail the Test of Lolth* **Hit Points** **Hit Die**: 1d10 **Hit Points at Each Level:** 1d10 (or 6) + Constitution modifier **Proficiencies** None Level|Proficiency Bonus|Features :-:|:-:|:-- 1|+3|Bite Attack, Carapace, Spider Form 2|+3|Preternaturally Stealthy 3|+3|Poisoned Fangs (1d8) 4|+4|Ability Score Increase 5|+4|Multiattack 6|+4|Ability Score Increase 7|+4|Poisoned Fangs (2d8/1d8) 8|+5|Ability Score Improvement 9|+5|Spinneret 10|+5|Ability Score Improvement 11|+5|Poisoned Fangs (3d8/1d8) 12|+6|Ability Score Improvement 13|+6|Blindsight 14|+6|Ability Score Improvement 15| +6|Poisoned Fangs (4d8/2d8) **Bite Attack** At 1st level, your teeth elongate into spidery fangs. As an action, you can make a melee weapon attack with a reach of 5 feet and dealing 1d4 plus your Strength modifier piercing damage on a hit. You are proficient in this attack. **Carapace** Heavy, chitinous plates grow over most of your body at 1st level. This prevents you from wearing armor but you gain a natural armor class of 16 + your Dexterity modifier. **Spider Form** At 1st level, your legs painfully and permanently warp into the body and legs of a spider. Your size increases to Large, and you gain a climb speed of 30 feet. In addition, you can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check. You ignore movement restrictions caused by webbing. **Preternaturally Stealthy** At 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Stealth skill, and you double your proficiency bonus when making Stealth (Dexterity) checks. If you already possess proficiency in the Stealth skill, you may gain proficiency in one other skill of your choice. **Poisoned Fangs** At 3rd level, your bite attack does additional damage, adding 1d8 poison damage with each successful bite attack. This damage increases to 2d8 at 7th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 15th level. Additionally, beginning at 7th level, you can excrete your poison onto your ranged weapons, adding 1d8 poison damage to any attack with a piercing ranged weapon. This damage increases to 2d8 at level 15. **Ability Score Improvement** When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 10th, 12th, and 14th levels, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can raise two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. **Multiattack** At 5th level, you've become more comfortable with your new form and can attack with lightning reflexes. You can attack two times, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action. One of these attacks can be replaced with your bite attack. If you also have the Extra Attack class feature, you can attack three times whenever you take the Attack action. **Spinneret** At 9th level, you grow a spinneret on your abdomen which allows you to shoot webs. As an action, you can make a ranged weapon attack with which you are proficient and having a short range of 30 feet and a long range of 60 feet. On a hit, the target is restrained by webbing. As an action, a restrained target can make a Strength check (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier), bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). You may use this ability a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1), and this ability recharges on a short or long rest. Also, while you are in contact with a web, you know the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web. **Blindsight** At 13th level, you become fully attuned with your spidery senses, gaining the Blindsight ability out to a range of 10 feet."

The DM has always been kind of frustrated by how much damage we can do as a team. So he has done things like decide that like 90% of the enemies we face have no vulnerability. This was frustrating for us, especially when a tree ent was not weak to fire. But on top of all of this he has a main boss that we have lost 4 characters to (out of 8). This boss is a necromancer with heavy plate armor, excessive spell slots, and has a legion of undead that fight with him. We went against him at level 5 (when the DM planned) and lost 2 before we were able to flee. Again at level 8 and we lost another almost immediately, and at level 10 (at DM insistence). Basically this boss just uses counterspell every time we attack with magic. His AC is so high that we almost never hit with normal weapons. He can get more HP from his many undead minions. And he teleports everywhere. So far 1 player left the game altogether because of it, and 2 more are considering it. I may also be considering it. Whenever we ask him about it, or complain, he just says that its a boss and should be hard. Or that he is tired of us just using magic to deal crazy damage. What do i do with this situation? He wont listen and doesnt seem to care that the game is no longer fun for us. "

In bullet points: * Your PCs engage a white dragon on a frozen body of water * When the dragon hits 1/2 HP, it slams its tail on the ice then dives through the resulting weak spot * Several rounds later, it violently resurfaces, using its wings to spray freezing water in an arc. Anyone within range needs to make a reflex save -- you can give them advantage if they're far away and disadvantage if they're right by the hole * Anyone who fails is now soaked to the bone in freezing water and could have one of: disadvantage on attack rolls, disadvantage vs. cold-based attacks, or vulnerability to cold * A large half-circle around one side of the hole is now water-covered ice, effectively a non-magical *grease* spell You'll probably want to give the dragon a swim speed for this to work, but you're creative. I'm sure you can think of a justification. Have fun! *Prestidigitation* should be able to dry a character off and nullify the effect of being wet, but good look dispelling wet ice. ;-) EDIT: Similar synergy from an arctic sorcerer (or druid) with one or more bound water elementals."
148,vulnerability,dndnext,[Homebrew] Abyssal Sorcerer Origin,2,6woupa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6woupa/homebrew_abyssal_sorcerer_origin/,2017-08-29 14:10:12,"Hey guys I really missed the abyssal bloodline from 3.5 so I did my best to remake it for 5e keeping the flavor and trying to keep it at roughly the same power level of the draconic origin. Thanks for reading and tell me what you think! (I'm really unsure of the 18th level feature and would love suggestions). Abyssal Sorcerer Origin: Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage. While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is particularly strong. You might sometimes have urges to chaos or evil, but your destiny (and alignment) is up to you. Abyssal Toughness: Your body has always seemed to shrug off blows others would succumb to. Ac 13 + dex mod. In addition you have fire and necrotic resistance but are vulnerable to radiant damage. Call of the Abyss: At the 6th level, as an action, you may conjure a demon(or demons), with a challenge rating of half your sorcerer level or lower. This costs 4 sorcery points to do so. A conjured demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 90 feet. They disappear to their home plane if they are reduced to 0 hit points. These fiends are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the fiend, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal(or telepathic) commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you dont issue any commands to the demon, it defends itself from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. You must finish a long rest to use this feature again. Demonic Flight: At 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of demonic wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create these wings as a Bonus Actionon Your Turn. They last until you dismiss them as a Bonus Action on Your Turn. You cant manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them. The Demon Within: At the 18th level you have the option to permanently fully embrace your abyssal heritage and your race changes to a fiend(demonic). Your appearence changes to that of the race of demon that infected your bloodline(Alternatively, at your dm's discretion, you transfrom to a demon of your choice or a form that is obivously demonic). You lose any ability scores, and any other weakness/strengths from your former race are lost (damage resistance etc..). You don't forget any languages however. You do gain the bonuses from your new race(pick 4 ability increases if you and your dm made a custom demon form). For example a tiefling changes to a vrock, the tiefling loses his fire resistance and ability scores. His ability scores are now set to that of a vrock, has magic resistance and is immune to poison. If you do not embrace your heritage the gods smile upon you and remove your radiant vulnerability. Regardless of changing race you gain telepathy as a free action within 60 yards. Edit: Clarified level Demon Within, nerfed Call of the Abyss. Call of the Abyss changes: Increased sorcery points from 3 to 4, removed extra uses. Demon Within changes: Added this line: For example a tiefling changes to a vrock, the tiefling loses his fire resistance and ability scores. His ability scores are now set to that of a vrock, has magic resistance and is immune to poison."
149,vulnerability,dndnext,[5e] [Spoilers] Better utilizing the **** of ****** relic in Curse of Strahd!,4,6zzztv,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6zzztv/5e_spoilers_better_utilizing_the_of_relic_in/,2017-09-14 14:19:53,"Hey there! I wanted to get some feedback on an idea I had for the Tome of Strahd relic from the Curse of Strahd campaign setting. My party had acquired the tome several sessions ago and were left with an overwhelming feeling of so what? To my understanding, the tome divulges information about Strahd's history and talks about the sun sword, the latter of which being more valuable than the former I would thinkthough the Tarokka reading already revealed that such a weapon exists. To satisfy my players, I wanted to come up with a use for the tome and the following is what I came up with. First, I have been utilizing the Strahd as Dictator theme. The players are always unsure of who is and isn't a Strahd sympathizer or whether or not the NPC they are engaging with is ultimately in league with him. The people of Barovia are terrified of him and rarely, if ever, act against Strahd's oppressive measures. Barovians also believe that Strahd is all-powerful and therefore un-defeatable. This is where the tome becomes a meaningful component to defeating him, but it requires a small and subsequently inconsequential piece of equipment found at The Wizard of Wines. That piece of equipment was the printing press found in one of the rooms on the second floor of the winery. Admittedly, what you're about to read is inspired in part by the protestant reformation and the idea that knowledge/information is power and the role that the printing press played in shaping European history. The Tome of Strahd is an item which is very intimate to the antagonist and demonstrates his capacity for vulnerability. If the Tome of Strahd could be reprinted for mass distribution by utilizing the printing press at the Wizard of Wines, pamphlets and propaganda materials which demonstrate his vulnerability could help to diminish his power over the Barovians, much of which is fuelled by their fear of him. Mortalizing him through the distribution and spread of what can otherwise be considered his diary could deal a massive blow against his unquestionable rule over the domain of Barovia. That, and it could potentially lead to a militia uprising which may prove instrumental in the player's quest to take/siege Castle Ravenloft. Thoughts? Am I missing something? Is there something I can tweak to convey this idea with greater opacity? Other parallels besides the reformation that I could draw on? Thanks in advance! TL;DR - Use the printing press at The Wizard of Wines to copy and distribute the Tome of Strahd to the people of Barovia by means of Anti-Strahd Propaganda. Also, this was originally posted on r/dnd."

More standard stuff about background and story to come, but they basically are cursed little people from the Feywild who got on Titania's nerves and then couldn't get in the way of ANY light without kicking in their rapid-aging. Fortunately, if they get on the good side of a god/quasi-divine/patron of some sort, they can undergo a transformation to become and Elder, who aren't as susceptible. I'm not worried about the story as much as I am balancing, so if anyone has any suggestions I would love to hear them! **Ability Score Increase**: Your Dexterity increases by 2, and your Wisdom increases by 1. **Age**: A Darkling can live up to 50 years depending on how much light it intakes before it becomes and Elder. It enters its Elder form with the physical maturity of a young adult, and can live up to 700 years after that. **Speed**: Your base walking speed is 30 feet. **Superior Darkvision**: Darklings have great need to be able to see in the dark, as even the smallest bit of light can harm them, and they carry this trait on when they become an Elder. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of grey. **By Nature**: You are proficient in the Stealth and Perception skills. **Dark Lineage**: You can cast darkness once per long rest without material components. Once you reach the third level, you can cast it once per short or long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this trait. **Darklings Curse**: You gain the following traits: * You are vulnerable to radiant damage, and cannot lose this vulnerability by any means. * If your glowing tattoos, which cover your whole body, are visible to others while you are in an area of darkness, others have advantage on attack rolls against you and on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you. **Death Burn**: Darkling Elders have developed ways to use the light their tattoos shed to attack. You can use an action to expel a burst of light from yourself. Any creature within a 10 foot radius sphere centered on you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. On a failed save, it takes 2d6 radiant damage and, if it could see the light, is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half that damage and is not blinded. The damage increases by 1d6 at the 6th level (3d6), 11th level (4d6), and 16th level (5d6). You may use your Death Burn once per long rest. **Chosen**: You gain 2 cantrips (can cast without material components, your spellcasting ability for the spell is either Wisdom for a deity patron or Charisma for a Warlock patron), 2 resistances, or one of each that are associated with your patron. **Languages**: You can speak, read, and write Common and Sylvan.

I know the pitfalls that go along with permanent injury tables and such, and I think I've mitigated them. Would you mind helping me flesh out my table and critiquing the rules? I've tried making each of injuries relevant to role play in some way. I know they're unbalanced. I'm looking more for interesting suggestions. If the suggestions are balanced, great. These are the rules and the table: **Trauma and death:** * If an attack brings you to 0 Hit points and any excess damage is more than half of your HP, rounded up, you die (Example: Maximum HP is 99. Current HP is 1. If someone attacks you and would bring you past -50 HP, you die) You have the option of undergoing trauma. If you undergo trauma, you are prone, have 1 HP, and can act on your turn, but your reaction is used. * If you're unconscious and unstabilized, you have the option of undergoing trauma. If you undergo trauma, you stabilize, are prone, have 1 HP, and can act on your turn. Stabilizing in this way uses your reaction. * If someone scores a critical hit against you, or you roll a 1 on a ST and you take damage or suffer some other adverse effect, roll a d100 and add your character level divided by two, rounded up. On an 11 or lower, you undergo trauma. * You can only undergo trauma once per session. * The player gets to choose which trauma they undergo. * The trauma a player undergoes must be fitting to the event that produced the trauma. * Trauma can be healed through the use of the Regenerate spell or similar magics or therapy, per your DM. **Trauma table** * Sensitive: You have vulnerability to the damage type that damaged you. If there was more than one, pick which. Can be picked more than once. * Phobia: You have disadvantage on attacks against creatures of the type that damaged you. Can be picked more than once. * Eye: You lose the use of one eye. You have disadvantage on perception checks made with sight, and attacks made against you from your right or left have advantage/you have disadvantage on STs from your right or left, you choose. Can be picked up to two times. If picked twice, you gain the Blinded condition. * Double vision: Everything now has +2 AC when you attack it. * Sterile: You can no longer reproduce naturally. (This one needs to be worse.) * Hobble: Your speed is reduced by 5ft, you can no longer take the dash action, and you have disadvantage on Athletics checks that require the use of your legs. * Memento: You can't remember anything past the last time you woke up, every time you wake up. Skills, class features, languages, and racial traits are unaffected. Change one axis of your alignment to the opposite. (This one needs to be worse) * Cripple: You can't use your arm for attacking, holding a focus, the S and/or M components of a spell, or holding a shield. You can still write, open doors, and interact with very light objects. * Stutter: You gain a stutter. You have disadvantage on Intimidation checks. * Dyslexia: You have extreme difficulty reading or writing anything.

The rest of the party can still do a fuckton of damage and I'm filling in a niche in the party with my support by perceiving, grappling, stealth, and speed. Don't break my cats' legs pls. Disclaimer: DnD is a role play game about character and stories. It shouldn't be about making op characters. Okay, now that we've got that weak shit out of the way, let's precede. I'm already level 4 and there are some home-brew rules to be aware of that I will get to. I am playing a tabaxi who only uses his claws and fights tough, ferocious, hand to paw combat. Remember, Tabaxi have 20 climbing feet and have an ability where, without taking an action, can double their movement speed for a turn. So far I am 3 levels in monk (open hand) and one in barbarian for that rage. I went monk first so I get monk unarmed defense (and if I had known the magic item I would be getting I would have gone barbarian first). My stats are: Strength: 13 Dexterity:16 Constitution:19 Int:10 Wis:15 Char:9 19 constitution is from a cool af amulet of healing. Before, my const was 12 and since there are no true barbarians who would benefit from an AC increase, I took the amulet. My health is currently at a max of 49 (for the first three levels my DM let the party take the max health increase that our classes would give [8+12+8+5+16=49]). My AC is 15, but wait! I have a magic ring called 'Ring of Tree Hide' which gives me +2AC, adv on stealth in wooded areas, but vulnerability to fire and lightning for an hour after touching it to a living tree. Given half cover while grappling and the ring my AC goes up to 19! Now here's where things get really crazy. Because I am a monk my DM said that I can do grappling that is Dexterity(Athletics) meaning my barb rage adv still applies and I get to use dex too! Here is what I am thinking of but I don't have much of a long term plan. I want to take the observant feat so my wis mod increases by one and I would have a passive perception of 21, since I am a perceptive cat and the most perceptive of the group I feel that this would be a good fit. Rogue, that expertise is delicious. I'm thinking taking proficiency in sleight of hand and expertise in athletics and perception. This is where I lose sight of long term goals. I've seen some other builds that do crazy combos and stuff and am not sure how to emulate anything. One build I saw involved monk/druid/fighter which can drag an enemy across magical spikes 18 times in a turn dealing 36d4. I know I have a ton of potential here and am not sure what to do with the opportunity. I know my second ability score improvement will be +2dex but that's about it. To sum it up. I want a fast, perceptive, grappley ferocious fur-ball of fuck-you-up. Note: we love the magic items so my DM tries to balance with harder fights. For example, we once fought a shield guardian (CR7) while only 4 people at level 4 were present after already being in some fights. "
153,vulnerability,dndnext,Help: calculating CR for controller/utility spellcasters,4,6mrxyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6mrxyw/help_calculating_cr_for_controllerutility/,2017-07-12 15:30:32,"I'm working on a campaign in which my players will be encountering a group of ice-themed spellcasting mercenaries called the Cryo Corps (futuristic campaign). I'll need a few different tiers of Cryo Corps mercs. CR1, CR3, and CR 5. Each should have a mix of damage and crowd-control abilities, but I'm uncertain how to calculate CR for abilities that don't deal direct damage, or deal some damage but have a primary effect of disrupting the battlefield. For instance: if I wanted to give my CR1 Cryo Corps Grunts a cantrip spell attack dealing 2d6 single target cold damage, and a recharging ""freeze"" ability that let them attempt to restrain a target at range, how would I calculate that? What if I also wanted to give them the equivalent of the ""shape water"" cantrip, allowing them to throw up minor ice blockades for taking cover, blocking off doorways, etc? The 2d6 cold damage cantrip is easy to account for. The freeze attack I would probably just reflavor from the Giant Spider's web ability, but I'm uncertain how big of an impact that has on CR. The shape water cantrip offers no damage, but does grant utility through the creation of cover, obstacles, and so on. Totally unsure how to account for this one. They will also, naturally, have resistance to cold damage, and vulnerability to fire damage. Because, you know, ice people. I figure those two things cancel each other out in terms of CR. Might even make them easier, given the abundance of fire damage spells and sources. Advice is appreciated! I'm a new-ish DM still getting the hang of making balanced new monsters and enemies for my players to interact with."
154,vulnerability,dndnext,Help me balance an almost finished magic item!,6,6nggzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6nggzp/help_me_balance_an_almost_finished_magic_item/,2017-07-16 01:23:49,"Ok, people, I need you to do what you do best. Be critical! :D I posted this a while back and have since updated it. **I'm looking for help specifically on #8 but any ideas at all are appreciated.** I have created a magic item for my next campaign. This would be for the entire party, not just one person. The item would consist of 6 dice in game. a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and a d20. The purpose of the item is a few things, it's to have cool random buffs happen (like a VERY low impact Deck of Many Things) because that's fun. Also there is the mini game of picking which die to roll (explained in a min). So I'd love for some feedback on the item. Based on the number you roll, that is the result you get. So if you roll a d8 and get a 6, it's the same result as if you rolled a d6 and got a 6. The higher numbers start to get higher risk for higher reward (for example the d4 is all good things! But it's all minor good things). Some things are intended to have both positive AND negative effects (usually with the positives being more major than others because they come at a cost) Also, there are Minor, Moderate, and Major good or bad outcomes by design. So I will post the item, and describe the intent of each outcome and you guys tell me what is utter garbage or way overpowered or would cause you not to use it etc. * 1 - No effect * 2 - (Minor +) Advantage on your next skill check * 3 - (Minor +) Gain your level in temp HP * 4 - (Minor +) Your speed increases by 10ft for the next hour * 5 - (Minor -) You must shout when you speak for the rest of the day * 6 - (Moderate +) Gain double your level in temp HP * 7 - (Moderate -) You must return to this spot in one week or be sickened for the duration of the 8th day * 8 - (Moderate +) **Party can communicate telepathically with each other for the day** * 9 - (Moderate -) DC 13 Con save or 1 level of Exhaustion * 10 - (Moderate +) 'Pass Without A Trace' is cast upon the party for the next hour * 11 - (Moderate -/+) Party gains a resistance of their choice and a vulnerability of the DM's choice for the rest of the day * 12 - (Moderate +) The party gains a d8 of Inspiration each * 13 - (Moderate -/+) For the next round of combat, you have advantage on all attacks, but all attacks against you have advantage as well * 14 - (Moderate +) 'Fly' is cast upon the party for the next hour * 15 - (Moderate -) Non-magical healing is halved for the day * 16 - (Moderate -/Major +) You know the location of the highest CR enemy within 1 mile, but it also knows your location * 17 - (Moderate -) You have disadvantage on your next saving throw * 18 - (Major +) You have advantage on death saving throws and gain the maximum possible amount from all non-magical healing **(not sure if hour or day for this one)** * 19 - (Major -/+) You have advantage on Dex saves and disadvantage on Wis/Con saves for the next hour **(thinking about making this for the day)** * 20 - (MAJOR +) You gain the benefits of a long rest and you get advantage on attack rolls for the next 2d6 minutes So I KNOW 20 is busted. That's sort of the point. They can use each respective die once per day, so they only have a 5% chance of getting it any given day. I'm ok with that. I am looking for feedback mostly on 2, 7, 10, 15, 16, and as you can see 18 is blank for now. Also any feedback on the feel, flavor, and flow of the item. I have deployed one of these in each campaign and my PCs always love them. So I'm not at all worried about the tone of the item. Just want to get some balance and tweaking feedback. Specifically what would make you NOT want to use these dice at all and does anything need to get tweaked? Thanks!"
155,vulnerability,dndnext,(Curse of Strahd Spoilers) Amber Temple Dark Gift Conundrum,9,6feezn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6feezn/curse_of_strahd_spoilers_amber_temple_dark_gift/,2017-06-06 00:15:05,"I am in love with the Amber Temple, and the idea of the party risking it all to power themselves up with Dark Gifts to defeat strahd appeals to me greatly. However I'm not completely sold on the Dark Gifts as-is. Here are a few of my complaints and possible solutions I'm considering. I'd love your input and your advice on how to deal with these vestiges! Problem 1: The penalty for failing a saving throw is either too little, or too much, depending on how you play it. If you let the character retain control of their character, the penalty is little more than a slap on the wrist. The character still needs to exit Barovia, so they will likely continue to work with the party even if they are Evil. Many players wouldn't even want to really roleplay something ""evil,"" but they wouldn't want to just lose their character, either. On the other hand, just straight up deleting a character isn't something I'd want to pull on my players without telling them first, and if I tell them first, I doubt anyone would even try to get a power. Problem 2: The DC is too low, if the penalty isn't insta-'death.' My Warlock player has a +9 to CHA saves and my paladin player grants +3 to saves when within 15 feet of him. My Warlock literally cannot fail a saving throw vs a vestige. There's virtually no reason he shouldn't just go around collecting every single one. Problem 3: The power level of the gifts varies wildly. This isn't a problem per se, but risking your entire character in order to get 3 casts of Suggestion...yeah, that's not gonna cut it. (Furthermore, the flaw combined with the suggestion spell just says 'rape' to me. It's squicky and I dont want it in my game. Definitely gonna modify this one.) Problem 4: Many of the powers only stick around for a limited number of uses. This is kind of tied into #3, but I'm on the fence about whether it's a real problem. Solution 1: I think I will swap to a system whereby when you accept a gift, you get both a penalty, and a boon. This is kind of already a thing, but the penalties vary so wildly. One person's blood turns black and viscid...okay. Someone else has to eat grave dirt or die. Hugely different. I'm thinking every penalty here should radically change the way the character has to operate, in some horrific way. The grave dirt is a good example. So is full body oily fur, losing your eyes, etc. Not necessarily mechanical stuff, but really disfiguring and horrific shit. So even if they pass their saving throw, they're still losing something. Solution 2. The DC. What should it be, and what should happen if they fail it? I don't mind making it high, and the drawbacks extremely steep, since if they fail it they still get their power-up and they don't lose their character. But I'm on the fence as to whether to do an across-the-board thing like irreversible loss of max HP or stats, or to craft an individual drawback for each one. I started to do this, but struggled to come up with some of them and decided that most of them would never see the light of day anyway so why spend time creating it? For example, the one that gives you cone of cold, if you failed it, would also give you vulnerability to fire damage and if you saw an open flame you'd have to make a save or be Frightened, or maybe roll on the madness table. Does anyone have any good ideas here? Should I customize the results, or go with something across the board? Solution 2a. I want to be heavily punitive here. Basically I want it to be really bad, but not quite as bad as your character turning evil and the DM getting control of it. So really, no holds barred, because it's never going to be as punitive as losing your character. Since my party has 7 characters and they're going to be higher level than normal for the final battles, I was thinking something as stringent as losing 4d8 maximum HP. Solution 2b. That warlock I mentioned will be the character most interested in these anyway, since he's an edgelord loner type character. So I'm thinking about uncoupling the save from Charisma, perhaps making it a straight roll. On the other hand, if he does run around grabbing literally every gift, he's going to be really freaky when he comes out the other side so maybe it's not such a big deal. But I was thinking what if each gift you took increased the saving throw DC? Or something? Solution 3. Some of these should just be re-worked entirely. Suggestion is a shitty spell to get as a dark gift. Mind Blank is not that useful heading into the final bit of CoS--party may or may not continue on after. Solution 4. I'm thinking about making some of the powerful ones like Cone of Cold and Finger of Death, to be once per long rest powers that go away when you leave Barovia. The weaker ones like Lightning Bolt, maybe 3x per Long Rest. I don't know. On the one hand I don't want to fiddle with it too much; on the other hand, I don't like that a player can just totally lose their gift. Makes them feel really underwhelming and not worth the risk. Any thoughts are appreciated"
156,vulnerability,dndnext,Our party of level 5 killed a Mummy Lord in its lair.,27,6hkrk0,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/6hkrk0/our_party_of_level_5_killed_a_mummy_lord_in_its/,2017-06-16 16:11:36,"There were four of us; Me, the Warlock 3/Druid 2 Yarrow, our Fighter 2/Cleric 3 Haji, the gnome Artificer 3/Rogue 2 Verhjis and the Ranger 2/Warlock 3 Rowlin. We also had a friendly Paladin NPC tag along named Marcus. The Rowlin and Verhjis recruited Haji and I to go take down a Mummy Lord in its lair. I'd just had a stint of DMing so the Mummy Lord statblock was kinda fresh in my mind; Inwardly I groaned, withered and died but outwardly my character was all for it - eventually I was the one strong-arming Haji to come along. He had one condition, though: he wanted some platinum rings for warding bond. So we made our way to Ebonhawke, a very large city only half a week's ride from the Mummy's lair. I took Marcus the Paladin along with me to a library for a 'date' (the poor sod was head over heals for me, apparently), and had him tutor me on what he knew of Mummies, lords and lairs. It boiled down to this: bring lots of fire, don't let him look at you, and don't get hit. I had a vague plan unfolding in my head, but didn't know enough of the Mummy's capabilities to fully commit to it. Meanwhile, Haji had an alchemist pay him 10gp to test an 'unstable' brew of his, something that was meant to douse you in a cloak of flames that didn't harm you, only others. All he succeeded in was getting set alight (water just made it worse), getting lost in the city for two days, and forgetting to source some platinum for Verhjis to make rings out of. Verhjis himself nearly got killed by footpads as he went about the city trying to source a poisoner's kit, and our ranger managed to score a bargain on a small quiver of fire arrows. Down to the lair we rode, arguing about strategy the whole time. Our linchpin rested on Haji using Path to the Grave (makes next damage source(s) a vulnerability for the marked creature) and me following up with a shot from my Moon Bow and spending a 2nd level spell slot (which is normally 4d8 on top of 1d8) to try and nuke it down. Rowlin had suspiciously accurate knowledge of the Mummy's lair and how to navigate it, when I asked he told me he'd scouted here before, and I saw through the lie it was (+10 insight is my new favourite thing, along with the Empathic feat) but didn't call it out, and we made our way to the main chamber only having to fight two mummies on the way. Then the sarcophagus; roll for initiative. 24, 22, 21, 20, 18, 1. The dice had spoken, and the Mummy Lord was to go last. Rowlin was up first and he shoots a fire arrow that also had some fire poison applied to it (we use a homebrew alchemy/poisoning mechanic) for 57 damage on his first turn. Marcus the Paladin is up next, and as hard as he smote that undead with his divinity, it used a legendary action to pummel him with its rotting fist, taking him down to 1HP and preventing him from healing. I ran into a corner and cast darkness on myself, able to peer out with the Devil's Sight invocation and used my bonus action on Marcus to heal him up with Balm of the Summer Court (Druid Circle of Dreams), finding out that he can't be healed (at least he had 10ft more movement though!). Then the rest of the fight was a mad scramble of buffs, counterbuffs and the Mummy throwing its entire arsenal against us. I'm honestly surprised we survived that onslaught (my darkness ploy seemed a lot less smart when the Mummy used insect plague on it). Eventually though, Haji decided it was time and marked the Mummy with Path to the Grave. I had lost concentration on darkness by now, so Rowlin took the help action to give me advantage on the shot. Lucky he did, as my first roll was a 3. I hit, and it's my first attack of the whole fight (probably an hour in by real time). I'm so pumped to actually hit the thing (we've tried this combo before but I always manage to miss, even with advantage) that I forget I have to roll for damage. 5d8? No worries. 5. 1. 1. 8. 7. The DM looked so keen for this attack but when he saw my rolls the light faded from his eyes. ""22 damage"" I say. He does the thing that indicates I was close to killing it but not quite (you all know that DM groan). Then we all suddenly remembered Path to the Grave, so the damage was doubled, and the Mummy Lord slain by my single, white wood arrow. We weren't warned about looting a Mummy Lord's lair, so I wonder if we'll end up cursed or not. Either way, it was worth the sapphire and opal to embed into my Roc skull helmet (Haji also finally found some platinum to get those rings made). We then cleared the rest of the lair out, but Marcus and Haji are both suffering from mummy rot and have about 4 max hp between them. Can't wait to see what happens there. Sorry for the long post, I rarely play and mainly DM now but this was just such a fun session that I had to share. TL;DR Party of 5 level 5's actually prepare for a fight (this is a new concept to our group of players), and somehow come out on top of a Mummy Lord and it's lair. The next challenge is to excavate the sarcophagus... "

Currently the vampire class acts similar to a warlock, he has spells he can cast but also does lifedrinker damage with a bonded melee weapon in close combat. I am probably going to make 2 subclasses, one for melee and one for spellcasting. I'm also going to give it a very limited shapeshifting ability, where you can shift into a bat at level 1, a hell hound at level 6, a vargulf (or similar) at level 12, and a vargheist at level 16 or 18. Of course it also has darkvision, sunlight sensitivity, resistance to nectrotic, vulnerability to radiant, can only drink blood takes damage every minute in sunlight and a couple other traits.

158,vulnerability,dndnext,[Campaign] To Strike the Lich God,6,62xofa,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/62xofa/campaign_to_strike_the_lich_god/,2017-04-02 14:00:38,"I've been working on a campaign for a little while now, and though I posted it yesterday, I decided to go more in-depth today. ***THE SETTING*** The full setting is detailed in my last thread here(URL This is the summary of when the PCs come into it. The PCs are part of a regiment entering through the southeast gate, one of four armies from across the world marching upon the city simultaneously. Each army is immediately met with disaster in the form of huge fireballs before being set upon from all sides by undead abominations, dooming the expeditions, and gates slamming shut behind them prevent retreat and force a massacre. The PCs are all killed and tossed aside, by sheer luck landing near one another, and are brought to life as the massacre at the hands of the Lich King causes a Soul Well to appear. The Well is drained immediately, as the PCs stand, and the players will find themselves invisible to undead forces for one hour. An NPC who attempted to warn the army, but went unnoticed, may call to the PCs and lure them into relative safety in the sewer system before giving them a brief explanation of the city (as much as he understands). He will suggest the PCs go to The Puddles before departing there himself. ***THE DISTRICTS*** Absalom is a big city, divided into districts to make it more manageable. These districts have since become their own ""biomes,"" distinct from one another in the dangers that exist there. Here's a map of Absalom, if you want a visual aid for the next wall-of-text: URL **Foreign Quarter** The tight-packed Foreign Quarter is where the more cruel of the Lichs schemes came to fruition: the planting of a new, advanced strain of Ghoul Fever in a dozen houses. During the delicate process to turn himself into the lich he is now, he needed a distraction, and found one in the form of the Ghoul outbreak; every fallen citizen joined his army in a matter of minutes while his modified spell of quickening still affected the disease, and what began as a horror escalated into a nightmare. Now the ghouls roam these streets in packs, originally intelligent but driven feral by hunger, and unable to eat their undead brethren. Despite being ordered quite specifically to stay in this district, raiding parties regularly venture out to claim the lives of any living creature in the surrounding districts, especially at night. Ghasts rule here, commanding their small packs of abominations, but there is no formal leadership over the entire district; the ghouls often turn into wild, ravenous animals long before they can begin to rally, regaining some sense only after every meal. The Soul Well here is relatively unguarded, but finds itself uncomfortably nearby where a clutch of ghouls has elected to nest, forced by overpopulation to stay anywhere else (as the undead are instinctively pushed away from the Soul Well, they stay only out of necessity, making them generally uneasy and therefore difficult to surprise). **The Coins** The Coins represents one of the more interesting of the Lich Kings surprise acquisitions; a young Shadow Dragon had been monitoring him, keeping tabs on his whereabouts and successes as he walked the path to become what he is now, and was ready for when the Lich King assaulted Absalom. As soon as the battle was decided, while the city still burned and the living still fled, a band of kobolds suddenly strode through the southeastern gate and sprinted straight to The Coins, setting up camps and beginning excavations. While the Lich King was initially angered by this, upon discovering that they had cloaked a Shadow Dragon and smuggled him into a newly-excavated cavern, he allowed them to stay and obey the dragon, who was made a general of the Lich Kings armies. The shadow dragon himself wants to see the Lich King succeed, and counting himself as the necromancers oldest friend, has no doubt that the world will be more or less handed over to him as soon as he requests it of the necromancer. This is, of course, absurd, not least of all because despite the long period of observance over the Lich King while he was still a man, the two never even met until the kobold tribes swift invasion of Absalom. The most amusing part of this is how the kobolds arrived; initially, it was a small contingent of kobolds riding on a carpet and constantly casting Invisibility on the dragon himself, and only a few hours after the dragon landed did the rest of the tribe stream in and get to work. So far as any eyewitnesses know, the kobolds came in on a flying carpet (which was on the dragons back, so that the kobolds did not defile their master by touching him) and immediately went underground. The kobolds have since, at their masters orders, begun grabbing anything of value they can find, preferably gold and gemstones. The dragon chose his district carefully, and has amassed a truly impressive hoard in an incredibly short amount of time. The Soul Well in this area is seen by the kobolds as being a waste of time, and they have completely ignored it, somewhat comically leaving only it standing as they stole everything else in the bank vault that it sprung up in. Having emptied the building, kobolds rarely enter now, except for the occasional bored hopeful thinking they may have missed something (the floor is littered with foot-deep divots born of similar thinking). **Ivy District** The boundaries of the Ivy District have been largely ignored by the Lich King as he divvied up the city for his forces to inhabit; deemed too small by all to be a worthwhile holding, it has instead been meshed into being a part of the 3 districts surrounding it, cutting it up equally between them. Secretly, however, this area serves as a headquarters for the cunning Lizardmen, who see at last an opportunity to retake the surface from the mammals, and have planted their fellows disguised as humans all across the city to spy on the proceedings. They are quite pleased with this Lich King, and the ancient Lizardman Royal who slumbered in this area has at last been awakened for the coming of the new Age of Scales. They are aware of almost everything in the city, and are currently working on a means to harvest the Soul Wells themselves, one having sprung up deep in their own lair. The Lizardmen are a crafty bunch, and will be difficult to track, difficult to discover, and difficult to defeat. They are closer than any other group in the city to discovering the secret to harvesting the Soul Well, and if the PCs take too long to discover their lair, their leader might be able to ingest the Soul Well himself, increasing his power drastically and leading to a race to claim the remaining Soul Wells. **Precipice Quarter** This quarter is the most volatile of all the districts; it has been nicknamed the Chaos Quarter by those who remain to name things. Goblins, bugbears, and boggards all streamed into Absalom immediately after it fell to pledge fealty to the Lich King, who in life was well-known to them. Mildly annoyed at their appearance, the Lich King decided to keep them all, but to confine them to this single district, as allowing them to roam farther would have them either killed or destroying far more of the city than should be allowed. The boggards wasted no time in reducing as much as the precipice quarter to a swamp as they could, the bugbears swiftly built hideouts and ranger towers across the district, and the goblins have basically just been lighting things on fire until they pass out. These three factions try their best to stay out of each other's ways when working on their respective projects, but inevitably tensions rise as one groups goals run counter to anothers, and a fight always breaks out. The three, by some coincidence, discovered the Soul Well at the same time, and after another fight over who should get it, their leaders convened and agreed to just leave it alone, vowing that no one should go near it lest incurring the wrath of all. Naturally, every faction posted spies surrounding the immediate area to ensure the peace is kept and try to take the well at the first opportunity. Tensions are already high between these three factions, and though little remains of the Precipice Quarter to begin with, if it is revealed that every group betrayed the other, a final battle will break out with all the parties attacking in full force and reduce the entire area to rubble and ash. Due to the volatile and generally annoying nature of the living races in this quarter, all but the mindless undead stay out (even the beasts know to avoid an area constantly on fire). **The Docks** Since the occupying of Absalom, the docks have been largely abandoned. What ships were at port were sunk by either the Lich King himself or the creation of the vicious whirlpool that now guards the bay. The docks themselves have been repurposed, turned into makeshift ramps to allow for cargo to be easily transported into the waters. The Sahuagin are currently using this to receive weapons, and occasionally armaments, from the forges in the North.The couriers bringing such armaments are typically simple undead, such as zombies, and skeletal warhorses are being used as beasts of burden. Ultimately, the sahuagin dont need anything being sent to them, but having been without new equipment for so long has made them greedy, and the fact that they now have a surplus of new weapons to choose from has them positively giddy. The sahuagin come out of the water every few hours to poke around the dock area, searching through warehouses and homes alike, convinced that there is something of value in this part of town, somewhere. This area, though technically controlled by the sahuagin, is largely inhabited by kobolds and merfolk, who squabble over this area as much as they do the Puddles; the kobolds here search for treasure, while the mermen remain paranoid that the kobold are attempting to sniff out the merfolks lair (which lies in the docks region; the kobolds dont understand this, and assume that it lies in the ocean somewhere). The merfolk decided to set up their lair in the Docks after finding the Soul Well here; their leader has ascertained that it is some kind of magical item, and that it could give him great power if he could understand how to harness it. It hasnt occurred to him that there are many Soul Wells scattered across Absalom, but he has placed the Well itself under constant guard and rarely leaves its side for his research. **Wise Quarter** The Wise Quarter is probably the most brutal of the four battle districts, featuring garish displays of decapitated limbs and hanging skeletons throughout. Rather than being maintained by undead forces, this district has been relinquished as living quarters for an orc tribe, cunning and dangerous. They utilized the confusion during the four armies invasion of the dead Absalom, allowing troops to split themselves up as they attempted to retreat into brutal traps set in the alleyways or found themselves ambushed while fleeing. Do to their uncharacteristically non-confrontational nature, this quarter saw the highest initial survival rate of any of the battle districts (except the Petal District) but managed to track down nearly all of the military forces before they had even managed to escape the district. This orc tribe is now quite proud of their new furnishings for the former vice-capital of Absalom, which in addition to gore include cunning and brutal traps designed two-fold: to catch any survivors that attempt to travel out of the district, or those who have resigned themselves to eaking out a meager existence within its confinement, and to kill each other, a sick game played to see who among them is the most crafty and brutal. Though their leader openly objects to these traps, harshly reprimanding any who are found to have contributed to the practice, he himself has placed more of these kinds of traps in secret than anyone else. The Soul Well in this area sprung up in the middle of an exhibit in the museum, much to the annoyance of the orcs, and after several attempts by the chieftain to affect the structure, has been ordered off-limits and placed under constant (if somewhat lax) guard. The orc chieftain claims this is to protect the ghost water in case it is somehow instrumental to the downfall of the Lich King, but in truth is scared that another orc will figure out what the Soul Well is for, causing him to lose a great deal of credibility and pride in the process. **Petal District** The Petal District experienced the least overall devastation of the four battle districts, thanks to an unbelievably powerful archmage leading the army. Seeing the fireballs strike the other locations gave the mage enough time to rally himself and all his spellcasters into creating a shield as their army retreated, and while some of the army was killed by the attacking undead on all sides, they were largely able to fight them off. The entire force, understanding that the battle was lost, escaped as swiftly as possible and lost only 20% of their army-- unscathed in comparison to the other attacking forces. In the end, the spellcasters of the army were totally drained by the endeavor, and many collapsed from exhaustion. As a result, the population of undead in this district was actually decreased by the attack, making it a relative success. The Lich King, understanding this to be the point of highest vulnerability and the only remaining force that could hope to threaten him, assigned the bulk of his forces to stay prepared by the gates, reinforcing them where they can. Here can be found specters, wraiths and ghosts from Eastgate, zombies and skeletons from Westgate, kobolds, and basically every monster from every other district. In essence, the district is an amalgamation of monsters; while this sounds difficult to traverse due to sheer density, most forces are centralized on the gate itself, and very few of the factions actually get along with one another. While its likely the party will see enemies here, it is unlikely they will be spotted, and even if they are its possible that their would-be pursuers are too preoccupied with a squabble to do anything about it. The Soul Well here coalesced into a somewhat unlikely area, the former living quarters of a lord and accountant killed during the initial attack on Absalom and turned into a vampire. He will try to lure the party into this room to rest, and then use his rogue training to execute them all. Its possible for the PCs to be made aware of his undead nature if he lures them this far; he is unable to see the Soul Well, after all, and will be utterly confused if it is brought up. **Eastgate** The Eastgate region is another one infested with the dead after the massacre, but in a different way. While the dead from the western attack were transformed into a shambling mass barely resembling their original selves, the Eastgate dead suffered a far worse fate. In flexing his new extension of power over the dead and dying (for the Lich King was quite skilled in his command of death, even before gaining divine essence) he decided to attempt to hold as many of the dead in this realm, bound as his servants, as his power would allow. As it turns out, his power was greater than even he expected, and the entire army is now a mass of ghosts in varying degrees of servitude. The most powerful of these became Wraiths, joining their brethren in the Westgate for slime-feeding, many of the captains became Ghosts, many of the more formidable soldiers became Specters, and the rest were forced to anchor their souls to nearby objects. This district, as a result, is by far the most difficult to pass through unnoticed, and one of the most dangerous places to be caught. Weapons and armor have been left lining the streets, since the bulk of the slime-feeding operation is still focusing on other areas of the city, but all of the more valuable armor and weapons have been possessed, as have many homes. In truth, the Lich King has elected to attempt a new experiment after he has ascended to godhood, and attempt to convert many of the spirits in this quarter into liches (who will serve as his prophets and priests in the world). The PCs should avoid this area if at all possible, and being caught means being swarmed by Ghosts who will attempt to possess the PCs and then march them straight to the slime (even if there is no slime-- very, very few have been captured this way, and so the ghosts are not kept in the loop of current events). The Soul Well here is the only one to have been formed after the lich kings ascension, a result of his soul-experiment, and lies directly in the middle of the ruined army, at the center of the blast zone for the super-fireball that decimated their numbers. Soul Wells being invisible to the undead, he remains unaware of it. **Ascendant Court** Ascendant Court, once the seat of power in Absalom and a bustling city center, has become the stuff of nightmares. Shoggoths stalk the streets here, summoned from deep from within the Underdark by the Lich King when he first took power, and this is the only part of the city the undead ruler watches over personally. His undead raven companion, Letum, circles tirelessly overhead, watching for intruders and directing the Shoggoths where to look as well as keeping in constant communication with the Lich King over the state of his kingdom. There are many valuable treasures to be found in the Ascendant Court, most of which are magical in nature, but to attempt to raid this area is likely a mistake. Also in the Ascendant Court is the Starstone Cathedral, where the Lich King currently works on bringing down the magical barriers that protect the Starstone, which currently occupies all of his time and concentration. The barriers around it were created by one of the most powerful gods to ever live, and only because that god is now dead can the Lich King defuse his magic at all. It will take the Lich King about 2 months to defuse the magic after the PCs arrive, and once he has done so, there will be a 4 hour period of attuning to the Starstone during which he will actually be particularly vulnerable, and all the denizens of Absalom will know what is transpiring. If he succeeds in his goal, then he ascends to godhood, and his first order of business is to pluck Absalom from the ground and deposit it at the bottom of the sea, using the Water Gem to create an impassible current around it and the Earth Gem to force terrible earthquakes preventing any attempt at tunneling in from underneath. His mortal soul securely anchored, his godly soul is free to do as it will with nearly unlimited power. **Azlanti Keep** Azlanti Keep is a strategic point, one of only a few meaningfully established as an offensive position. It was from here that the Lich King rained fire upon the armies, dealing the first and decisive blow of the attack, and the keep itself houses the undead necromancers next plot: a simple dungeon slime, being constantly fed and grown to absurd size. In the beginning of the campaign, it will be barely larger than an average slime, but as the shambling corpses of the armies are fed into it (and converted into skeletons in the process) the slime will grow to immense proportions; unchecked, it will be grown into a building-absorbing monstrosity visible above the rooftops of the city, and will then be unleashed upon the ragtag remainders of the four armies that initially assaulted the city, forcing their ultimate defeat and retreat by engine powered by their own flesh. Azlanti Keep is, therefore, a sort of undead factory, pumping zombies in one end and skeletons out the other. Fire giants from the south have bolstered the ranks here, allowed safe passage through the harbor by the Lich King before their ship was sunk and sent to the Sahuagin. They run the factory, working iron and any other metal they are brought from all over the city into weapons for their new troops as well as keeping the assembly line of undead moving as swiftly as possible through the slime. The slime itself is a large, dumb creature that, by the time the PCs encounter it (unless they venture to Azlanti Keep within a few days of their arrival in Absalom) has grown to the size of a small house. Unmolested, it can grow to dwarf even the largest buildings in Absalom, at which point it will be almost unstoppable. Fortunately, it is still a slime, and hasnt had its route set yet. Although it will attack any creature that crosses its path, it can still be programmed to do whatever the first mage to attempt the process tells it to do. There are other methods of dealing with it as well; removing a series of magical totems spaced throughout its enormous mass will cause it to revert to a normal slime, splitting into as many normal-sized dungeon slimes as it has mass to form; burning it will evaporate its body mass, reducing its size; and attacking the central slime in the center of the mass will attack the enchantments holding the slime together directly (this slime is only slightly more durable than an average dungeon slime, and destroying it dissolves the membrane holding the slimes mass in, which is basically acid. In other words, it floods the immediate area with acid). The Fire Giants feel at home, however, the temperature inside having been risen to absurd temperatures. The areas right next to the furnaces are dangerously hot, dealing 1d4 Constitution damage to any character without fire resistance per round, halved on characters wearing relatively light armor and doubled on characters wearing heavy armor. The entire facility is warm enough that characters in heavy armor will find themselves overheating rather easily, with medium-armored characters overheating only after exerting themselves. The furnaces themselves are using the power of the Fire Gem itself to heat metals, a typhoon of fire having been conjured down the makeshift chimneys. These furnaces could potentially be weaponized, if the PCs can find a way to funnel the fire out of the furnaces. The area the slime is kept is comfortably cool, in stark contrast to the rest of the area, and is the only reprieve from the stifling heat permeating the area. The giants will attack any intruder they find, even hapless, lost and confused undead, with vigorous glee; they are a warrior culture at heart, and joined the Lich King under the assumption that there would be glorious battle to be had against the kingdoms of men. Their overeagerness for a fight can be used to their detriment, luring them into traps for intelligent PCs, or away from their posts for stealthy ones. In a head-on fight, they prefer brute strength over strategy, but are not foolish; an obviously bad situation will result in their retreating and regrouping, but if retreating from a battle would mean losing it, they would rather fight and die. The top of Azlanti Keep houses the Fire Gem, which appears to be a large red ruby, warm to the touch. Upon arriving within its sphere of influence, the temperature is immediately raised to that of an oven; unless the PCs have found some way of combatting heat, they take Constitution damage equal to that of the areas near the furnaces. The Fire Elemental itself is a being of pure rage; it eschews all strategy for sheer force, thinking itself unstoppable and acting accordingly. All spaces the PCs attempt to stand on or move through become caltrops, they each burst into flames (dealing 1d10 damage per turn) and the Elemental will position himself between as many enemies as possible in order to maximize how quickly they burn. If the PCs are in control of the Water Gem, the wielder can focus his power, removing him from the fight (and forcing DC15 Concentration checks if they take damage) but negates all of these effects, shrouding the area in mist and leaving a completely average Fire Elemental for the party to kill. This may or may not be immediately apparent to the PC wielding the gem. Removing the Fire Gem from its stem cools down Azlanti Keep, and any remaining fire giants within, realizing what has happened, will attempt to flee the wrath of the Lich King by hiding in the city and hoping the barriers surrounding it fall. If they do, the giants flee North, towards the mountains from which they came, but after a week all of the remaining giants are discovered by the Lich Kings army and captured, told they will be allowed to live if they reclaim the gem, and then sent to hunt down the PCs. If they manage to reclaim the gem, their leader will think himself unstoppable and, unless the PCs get the gem again, will challenge the Lich King to a battle (in which he stands no chance). **Shipwreck Castle** Shipwreck Castle is the amalgamation of hundreds of shipwrecks from the bay both before and after the founding of Absalom as a city. They have been arranged deep at the bottom of the ocean into a shantytown of sodden wood surrounding a great, majestic castle, made of coral, wrecked ships, and occasionally stone. The wrecks are adorned with all manner of aquatic life, and are constantly circled by sharks eager to please their Sahuagin masters. Towards the outskirts of the bay, however, another battle rages; a battalion of merfolk soldiers tracking a known band of murderers has discovered the Sahuagin settlement here, and have sworn to destroy both it and them, laying an underwater siege to the bay. Most of the Sahuagin forces are deployed among the many shipwrecks here with their shark companions, engaging in guerilla warfare with the well-armed merfolk and generally winning due to physical superiority and a better knowledge of the area. If the PCs venture this far south, they may be captured by the merfolk after being rescued from a group of Sahuagin, and upon explaining their predicament, the merfolk will grudgingly agree to aid them on the grounds that the Sahuagin are wiped from the area afterwards. This aid may come in the way of magical weapons, armor, or trinkets. Of course, bad diplomacy on the part of the PCs could quickly turn the whole situation south and force them to fight their way out of the merfolks forward operating base. The Sahuagin themselves built this small city rather purposefully beneath the largest trade hub in the world, collecting the treasures that occasionally fell out of a ship and keeping their existence a closely guarded secret. Their existence was unknown to even the Lich King himself until he came to the depths to plant his Water Gem, whereupon he found them staunch followers and supporters, eager to be able to pillage the riches of the town at their own leisure rather than surviving off its scraps and lost trinkets. The Sahuagin will fight to the death in service of the Lich King, and refuse to speak to anyone else. The Sahuagin King believes himself to be the final defender of the Water Gem, though this is not strictly true; the Lich King sees the whirlpool as convincing enough for people to stay away from the harbor, but has secretly left a patient and cunning Death Tyrant lurking in the shadows of the shattered hulls with orders to stop anyone who would try for the gem. The Death Tyrant himself is a crafty one, and will follow PCs as soon as he is alerted to their presence, staying out of sight while trying to cause the environment to kill them (breaking the ceiling, breaking the floor, calling attention to the area theyre in, etc.) Its only after no other defenders stand between the PCs and the Water Gem that the Death Tyrant will interfere directly, but being submerged for so long has softened what remains of his body, weakening him significantly for the fight (adjust CR to 10). Once the PCs reach the water gem, they will be forced to undergo a series of Athletics checks to avoid being blown away by an incredibly powerful undercurrent which cuts through all magic. The Water Elemental itself will attack as normal, but PCs must succeed on a DC 13 Perception check every round to be able to see it while it remains submerged. Upon being struck by the creature, a DC 15 Wisdom save must be succeeded, or else it will reclaim the energy transferred to the rings and leave the PC drowning at the bottom of the ocean (they have 1+CON before they drop to 0 hit points and begin to die. They cannot be stabilized until they can breathe again). Defeating the elemental ends the undertow, as well as any other effects caused by it, and restores the rings. Removing the gem will end the whirlpool above, and the ensuing backlash of magical energy rips the sea floor apart correspondingly (the PCs are protected from this destruction if they are within 15 feet of the gem). This bombardment will all but erase Shipwreck Castle from existence, leaving few Sahuagin alive, and those that do live will retreat out of the bay into the depths of the ocean rather than face the seemingly unstoppable PCs. **Sub-Absalom** There is a city beneath a city, many miles below, at the bottom of the bottomless pit surrounding the Starstone Citadel. Sub-Absalom is a pre-existing city of troglodytes beneath Absalom. They have been rallying in support of the new Lich King, but have hardly been left to their own devices. Duergar and Drow seek to undermine them subversively, in the hopes of taking their place alongside the Lich King, and will help the PCs in their quest only so long as it serves to make the Troglodytes look bad. The Duergar will attempt to thwart any plan that seems to be going too well in an attempt to seriously hurt the Lich Kings efforts, doing anything except for supporting either Drow or Troglodyte in the fight against the PCs (despite sharing a goal, duergar are too proud to assist or accept assistance). The Drow, on the other hand, secretly wish for the Lich King to be thwarted in his scheme, not trusting him to control any more power than he already does. Openly they will support him, and speak of wishing to stand by him, but if it becomes clear that a serious blow is about to be struck they will lend their support in as untraceable a manner as possible. The Troglodytes themselves believe the Lich King to be the fulfilment of an ancient Troglodyte prophecy, a sort of messiah for their people that will lead them back to the surface and lay waste to their enemies, returning them to the top of the food chain. As such, they will fight with vindictive zealotry, and have become overconfident enough to have opened hostilities with their neighbors (and, indeed, anyone not sent specifically by the Lich King himself), thinking themselves invincible. If it can be revealed to the troglodytes that the Lich King is NOT the messiah they think he is, they will rally against him and join the PCs struggles, their scorned pride overwhelming their hatred of outsiders momentarily. (It is possible to change their sides by correctly interpreting a series of hieroglyphs deep in one of the temples of Sub-Absalom, and then explaining it to them; the troglodytes were once a more intelligent people than they are now, and so have misinterpreted the glyphs). The Lich King, though amused at the troglodytes zealotry, suspects that they may turn on him (or arent staunch enough defenders on their own), and as such has bolstered the defense of his Earth Gem with a small host of undead minions and constructs, lead by a relatively inexperienced Vampire captain. The vampire is not the most powerful minion that could be stationed there, but due to Sub-Absalom being such a closely-guarded secret, the Lich King feels a stronger captain is unnecessary, and instead ordered these minions to hold the gates or roam the streets. This quarter contains a Soul Well, which sprung up towards the outskirts of the Troglodyte city and attracted some attention before being dismissed as just some weird undead thing. Only a few Troglodytes stay near it (because of curiosity, and not to defend it) and will retreat as soon as it becomes apparent that they are outmatched as a result. The Earth Gem itself is buried deep in the Troglodyte Catacombs, a labyrinth littered with undead and dungeon-dwelling creatures even before the Lich Kings rise. He has since bolstered its defenses, and used the gem itself to construct the room it is now housed in. The Earth Gem was placed more recently than any other gem, its having been used to construct most of the others resting places, and as such commands the weakest of the Elementals (adjust Earth Elemental CR to 3) but has dangerous control of its surroundings, and will use this control against the party to create all manner of hazards (ceiling falling, ground opening, spikes forming, walls closing/forming, etc.) to hamper the PCs as soon as they walk through the door. Killing the Earth Elemental returns the room to its original form. **The Puddles** The Puddles has always been a somewhat neglected area, but recent times have turned the tables quite favorably. Since theres never been anything in the Puddles worth keeping anyway, and since many of the beings that live there arent exactly unhappy with what happened to the rest of Absalom, its relative unimportance is finally working in its favor. The Lich King has largely ignored the entire district, leaving it to whatever faction wishes to claim it, and so while merfolk and others squabble pettily over the area, it remains the most easily traversed area in all of Absalom, and the most populated with the still-living. The Puddles, however, is not without its dangers. A pseudo-war is being waged between several monstrous factions seeking to claim the district as their own, the most dominant contenders among them being an evil-worshipping tribe of Merfolk and the Kobold. Singular skirmishes are fought almost daily, and a more organized assault from both parties is bound to happen eventually. The living are not all to be trusted, either. Those who remain here are largely insane, or pretending to be, and only a barebones network of humans and their allies resist the encroaching races. Cutpurses and murderers still lurk in the streets, killing and stealing for survival as much as fun, and are loathe to attack any occupying force, preferring instead to prey on their own kind. Most of the humans that yet survive here, despite the conditions, will attempt to turn in the PCs for a reward if they discover who the PCs are or if they seem to have had any success in resisting the Lich Kings forces. The most interesting survivor in this quarter, however, was a notorious murderer before the Lich Kings rise who has gained a new power. A moderately wealthy lord, he would quaff water-breathing potions in order to rise from the ocean at night and commit atrocious murders, then disappear into its depths once more to ensure there was no trail to indict him. After the Lich Kings rise, however, he narrowly escaped the purging of The Coins into the sea before being nearly killed again by the activation of the great whirlpool. It was at the bottom of the ocean, his water-breathing potion running out, that he found a small orb; a concentrated nugget of water elemental energy, spawned from the particularly powerful rift resulting from the creation of the whirlpool. He quickly learned that this not only allowed him to breathe underwater, but also gave him some control over the currents immediately surrounding him, saving his life. Instead of using this power to leave, however, he has seen it as an opportunity to continue his reign of terror unchecked, there being few creatures even among occupying forces able to keep up with him on either land or sea. He can be found by a short series of murder investigations, since hes gotten rather sloppy and complacent due to the fall of the law. After defeating him, any member of the party with arcane knowledge and having already seen another gem can deduce that this essence can, with about a days work and the proper materials, be siphoned into Rings of Water Breathing (precisely as many as the party needs). **Westgate** Westgate holds one of the largest undead presences, and as a result, is one of the most difficult areas to move about freely. Wraiths wander the streets here, raising the dead and looking after them for their master. The remnants of the PCs doomed attack on the city wander the streets here as zombies or skeletons, a force of largely pushover forces made lethal through sheer numbers. To be caught here necessitates a hasty retreat, unless powerful and constant AoEs are available, or else the PCs will be swarmed. The heart of the wraiths power here is a minor cathedral that has been repurposed after a Soul Well appeared in it, guarded by skeletal minotaurs and ruled by (either a necromancer or a zombified Beholder). **Green Ridge** Here, the horrors of the undead are seen most plainly for all. Signs of lives lost litter the streets, and all manner of abomination stalk the alleyways and streets. During the day, this district is eerily abandoned, and at night it is crawling with the infestation that has overcome it. A Zombie Lord has risen in this area, and attempted to consolidate power among the other undead here, though most of them are simply mindless and therefore un-rule-able. The Soul Well in this area is totally unguarded; the undead being unable to see it, they have no idea that it even exists. There exists the danger of being spotted en-route to the Well, thanks to the tight surveillance of the entire district by all manner of small undead beasts, but a fast party could reach the Well and then lose their pursuers in a nearby district. **Merchants' Quarter** Another area overrun by undead, this is considered a sister district to the Green Ridge; here, a skeleton lord has risen, and organizes his magical brethren to arms with much more success than his zombie brother. This is a more militaristic zone, therefore, and the skeleton lord has been careful to root out all other intelligent creatures that do not have a place in his hierarchy, or that might betray him. He has, however, allowed a menagerie of monsters to nest in this district, using their inherent aggression and willingness to ignore the dead to keep watch over his territory, despite his actual forces being spread very thin. Some wild beast has laid claim to the Soul Well here, drawn to its power instinctively and made magically inclined to nest in the area. It will protect itself, and its young, with vicious ferocity, and has to fight off other animals drawn to the Soul Well regularly. By simple natural selection, this has left the most ferocious beast in the entire district nesting here. ***THE FINALE*** In the end, the PCs will muster their strength and face the Lich God in combat, utilizing all the powers at their disposal to try to usurp him. It will likely be a close-fought battle, but even if the PCs defeat him, they will have to destroy his phylactery. Once they break the small locket around his neck, it should become apparent that nothing on him is his phylactery, and if the PCs are slow to putting together the clues scattered throughout the rest of the city, the Lich King will mockingly declare the truth on his third resurrection (each of which takes a matter of minutes): the very city of Absalom is his phylactery. The PCs will have to use the rifts to elemental planes, pulling them open to wreak havoc on the city and destroy it. Once enough of the city has been destroyed, the Lich's spirit will be released, causing a large portion of it to explode rather spectacularly. So, as campaign settings go, how does that sound? Anything I'm missing? Thoughts? Questions? Suggestions?"

I know 5e is streamlined, and that's one of the great things about it. But for all the demarcations indicating damage 'type' it just doesn't matter very often. When does bludgeoning/piecing/slashing matter in this game? In one game I ran the cleric had a magic weapon that did additional damage. So everytime he hit he was telling me x slashing, y force, z radiant. It never mattered. Not according to the MM. Now vulnerability that did double damage would probably overly powerful. But you could just have vulnerability/1 to a damage type, to take one extra damage. When monsters do have abilities that make damage matter it is virtually always resistance to damage, and not vulnerability. I just think it would add something interesting to the gameplay. It would also make knowledge skills and in game research to learn monster weaknesses more valuable and interesting. Anyone else out there feel this way about damage types? Any homebrew or rules from expanded books or UA (that I clearly haven't read) that people use to address this? "

However, I want to change how it works, do something my players wouldn't expect. My current idea is that fire doesn't kill the troll, it only makes him angry. As in, he charges the guy who burned him and deals more damage angry. He is also completely unharmed by the fire, just pissed. What I want his vulnerability/kill condition to be is ice. I want my players to have to freeze the beast and then shatter his frozen body before he melts. The way I'm thinking of implementing it is that his regen is interrupted by cold damage (perhaps a second type, not entirely sure yet), and he cannot be brought below 0 by anything other than ice damage. Once he is brought to below 0 he gains an amount of temp HP (or perhaps he just has a secondary health pool) and freezes. While frozen he cannot move or act, fails str and dex throws, yada yada, only difference from paralyzed is no auto crits. He also gains vulnerability to force damage and bludgeoning damage while gaining resistance to piercing and slashing as well as immunity to cold. Cold will instead increase the duration of him being frozen. Fire will thaw him instantly. These are just my basic ideas for now. Do you guys have any ideas to build this monster?"

165,vulnerability,dndnext,"UA: Wizard - the most overpowered part, the one everyone's been overlooking.",155,5u8bk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/5u8bk3/ua_wizard_the_most_overpowered_part_the_one/,2017-02-16 03:10:06,"So, I actually don't think that the Lore Master is overpowered at all, with one exception. Remember, we're comparing this subclass to the sets of abilities that the Diviner, the Necromancer, or the Abjurer get. However, Lore Master (expertise on all knowledge skills) combined with the first half of Spell Secrets (changing the element of your spells freely) is too obviously abusable. It basically reads, taken in total: ""If the enemy has a vulnerability of any kind, then you know about it and deal double damage. Forever."" I like the feel of adaptability from the rest of the spell modifications, and a 1/short rest saving throw switch seems fairly on-par with what other subclasses get. But ""deal double damage to everything with a weakness"" is a bit much. It basically changes fireball into a straight 16d6 at level 5, for example. It's a bit much. ------ EDIT: Note, I was immediately shut down here - and I totally agree with them all. Out of 428 monsters in the MM, 20 have vulnerabilities. Seems just fine."
166,vulnerability,dndnext,"Making Damage Types Matter [House Rule, partially complete, need feedback]",16,5kkzzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/5kkzzh/making_damage_types_matter_house_rule_partially/,2016-12-28 04:54:06,"**EDIT:** _Thanks for all of the critique thus far. I've posted some new thoughts further down this page - [link](URL I've been finding myself a little disappointed lately with the bland interchangeability of D&amp;D damage types. Few monsters have any vulnerabilities, and those that have resistances usually have them very broadly, such that ""bludgeoning"" vs ""slashing"" damage ends up being little more than flavor text, and ""fire"" vs ""cold"" vs ""lightning"" means little more than whether your spell is probably spherical, conical, or line-shaped (and what color dragon to avoid using it on.) There's little to no reason to pack multiple weapons, alternate spells, or emergency flasks of alchemist's fire, acid, and holy water. I've been sketching out ideas for ways to make these types more relevant, so that the fighter might actually have a reason to sheathe her sword and pull out a morningstar, the wizard might mull over which way to cast Chromatic Orb (instead of just saying ""I dunno, acid this time""), and the rogue might pull out his alchemist's fire with a ""I knew this would come in handy!"" grin. ## House Rule #1 **All creatures have at least 1 resistance, and at least 1 vulnerability.** If I can't think of one off the top of my head, I can roll for it randomly. (Corollary: it will either be automatic or a simple knowledge check away for the PCs to learn these traits. The goal isn't to spring a ""gotcha!"" on them, but to vary the encounter texture.) * This way, there will - occasionally, at least - be points where the wizard's go-to Fireball will at least be worth second-guessing; ""these orcs bear the Sign of Fernia! maybe I should prepare Fly today"", and the fighter's trusty longsword will have moments on the wayside and moments to shine. I'll probably try to implement rule 1 in my next campaign no matter what (unless my players veto). Rule 2 is still in development and I'd love some thoughts on it. ## House Rule #2: **All damage types have a built-in side effect, in addition to whatever else their source might inflict.** There is no such thing as ""just bludgeoning damage"" or ""just cold damage"", and even something as simple as enchanting your weapon to do fire instead of slashing damage will noticeably change the way it affects the battlefield. A partial table is below. (""1 damage per 5 base"" means ""if the original spell did 16 fire damage, the side effect deals 3 fire damage"") Type | Effect | Details/Scaling -----|--------|---------------- Fire | Ongoing damage | Ongoing 1 damage per 5 base (min 1.) Save DC 10 to end. Cold | Slow | Speed reduced by 5ft, or half damage rounded down to nearest 5, whichever is higher. Acid | Vulnerability | Target is vulnerable to the next attack (but the extra damage is capped by how much acid damage was dealt) Lightning | Chain | Adjacent creatures (except the attacker) take 1 damage per 5 base (min 1.) Force | Slide | Target is slid 5 feet (or half dmg rounded down, in feet) in any direction. Poison | Delayed effect | The target takes half damage immediately, half damage at the end of their next turn, and half damage (a third time) 1 minute later. Necrotic | ??? | ??? Radiant | ??? | ??? Psychic | ??? | ??? Thunder | ??? | ??? Slashing | ??? | ? Some sort of bleed effect, either ongoing damage or ala Dark Souls' sudden spike damage Bludgeoning | ??? | ? Something related to dazing, pushing, or heavy armor? Piercing | ??? | ??? These side effects are in addition to whatever the spell or attack does normally - so e.g. Melf's Acid Arrow would still deal acid damage both immediately and at the end of the target's next turn, but would also impose vulnerability, and Ray of Frost would impose its normal automatic 10ft slowdown *plus* the 5 to 10 bonus slowdown from cold damage. Some open questions/notes: * This generally increases damage output across the board. I might want to address that in some fashion, either by giving everything (PCs and NPCs) a slight HP buff, by making it easier to get access to damage resistance, or just by cackling and rubbing my hands together and chanting ""T! P! K! T! P! K!"" * I'm reaallly trying to keep from adding too many new things that need to be calculated or rolled against, which is why most of the damage amounts or other numbers above are generated through simple math. I don't want to (for example) have to stop mid-fight to say ""oh, wait, we have to figure out the save DC for the ongoing fire damage from the torch, let me look up this kobold's Con bonus."" This is also why I don't have saving throws for most of these side effects - that could be way too many die rolls. That said, it might also make things like Shocking Grasp alarmingly powerful at the moment. * If at all possible, I want the side effects to be valid whether the source was a spell or a weapon, and whether it was an attack or a saving-throw effect. So e.g. giving bludgeoning attacks an attack bonus vs. armor isn't great, because it does nothing for the Ice Storm spell. * I'd also like the effect to scale up and down reasonably well - it should add variety and utility to cantrips without making them horribly powerful, and an adult red dragon's breath weapon should probably have more of a side effect than a level 1 caster's Burning Hands. **I'm a bit stymied for some of the damage types above, and if anyone has any ideas, I'd love to hear about it.** I considered a ""necrotic damage reduces max hp"" effect, but that affects PCs way more than it affects NPCs/monsters in most cases. I found this old post - URL - which has some specific ideas for slashing/bludgeoning/piercing that I might use as a baseline, but they don't work well for save-based damage."

168,vulnerability,dndnext,My players killed the boss with a castle;or how the deck of many things made the one shot great,32,5m30lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/5m30lp/my_players_killed_the_boss_with_a_castleor_how/,2017-01-05 11:28:07,"Crossposting here cause why not So our group wasn't going to do our normal campaigns due to missing people so I volunteered DMing for a one-shot, a first for this group. I decided on level three premade characters and an island escape scenario, I did some drilled down to essentials character sheets[\(as you can see here along with the other materials](URL simplicity, with a 14 year old female Rogue, A Balding Human Monk, A Noble Minotaur Bard and a warforged Cleric. Cleric player was using a speech synthesizer and playing a narcissistic and condescending robot to a T. Rogue player did a great Edgelord 14 year old, Monk player really hated having a bald spot being pointed out(which is ironic given the monk is 7 foot tall)and the Bard player played the cowering wimp the Minotaur was. I wasn't actually expecting four players and had just made four characters for choice but it all worked out great. The concept behind the island is a now-insane demigod kidnapped the four(The White sheets pure souls, the black sheets darkened souls)and put them on an ""abandoned"" island,that once was a Courthouse island/port, just to see how they would work together and try to escape or fail and prove his idea of absolute evil or good right. Really just a nice little sandbox island with multiple potential endings. That's all fine and would of let to a simpler campaign but if you notice on those character sheets I have ""Draw X loot cards"" which I did just to spice it up. I had 10 magic items on sticky notes I was letting people draw randomly from. - Deck of Many Things(Slight curse to appear as normal cards) - Portable Hole - A slightly altered Alchemist Fire(Just to deal damage when it breaks too) - Potion of Last Step(Returns you to your last turn(or 6 seconds prior)) - Goggles of Good Choice(25% of detective/witcher vision) - Hair of the Gorgon(Just a thrown snake with AC reducing poison cause minor Petrification) - Blade of many shapes(+1 blade that can turn into any bladed weapon) - Robe of Useful Objects - Faulty Ring of Telekenisis(20% of not working) - Pot of Stew(Alchemy Jug for Stew/Soup) So with 7 of those given out at the start(and the other 3 during the one shot)I was happy someone, the bard, got the deck of many things and she was super excited to get to use it in DnD. I wasn't really sure how this was going but I was fully prepared for a lot of improv due to deck of many shenanigans. Anyways onto the actual one shot. They all awoke in individual prison cells without remembering how they got there. Nobody but them is around and the door was unlocked so they left, found the guard post and their gear along with a map and a riddle. ""The Light can quench, the Dark can be judged, both can survive by the Knight"" - Signed M. It was intended to be an incredibly vague ""Oh thats what it meant, that makes sense"" kind of riddle as opposed to actually being solvable. Anyways, they leave that area and avoid a Skeleton encounter by not looting dead bodies. They're in a large and once beautiful courthouse and thankfully decided to leave instead of going upstairs(where they could of fought the boss right away)and left the ominous feeling area to explore the Island. Which the *moment* they got outside they wanted to use the Deck of Many things. I used DM Fiat to only let one per person for now and it worked out well. Cleric got a lv4 warforged warrior(who ended up just carrying a mirror for the Cleric later), the Bard got 50k in gems, the Monk got a magic weapon(Cestus with a reaction interrupting jab)and the Rogue got the ""Can reverse one event at any time"" but held onto it. After that they leave for the town on the island. It's abandoned(of course)and all they find is a small malnourished puppy in the pet store and the rogue/monk takes it under their wings. As they're searching the general store the puppy breaks out of the rogues grip(+1 strength v.s -4 yeesh)and runs into an alleyway where it grappled the Rogue as its revealed to be a mimic. They wipe the floor with it of course and find a large key in its belly. With a depressing mimic encounter out of the way they rested and the next day went to the Salamander Cave where they had to fight a giant wooden Salamander statue to enter the cave. Now I goofed up heavily on this part, as I had a carved Salamander I wanted to use as a mini but then didn't realize I gave everyone fire spells/items with it having vulnerability. So they made short work of it and found a healing fountain and the potion of last step in the cave, lore wise you only have to show the salamander you're not weak to pass which is a jerk move to hide a healing fountain behind. Anyways, thats when they decided to draw some more cards. This time only two and what do you know, the Bard got 2 wishes out of it. However before she could utter a wish the rogue player used his prior card to have the wish card never happened. I was actually super happy about that since I had no idea how that'd go with wishes and it was just really funny along with fitting the character well. The bard drew another card like nothing had happened(since it didn't)and got the advice one, with the only advice I gave was ""run away"" which fit multiple encounters left on the island.The rogue then drew a card and got the hate filled enemy one. So 19 days from then some guy who really hates the rogue will just constantly annoy and inconvenience her all day long until one is dead. They left for the nearby crag,saw harpies and left. Nothing really of note there anyways since it was just filler. They went to the Black Sands and found some Black Salt Golems and shipwrecks, also just leaving them be. Onto the shipyards and they find a ship in need of repair but sea-worthy so they'd have to go back to the Sands and salvage to fix it. They decide to do that later and check out the docks, see nothing on it and leave again(which would of triggered a sea serpent battle if they went on it)and slept on the boat. Earlier in the game when they first slept I told them they had horrible nightmares of the island and then on the boat had horrible nightmares of sinking in the sea and the island still. They interpreted that as to finish the island exploring first(with only the main building left)instead of just leaving so went and found a large locked door that the key they found earlier fit and went in to find an even larger edgelord. The demigod gave his little spiel and offered them two choices. Fight him in his room, the court room, or fight him in the sea if they try to flee. So they fought him there and boy did I think that fight was going to be way harder. Granted the extra fighter was useless, he literally hadn't hit a thing since he was summoned, but its a classic bad DM rolls and I loved it. Rogue had a poison ability and did almost half its HP, cleric hit every single scorching ray at 3rd level(with one crit)so that almost brought him down and just to add insult to injury the Bard had cast stinking cloud on this demigod(who was vulnerable to poison)and it failed. So this giant dark angel like demigod of justice is just puking up and down and just getting blasted with everything. He had a legendary action to stop all the white sheets or all the black sheets in place but even with that he missed our monk three times in a row(with a +8 no less)only causing the sun blade to get rid of his comb-over. It came to the bards turn in which even just slapping him with her guitar would of killed him(3 HP left)but instead she chooses to draw a card from the deck of many things in mid-combat. I loved the idea but had no idea if it'd even be combat applicable. Oh it was. Summoning a medium castle within sight range(with up to an hour to choose where)she chose to summon the castle right on top of the boss, which promptly caused a castle to fall down on top of him and now be buried beneath the stairs. They won the day, claimed the island for themselves, killed a boss with a castle(which I figured is 134 D6 damage)when it only had 3 HP left and to add insult to injury turned the bosses layer into the foyer for the castle. All in all it was a very successful one-shot with a few surprise twists but I am so glad I gave them a deck of many things, it would have been fine without it but that made it far far more memorable. Definitely using it again in the future."

This monster has a dark purple skin with amethyst colored quills that are valuable, as well as jet black wings and a tail. It has a fiendish grimace as well.

This also means that the monster can cast webs (but not quickly enough to create new webs to influence combat ***Destroy Water*** The monster can destroy water, similar to casting a Destroy Water spell. However, the water does not just vanish; it dies in a squealing burst of steam and then dissipates with a wave of moist heat. ***Stalking Between Worlds*** The monster is invisible until it attacks. ***Magic Sense*** The monster can detect magic items, spellcasters, spells, and other forms of magic within 15. ##Actions --- ***Multiattack***. The monster makes two attacks. Only one may be ember gaze. ***Gore***. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5, 1 target. *Hit:* 14 (2d10+2) piercing damage. ***Ember Gaze (Recharge 3-6)***. *Ranged Spell Attack:* +x to hit, range 40, 1 target. *Hit:* 27 (6d8) fire damage. X is the controlling Spellcaster's spellcasting ability. So I imagined this thing looking like a smallish torso held up by 4 long insect legs that attach at the shoulders then having two arms attached at the hips, that manipulate its webs. It has a singular red multifaceted eye. It stalks and eats magical things but can subsist on regular substances. Thoughts on mechanics or flavor are welcome. I forgot to mention both of these creatures are intended to be controlled by a spellcaster. The ember gaze is only usable when the creature is being controlled. "

Brom and Bonsai, don't you dare read any of this. I'm currently running a 2-man Coliseum themed campaign. Last night my Level 8 PC's began a weekend event in the Arena which is essentially a 2-day dungeon crawl. It's set up so that there are 4 sets of combatants, all diving into separate magical dungeons, so that the audience has 48 full hours of entertainment (with groups entering 4 hours apart). One of the main themes of the dungeon is that it's populated by a bunch of experimental creatures, created by the wizard residing in the dungeon. The creatures are modeled after Slivers from MTG, so individually they aren't all that strong, but they all have abilities and attributes that are then shared with other Slivers they are in the presence of. What I am looking for from you is unique and interesting ideas for attributes the Slivers could share, and also for funny or interesting failed experiments. I plan on having them find a room with a bunch of failed creations, which aren't directly as deadly but have random and weird magical effects. So, maybe when the failed Sliver is struck, the attacking PC has an effect similar to something from the Wild Surge table take place (this is more for the sake of interest as opposed to danger). My current Sliver ideas are as follows: *Battle Sliver*: +2/+2 to attack and damage *Burrow Sliver*: Adds burrowing speed *Elemental Sliver*: Provides elemental type and correlated resistance/vulnerability *Breath Weapon Sliver*: Provides a breath weapon based off the elemental Type *Armored Sliver*: +2 AC *Tailed Sliver*: Causes Slivers to grow a tail that can grapple and restrain Failed Creation Column: *Splitting Sliver*?: Causes slivers to split into weaker/smaller Slivers when damage is taken *Telepathic Sliver*: provides telepathy within 30 ft, but the slivers have low INT and it's mostly reptilian nonsense, with notes on desk reading something like ""NO MORE TELEPAHY, SO ANNOYING"" So, let me know what you would add! I want to hear all of your interesting ideas, be they dangerous or funny!! "

I see some fairly neat ideas and things I would incorporate into my 5th ed game. But I'd like to see some of the more unique magic items that a PC might find. Of course I never show up to a party empty handed so here are a few I've created as well. I encourage you to either use these yourself or show me how to make them better! I'd hate to have left a crazy loophole in something. Fey Ring of Fire Upon activation by magic word this item has several effects: 100% chance to set user on fire for 1d4+2 rounds Roll d% for additional effect (21-100) give user fire immunity for duration of above effect (9-20) give user fire immunity for 1d2+1 rounds (5-8) give user fire resistance for 1d2+1 rounds (1-4) give user fire vulnerability for 1 round The fire from this ring does 1d10 damage to any creature that starts it's turn within 5 feet of the wearer. The ring is able to be used once per short rest Removing the ring after the effect begins immediately ends any of its additional effects, but does not extinguish the fire. _________________________________________________________________________________________ Cloak of the Forgotten Assassin Upon activation roll a D20 and check the table below: (2-20) Success: The user of this cloak may add their proficiency bonus to a stealth check, even if they are already proficient at it.

It will sell these items for twice their standard value, and will buy items from its summoner at half their standard value. It will not take an item of no value. This merchant is unable to store items for its summoner, additionally once an item has been sold to the merchant it is not available to be bought back, even at its double value. To the summoner of the merchant it will appear as a ghostly figure with no specific details visible, when it produces an item it appears to reach up to a shelf or into a bag depending on the items requested as though it was in a storefront. Those watching this transaction will not see any item until it has been placed in the summoner's hands.

174,vulnerability,dndnext,Help with encounter Balance,1,4za2k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/4za2k6/help_with_encounter_balance/,2016-08-24 11:41:55,"First off, if youre currently working for an eccentric mage named Arthur Davenport and his pet pseudo-dragon, piss off youll find this all out next week. &amp;nbsp; Id like a little of feedback on an encounter I have planned for my group. To give some background, I currently have 8 level 5 PCs. For this upcoming fight well have all 8 players at the table. We have a Vengeance Paladin, Totem Barbarian, Land Druid, Battlemaster Fighter, Beast Ranger, Death Cleric, Abjuration Wizard and a Lore Bard. &amp;nbsp; The party have come across the remains of a long dead green dragon. The beast was killed in its lair and so the party find themselves in a room full of goodies with no apparent defences. After some shenanigans the party look up to see the skeletal remains of the dragon re-animating in front of them and this is where we called the session for the night. &amp;nbsp; Upto this point I dont think the party has had real challenge so my goal with this encounter is to create something that poses a real danger to the party, but hopefully not too dangerous, that if the party and smart about will be able to take down. &amp;nbsp; To that end, I have taken /u/DieGiantMonsterDies skeleton template (found [here]( URL and applied to a Green Dragon to get a base idea and have then done some tweaks as well. By my calculations the difficulty for this encounter is around CR 10. &amp;nbsp; Armor Class | 17 :--: | :--: Hit Points | 200 Speed | 40 &amp;nbsp; STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: 23 | 12 | 15 | 6 | 8 | 5 &amp;nbsp; **Damage Immunities** Poison **Condition Immunities** Exhausted, Poisoned **Damage Vulnerability** Bludgeoning **Senses** Darkvision 60ft. &amp;nbsp; **Multiattack.** The Dragon can make three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. **Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage. **Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage. **Poison Aura.** With no way to properly contain the gas cloud, this Skeletal Dragon instead emits a poisonous aura. If a character ends it turn within melee range of the dragon it takes 6 (2d6) poison damage. &amp;nbsp; At some point in the fight the dragon will attempt to take flight and escape. Given that its wings no longer have any substance though the dragon is unable to flee, instead managing to rise off the ground 10-15 feet before slamming back down. Anyone within a 50 feet radius must make a Dexterity (DC 15) saving throw. On a failed save they take 2d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; All feedback is most welcome. Anything you think I can should change to make the encounter more fun, rewarding etc. No number here is set in stone and everything can be adjusted. My biggest fear is that the party will either just beat down on this thing within 2 or 3 rounds, or the fight will go on so long that the dragon wins by attrition. &amp;nbsp; Edit: I have made some changes to the monster and uploaded it as a Word Doc [here](URL as I really couldn't be fucked with mark-up editing. &amp;nbsp; TL;DR &amp;nbsp; * AC decreased to allow party to hit more frequently. * HP increased to lower possibility of a boring 1 round encounter. * Strength lowered slightly, hit bonuses and damage adjusted accordingly. * Legendary actions introduced. Giving the dragon a way to summon ""adds"" to soak up party actions and provides interaction with terrain. "

I have a player cursed with lychantropy. He is a wereboar and we kinda homebrewed it since the one from the MM felt a bit to strong. The MM states (pg 207 and 209) that a player get a strength score of 17 unless its higher, +1 to AC in boar and hybrid form, immunities to all bludgeoning, slashing and piercing damage unless its a silvered weapon and a charge that deals 2d6 damage aswell as a chance to knock creatures prone if they fail a save. We changed it to vulnerability to silvered weapons and normal damage from the rest. No change to the AC and since his strength was higher than 17 already we just ignored that. And for the charge we just removed the knocking creatures prone but he always deal the 2d6 damage if he moves towards a creature in a straight line. He also gained the keen smell trait that grants him advantages on perception checks based on smell. At the start this was fine, there was a sidequest to find a mentor to help him control his feral side since he changed uncontrolled at the start of combat, d20 roll, 1-5 boar, 6-15 human and 16-20 wereboar. Now he can shapeshift at will but he wanted to get stronger so he made a deal with a alchemist to be experimented on. This resulted in a village getting slaughtered aswell as some bad magic happening to infuse him with more power. The powerup resulted in that he can shift to a giant boar instead of a boar and a improved charge: &gt; Charge (Boar or Hybrid form only). If you move atleast 10 feet in a straight line towards a target the target takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. If you hit the target with a melee attack you can choose to knock it back 10 feet, knock it prone or trample it, you can only do this once a turn. The creature must succeed on a DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your strength modifier or be knocked back/prone. The trample damage is determined by the amount of feet the charge is, you add 1 extra d6 for every 5 feet above 10. This is quite strong, and im looking for some drawbacks to balance it out a bit. So far he has disadvantage on ALL wisdom, intelligence and charisma checks and saves while raging. Im basicly looking for things to add on depending on how long he is in other forms, and somehow tie it together. Preferably stuff that focuses on his rage or animal/feral side and the use of that. "
176,vulnerability,dndnext,Magic Item Questions,11,4qmas6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/4qmas6/magic_item_questions/,2016-07-01 01:35:45,"New DM here... Let's say my players find an ""Armor of Vulnerability"". The DMG states that ""handling a magical item gives the character a sense that something is extraordinary about it"". Does that mean that characters have a built-in Detect Magic when it comes to items? So as soon as they touch this ""Armor of Vulnerability"" they'd pretty much know it's magic? My second question: the DMG says that the short rest identification would not reveal the curse on this particular item. I'm guessing that means that they *would* see the positive aspects of the item?"
177,vulnerability,dndnext,An analysis of the 5e weapon design (xpost r/dnd),56,4n4mwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/4n4mwh/an_analysis_of_the_5e_weapon_design_xpost_rdnd/,2016-06-08 21:55:45,"Background: I'm planning to do a homebrew rework of the 5e weapons system to make the choices more meaningful. I started by closely examining the current system, and have found that a lot of the design choices don't seem to make much sense. Of the 37 weapons in the PHB, 11 serve no gameplay purpose. Feats could be added to make certain weapons better, but it would be preferable to make a weapon choice viable without feats involved. In addition, some of the weapon properties could be tidied up a bit. From a balance perspective, it is obvious that martial weapons, which require additional proficiency, should be better than their simple counterparts, if only slightly. Positive weapon properties such as Finesse, Light, Reach,Thrown and Versatile, should come at a cost of damage, while negative properties such as Two-handed, Loading and Heavy should come with extra damage, in comparison to a weapon with no properties. Some weapons appear to be primitive or improvised weapons that can be wielded by enemies for theme. It would probably to easier to cut them out, and just have them as flavor for enemy attacks. In terms of damage types, there are relatively few monsters that have a specific resistance or vulnerability to bludgeoning, slashing or piercing damage. Poison can be applied to to the latter two, making them generally slightly better than bludgeoning. Regardless, I will treat weapon variants with different damage types as having a purpose. The weapons players use will generally be starting gear, or magical versions found as loot. This makes the costs relatively unimportant. Weight is also a slight negative, but only a handful of weapons are outside the 2-6 lb range. --- Now, on to the weapons themselves. I won't mention every one, only those that vary from expectation. * The greatclub and mace are both made pointless by the quarterstaff, which can function as either as required. * The spear is even better, as it can be thrown, and apply poison * The javelin can be thrown further than the spear, but doesn't get extra damage from 2 hand melee. This is fine. * The trident is the martial version of the spear. It costs and weighs more, but is identical otherwise. This is the hardest decision to justify from all the weapons. * The flail is just a warhammer without the versatile property. * The glaive and halberd are literally identical. * The morningstar is literally a heavier and more expensive version of the warpick. * The club is a light hammer that can't be thrown. EXCEPT, any weapon can be thrown (1d4 20/60), which is the same as the light hammer. Why aren't the d4 weapons just listed as being throwable? * The sickle is a handaxe that does less damage. * Ranged weapons all have their own niche. Darts are worse versions of daggers, but are 40 times cheaper, so they get a pass. Now for some slightly more contentious ones - * The whip is 2 dice sizes weaker than the rapier, in exchange for reach. The other reach weapons only lose 1 dice size. * The Heavy property is basically unnecessary. Every 2-handed martial weapon is heavy, and ONLY these ones are heavy. The only exception is the lance, which is a special case anyway. * If the heavy property is to be kept, the greatclub should certainly have it. It weighs more than the greataxe, which *is* heavy. * Why does the blowgun require martial training? Is it really harder to use than a shortbow, crossbow, or sling? Additionally, it probably needs a special property of not revealing your position or alerting the enemy on a miss. * Strangely, the hand crossbow has the Light property, which only affects melee attacks. This is only useful when using it to bash someone as an improvised weapon. This property is not referenced in the Crossbow Master feat, and could be removed. * The net has disadvantage to hit, whether you are 5 feet away, or 15. This is because ranged attacks at 5 feet have disadvantage (unless you have crossbow expert). I'm sure this is not intended behavior. Please let me know if I made any mistakes or missed anything, or if you have suggestions on how to make weapon choice more interesting! * Edit: Added the net."

I've been worried about the combination of physical resistance given freely coupled with the wild regeneration feature being too strong. This is supposedly offset by low hit die (d6). Essentially, for those who dont want to read that the interacting components here are: Resistance: Non-silvered S/P/B Wild Regeneration: Heal as a reaction to taking damage a lvl'd amount (currently 1d8 flat) at level 5 What this comes down to is recently I got hit for 16 damage... then I told the DM nope, I got hit for 8 (rolls dice and heals) actually, I take 2 damage. And I felt like total bullshit cheese. Is this? It seems like a mix of rogue and berzerker skills that do exist, but in combination it feels a bit strong. I'm also afraid in the future it'll feel too weak (when exotic damage comes more into play) though that may be the point (to magnify the strength/vulnerability) dichotomy. *edit* I just wanted to reply with an update, to be included in the main post. Your responses are all greatly appreciated, after fumbling with this class for awhile I've followed everyones advice and said fuck it. Because honestly, it's impossible. I thought the DM might be upset over the class change but they had been harboring unvoiced opinions that it was BS as well and was more than happy to be accommodating."

However, I want to make sure that they are balanced of equal power for all. If you are currently hunting Baron Firemont, don't read further. For each artifact I have been spit balling some idea's. Please let me know what you think and any suggestions. 1. Silence (Staff) Allows the wielder to prepare up to five spell levels from any spell list. Once a day, lets the wielder get +2 DC to a school of magic. 2. Charlie's Heavenly Apparatus of Rousing Music This is specifically for the bard in the group, it would let him use cutting word on the enemies save on spells he casts. Also I was thinking of allowing it to bestow a legendary save 1/day. 3. Larethian Circlet This is a skirmisher type item, in my mind. Allowing the wearer to cast misty step and gives the first attack per round advantage. 4. Breaker's cape My first idea was to combine the displacer cloak along with regaining HP when the wearer scores a critical hit. 5. Howling Saber (This one I have the hardest thinking of) First thoughts was a holy avenger that also gives flight. Making the bearer like a literal angle. 6. Clasp This armor would give vulnerability to the damage that the bearer uses. So like, if he hits with a bludgeoning attack, the enemy would give vulnerability to bludgeoning damage until the wearer hits with something else. I thought at first to limit it to the next hit of that type. Please let me know what you think and any suggestions would be SUPER GREAT."

I had not but I am aware of the plot, so he then highlights this idea for his pact of the chain where his summoned familiar can take on aspects of different creatures he's encountered becoming this horrific amalgamation of animals over time. I liked the idea so tried to come up with some rules for it, opinions would be appreciated and any improvements you can think of! --- ##Pact of the Chain## ###The Thing### *After entering the Pact of the Chain the Warlock will have the ability to summon a familiar, over time this familiar will take on the Aspects of the creatures the Warlock has encountered and memorized.* *The Aspects include all abilities (skills, senses and attacks) that the selected creature would normally have.* Limits- * The Warlock must select a base Aspect, the creature selected for this will determine the familiars AC, HP, Speed (though land, air and water speeds can be dependent on present Aspects) and base Stats. * Number of Aspects available is dependent on level, for every 2 levels above level 3 the Warlock can have +1 Aspects present (i.e. at level 5 the familiar can have 2 Aspects applied) **to a maximum of 5** * If the Warlock wishes to swap out the applied Aspects he must re-perform the Find Familiar spell. * ~~When the familiar is present the Warlock gains +1 to Intimidation checks and -1 to Persuasion checks per extra Aspects (i.e. if familiar has 3 Aspects present the Warlock gains +2 to intimidate and -2 to Persuade.).~~ Per feedback I will probably just adjust this so that the familiar can help on intimidation checks and suitably RP npc's meeting a horrific looking creature. * Warlock must spend 10 minutes (or 2 rounds of battle) studying a creature in order to memorize it and summon it's aspects. **(Increase time?)** * Creatures the Warlock attempts to memorize must be Small or Tiny in size. *Edit 1* - Additional/ Possible limits * Warlock can only have a limited number of Aspects memorized at a time dependant on level, starting with 3 gaining +1 every 2 levels to a maximum of 10. To learn a new Aspect the Warlock must forget a previously memorixed one. * If any of the chosen Aspects have Immunities, Resistances or Vulnerabilities to the same source, the *most damaging* takes precedence. So If the chosen aspects have both Resistance and Vulnerability to Fire damage then the familiar as a whole will have Vulnerability to Fire. * ""Humanoid"" Creatures cannot have their Aspects memorized.

Also, rings of the same type cannot be stacked together (you cannot stack a **life ring** with a **life ring +1** or a **life ring +2**).

You have no control over the appearance of the polymorph you are simply a gender swapped version of your prior self. Removing the ring reverts the effect. **Ring of Steel Protection**: Gain resistance to slashing, piercing and bludgeoning damage (non-magical) but gain vulnerability to all other types of damage. **Ring of Steel Protection+1**: Gain resistance to slashing, piercing and bludgeoning damage (non-magical). **Magic Stoneplate Ring**: Gain resistance to force damage but also gain vulnerability to a physical type of damage (DMs Choice). **Magic Stoneplate Ring+1**: Gain resistance to force damage. **Flame Stoneplate Ring**: Gain resistance to fire damage but also gain vulnerability to a physical type of damage (DMs Choice). **Flame Stoneplate Ring+1**: Gain resistance to fire damage. **Thunder Stoneplate Ring**: Gain resistance to lightning/thunder damage but also gain vulnerability to a physical type of damage (DMs Choice). **Thunder Stoneplate Ring+1**: Gain resistance to lightning/thunder damage. **Dark Stoneplate Ring**: Gain resistance to necrotic damage but also gain vulnerability to a physical type of damage (DMs choice). **Dark Stoneplate Ring**: Gain resistance to necrotic damage. **Speckled Stoneplate Ring**: Gain resistance to fire, force, lightning/thunder, and necrotic damage but also gain vulnerability to all physical damage. **Poisonbite Ring**: Gain resistance to poison damage but also gain vulnerability to a physical type of damage (DMs choice). **Poisonbite Ring+1**: Gain resistance to poison damage. **Magic Clutch Ring**: Gain +2 to spell modifier and spell save DC when casting a spell that deals force damage.

Hope this is somewhat useful for you. I definitely want to start handing out a few of these to my own party, should make things interesting. Any feedback is appreciated. Feel free to take these and do whatever you want to them, change values to fit your groups power level, add/remove effects. Go nuts. EDIT: The google doc has been updated to provide some percentage free alternatives to some of the rings for those of you who dislike percentages. The red and blue tearstone rings still activate at &lt;20% max HP, which should be an easy calculation to do. And the lingering dragoncrest ring and sages ring don't work well at all if I remove their percentage bonuses (so I didn't)."

One of my players wants to play a non-lethal rogue (a pacifist of sorts, at least someone who doesn't want to kill anyone), and for him just being able to knock them unconscious with the final blow as the rules say isn't enough. And, to be fair, it doesn't make sense to be all ""STABSTABSTAB oh I knock you unconscious"" at the last minute and walk away with a clean conscience. So, he wants to reflavor some finesse weapons to do bludgeoning damage, single or dual wielding something like kali sticks/escrima/phillipino stick fighting stuff. I know that some monsters, like skeletons, have vulnerability to bludgeoning. Is it going to break anything/be OP in some way if he has finesse weapons that do bludgeoning damage? "
185,vulnerability,dndnext,[SPOILERS] Seeking Curse of Strahd Advice on BBEG Appearances,17,4dbx3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/4dbx3t/spoilers_seeking_curse_of_strahd_advice_on_bbeg/,2016-04-05 02:47:01,"It was stated pretty clearly that Strahd isn't your typical BBEG, hiding until the final confrontation in their lair... no, Strahd is supposed to make more than one appearance, haunting the players with the fear of vulnerability as Strahd enjoys striking at their weakest (wise choice). What I would like advice on is when to bring him into the picture, and what his purpose should be? I plan on introducing him in the graveyard as they attempt to bring the burgomaster to rest, as a way of showcasing how overwhelmingly powerful he is to level 3 PCs without killing them (non-lethal knockouts, he wants to see them grow strong enough to impress him, one perhaps enough to become a successor). I hope for this altercation to also reveal his nature as the BBEG that isn't afraid to show himself... so for future appearances, when and why? Should he just be doing guerilla warfare when they are vulnerable, making it easy to kill them? It doesn't seem very fun or story-motivating for him to pop out when they're weak just to finish them off, as much as it would make sense tactically on his part; especially with how I'm running him to want them to grow more as he saw potential from them in Death House. I also don't want to make it a habit to have Strahd do non-lethal challenges with his multiple appearances. I know Strahd will let them retreat (unless they have his tome), but having 3 to 4 looming battles resulting in fleeing from a clearly more powerful BBEG also doesn't seem entertaining (unless done very well with suspense rather than raw combat). I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what to do with that, especially when they start bringing Ireena to Vallaki... Strahd really wants her, so I can't imagine he'd let that opportunity go by without annihilating them to have her. Lengthy question with lots of areas I have concerns about, sorry about that!"
186,vulnerability,dndnext,[Homebrew] Rougarou first draft,4,4dn134,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/4dn134/homebrew_rougarou_first_draft/,2016-04-07 04:18:46,"J*The rougarou live in dark swampy regions stalking their prey using various stealthy and magcial means. Believed to be a man cursed for his transgressions against followers of an ancient swamp god or against the swamp itself, it is filled with a lust for flesh. Able to shape change, the particulars of its appearance are quite varied and come from the shaken recollections of the handful of people who have managed to escape once seeing the creature. The most common descriptions are of a man with a wolves head and razor sharp teeth, a large bipedal ape like humanoid covered in dark mangy fur, and a humanoid with wet dripping swamp moss, algae, and fungi covering its entirety. The only trait common among all tales is that of the glowing yellow eyes and the horrific scent.* I'm looking for input and creative criticism on my stab at the Rougarou. This is my very first draft so it will certainly need work and I look forward to your input. #Rougarou *Medium monstrosity, neutral evil* --- **Armor Class** 15 (natural armor) **Hit Points** 52 (8d8 + 16) **Speed** 35 ft. --- STR|DEX|CON|INT|WIS|CHA ---|---|---|---|---|--- 17 (+3)|19 (+4)|14 (+2)|8 (1)|10 (0)|10 (+0) **Saving Throws** Con +5 **Skills** Survival +2, Intimidation +3 **Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9 **Languages** Common **Challenge** 3 (700 XP) --- **Foul Stench.** All creatures who start their turn within 120 ft of the rougarou must make a DC 12 constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on all attack rolls and skill checks due to the sickening smell. The saving throw can be attempted at the beginning of the affected creature's turn. When a creature succeeds on the saving throw, they cannot be affected by Foul Stench again for 24 hours. ##Actions **Multiattack.** The rougarou makes three attacks on its turn, one with its bite and two with its claws. **Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. **Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage. **Frightening Howl.** The rougarou howls a deep mournful and loud sound that causes fear in those that hear it. Any creature that can hear the howl and is within 120 ft. of the rougarou must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The saving throw can be repeated at the end of the creature's turn, ending the effect on a success. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw, they are immune to the Frightening Howl of this rougarou for 24 hours. **Cursed Stare (5 or 6 Recharge).** The rougarou stares deep into a creature's eyes who is within 30 feet of it. The victim must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12), if they fail then the they are paralyzed by the curse. Removing the curse can be done with a Remove Curse spell or similar magical effect. *edit:* * Increased HD to 8d8+16 from 4d8+8 * Saving throw for Frightening Howl occurs as the end of the affected creature's turn rather than the beginning. * Changed the Cursed Stare to cause paralysis rather than changing the victim to a rougarou. * Updated the wisdom of the rougarou to 10 from 8. * Removed the fire vulnerability. * Set Challenge to 3 (though it might make more sense for it to be 4)"
187,vulnerability,dndnext,Young Justice D&amp;D 5e Builds,30,4ehn52,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/4ehn52/young_justice_dd_5e_builds/,2016-04-13 05:09:47,"So I started rewatching Young Justice recently, and I thought the characters would translate well to D&amp;D 5e rules. I tried to keep homebrew to a minimum, and I'm really happy with what I got. Feel free to drop your criticisms and ideas. &amp;nbsp; **Aqualad** Name: Kaldur Ahm Class: Fighter 6 (Battlemaster) Background: Sage: Wizards Apprentice Race: Atlantean *Attacks* Water Bearer (short sword) +6 1d6 + 3 slashing Water Bearer (mace) +6 1d6 + 3 bludgeoning Shocking Grasp +4 2d8 lightning Ability Scores: Str 16, Dex 12, Con 16, Int 12, Wis 12, Cha 10 Prof. Bonus: +3 AC: 15 (breastplate) / 17 (with shield) HP: 58; Hit Dice: 6d10 Features: Amphibious, Swim, Cold Resistance, Atlantean Weapon Training, Magic Initiate: Wizard (shocking grasp, true strike, shield), Researcher, Fighting Style: Two-Weapon Fighting, Second Wind, Action Surge, Martial Archetype: Battle Master (Combat Superiority: DC 14, Student of War, Maneuvers: Disarming Strike, Lunging Attack, Trip Attack) *Proficiencies* Armor: all armor, shields Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: one set of artisans tools Saving Throws: Strength (+6), Constitution (+6) Skills: Arcana, Athletics, History, Perception Languages: Common, Atlantean, and 2 others Notable Equipment: twin Water Bearers, medium armor Notes: I considered making Aqualad an Eldritch Knight, but his use of Atlantean sorcery is mostly limited to shocking things and occasionally controlling water (and then always with his Water Bearers, so I rolled that power into the items themselves). Thus, I found Battle Master to be the most appropriate choice. His Battle Master maneuvers can be flavored as his water whip attacks if desired. &amp;nbsp; **New Magic Item - Water Bearers** Forged with powerful Atlantean sorcery, the Water Bearers grant their wielder power over water, and they allow their wielder to summon a multitude of melee weapons. As a bonus action, the Water Bearers wielder can form each of the Water Bearers into a one-handed melee weapon or shield. Also as a bonus action, the wielder can dismiss one or both Water Bearers. If the wielder drops the Water Bearers or is incapacitated, the formed weapons revert to ordinary water and spill onto the ground. As an action, the wielder of the Water Bearers can point both at a body of water and command it as with the Redirect Flow effect of the control water spell. The duration is Concentration, up to 1 minute. It can alternately be used as a 10-foot area attack that deals 4d8 bludgeoning damage (DC 14 Dex Save for half damage). The Water Bearers must not be formed as a weapon or shield when either of these abilities is invoked. Once either ability is used, neither can be used again until the next moonrise. &amp;nbsp; **New Race - Atlantean** Far beneath the surface of the worlds oceans are the powerful and advanced Atlanteans. They are skilled in engineering, warfare, and magic. While they are slow to trust outsiders, those who earn their friendship find them to be unshakeable allies. *Atlantean Traits* Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 1. Age. Atlanteans age at a similar rate to humans. They reach adulthood in their late teens and may live close to 100 years. Alignment. Most Atlanteans are lawful. Size. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Amphibious. You can breathe air and water. Swim. You have a swimming speed of 30 feet. Cold Resistance. Due to a life spent in the depths of the ocean, you are resistant to cold damage. Atlantean Weapon Training. You are proficient with the spear and trident. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Atlantean. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Robin** Name: Robin Gray Class: Rogue 5 (Thief)/Monk 1 Background: Entertainer (Tumbler) Race: Human *Attacks* Unarmed +7 1d4+4 bludgeoning Clubs +7 1d4+4 bludgeoning Dagger +7 1d4+4 piercing range 20/60 Ability Scores: Str 9, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 10 Prof. Bonus: +3 AC: 17 HP: 39; Hit Dice: 6d8 Features: By Popular Demand, Expertise (Acrobatics, Stealth), Sneak Attack (3d6), Thieves Cant, Cunning Action, Roguish Archetype: Thief (Fast Hands, Second-Story Work), Uncanny Dodge, Unarmored Defense, Martial Arts *Proficiencies* Armor: light armor Weapons: simple weapons, hand crossbows, longswords, rapiers, shortswords Tools: thieves tools, disguise kit, one musical instrument Saving Throws: Dexterity (+7), Intelligence (+5) Skills: Acrobatics, Athletics, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Stealth Notable Equipment: 2 clubs, 10 daggers, grappling hook, silk rope (50 ft.), ball bearings, dust of sneezing and choking Notes: Robin Gray can chuck his daggers (birdarangs?), fight unarmed, and whip out his dual escrima sticks for equal effect. He can funnel his bonus action into an extra unarmed attack from Martial Arts, or a Dash, Disengage, or Hide from Cunning Action. With his grappling hook and Second-Story Work feature, he can scale any wall in no time, and he can infiltrate almost any situation without getting caught. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Kid Flash** Name: Brother Westwall Class: Monk (Way of the Open Hand) 6 Background: Sage (Alchemist) Race: Human *Attacks* Unarmed +7, 1d6+4 bludgeoning Ability Scores: Str 10, Dex 18, Con 10, Int 14, Wis 16, Cha 11 Prof. Bonus: +3 AC: 17 HP: 33; Hit Dice: 6d8 Features: Researcher, Unarmored Defense, Martial Arts (1d6), Ki (6 points), Unarmored Movement (+15 ft.), Monastic Tradition: Open Hand (Open Hand Technique, Wholeness of Body), Deflect Missiles, Slow Fall, Extra Attack, Stunning Strike, Ki-Empowered Strikes *Proficiencies* Armor: none Weapons: simple weapons, shortswords Tools: alchemists tools Saving Throws: Strength (+3), Dexterity (+7) Skills: Acrobatics, Arcana, Athletics, History Notable Equipment: boots of speed Notes: Westwall runs fast, hits hard, and knows a thing or two about alchemy. When he kicks on the magic of his boots of speed, his speed becomes 90 ft, allowing him to zip around any battlefield! With some ki expenditure, he can double his jump distance if he needs to get airborne. At level 9, he can run up walls and across water as well! &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Miss Martian** Name: Mgann Class: Sorcerer (Draconic) 6 Background: Outlander: Outcast Race: Marshen *Attacks* Fire bolt +7 2d10 fire Ability Scores: Str 8, Dex 14, Con 10, Int 13, Wis 14, Cha 18 Prof. Bonus: +3 AC: 15 HP: 26; Hit Dice: 6d6 Features: Frigid Homeland, Heat Vulnerability, Darkvision, Mind Shield, Telepathy, Natural Camouflage, Wanderer, Spellcasting (DC 15), Sorcerous Origin: Draconic (Green Dragon; Draconic Resilience, Elemental Affinity: poison), Font of Magic, Metamagic (Heightened Spell, Subtle Spell) Cantrips Known: blade ward, mage hand, minor illusion, fire bolt, true strike Spells Known: 7 others (alter self, disguise self, fly, invisibility, shield, sleep, tongues) Spell Slots per Level: 1st (4), 2nd (3), 3rd (3) *Proficiencies* Armor: none Weapons: daggers, darts, slings, quarterstaffs, light crossbows Tools: one type of musical instrument Saving Throws: Constitution (+3), Charisma (+7) Skills: Athletics, Deception, Insight, Survival Languages: Common, Marshen, and one other Notable Equipment: arcane focus Notes: I felt that sorcerer was the best choice for Miss Martian. I used gnome as the base for her race and tacked on cold resist/heat vulnerability, then swapped their cantrip to message and their Speak With Beasts trait to Natural Camouflage (which is itself one of the bullets in the Skulker feat). I considered making a homebrew bloodline, but I wanted to keep everything as close to the core rules as possible, so I went with draconic, specifically the green dragon to match her color. You could go white as well if you wanted to represent her true form. However, the green dragon blood lets her spend a sorcery point to resist poison damage, and Young Justices Miss Martian can retool her own physiology to combat threats, so I think its appropriate enough, even if she doesnt have any poison type attacks she can benefit from. Overall, she can shapeshift to a limited degree, fly, and camouflage or even go full invisible if need be. She doesnt have telekinesis at this level, but she does have mage hand at least. Though MM doesnt actually sling fire, Mganns fire bolt could be reflavored as force damage for a telekinetic strike. &amp;nbsp; **New Race - Marshen** Green-skinned people from the frozen plane of Marz. *Marshen Traits* Ability Score Increase. Marshens are strong of mind and spirit. Your Wisdom increases by 2, and your Charisma increases by 1. Age. Marshens are young adults around 50 years old. They can live for several hundred years after that. Alignment. Marshens run the gamut of alignments, though most tend to be neutral or neutral good. Size. Marshens are Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common and Marshen. Frigid Homeland. Due to growing up in your near-frozen homelands, you have advantage on checks against cold effects and resistance to cold damage. Heat Vulnerability. Fire is especially deadly to Marshens. You are vulnerable to fire damage and have disadvantage on checks against fire and heat. Darkvision. Your eyes can see in a spectrum beyond that of humans. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Mind Shield. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. Telepathy. You know the message cantrip, and you can cast it without material components. Natural Camouflage. As a marshen, you can allow light to pass through you in order to blend in with your surroundings. You can try to hide from a creature when you are lightly obscured. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Superboy** Name: Kahn Rohket Class: Barbarian (Bear Totem) 6 Background: Soldier Race: Crypten *Attacks* Greatsword +7 2d6 + 4 slashing Ability Scores: Str 18, Dex 14, Con 16, Int 10, Wis 10, Cha 8 Prof. Bonus: +3 AC: 16 HP: 65; Hit Dice: 6d12 Features: Darkvision (60 ft.), Crypten Endurance, Powerful Build, Transferred Knowledge, Military Rank, Rage (4/day, +2 dmg), Unarmored Defense, Reckless Attack, Danger Sense, Primal Path: Totem Warrior (Spirit Seeker, Totem Spirit: Bear, Aspect of the Beast: Bear), Extra Attack, Fast Movement (+10 ft.) *Proficiencies* Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: cards, land vehicles, cartwrights tools Saving Throws: Strength (+7), Constitution (+7) Skills: Animal Handling, Athletics, History, Intimidation, Perception Notable Equipment: greatsword, ring of jumping Notes: Kahn doles out the punishment, and he can take a lot of it, especially when hes raging. I gave him a greatsword, because that seems appropriate for a fantasy version of the character. A barbarian/monk combo would let him use his fists, but I really like how this build turned out as is. With his Powerful Build and Bear Totem features, he can lift an immense amount of weight! &amp;nbsp; **New Race - Crypten** Cryptens are a fusion of construct and living being. They are born from advanced magical and alchemical processes to act as guards and soldiers for their masters. However, some break free and pursue a life of freedom and adventure. Free crypten hate being told what to do and view most authority figures with suspicion. *Crypten Traits* Ability Score Increase. Your Strength score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1. Age. Crypten grow at an accelerated rate and can reach puberty within months of their initial creation. Then, they mature more naturally, though they may well live past 100 years. Alignment. Crypten still under the leadership of their creators are lawful, though those that seek their own destinies tend to be chaotic. Size. Like the humans they appear to be, crypten are Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. Darkvision. You have enhanced eyes that can see light well beyond the ranges of ordinary humans. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Crypten Endurance. You can focus yourself to occasionally shrug off injury. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to roll a d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled, and reduce the damage by that total. After you use this trait, yo ucant use it again until you finish a short or long rest. Powerful Build. You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. Transferred Knowledge. As a part of your accelerated growth, you were magically fed a direct-to-mind education. You are proficient in the History skill and one set of artisans tools. Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Artemis** Name: Artemis Class: Ranger (Hunter) 6 Background: Criminal (Hired killer) Race: Human *Attacks* Shortbow +7 1d6 + 4 piercing range 80/320 Hand crossbow +7 1d6 + 4 piercing range 30/120 Ability Scores: Str 10, Dex 18, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 16, Cha 10 Prof. Bonus: +3 AC: 16 HP: 46; Hit Dice: 6d10 Features: Criminal Contact, Favored Enemy (constructs, monstrosities), Natural Explorer (forest, mountain), Fighting Style (Archery), Spellcasting, Ranger Archetype: Hunter (Colossus Slayer), Primeval Awareness, Extra Attack Spells Known: ensnaring strike, hail of thorns, hunters mark, cordon of arrows Spell Slots per Level: 1st (4), 2nd (2) *Proficiencies* Armor: light armor, medium armor, shields Weapons: simple weapons, martial weapons Tools: cards, thieves tools Saving Throws: Strength (+3), Dexterity (+7) Skills: Acrobatics (+7), Athletics (+3), Deception (+3), Perception (+6), Stealth (+7) Notable Equipment: shortbow, hand crossbow, quiver and arrows, leather armor Notes: Artemiss spells simulate her trick arrows and special training - ensnaring strike for bolas, hail of thorns for an explosive arrow, hunters mark for focusing on a single target, and cordon of arrows for rigging a trap (perhaps with mounted crossbows). As she increases in level, she can construct more powerful trick arrows (by learning more powerful spells). Her favored enemies represent her experience fighting large, monstrous entities (for monstrosites) and androids (for constructs). I gave her Colossus Slayer because she typically focuses her fire on a single powerful enemy. Her favored terrains are fairly arbitrary, but I chose mountain for the Teams home base and forest to reflect multiple encounters fought in similar environments throughout the show."

While I love the simplicity of 5e, I desired a little more choice and crunch to the default weapon stats. Here's my attempt at giving the weapons a little more identity (and in certain cases, balance). I've added a few keywords and clarified others. I also did my best to avoid static multipliers (the 3.5 approach) and keep things to common mechanics. This list might be most useful to those who want to use resistance and vulnerability more liberally than the RAW Monstrous Manual- I find combats much more interesting when damage type matters.

With the information I know of with monks (which isn't a lot) it seems balanced. Can you guys let me know if it sounds balanced or not? If it doesn't why not? Way of the Drunken Fist Ki is depleted, instead of regenerated after a rest Ki points are gained by drinking. A drunken style monk can stand up without movement and suffers no disadvantages from fighting prone or supine. Drinking alcohol regenerates ki up to 1.5X max ki points between long rests based on the following table: Proof Ki 10-30 1 31-50 2 51-70 3 71-90 4 91-110 5 111-130 6 131-150 7 151-170 8 171-200 9 The drunken style monk is also immune to intoxication disadvantages aside from drinking 180 proof or higher alcohol which requires a DC 12 CON check or take 7d6 poison damage. lvl3 - Improvisation Expert Proficient with improvised weapons and they are considered monk weapons lvl6 - Master of Drunken Balance Can sacrifice all attacks for the turn to both dodge and grab improvised weapon or take a drink of alcohol (only with free hand) Also, can drink AND grab improvised weapon if improvised weapon is a drink IE. Pint glass of beer. lvl11 - Illusion of vulnerability Once per round when successfully attacked, you can spend one ki to parry and counterattack as a normal attack action. If you successfully hit, the damage you roll will be subtracted from the damage you take and done to the enemy. If your damage matches or exceeds theirs exactly you both fall prone for no damage. lvl17 - Drunken Master You've become a master of your drunken body. You may focus inward as a bonus action to reproduce auto-brewery syndrome and use any grain-based food in your stomach to become drunk and restore 1 ki. This ability may be used more than once (still once per turn) if a grain-based meal has been consumed within 6-8 hours, however, how much food is left in the stomach to use will be up to the DM. When at max ki, aka completely obliterated, you gain a +1 to all attack rolls as well as unarmed/improvised/monk weapons that don't have high critical (critical on natural 19) will have high crit. Also you may use alcohol to regenerate max ki three times between long rests. Edit: formatting"

The problem I have is that while it's awesome and probably more effective in most cases to animate 10 tiny or small objects, it's not going to be fun to slow down the combat massively with 10 new creatures that each have movement, an attack, and a reaction(?). So in the interests of keeping things quick, I thought I would brew up a 'swarm of daggers' type monster that is roughly equivalent to the power and abilities of having 10 distinct creatures, but with less of an impact for action economy, and time burden. A Tiny animated object gets 20hp, 18AC, an attack with +8 to hit and 1d4+4 damage. 10 of these creatures is likely to be far more effective in most cases (a fireball could kill them all quite quickly though) than a single Huge object plus 2 small or tiny objects. **How would you stat up a single creature that represents 10 tiny or small animated objects?** A few considerations: * Assuming all hits, a single Tiny object has an average damage of 6.5 per round, so 10 of them is 65 damage per round. Each object has 20hp and 18AC! The best strategy appears to be Fireball. * A Huge object has an average damage of 17 per round, so a huge object plus two Tiny objects is 30 damage per round. Huge objects have less AC, but are less vulnerable to a Fireball. * The Huge object has the same attack bonus as a tiny one, so if a tiny object would miss, then so would a huge one. * It seems like in most cases, 10 Tiny objects is the way to go. You also get the additional benefit of being able to split your forces, plus have a bunch of extra opportunity attacks if an enemy runs away. * Am I wrong in thinking that these objects would have reactions? * My goal is to ensure that combat doesn't slow to a crawl with 10 daggers flying about, and potentially build a model I can apply to similar spells such as Conjure Animals. * I calculated the CRs of Tiny and Huge objects using the DMG's table, and it seems like a Huge object has CR3 while a Tiny object has CR5! Here's what I'm thinking, based on the Swarm type enemies in the MM: **Swarm of Tiny Objects** _Large swarm of Tiny constructs, unaligned_ AC: 18 Hit Points: 120 Speed: hover 30ft STR 4 DEX 18 CON 10 INT 3 WIS 3 CHA 1 Condition immunities: charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, prone, restrained, stunned Senses: Blindsight 30ft, passive perception 10 **Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a tiny object. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points. **Fireball Bait.** The swarm has disadvantage on saving throws against effects that target an area that the swarm occupies, and has vulnerability to damage from such effects. **Multiattack.** The swarm makes two _Slams_ attacks. This cannot be used if the swarm is below half its hit points. **Slams.** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10ft, one creature. Hit: 2d12+4 slashing, piercing or bludgeoning damage, depending on the type of objects. Some notes about the monster above: * Its hit points are lower in total than the combined hit points of 10 tiny objects, but it can only take a maximum of twice the damage of a fireball, so it's less vulnerable on that front. This is still 50% more than a huge object though, and it's got higher AC! It's immune to most conditions to represent the notion that it's a large group of creatures, but this might not be appropriate as the spell's animated creatures have no such immunities. * Overall damage output (34, going down to 17 at half life) is about half that of the 10 tiny creatures, and it can only target two creatures per turn. * It can reach enemies pretty easily, but can't spread out as far as separate creatures"

Now none of my players have ever played world of warcraft so I thought I would convert one of my favorite raids from years ago into a dungeon. I am of course speaking about Karazahn. So besides piecing together a map and simplifying the fights a bit what aresome ideas you guys have for this? How would you change the fights to fit 5e? What little tid bits would you add? Should I drop hints as to tricks to deal with the 'bosses'? This is a list of 'bosses' or rooms I would like to do: - Stables (Fight against a knight, then his horse, then the knight mounted on the horse) - opera house (fight against Juliane and Romulo, when one is killed have to kill the other in 2 rounds or the first stands back up at half life) - mage (has lair actions to pull all enemies in and slow then, then every 2 rounds does an explosion for damage) - warlock (summons minions, links to a minion at the top of every round, invincible while linked minion is alive) - dragon in observatory (create areas with large buffs on them, if staying in buff area for more than 3 turns, 1 level of exhaustion) - chess (not quite sure how to do this one yet, needs to be non-combat, perhaps a puzzle?) - golem (being charged by crystals around the room, when charged resist all damage and increased damage, when crystal is broken has vulnerability to all damage and does normal damage for one turn then charged by other crystals) If anyone is interested I can post the dungeon when I am done."
192,vulnerability,dndnext,Question concerning Mirror of Life Trapping,4,429695,https://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/429695/question_concerning_mirror_of_life_trapping/,2016-01-23 14:32:09,"Once active, can it be deactivated only by the person who activated it, or by anyone who knows the command word? The wording is a little unclear IMO, especially with the use of the word ""you"". It says that ""you"" can say the command to activate it, after which the mirror will attempt to trap everyone except ""you"" until ""you"" say the command word to deactivate it. To me this implies that it's the same person, and even another person with the command word cannot deactivate it (the mirror will try to trap him or her, after all). I already made my ruling as DM so I'm likely to stick with that, but I could be convinced to handle it differently in the future. Opinions? EDIT: Since this item is in the SRD, I'll just copy over the description. Emphasis mine. &gt;When this 4-foot--tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points. &gt;If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, ***you*** can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until ***you*** use an action to speak the command word again. &gt;Any creature ***other than you*** that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirrors twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirrors nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically. &gt;An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirrors cells dont age, and they dont need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed. &gt;If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it. &gt;While within 5 feet of the mirror, ***you*** can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirrors surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally. &gt;In a similar way, ***you*** can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it."

One of the players is a hot-headed draconic sorcerer. In combat, the only spell he uses is the firebolt cantrip, and despite the fact that most of the creatures in this campaign have had low AC, the attack rolls have just not been in his favor, and even when he hits, at his level (they started at level 1, just reached level 3 last night), it only does 1d10 damage, not very impressive, even against creatures with fire vulnerability. Despite his usefulness outside of combat, using Message to negotiate from the shadows and Dancing Lights to distract dire wolves and light up caves for those without darkvision, I get vibes from him that he is not enjoying the fact that he's just not a badass spellcaster yet (at least in combat). Whenever he misses, it clearly shows that he's a bit frustrated. Any suggestions of how I can help him out? EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the quick replies! Literally everyone in this party is new to D&amp;D (except one guy who played an earlier edition several years ago, so I'm sure there is a lot of room for improvement all around."

The priestess is not going to engage the party in combat but I wouldn't be surprised if they attack her, especially because she will end up ordering others to attack the party. I want there to be a consequence for killing her during her gods favored season that can come up later. I remember reading in the first Pearcy Jackson book that Aeries cursed Percy to have his weapon fail him when he needs it most then a few books later he can't fight and beat a titian because the curse came into effect. So I don't want to give them a curse like ""vulnerability to cold damage"" and then have them seek out some cleric to remove it. What are some cool curses a priestess of Auril could give as her dying breath?"

I've had a great time playing a bunch of different campaigns with my friends in the last year from HotDQ, a custom Elder Scrolls campaign, and my new custom campaign with a large amount of homebrew and emphasis on storytelling and improv opposed to set goals and powergaming. Recently my friend has come up with the idea of building homebrew classes, one of which we've built up to level 5. I know a lot of people have put there stuff on here before and I know that you guys would have a lot of useful insight on how to make the class more fun or balanced. I'm typing this all shorthand and from memory so forgive me if it's a little sloppy. So here goes: * d8s for health **Proficiencies**: * Dex and Int saves * Simple weapons, shortswords, scimitars, longswords, rapiers, light armor * Skills: choose 3 from Athletics, Acrobatics, Stealth, Sleight of hand, History, Investigation, Perception, Performance, Intimidation * Tools: One gaming set of your choice **Starting equipment**: * A rapier or longsword * Two shortswords or 20 darts * Explorer's or dungeoneer's pack * Two daggers * Leather armor or a gaming set of your choice **Level 1**: * Unarmored defense equal to 10 + Dex mod + Int mod *Fighting Style (choose one:)* * Defense * Dueling * Two-weapon fighting * Blade focus (+2 to attacks with longsword attacks when wielded in two hands, and longswords are finesse weapons for you) **Level 2**: * Ki point equivalent called Adrenaline points (AP), 1 per level, regaining after short or long rest. Saves if applicable will be based on 8 + Int mod + proficiency bonus. *Every myrmidon at level 2 gets*: * Patient Defense: 1AP, dodge as a bonus action. * Sure strike: 1AP, advantage on attacks until the end of your turn **Archetype choice**: *Way of Bloodletting*: * (Currently unnamed): On an attack roll of 19 (nat), you may use 1AP to make that attack a critical hit. (Extended to 18 at ? level) or, *Way of Devotion*: * (Currently unnamed): When an enemy within 5 feet of you makes an attack against you and misses, you may spend 1AP to make a melee attack against them as a reaction. **Level 3** * Swordmaster: When you land an attack with a longsword, rapier, shortsword, or dagger, you may spend 2AP to roll an additional damage die of the weapon's type. **Level 4**: ASI **Level 5**: * Extra attack * (Currently unnamed): 1AP to use a dash as a bonus action, and opportunity attacks have disadvantage against you until the end of your turn. So that's all I've got so far. I do have some ideas for higher levels including proficiency in con or wis saves for bloodletter and devotion respectively at level 6, including some other feature. Evasion at 7 and... that's about all I have in mind until later levels. I'm imagining the level 20 feature will be a regaining of X AP at initiative rolls. And I'm thinking of the level 17 feature being something like vulnerability to slashing damage for a target at a cost of some AP or two attacks as a bonus action for some AP for bloodletter and devotion as well. Any ideas or comments are greatly appreciated!"

I can afford another ""0.5"" ability or leave as is. Many of the current abilities are passive so what do people feel is more thematic; a 1d4 Bite attack or a Proficiency in one of the following skills: Deception, Persuasion, or Stealth? &amp;nbsp; Hey everyone, I posted the other day asking for Undead player options or balanced homebrew. I received a lot of advice and several links to some great homebrew but [I also was directed to this website](URL Using this tool I created a Dhampir race and I wanted to see if you all feel its balanced while maintaining the Vampire/Undead theme. My goal was for a Race value of 5.5 to 6 points (Currently 6 points). **Dhampir:** Dex +2, Con +1. (3 points) Medium Size, 30 ft speed. **Living Dead**: Even though your ancestor was dead, you are a living creature. You are immune to disease and resistant to poison. You do not need to breathe and you may ingest food and drink if you wish. However, once a month you are required to drink blood or suffer a level of exhaustion. (1 point) **Graveborn**: Advantage on all Int, Wis, &amp; Cha saving throws against magic. (2 points) **Darkvision** 60 ft (0.5 points) **Sunlight Sensitivity:** Disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. (-0.5 points) **Necrotic Resistance:** Half damage from Necrotic (1 point) **Radiant Vulnerability:** Double damage from Radiant (-1 point) Rational: In the Monster Manuel it lists that any PCs who become vampires have their STR, DEX, &amp; CON increased to 18 (unless its already higher) so I chose +2 Dex and +1 Con to allow the race some versatility for player options. I was constantly told ""Just use the UA Warforged; Living Construct is close enough"" so I modified it to be more thematic with a couple changes. Seeing as this race is alive, is not an elf, and is not a construct I removed the ""trance"" effect and required the player to drink blood once a month. I'm hoping including resistance to poison isn't to overpowered by comparison. Darkvision and Sunlight Sensitivity seemed appropriate. I also included Necrotic Resistance and Radiant Vulnerability for thematic reasons. ""Graveborn"" is Gnome Cunning from the Deep Gnome Race but renamed to be appropriate. I felt like this was a good reflection of the Vampire's Legendary Saves affect. Initially I had also included a Fire Vulnerability but I was worried it made the race to weak (and the Monster Manuel Vampire has no such weakness). Thanks again for the constructive feedback and as a famous pig once said; that's all folks! =)"

Because of this, I decided to try and retool the Assassin to be centered on poisons. I've finished a very rough draft and would like some feedback on how people think it would play and how it undoubtedly needs to be balanced. ------------- **Rogue Assassin Archetype  Rebuild** **Bonus Proficiencies** When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with the disguise kit and poisoners kit. In addition you gain proficiency with the following weapons if you arent already proficient in their use: Longbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Blowgun. **Master Poisoner** Starting at 3rd level, you are adept at handling poisons. You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to apply poison to a weapon or ammunition (Darts follow the same rules as ammunition for the purposes of applying poisons). Additionally, you are capable of creating your own poisons from whatever is at hand. You can create 1 dose of a single custom poison of any type (Injury, Ingested, Contact, or Inhaled) by spending 1 hour preparing it which can be performed during a short or long rest. You must have a poisoners kit to create this poison. You may only carry 3 total custom poison doses regardless of type or effect at any time (this number increases as shown in the ***Custom Poisons Table***). Creating an additional dose causes the oldest to become inert. Each poison otherwise remains potent until used. A custom poison can only be used by you. Even if a creature uses a weapon or piece of ammunition you have dosed with a custom poison, attacks made with the weapon or ammunition do not inflict the effects of the poison. Should any other creature attempt to use or handle one of your custom poisons, they must make a DC 20 Constitution or Intelligence (DMs choice) saving throw or suffer the effects of the poison. On a successful save, the poison becomes inert. When creating a custom poison, you must choose an effect from the ***Custom Poisons Table***. Any custom poison with a duration has a DC (8 + INT modifier + Rogue level/2 rounded up) Constitution saving throw which can be made by the poisoned creature at the end of each or its turns. **Beware the Dark and Dangerous Night** At 9th level, you are able to move at normal speed while stealthed. Additionally, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks made to slip an ingested poison into drink or food, plant a simple inhaled poison trap, or apply a contact poison to an unsuspecting creature, and Dexterity (Stealth) checks at night or in dark lighting conditions. **Hide in Plain Sight** At 13th level, you are able to blend in anywhere with easy. You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another persons speech, writing, and behavior. You must spend at least 3 hours studying these three components of the persons behavior, listening to speech, examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms. You can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must spend 7 days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and affiliations for an identity. You cant establish an identity that belongs to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing, letters of introduction, and official-looking certification to establish yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter, if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to be that person until given an obvious reason not to. Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. You have advantage on Charisma (Deception) checks made to avoid detection and Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to infiltrate a guarded area or hide your real identity. **Death Strike** Starting at 17th level, you become a master of instant death. When you attack and hit a creature and are able to apply your sneak attack, you may have it make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, double the damage of your attack against the creature. You may use this feature only once per short or long rest. ***Custom Poisons Table*** Rogue Level | Instant Damage Effect *Injury, Contact, or Inhaled* | Short Effect *Any* | Long Effect *Ingested, COntact, or Inhaled* ---|---|---|--- **3+** Carry 3 doses | DC 12 CON save, creature takes 2d4 Poison Damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. | The effected creature(s) must succeed on a DC 15 CON save or be Blinded for 3 turns | The effected creature(s) must succeed on a DC 15 CON saving throw or fall Unconscious for 1 hour, the creature recovers if it takes damage or another creature uses its action to shake it awake. **9+** Carry 4 doses | DC 14 CON save, creature takes 4d6 Poison Damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. | The effected creature(s) must succeed on a DC 18 CON save or be Poisoned &amp; 1d8 poison damage at the beginning of each turn for 5 turns | The effected creature(s) must succeed on a DC 18 CON saving throw or be weakened (deals half damage with weapons and half carry, push, drag, and lift capacities) for the duration.

But I think it might be ballanced. I find it quite interesting to build non-humanoid creatures that function quite differently from standard humanoids, and to try to ballance for PC play. Have I succeeded? If not please tell me why... Lore --------------- When faced with a giant spider large enough to look them in the eye, most people flee or draw their weapons. But if it is a giant fey spider, starting a pleasant chat is also an option. Fey spiders are marked with a nearly unquenchable cheerfulness and all around friendliness. Those fey spiders who travel outside the fey world are too often feared and driven away. But fey spiders dont take it personally, they realize that monstrous giant spiders are much more common, and few people have heard about nice giant spiders. But they remain hopeful that the next creature they meet will be friendly. A giant fey spider is simply a giant species of spider with the intellect and spirit of a fey. Their first pair of legs are used as arms, and possess dexterous pincers that serve as hands. Each individual has a unique, bold pattern of gold, rust, silver, ebony and copper green on fur and gleaming chitin. Smiling at everyone through two large iridescent eyes, a fey spider is quite handsome to those who can see past its spidery-ness. Disgusted by the idea of sucking the juices from creatures, fey spiders instead make fruit their staple, though they can eat other vegetable foods if they must. Traits ---------------- * **Ability** Score Increase. Your Charisma score increases by 1. * **Age.** Giant fey spiders mature quickly, reaching adulthood in 12 years. Avoiding mishaps, they usually live around 80 years. * **Alignment.** As fey, giant fey spiders have a tendency toward chaotic good. Their tendency toward cheerfulness is even stronger. * **Fey.** Your type is fey. Spells that work only on humanoids do not affect you, but you are affected by spells that target fey. You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic cant put you to sleep. * **Long, Spindly Limbs.** Due to the length of your arms, you have an additional 5 feet of reach, but you find it awkward to balance long weapons. You have disadvantage on attack rolls with reach weapons. * **Size.** A giant fey spider can look a dragonborn in the eye, but on closer inspection the space it occupies is mostly legs and air the spiders body is about the same size as a dwarfs. A giant fey spider weighs between 150 and 175 pounds, and can comfortably hold its body anywhere between 3 and 7 feet high. Your size is Medium. However due to your long legs, you are considered Large in the following ways. * &gt; You normally occupy a 10x10 foot space. As a bonus action you may fold in your legs to fit in a 5x5 foot space, but in that stance your speed drops to 20 feet. You may later unfold and return to your 10x10 stance with a bonus action. * &gt; You are considered Large for purposes of moving through or sharing the space with another creature. * &gt; You are considered Large for the purpose of grappling, which means you may attempt to grapple Huge creatures. * **Speed.** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. * **Arachnophobia.** Humanoids have an instinctive aversion to giant spiders. But many humanoids who spend time around giant fey spiders are surprised how quickly the spiders winsome personality removes their unease. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Performance) or (Persuasion) checks targeting humanoids unless they are accustomed to either fey or giant spiders, or both. * **Armor.** Armor may be difficult to find in the proper shape for a giant spider.

202,vulnerability,dndnext,Homebrew PC Race - Semigolem,7,384cd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/384cd4/homebrew_pc_race_semigolem/,2015-06-02 05:35:03,"This is my first attempt at a homebrew race, partly inspired by Warforged. I liked the idea of being able to take the reins of a construct, but wanted to create something magic-focused. I attempted to keep it as balanced as possible, but I have not had the chance to playtest it. Suggestions more than welcome! **Semigolem** Where true Golems are typically hulking masses of stone or steel, made to serve as mindless warriors and guardians, a Semigolem is a smaller, more ultilitarian creation. A Semigolem is comprised of several hundred small stones linked together by magic, and more or less acting as a walking brain. Appearance: Your appearance is as varied as that of stones themselves; you may be comprised of flat colored slate, sparkling multicolored granite, or cool green jade. In any case, your body is composed of hundreds of separate pieces, sewn together by magic. If one of your body stones is removed by an outside force or entity, it may move as far as 1 foot from the nearest body stone, after which it disappears, and then reappears in its proper configuration. *Ability Scores*: Con +1 *Stone Construction*: You do not need to eat or drink. You do not sleep, but instead go into a passive recharge state for four hours a night. You are immune to disease and poison. For all intents and purposes, you are both Humanoid and a Construct. *False Senses*: You can see, hear, and touch, but you cannot smell or taste. *Memory Keeper*: A number of times per day equal to your half your level rounded down, you may spend the same number of hours recording what you hear and see, granting perfect recall of that span of time. *Stoneshifting*: By rearranging the stones of your construction, you may take on different forms with unique abilities. Changing form takes up your action. *Humanoid*: Your default form, in which you resemble a typical humanoid with two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head. In this form you have all your normal abilities. Your speed is 20 and your size is medium. *Ball*: Your body stones all condense into a sphere. In this form, any weapons you were holding disappear, and reappear at your feet when you shift back into Humanoid form. In addition, you may only cast spells which do not require somatic or material components. Your move is 40, and your size is Small. *Scope*: In this form, your body stones stretch out straight upward, tripling your height and giving you advantage on Wisdom checks relying on sight. You may not move or attack in this form, and are vulnerable to physical damage. Your size is Medium. *Caltrocks*: In this form, your body stones scatter in a 10 ft radius around you, with the same effects as laying down caltrops. You may not move or attack in this form, and you do not have a size. After the second turn that you stay in this form, for every turn after the magic that binds your body stones destabilizes, and you take 2d4 damage. **Racial Variations** - *Mage's Companion*: You were created to serve a Wizard as aide and protector. You are gifted with magical knowledge that many others would not have had access to. Your Int is increased by 2, and twice per day you may add your proficiency (even if already proficient) on an Int ability check. *Travel Guide*: You were created to serve as a guide through the wilderness, either at the side of a Druid or Ranger, or for inexperienced travellers. You are gifted with a deep understanding of nature. Your Wis score increases by 2, and twice per day you may add your proficiency (even if already proficient) on a Wis ability check. *Cursed Liar*: Unlike other semigolems, you were once humanoid. Perhaps a silver-tongued master thief, or an enigmatic cult leader; either way, your crimes were severe enough for your soul to be locked away in stone. But now, you're free, and what you do with that freedom is up to you. Your Cha increases by 2, and twice per day you may add your proficiency (even if already proficient) on a Cha ability check. **EDIT 1**: Removed AC bonus, replaced perfect memory with recording ability, added damage vulnerability to Scope form, added damage over time to Caltrocks form"
203,vulnerability,dndnext,[Traps] Traps to Worry Your Players With (Part III),25,38ejv3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/38ejv3/traps_traps_to_worry_your_players_with_part_iii/,2015-06-04 04:16:45,"Laaaaaaaast post on these for the week. I appreciate everyone's feedback and encouragement---traps are much harder, I'm finding. They have to account for so much more. But its been fun so far. If you like any of what you've seen, please head over to [manysideddice.om](URL and leave a little positive feedback and tour through some of our other posts. (also, we're looking for writers and artists--if you know any, and they're interested in a gig, send them our way) . **Chirograft** *""You already ruined two quills! Why don't you let me give it a go, you clearly don't know how to properly use them"" Meilla was a boiling kettle outrage. Her calm and dismissive demeanor was threadbare when Kallie snapped the tip of the wizard's first pen and turned into only barely contained rage at the splitting of the nib on the second.* *It was times like this that Kallie had to remind herself that they really were friends and that the secrets locked away in this ancient library were more important than the consequences of the fight that was coming between the young delver and the now pissed off mage. If they didn't find the Bone Scroll, innocent people would die. It was just that simple.* *Taking a deep breath, Kallie tried a different tack. She'd tried encouragement and pleading, maybe some fear was in order.* *""Hon, if you don't hand me that gods-damned quill, I'm going to take my finger off this line here---you see that? I'll pull this finger off that line and we'll all be very lucky to not die of hastened dysentery in seconds. Crapping yourself to death in the span of a breath is a horrible way to die...""* **History:** The Luminaries, an offshoot of the worshipers of the Riftmaster, were a heretical sect of mages and clerics put to death in the time of Reetesh Exile II, also known as the Architect, the last of Mallean Dynasty. Their faith was more interested in arcane mechanics than mysteries, having famously invented several devices in violation of church tenants to keep the purity of the River (the great flowing current of magical power in the universe). They sought to bring magic to the material, the high-minded priests of the Riftmaster leveraged the crown to destroy them for it. However, given their mechanical predilections, several of their old keeps and towers---many lost now---as well as many temples and monasteries of the time utilized a heretical security device they called a Chirograft. One of the finest, most effective ways to keep unwanted people away from precious things. **System:** Chirografs were made into existing doors and almost exclusively used on them, though there are some rumors of adventurers finding them on smaller things (like chests or trunks or windows). When newly made, they are easily spotted, though age and time can obscure them as paint and ink fades. A door with a Chirograft will have an intricate pattern of darkly inked lines drawn over it on both sides (if less than 100 years old, Passive Perception 10; up to 200 years, Passive Perception 15; up to 500 years, Passive Perception 20). Knowing what a Chirograft is, on noticing it, requires a History check DC 20 or a Religion check DC 15 (advantaged if also proficient in Arcane). Every failed attempt to open a Chirograft door increases the potency of the effect if triggered. As a result, ancient doors so trapped that have turned away many dungeon delvers over the ages are especially dangerous (Investigation Dc 10, if the Chirograft is noticed in the first place, to deterimine the age of the ink and wood). On a success, the PC can safely estimate an approximate age (and if they passed the history/Religion check or are informed by someone who has may know the rough DC and average damage of the trap). Attempting to open the door before the Chirograft is disabled inflicts a Charisma Save DC 14 as the Chirograft unleashes the power of the River and arcane energy washes over the PC, inflicting a curse of Magical Vulnerability on them (they are disadvantaged on Saves with respect to magical effects; can be removed with a Remove Curse and any appropriate divine prayer spoken over the removal, Religion check DC 10 to know any), inflicting 2d6 necrotic damage, and teleporting them 2d4 times 5ft. backwards (but not beyond a wall, if in a room, no collision damage). On a success, they suffer the same effect but no Curse. The lines and patterns on the door are a combination of Mage Hand infused ink and Bronze and Copper metal parts inside the door. With a Calligraphy or Painters toolkit, a proficient PC may duplicate the shade and texture of the ink easily and may attempt a Calligraphy or Painters Tools check DC 14 (the PC attempting this must also be proficient in Thieves Tools or be helped/assisted by someone that is, the pattern is a lock afterall). On a success, they alter the layout of the metallic parts of the door and disable the trap effect, unlocking the door in the process with dull metallic clicks sounding within. On a failure, the pattern is marred and one suffers the effects of an attempt to open the door as above, except their save is Disadvantaged. . **Witchfog** *The room was completely obscured in a grey-green mist. Squick could see only a few feet into the space, enough to make out the beautifully tiled floor done in vibrant blues and greens. It was part of some larger pattern, obviously, and the hedonist in him wondered if it was something lurid and wanton.* *""Do we go in?"", Teller's voice was hushed and told him that she was probably unsettled by the strange cloud. Brodie knew what it was, they'd seen this before down in the jungle last year. What was it with these bastards and the damned fog stuff? As near as Squick could tell, they weren't immune to it---the idea of flooding a place with something so dangerous when you couldn't guarantee safe passage? Madness.* *Heavens and hells, but Squick really hated Wespers. He lamented how he was likely going to lose his new scarf and, dammit, probably his new boots as well. But, nevertheless, without waiting for suggestions from the rest, he wrapped the scarf around his face, dropped his pack, borrowed Brodie's cloak, wrapped himself up tight, and closed his eyes while the old paladin shook out three waterskins all over him, soaking him to his socks.* **History:** The Wespers were a cult of warlocks infamous throughout the Southern Continent, a band of primal and chaotic devotees of a Great Old being beyond the skies they called The Pierced Flesh. It wasn't long, maybe a generation or so, before knowledge of their dark dealings and cruelties made it to the attention of the chiefs and governors of that land and the Wespers were hunted on sight, less one find corruption and devastation in one's domain. Wesper strongholds, both ones they created in the deep dark places of the jungle and ones they found and took over in the world (old tombs, keeps, hidden caverns) were rife with vicious traps and hazards. One of the most common was Witchfog, also known as Bloodsweat (for the appearance of victims of it in the first stages). **System:** Witchfog is entirely alchemical, it comes from a volatile concoction of rare, foreign reagents (some of which are unearthly) and a dark, masterful skill. The bubbling goo is almost pitch black, like tar, and gives off a constant release of an acidic fog designed to dissolve any porous substance it comes in contact with. An open container the size of a glass bottle can create enough acidic fog within a few seconds to fill a 15ft cube. If anyone has witnessed the brew ""running out"" it hasn't been documented, it seems to perpetually create the fog. One can notice the fog by both sight and smell (a pungent rotted apple scent) automatically, if within 10ft. of it (even through a door or non-air-tight barrier). History check DC 15 to recognize the scent or look, advantaged if one has any kind of scholarly background at all; beating the check by 5 (so, a total of 20 or higher) also informs the PC that the Wespers traditionally carved out a hollow in the stone or hard floor, filled it with an epoxy that created an alchemical glass, to make a sort of immovable cauldron to brew the fog in places they wanted protected. Ending one's turn in the fog, one must make a Constitution save DC 8 + the number of saves one has had to make times 2 (first save 8, second 10, third 12, and so on). On a failure, one takes a number of d6 points of acid damage equal to the number of saves one has had to make. A success, one only takes half the damage. The fog is so frictionless and vicious that retreating from the cloud to safety does not reset the save DC or increasing damage, as the particles are still in one's clothes and skin, ready to react. A thorough soap and water scrubbing can reset, however. At the end of one's first turn in the fog, one's carried and worn items are fine. At the end of one's second turn in the fog, any leather or cloth less than 1 inch wide/thick begins to dissolve (will require mending to survive hard use). At the end of the third turn, any thick leather or thin metal (daggers, rapiers, joints on some armor, mail) begins to damage similarly. At the end of the fourth turn, the thin leather and cloth dissolves entirely. At the end of the fifth turn, the thick leather and thin metal dissolves entirely. At the end of a sixth turn thick metal will be damaged, and at the end of a seventh turn it will be ruined. Soaking one's clothes and possessions will prevent the item damage and advantage one's self on the Constitution saves. Finding the ""cauldron"" is the hardest part, the DM should divide the room into quadrants (they can be rough) and write down on a card which the cauldron is in. Finding it requires an Investigation check (taking an action) while standing in a quadrant---this represents the PC straining to hear the bubbling, read the flow of the gas, even get low to the ground to try and see any change in the floor. At the end of their turn, make saves appropriately. If they don't find it, they will need to move and conduct another action. At the end of their turn, they can make saves appropriately. If they find it, however, disabling is relatively easy with an action. If the character has any kind of pot, bowl, or even a soaked blanket to cover the cauldron, it will suffice to keep the fog at bay for 1d4 minutes. A sealed, air-tight glass or polished stone cover will last 1d6 hours. Glassblower or Potters tools (DC 15) will allow the character to seal away the cauldron completely with an hour of work. Note, magical wind and similar attempts to blow away the fog are only partially effective as it dissipates and generates so fast from the cauldron that at best, it will buy a free turn without having to make saves for someone initially entering the space but no more than that (save DM fiat). Also, note that the actual black tar is dangerously acidic and will dissolve any object that touches it directly in moments. Attempts to ""sample"" it into other containers are likely to lose people fingers and hands as it chaotically bubbles and pops. .

204,vulnerability,dndnext,Please Help Me Finalize These Monsters (Warning: Long!),1,38h288,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/38h288/please_help_me_finalize_these_monsters_warning/,2015-06-04 14:00:41,"IF YOU'RE JUST INTERESTED IN GIVING ME ADVICE ABOUT THE STATBLOCKS AND DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT I HAVE TO SAY BEFOREHAND, SKIP DOWN TO THE NEXT BLOCK OF ALL-CAPS. Hello all, fresh-to-homebrewing-monsters DM here looking for assistance. I'm running a 3 to 5 session campaign for 3 level 3 players of the mystery/horror genre, with inspiration taken from the old Castle Amber module, *The Screwtape Letters* (C.S. Lewis), the 3.5 Ravenloft campaign, and hyenas, among things that don't pop immediately into my head. The main baddie in this mini-campaign is a minor deity called The One That Hungers, and since nothing in the Monster Manual particularly fit my concept for his spawn I decided to create my own. I've currently created the Shadow of Hunger, Horror of Hunger, and to come is the Avatar of Hunger, and maybe a Behemoth of Hunger, in addition to an unrelated NPC that also needs a monster stat block (the last three I'll hopefully finish and post looking for advice on touching them up in a few days). These monsters are basically mismatched bones forming a rough skeleton covered by shadows that form a rough silhouette of a hyena-like beast. The bones are visible upon the creature's destruction, but before its demise all that can be seen (other than the shadow/silhouette) are very large claws and teeth. My intent behind creating these beasts is to (for the Horrors of Hunger) create a powerful and single-minded beast that locks down a single opponent and mercilessly tears them to pieces before moving on to its next victim (Shadows of Hunger are basically intended to be smaller, weaker, swarm-oriented Horrors of Hunger). I want these PCs, upon discovering even one Horror of Hunger, to be forced to very carefully weigh whether or not their resources warrants the risk of combat, or if they should just flee immediately. I intend for Horrors of Hunger to be uncommon and generally solitary, but still very dangerous, and Shadows of Hunger to be more frequent, and generally found in large groups. These creatures are fully intended to be quite powerful in the hopes that creating a greater challenge for the PCs will result in more meaningful victories, as well as hopefully increasing the tension. I'm mostly looking (hoping) for advice on polishing up these monsters, in addition to warnings of what to watch out for that make these creatures just too powerful (turning ""very challenging"" into ""completely unfair"" - it can be a fine line to walk). Please keep in mind that I'm hoping that 3 3rd level adventurers could kill one of the Horrors of Hunger, but it would be very costly, and several Shadows of Hunger, but they will probably prefer to just run after getting their butts kicked once or twice until they are a little more powerful, or are in an advantageous position. ALL RIGHT, HERE IS THE STAT BLOCK, STARTING FROM LOWEST CR TO HIGHEST CR: --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Shadow* *of* *Hunger* (Small Aberration, Chaotic Evil) AC: 12 (10 + DEX) Hit Points: 19 (3d6 + 9) Speed: 40 ft, Fly 20 ft, Burrow 10 ft (can burrow through stone, can burrow through metal at a pace of 1 ft per round) STR: 12 | DEX: 14 | CON: 16 | INT: 10 | WIS: 8 | CHA 4 Skills: Acrobatics (+6) Athletics (+3) Perception (+4) Saves: DEX (+4) CON (+4) Damage Vulnerability: Radiant *(I'm considering changing this to Psychic)* Condition Immunities: Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, Prone, Stunned, Unconscious Senses: Blindsight (10 ft) Languages: Telepathy (10 ft - a Shadow of Hunger can understand any language via telepathy, but itself cannot communicate in this fashion beyond sending very basic feelings, impulses, or images) Challenge Rating: I guesstimate this somewhere between 1/8 and 1 (suggestions to keep this closer to 1/8 or 1/4 would be appreciated) ~~~~QUALITIES~~~~ Grappler: a Shadow of Hunger has advantage on attack rolls against a grappled creature. Fearsome Jaws: a Shadow of Hunger has advantage to maintain a grapple after successfully landing a bite attack. This advantage overrides any disadvantage that would nullify it. However, the Shadow of Hunger's jaws are so firmly latched on its target that it cannot willingly end its grapple without taking a full action to remove its jaws. Shadows and Bones: the Shadow of Hunger's body is composed of rearrangeable bones held together and collected by a magical shadow. It can fit through and comfortably function in any space 2 inches wide or larger. Additionally, anyone that attempts to grapple a Shadow of Hunger does so at a disadvantage because of the nature of its body. Swarm: up to 4 Shadows of Hunger can grapple and attack the same target without interfering with each other. If a Shadow of Hunger is within 5 ft of another Shadow of Hunger that is attacking, or attempting to grapple (or successfully grappling), the same target, both Shadows of Hunger receive advantages to initiate grapple checks OR to their claw attacks. Feast: when a Shadow of Hunger makes a successful bite attack, it heals itself an amount equivalent to half of the damage dealt. A Shadow of Hunger can continue to devour its target once the target is dead, but only receives 1/4 of the damage dealt as health (and can only continue to feed until the entire corpse is consumed - how long that takes us up to the DM, but I advise until the Shadow of Hunger does an equal amount of damage to the corpse as the target's total HP). ~~~~ATTACKS~~~~ Multiattack: make two claw attacks. If both hit the same target, immediately make a bite attack against that target with advantage. Bite Combo: after making a successful bite attack, and until the grapple is broken, each round the Shadow of Hunger can make two claw attacks with advantage against its grappled target and a bite attack that hits automatically. Claw: +4 to hit, 5 ft, 2 damage (slashing) Bite: +4 to hit, 5 ft, 1d4+2 damage (piercing) and the target is grappled (and restrained, if at least one size category smaller than the Shadow of Hunger). Once a target is grappled, a Shadow of Hunger can only make bite attacks against that target. --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Horror* *of* *Hunger* (Large Aberration, Chaotic Evil) Armor Class: 8 (10 - DEX) Hit Points: 112 (15d10 + 30) Speed: 20 ft, Fly 5 ft, Burrow 15 ft (can burrow through stone, can burrow through metal at 5 ft per round) STR: 20 | DEX: 7 | CON: 21 | INT: 14 | WIS: 8 | CHA: 4 Skills: Acrobatics (+1) Athletics (+11) Perception (+2) Saves: STR (+8) CON (+8) Damage Immunities: Psychic, Poison Damage Resistances: Piercing, Slashing *(considering adding)* Damage Vulnerability: Radiant Condition Immunities: Charmed, Frightened, Paralyzed, Poisoned, Prone, Stunned, Unconscious *(considering adding)* Other Immunities: Anything Involving a Wisdom Save *(highly unlikely this will actually fly)* Senses: Blindsight 30 ft Languages: Telepathy (30 ft - a Horror of Hunger can understand any language via telepathy, but itself cannot communicate in this fashion beyond sending very basic feelings, impulses, or images) Challenge Rating: I guesstimate this one to be around CR 6 (I'd prefer to keep this as close to CR 6 s possible, but a power creep to CR 8 is the highest I'd accept) ~~~~QUALITIES~~~~ Bulldoze: after moving 20 ft in a straight line, the Horror of Hunger can choose to continue moving (in that straight line) up to 80 extra feet, but can only stop early if it makes a successful bite attack along the way. While moving in this fashion, the Horror of Hunger travels over or through (whichever is easier) any obstacle that stands in its path, within reason. Using this ability. the Horror of Hunger can bash through up to one foot of stone without slowing down. Grappler: a Horror of Hunger has advantage on all attacks made against a grappled creature. Supreme Jaws: a Horror of Hunger has advantage to maintain grapples made with its bite attack. This advantage cannot be nullified by any number of disadvantages. However, the Horror of Hunger cannot willingly break this grapple unless it successfully manages to chew through whatever it has grappled with its bite attack. If the Horror of Hunger died while grappling an opponent, its jaws can be pried open with a DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check. They can also be broken off (the jaws have an AC of 15 due to hardness, and 30 hit points). Shadows and Bones: a Horror of Hunger's body is composed of mismatched bones held together by a magical shadow. It can fit through any opening of a width of at least 6 inches and function comfortably within. Additionally, all attempts made to grapple a Horror of Hunger are done so at a disadvantage, due to the nature of its body. Feast: after grappling its opponent, a Horror of Hunger heals an amount equivalent to half of the damage it deals with every bite attack. A Horror of Hunger can continue to devour its target once the target is dead, but only receives 1/4 of the damage dealt as health (and can only continue to feed until the entire corpse is consumed - how long that takes us up to the DM, but I advise until the Shadow of Hunger does an equal amount of damage to the corpse as the target's total HP). ~~~~ATTACKS~~~~ Multiattack: make 2 claw attacks. If both hit the same target, move up to 5 ft closer to that same target and make a bite attack with advantage. Bite Combo: after making a successful bite attack, and until the grapple is broken, each round the Horror of Hunger can make two claw attacks with advantage against its grappled target and a bite attack that hits automatically. Claw: +10 to hit, 10 ft, 3d4+5 (12) damage (slashing) Bite: +8 to hit, 5 ft, 3d10+5 (21) damage (piercing) and the target is grappled (and restrained, if at least one size category smaller than the Horror of Hunger). Once a target is grappled, a Hunger of Horror can only make bite attacks against that target."

I do everything in my power to not have the basic ""I swing at him, he swings at me"" fights. This is most important to me when it comes to Boss Battles! 5th Ed has made this even easier now with the introduction of Lair and Legendary actions. However, I'm stuck and need some ideas! I feel like all of my options revolve around 'bad stuff' happening to the players. ""If players play poorly and do x, they take damage."" Or ""If players play smart and do y, they avoid negative status."" What I'm looking for currently is ways to instead give them 'good stuff' to use against the boss when they play well, make the right move, or decipher a weakness. Advantage on attack rolls and boss vulnerability to damage type are my easy answers, but there has to be something more creative out there. What have you guys used or thought up!?

And the point is I wrote, like, an entire paragraph of cheesy dialogue for this. That's how much I want this to be a thing. The aim was to keep the theme of death and necromancy without actually giving them the raise dead spell - hopefully I got there, but I may have screwed it up horribly. Anyway, this is just a first draft so don't be afraid to give input on any issues of balance, lore or convention this might break. ------------- #**Shadow Patron** *You serve a powerful creature of darkness and death that lurks within the recesses of the Shadowfell, such as Orcus or the Raven Queen. Some servants of the Shadowfell do not even sign pacts at all, gaining an impossible grasp over death itself over night for reasons known only to their illusive patron. Others might be charged with the abolishment of magics that intrude upon their patron's ghostly servants, such as necromancy - whilst still more serve as the blades and mouths of death cults - or the shadowy assassins of a creature sympathetic to the lament of the tortured spirits that listlessly wonder its domain. Regardless of a purpose, all wield the icy chill of death like a cloak, and all have the jaded look of one who has seen what no living mortal should ever see.* ----------- **Expanded Spell List-** | Spell Level | Spells | |:-----------------|:----------------| | **1st** | *ray of sickness, inflict wounds* | **2nd** | *blur, blindness/deafness* | **3rd** | *blink, slow* | **4th** | *greater Invisibility, ice storm* | **5th** | *cloudkill, cone of cold* **Whispers of the Shadowfell (1st):** At first level you can draw upon a spirit's mortal ties and lingering connection to the Shadowfell to contact them. Once per long rest you can use a body part of item of importance belonging to a dead person to summon their spirit for questioning, although their disposition towards you depends entirely on what they were like in life, and their memories are often fragmented and ravaged by time. In addition, you can force a spirit summoned in this way to answer one one question truthfully by invoking your powers. They may choose to reply to this query in riddles or half truths however. You cannot compel an individual spirit to speak truthfully in this way more than once a year. Souls that have chosen to become fiends or were otherwise destroyed through some description of magical phenomena cannot be summoned in this way. **Shadow Walk (6th):** At sixth level you are able to give your soul physical form, leaving your body in a shadowy miasma without risk of physical harm or incrimination. As an action you may leave your body, manifesting in the form of a 'Shadow Projection' *(See below)*. Whilst projected in this way you lose all control and awareness of your physical form. Moving more than 200 metres from your body, having your shadow form reduced below 1 hit point, staying in the form for more than 10 minutes or ending the power as an action immediately returns your consciousness to your physical body. You may not leave your body in this way more than once per short rest. Your body suffer psychic damage equal to your warlock level in the event that your shadow self is destroyed. Your shadow projection possesses the same proficiency bonus, languages, skills and save proficiencies as you in addition to your Intelligence, Charisma and Wisdom scores. The shadow projection is limited to the features described on its stat and cannot make use of class features, invocations or cast spells. **Dark Spiral Aura (10th):** As of 10th level, you may fashion a protective aegis from the souls of your defeated adversaries - striking attackers down with the raw power of the resentful dead - to dramatic effect. Each time you reduce a living creature to 0 HP you gain a Soul. Once per short rest, after suffering from a successful melee attack you may choose to invoke your Souls to rebuke your attacker as a reaction. In such an event, your assailant must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are knocked prone and suffer 1D6 necrotic damage for each soul you have stored *(up to a maximum of 5D6 damage)*. After invoking your aura, all of your stored souls are consumed. The souls are harvested by your patron in the event that you refrain from collecting any more for a period of a minute. You must possess at least one soul in order to rebuke an attacker. **Reaping (14th):** Once per long rest you may summon a two-handed spectral scythe into your hands as a bonus action. Whilst held, the scythe grants the wielder a number of temporary hit points equal to twice their level and as long as the weapon is wielded in both hands you may use it to make a magical melee attack as an action. The scythe deals 5D10 necrotic damage, or 7D10 necrotic damage at 17th level, on a hit. Reducing a living creature to 0 HP with the scythe immediately kills it and causes it to return to life on the following turn as a 'Ghast' (MM, *pg. 148*). The reanimated corpse will follow your commands and assist you in battle until the scythe is returned to your patron, at which point they fall lifelessly to the ground - this time for good. The corruption bestowed upon a Ghast wrought by this this feature may be reverted by 'Remove Curse', 'Raise Dead', 'Resurrection' and 'True Resurrection' spells. Ghasts raised in this way may utilise any items of clothing they were wearing upon their death, but may not wield weapons or manipulate objects. The scythe returns to the shadowfell in the event that you drop it, have your temporary hit points reduced to 0 or ten minutes passes since your weapon was summoned. Alternatively, you may forfeit your use of this power for the day in order to take the form of a 'Wraith' (MM, *pg. 302*) the next time you use your Shadow Walk feature. Whilst in Wraith form you follow the same special rules as the Shadow Projection, save that you may retain your wraith form for up to an hour before being forcfully shunted back into your body. You may choose to use the 'Create Spectre' as normal whilst projecting in this way, although all of your summoned Spectres are immediately destroyed upon returning to your body. ------------ ###**Shadow Projection-** *Medium Undead* **Challenge Rating:** 1/8 (25 XP) **Hit Points:** 5 (1D6) **AC:** 11 **Speed:** 40ft walk, 40ft climb, 20ft fly **Str:** 6 (-2) **Dex:** 12 (+1) **Con:** 12 (+1) **Int:** - **Wis:** - **Char:** - **Damage Resistance:** Non-magical or silvered piercing, blunt and slashing damage. **Damage Vulnerability:** Radiant **Damage Immunity:** Poison, Necrotic **Condition Immunity:** Poisoned **Senses:** Dark Vision; 120ft. ***Traits-*** **Black Mist:** You can flatten yourself to squeeze through any non-watertight opens or crevices you wish. **Insubstantial:** You cannot influence the physical plane in anyway, benefit from the wearing of magical items or inflict physical harm upon others. **Darkness Incarnate:** Whilst within Darkness or Dim Light you are considered to be invisible. **Sunlight Hypersensitivity:** You suffer 1D10 radiant damage at the beginning of each turn you spent in contact with direct sunlight and suffer disadvantage to all rolls whilst beneath the sun's rays. ***Edits: Nerfed Shadow Walk significantly and made it the level 6 power, limited Dark Spiral Aura to once per short rest and a maximum of 5d6 damage, removed the AC bonus from Reaping. Siphon Life is removed. Mother of god Contagion was broken; it has now been replaced by cloud kill. Realised that for god knows what reason warlocks don't get Ray of Sickness - this is now added in place of ice knife.*** "

This is just the rules nuts and bolts of the race, not the fluff. Thanks much. Treeling Treeling Traits Boosted Ability Scores. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and your Wisdom score increases by 2. Age. Treelings age at a rate similar to elves, reaching maturity at about 100 years and living to 750 years or possibly more. Alignment. Though tending towards benevolent rather than malevolent, Treelings do not usually think of terms of good and evil, law and chaos. As a result, Treelings are most often neutral in alignment. Their ideas of morality are typically shaped by a very practical viewpoint. Size. Treelings range in height from 6 to 7 feet. Your size is Medium. Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 ft. Darkvision. Treelings have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 ft. of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You cant discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Natural Armor. Due to their bark-like skin, Treelings have a base armor class of 11. Damage Vulnerabilities. Treelings have damage vulnerability to fire. Photosynthesis. Treelings are able to use photosynthesis to meet some of their sustenance needs. As a result, Treelings need half the food and water that other races require. Forest Camouflage. You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks in forested terrain. Tree Shape. Once per day, you may take the shape of a medium sized tree for an unlimited duration. While in tree form, even the closest inspection will not reveal you are anything other than a sapling. You are able to observe you surroundings as normal, your base armor class becomes 15, but your speed drops to 0 and attacks have advantage against you. Any items you wear or carry merge with your form when you change and do not function while merged. Speak with Plants. Upon reaching 3rd level, you may cast Speak with Plants once per day. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell. Languages. You can speak, read and write Common and Sylvan. "

Vulnerability to fire (Not giving the piercing/bludgeoning resistance - seems like too much for a player to start with). Common and Sylvan languages. Bonus cantrip of something like Speak with Plants - basically just the first paragraph of the spell description only. It seems balanced, unto itself and relative to other PC races. I think it's mechanically modest, but you get to be a tree. Maybe it's a little underpowered. I actually haven't really homebrewed much of anything for 5e yet, so if you've more experience and you'd like to share your intuitions on this, I'm all ears."

Would love some feedback or additional ideas. **""Breath Weapon""**(new) * As a BONUS ACTION you may use your breath weapon. * You may use your breath weapon an amount of times equal to your constitution modifier. You regain these uses after a short or long rest. * A creature takes 1d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 2d6 at 4th level, 3d6 at 8th level, 4d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 16th level, and 6d6 at 20th level **""Polarizing Presence""** * Unless NPCs have a specific reason to feel differently, most races or creatures will regard you with unease. * If you are regarded with unease you have disadvantage on persuasion checks and your presence increases the difficulty of persuasion checks for you and anyone else in your party by an amount equal to your strength or charisma modifier (whichever is higher). * In return, when you or anyone in your party with you present makes an intimidation check against an NPC who regards you with unease they may add your strength or charisma modifier (whichever is higher) to the roll. **""Draconic Resistance""** * You have resistance to magical damage. * You are vulnerable to one type of elemental damage. This vulnerability cannot be offset or mitigated by magical spell effect or effect of potion. (either you choose the element, or the element is based on your Draconic ancestry and comes off a predetermined chart). * If the elemental damage you are vulnerable to is caused by magic, the vulnerability and resistance each cancel the other out so that you are neither vulnerabile nor resistant. **""Clawed hands and Feet""** * The claws on your hands and feet aid you in maintaining grip and traction. * You have the benefits of boot tips and gloves without the need of a climbers' kit. When climbing you cannot use the claws to anchor yourself, but you have advantage to any checks that would cause you to lose your grip or fall. * Your claws aid you in maintaining your balance on most surfaces. You may add your strength or dexterity modifier to any checks that that would knock you down. * To accomodate your clawed hands and feet and gain the benefit of this abilityk addittional modification must be made to any armor or shield you wear. The modifications cost an additional 10% of the armor's price (EX: Splint Armor costs 200gp, modified Splint Armor costs 220gp). When purchasing the armor directly, the modifiction is already done at the time of purchase. When modifying armor you already own, the modifications take one day. Modifying unique or magical armor has the same cost as that armor's base version and takes the same amout of time. **""Draconic Potency""** * You may take an additional +1 in one attribute in exchange for -1 in another, with no attribute receiving a total racial bonus greater than +2 (for example if you already have +2 in strength an additional point may not be added to the stength total). * *Or maybe just a few variant options that use this mechanic without offering players the choice:* +2 str, -1 int, +1 con, +1 cha +1 str, -1 dex, +1 wis, +2 cha"

I don't even hate you. I regard you in the same way I regard the paper on which I scribble my careful messages or the base metal I forge into something of use. You're mortal, which means you're one of millions times millions of pestilential, short-lived things in this world and all others that I may use for a larger purpose.* *""Should I tell you my purpose? Again? I've told you before, of course. Your mind cannot hold its grandeur and naturally burns itself free of the knowledge each time. You used to speak clearly, that stutter is a sign you're slipping more. Your soul cannot handle the burden of my majesty. But, because it makes me laugh and happy, I'll tell you again.* *""Sshhhhh, careful boy, shhhh. No crying yet. I haven't even started. You'll need to steel yourself, you always scream at the end...""* **System:** The wars of mortals are won with diplomacy, bargaining, and some military force. The fool thinks it requires only the last bit. Great rebellions have overthrown powerful entrenched authorities only to themselves fracture and dissolve for lack of a solid web of support built by friendships, allies, and the careful sale of power, prestige, and resources to enemies. Paper wins wars. In the vast expanse of the planar hells, it is no different. The Fiends have brokered the Great War for eons, serving no side and facilitating treaties, exchanges, and accords. The Blisterkrau, a Fiend of the Eight Gate who brokered the sale of the Lands of Inx to the Lost Powers, took his reward and turned his eye toward the ruination of another sort. His warlocks have worked knowingly and unwittingly both for millenia towards this new end. His Shroud has been passed from cult to cult, from Warlock to Warlock, and grants its bearer a part to play in the great plan. Attunement requires the overthrow of a legitimate government (in the form of the disgraceful ousting of a mayor, the bankrupting of a town's administration, the institution of a different form of rulership, etc.). Once done, the Shroud---a pink and white, skin-soft robe as light as air---grants the wearer the ability to spend their Hit Dice to recover spell slots at an exchange rate of 4 HD for 1 slot for any non-warlock casters; 3 HD for 1 slot for warlocks; and 2 HD for 1 slot for Fiendish patron Warlocks. . **Revealers** *While Occam let the demon swing away at him, firey axe trailing a comet of light and smoke this way and that while the stern and scarred warrior stepped out of the way over and over in a physical taunt that enraged the thing, Beniss circled wide behind it. Staying out of its reach, out of its line of sight, trying to get around it and hoping it wouldn't notice. Chains wet with blood (its own? one of its victims'?) whipped gracefully, so smoothly that one forgot they were hundreds of pounds of arcane steel that would slap a man in half on impact.* *As Beniss found his opening (and Occam took a searing cut across his already horrifically puckered and lined chest), he ran a finger along the rings on his right hand. Hard, ghostly images flew around him, symbols of light and wisping smoke keeping perfect distance from his fingers as though locked in orbit around them. Once satisfied with whatever they were saying, he took a deep breath and pressed his other hand against the giant thing's leg.* *The symbols danced and changed, and Beniss had enough time to call out four short words before a bloody chain broke most of his ribs and left him dying on the dry, hard ground.* **System:** Divination magic is one of the great misunderstood elements of the arcane education. Novices and adepts gravitate, in all academies and amongst all private tutelages, toward Evocational and Conjurational lines of magic (and the truly power hungry dabble in the dark purple arts of reanimation and death). The Diviners have a quieter role. Studied by the usually less adventurous, quick to find appointment to a court, they form the backbone of the Arcane Traditions in a quiet way. Originally designed for scholarly pursuits, the Revealers have found some popularity amongst Diviners and mages seeking the life of discovery in the field and adventure in the hidden places of the world. Revealers are a set of three gold rings with a pearl inlay around the bands meant to be worn on the first two fingers and thumb. Attunement requires formal authorization from any of the Archmages of Divination (from any academy or scholam)---Evokers may allow their tools to be used by any hexslinger with a book and a grudge, but Diviners are somewhat more circumspect. Once attuned, the rings allow the wearer to draw forth knowledge of a creature by bringing its anima, its pattern in the cosmos, into focus and representing it with arcane symbols to be read. To use this ability, the wearer must calibrate the rings with an action (requiring the opposite hand to turn them just so to refract the light in a specific way). From there, the rings project readying runes of curiosity and inquiry around the wearer's hand. Upon touching a target creature with the other hand (the un-ringed hand), the runes of light start shifting and telegraphing information about the subject. So long as the un-ringed hand is in unbroken contact, at start of the wearer's turn they first get the creature's Type or Name (wearer's choice); at the start of their next turn (if still in contact), they get the creature's Damage Immunities or Damage Vulnerabilities (wearer's choice); and at the start of their third turn (if still in contact), they get a piece of the creature's pattern---giving the wearer advantage in attacks, saves, and ability checks against the creature for 24 hours. . **Boots of Proteas** *Kirig Vul had been murdering in these forests for nearly twenty years and was regarded far and wide amongst the gobs and hobs as one of the most dangerous warchiefs in their collective history. Sure, he hadn't any of the high weaponry or infrastructure of his taller cousins in the Hobgoblin nations, and didn't have the brutish might of the bugbears either. But his band of gobs were no less lethal in their element. Theirs was the warband that turned this corner of the Emperor's domain into a no man's land where even the Emperor's Own elite soldiers avoided at all cost.* *And here, the gods of the dark and warm were blessing Kirig. A lone stranger, mashing a turnip in a pot just as bold as you please. It'd be a quick kill, then, then a look at what's in his pack, then maybe take the head and leave it at the edge of the wood for a solid message to the Emperor that his subjects were not welcome. It'd been years since they'd done that.* *But, the stranger was gone. Suddenly, as though he'd not been there at all and were it not for the pot he'd have thought it all an illusion. Kirig felt a panic rise, the unknown was bad business for a brigand. And as he stood and started backing away, he bumped into someone behind him. Someone tall. Someone that had not been there a moment before.* **System:** In the time of the Weylthia Courts, which ruled the Great circle of the Fae before the Planar Godlings and Material Powers grew the universe, an Arch-Fey of the Hard Green formed a proto-world for its own amusement and curiosity. The worldling was small and simple, it grew its grasses and strange beasts grazed it and in the flash of an eye after centuries of gardening, it was voided from existence as the Fey found a new distraction. Just as carelessly, she took a pair of boots made by a primitive sentient tribe that had developed there and dropped them into the now created real world. Such is the chaotic indifference of the alien Fey. The Boots are made of the barest substance of pure creation itself. Resembling woven boots of thick, dark blue grass, they grant the wearer an affinity for the earth in ways no arcane or divine powers can truly duplicate. Attunement requires being buried alive in the boots for three days. No food or water, no magical or other assistance. Communing with the soil and the earth on a deep and somewhat maddening level. Once attuned the boots allow the wearer to sink into and merge with natural ground for extended period of times. Using an action, one may drop into natural ground one is standing on, falling deep below the surface and merging with the soil and roots and clay and sands and rocks underneath. One is immune to all damage types while merged except Necrotic and should anyone target the ground with Necrotic damage within 10ft. of where one initially merged one will take double damage (having Vulnerability). One has a movement while merged equal to 5ft times their proficiency bonus. Returning imposes 1 exhaustion on the wearer and requires a bonus action. . the last two, ""The Feast"" and ""Sola Scriptura"" at [manysideddice.com](URL"

He hardly remembered what she looked like, back when they were young. They'd survived the war, the purge... and he'd been the only one to survive the bare winter that followed. She had red hair. She liked climbing trees.* *That was nearly two hundred years ago, and it felt longer. Every sacrifice made the years seem longer, and even now---as he stared at his son, foolish and weak thing that his progeny was---he was reminded of why he did this. Reminded of the long game. Reminded that empires are not destroyed with a few bold fights but with the force of the ages and a will ready to make the sacrifices necessary to temper the steel of a thousand knives.* *His followers were many, carefully chosen over the generations---brought into the great circle of being. They knew how he prolonged his life, they knew about all of his children over the centuries. They honored them. He honored them. The fawn that falls to the wolf is a part of the larger destiny of the wild.* *He would bring the empire to its knees. He was the wolf that leads the pack, the pack would devour this weak false kingdom. He would do it for the greater good of the world, and not a little for the redhaired girl on whose bones this city was built.* **System:** The Scepter is a two foot shaft of hewn obsidian, the glassy rock bears the marks of being fashioned from small chipping tools with great care. When held to the light, the naturally dark black material shines a translucent green---deep as the canopy of an old forest. To the casual observer, it is the sort of thing a distinguished man of gentle birth might carry on a walk through a garden. It was, in the oldest time, the focus of a druidic cult intent on changing the world itself. Attunement to the Scepter requires siring progeny. Once the child is born, the Scepter becomes active and the wielder becomes the fulcrum to the turning of great events and grants three distinct abilities. First, the wielder may grant a spell to another. Doing so loans the spellslot the spell is to be cast to the recipient. They do not have to be willing. The wielder chooses a target, chooses a spell they can case, and the appropriate slot---the recipient now has that slot, regains the slot in the same manner the wielder does normally, and can use it to cast only that spell. This lasts for a number of years equal to 10 minus the spell's level. It may be returned to the wielder on the death of the recipient, but no sooner. Second, the wielder may use a reaction to speak a phrase in Druidic to another who knows the language---the effect of which is similar to the Help action (in granting advantage on an ability check or save only, though). Third, on the final death of the wielder---3 failed death saves, as the most common example---the wielder is born again through the child they sired. They grow bodily from the child's own form, tearing through it (killing the child in the process), and emerge at half the age and one level lower than when they died. They then must reattune to the Scepter to use its abilities. . **Eighth Wand of the Good Man** *""The world hates you. I hear it. You think the green is the only power in the world? You think the circles and spheres of the wild are only rich and vibrant and warm? You are ignorant. I am the teacher sent from the Last Places to instruct you in what the skies and seas and secret lands really are.""* *""The desert is vast.""* *""The ocean is crushing.""* *""The mountains choke life from the ambitious.""* *""The skies are filled with rage.""* *""The earth is home to its own monsters.""* *""I am who was sent to bring all of these to you and hear you scream your sins to a world that drinks them like wine.""* *""I am the true wild.""* **System:** The Goodman was the last Son of the Bound. A druidic sect that sought to eliminate virtually all life in a great plan to return the world to its most primordial and simple state---its form before the great beings came, before gods, before powers of any kind shaped people or higher creatures. The Goodman's sect was the focus of the Far War. which destroyed what was, before what is came to be. One of the weapons of his crusade, the least of them, was a wand fashioned from a cruel, jagged spike of perpetually smoking dry, sandy ice--devastatingly cold and menacing to the touch. A piece of the world that was. Attunement to the wand requires surviving one month, a full turn of the moon, without any trappings of civilization or magical support. A month of natural ability, crafting no tools, using no technologies or divine or arcane assistance. Pure survival in the wild. Every three days requires a Survival Check DC appropriate to the terrain (5 for a place with abundant water and fauna, 15 for a place of varying and uncertain wilderness, 25 for a place somewhat barren, etc.). The DM is encouraged to look to starvation, thirst, etc. rules to govern how bad or lethal it can be to have poor results. Backing out requires starting over. Once attuned the wand allows the wielder to bring to bear on their surroundings the fury and inhospitable effects of the worst of natural environments. The wand has 7 charges, replenishing 1d4 charges per day spent outside of developed settlements or cities. With an action, one may bring the dry, blistering heat of the Infinite Desert to bear around themselves---all creatures within 60ft. must make a Con Save DC 5 multiplied by the number of charges spent with the action (evoking more and more the unforgiving, searing heat of the baked sands and arid vastness). Failures grant 1 exhaustion and the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of every turn they spend in the radius for as long as Concentration is held by the wielder. With an action, one may bring the surging, powerful and rolling power of the unforgiving sea in a storm---all creatures in a radius equal to 5ft multiplied by the number of charges spent find themselves choking on chilly sea-water (suffocation rules may apply, if the creature requires breathing) and slowed and crushed by unseen waves. While within the radius, movement is reduced to 5ft and there is a 50% chance once movement is declared that they are tossed 5ft in the opposite direction they wished to go (only for movement, having no effect on Dash actions or magical forms of movement or movement caused by others). With an action, one may inflict the worst of the high tundras and great barren peaks of the mountains upon a target. Target makes a Strength Save DC 5 times the number of charges spent with the action to push Vulnerability to Cold onto a target for one round. The icy bite of the desolate high places above the clouds grasping them fiercely for a moment. . the last one, the ""Shade of Life"" at [manysideddice.wordpress.com](URL "

Chorom d'Zaet had been his friend, his confidant, had been the one to start him on his own path, had shared with him the Way, and his passing had been particularly hard on the old paladin.* *Ferail took the opportunity for the break and fed the old grey horse. Oatcakes, looked like. Choron hated oatcakes, wouldn't eat them and wouldn't have fed the grey any, either. Broadways felt the urge to stop the young man right then and there, but stopped himself---such a trivial thing, not worth confusing the boy.* *It had been three weeks together, Ferail with the group. And not once had the young man said more than two words to Broadways in tha time. He had jokes for Meila and traded news with Teller, but he'd been avoiding the old man at every turn. It made Broadways suspicious. It wasn't until last night that he'd let all that wariness melt away to whatever this melancholy was.* *In the middle of the meal, when the others were turning their bedrolls out, the young warrior took a bare moment and whispered.* *""I'm sorry I left you, Brodie---I'm sorry to have put all this on you. The Way is a circle, and long is its course.""* **System:** Abin's Course are a pair of simple, light, and immaculately crafted boots. The sole is thin, but impossibly durable, worn only barely by what (surprisingly) has been centuries of use. The dark brown boots are crisscrossed with threads of dusty white metal. Initial attunement is accomplished with a choice. The boots will be found---they are only ever found---usually laying in dangerous places. Upon putting them on, one is given the choice. Either accept the burden---The Way---an oath and path of conduct blessed by the sovereign gods or not. If rejected, the boots slowly vanish and cannot be located. If accepted, the PC must take their next level or levels in Monk or Paladin until they select a Monastic Tradition or Sacred Oath. If they currently already have a Monastic Tradition or Oath, this will alter (though not replace) some miscellaneous tenants of it. Should they die before achieving their Tradition or Oath, the boots fade away to find another suitable person of worth. Once attuned and worn, the PC becomes the next link in a chain of a great mission and path that has gone back centuries. The DM is encouraged to forge an interesting flavor to what their role is to be in it and what works are needed from the PC to honor it. It may add some elements to a Sacred Oath, it may shift some details in keeping a Tradition. The PC's mind is flooded with memories of all who have worn the Course before and how they are part of an ages old quest that will, indeed, go beyond their own lives as well. The wearer of the Course gets death saves as normal except the fail range is from 1-15 instead of 1-10. On their third failure, their spirit is lifted from their body and moves on to the rewards of the Great Circle, their burdens and the Course, passing to another. The boots will vanish from their body, no magical or other means can stop it, and put themselves in the path of a hero or one who is destined to become one. The player may select two of the five following elements of this new hero: * Ability Scores (the same stats their previous had) * Race (and subrace) * Background (and proficiencies/languages only) * Class (and archetype--max level one less than their previous had) * Feats (the same feats their previous had, in order taken, where possible) The remaining two elements not selected are done by the DM. For elements like Ability Scores (up to same stats had by original) or Class (including level-1), if one does not select them, the DM may (though they also may not) select the minimum RAW value for these for a playable character--or any in between. Wherever that character is, the boots are found by them at the same moment the original wearer dies. They had the choice and accepted it. Play begins for the new PC at the point of taking on the responsiblity. Their new PC gets flashed of memories and knows (as the original did) things about the history of the Course (the DM is encouraged to add snippets of the coming great struggle or purpose of their mission). The Way is a circle and it's course is long. . **Consecrated Bakama** *Being blessed means being cursed. There is no gain in circumventing the Way. The Way is a circle and its course is long. When you trace a circle upon the ground, Kaei, and then trace your finger around it---as you advance in one direction are you not also retreating from the other?* *This is part of the Way. And it is a part all who live by it must know.* *That is not to say that one must never choose a direction---for standing only still is not the Way. Place, here yes, your finger. Do not move it. Are you a true part of the circle? You are a point. You could be a point in any figure. On any path. BY staying only still you are not following the Way but scared of it.* *That is not part of the way. And you must know that as well.* *Some may think---when they see us go about our lives---that it is chaos. It is like the rain, they think. It falls and cares not where or cannot be known. But, truly it is not. It is not us who are the drops of the rain, falling randomly through the skies to moisten a random bit of ground. We are instead the man who walks through the rain to get home. We will get wet and not wet, it does not matter either way, so long as we continue walking.* **System:** The bakama is a coarse garment, finely made but rugged in utility. It is unadorned by any interesting pattern or color. A beige heavy cloth cut in such a way as to make a loose-fitting blouse and trouser that must be carefully wrapped and tied around the waist and shoulders. Great care must go into wearing the bakama. The sacred followers of the Way---hidden in their valley---created the bakama to teach their champions to appreciate the full circle of the world's dangers and protect them from some. Attunement requires a ceremonial donning of the outfit (DC History 20) and the appropriate sworn oath to wear it through all of one's trials and travails until one knows the full story of the pain of the world. Once attuned, it's granted powers come alive---but at a cost. One cannot gain the benefit of any armor when attuned to the bakama---worn or not. Every day requires re-donning the garment (a 10 minute process, intricate) and removing takes as much time. Each day, the wearer may select one damage type to be resistant to (must be a different one each time they pick, there are thirteen--acid, bludgeoning, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, piercing, poison, psychic, radiant, slashing, thunder). Of the remaining, the DM rolls 1d12 to pick the second type one may be resistant to (numbered alphabetically, less the one already picked). The DM then lists the damage types in any order they wish on a notecard and numbers them (less the first one picked by the PC that day), and rolls 1d12. The number is documented on the back of the card (openly) and the DM knows (secretly) which damage type is selected by that roll. That damage type is what the PC is vulnerable to today. Only an attack or intentionally hostile effect from another creature triggers the DM revealing the vulnerability by turning over the card (and then, naturally, applying the appropriate damage effects). Any attempts to divine or otherwise reveal the damage do not work. The bakama unattunes at sunrise following the day the PC has experienced resistance to all damage types during this time. They may reattune as desired. . the last one, ""The Hurricane Gallichon"" at [manysideddice.com](URL"

This race is a little silly. But it makes sense, in a way, for our setting. I just wanted to see if this race looks fair-ish before I hand the details to the details to the parties involved. **Homebrew race: Were-** (this is my catch-all meta-race for future lycantropes.) * **Racial stat bonus:** +2 con * **Speed:** 30 ft * **Languages:** Common * **Damage Vulnerability:** You are vulnerable to Silvered and Magical Weapons * **Shapechanger**. You can use its action to polymorph into a hybrid or full animal form, or back into your true form, which is humanoid. Your statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment you are wearing or carrying isnt transformed. You revert to your true form if you die. Your hybrid form and full form have abilities dependent on your animal, as listed below. You cannot wield weapons or wear armor in full animal form. You cannot speak in full animal form. **Were-Octopus:** * **Racial stat bonus:** +1 Dex * **Speed:** In hybrid form, you have a swim speed of 15 ft. In Octopus form, you have a swim speed of 30ft. Darkvision * **Tentacles:** (Hybrid/Octo) With your tentacles, you are adept at grappling. You have advantage on checks to initiate the grapple, and on checks to maintain the grapple. * **Ink Cloud** (Hybrid/Octo) Recharges after short or long rest. A 20 ft radius cloud of in extends all around if the target is under water, The area is heavily obscured for one minute, although significant current can disperse the ink. After releasing the ink, the octopus can use the dash action as a bonus action * **Underwater Camouflage** (in Hybrid/octopus form): Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) Checks made under water * **Amphibious** (Hybrid Only): You can breathe both air and water * **Water breathing** (in Octopus form): Can only breath underwater * **Hold breath** (In Octopus Form): Can hold breath for up to an hour This is a pirate/swashbuckling sailor setting, so all the water based abilities should come up often enough."
215,vulnerability,dndnext,Calculating damage types...?,1,2y6pof,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2y6pof/calculating_damage_types/,2015-03-07 10:03:47,"This has only come up a few times, but I wanted to clarify it. Basically I'm curious how damage from multiple sources is calculated. I understand that vulnerability means the damage is doubled, and resistance means it is halved. But I'm not sure how much of the damage of an attack is considered to come from a given type. ***** * If a paladin is attacking a shadow and uses their smite to add radiant damage to their attack, is all of their damage considered radiant, or only the additional dice from the smite? * Say they deal 1d6 (shortsword) + 3 (STR mod) + 2d8 (smite) to a shadow. The shadow resists normal nonmagical weapons (like the shortsword) but is vulnerable to radiant damage. In my games, I've been halving the shortsword damage and the modifier, but then doubling the smite. * For example: (5+3)/2= **4 slashing** + (2+7)x2= **18 radiant**, or 22 total damage. ~~That makes sense, but feels over-complicated and wrong.~~ * ~~Alternately, you could take the d6+2d8+3 in the above example and consider it ""piercing, mundane, radiant"" damage. Then (if I am doing this right) the damage of say 5+3+9 would be doubled (radiant) and halved (resisted) for 17 damage, effectively cancelling each other out.~~ * ~~There's a chance that the smite damage makes the weapon a ""magic attack"" which would cancel resistance anyway, but I'm sure there are other damage types/monsters that would work for the example in that case.~~ I don't have a book on hand, but can somebody help me out a bit here? EDITED: Thanks for the quick answers guys! Scratched out the parts that I had that were wrong."
216,vulnerability,dndnext,Vampirism and Lycanthropy,2,2y7ewc,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2y7ewc/vampirism_and_lycanthropy/,2015-03-07 14:05:00,"I was thinking about making a sort of home-brew disease/infection a la oblivion/skyrim for both. To spice up the gameplay and put the fear into my players (who like a dark fantasy low magic setting), I wanted to make a chance of them catching a disease when fighting a Vampire or Werewolf. Then it hit me, use it like a disease with a tracker, and the more they feed into it (don't resist or try to get it cured) the more it develops. Then I thought it would be interesting to give possible benefits and drawbacks to each. Tell me what you guys think, remember this is a rough step: Stage 0 of both: They are only infected, they are ""sickly,"" appearing. They lose their level worth of hp (a 2nd level player would lose 2 hp) from their max hp. Vampirisim would gain vulnerability to Fire and Radiant damage. Lycanthropy would gain vulnerability to magic weapons (possible straight arcane damage?) Stage 1: Vampirism: You would now be considered undead, you would stop aging. (I was toying with making it so you cant get ability score improvements from this). You are not an obvious vampire. You gain one use of the False Life spell per long rest, your spell casting ability for this is Constitution. You can make a bite attack on an enemy (like an unarmed attack) that does 1d4 + str damage, and you are healed 1/2 the damage done. This is ""Feeding"" when you feed, your victim rolls a d20 or possibly gets infected (vrs a dc) If you feed too frequently you would reach the next stage of infection. Lycanthropy: You would gain one use of the Druid Shape (name?) ability, and you would be able to turn into a dire-wolf. *I was toying with making it so they roll a d4 and whatever they roll would be a different animal upon their initial infection, 1 being a bear, 2 being a dire wolf, 3 being a tiger, 4 being a lion* If you turn more than once per long rest you must make a DC check or possibly get another level of infection. If you fail the DC check you also gain a level of exhaustion. Once per play session the DM can ask for a DC check, on a fail you will automatically, without control, turn into your beast mode. Vampirisim stage 2: The Vampire would gain access to the Misty Step spell for once per long rest. The bite attack is increased to 1d6. People can now make a wis check to see if you are infected. Lycanthropy stage 2: The lycan would gain access to 2 transformations per long rest without a possible repercussion. They are also possibly noticeable as an infected (people can make a wis check to see if you are infected). Your unarmed strikes can now be considered slashing light weapons, and would do 1d4 + str mod damage. You now gain benefits from your beast form when not in it (*keen senses* from most animals, advantage on perception checks with scent, sight, or sound maybe?) Vampirisim stage 3: You are now obviously a vampire. People will fear you unless you use an illusion ability to disguise yourself, or you make active cheks to try to hide it. You gain one use of the Chill Touch spell per long rest. you're bite is now increased to a 1d8, you no longer have the minus to your max health Lycanthropy Stage 3: You can now use your beast mode three times per long rest without having to make checks against exhaustion. You are clearly bestial in nature and people will likely assume you are a lycan, unless you are actively trying to hide it. You're unarmed strikes are now 1d6, and you would gain access to one ability from your beast mode in normal form, I *was thinking* Pack Tactics, Pounce, or Multiattack (working so that you can do two attack actions in one, if you are proficient with your weapon, not sure about that one though) You now lose the minus to your max hp from your infection Please feedback would be nice if you think any of this is too much, I really want to use a system like this, I just would like to know what other's have done to implement a system like this, or what they would think of this one!"
217,vulnerability,dndnext,[Homebrew]Voodoo Warlock?,3,2zm6hj,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2zm6hj/homebrewvoodoo_warlock/,2015-03-20 06:11:03,"Just some clarification, I have always hated homebrew, especially in third edition when there were so many options, balanced and unbalanced, in both editions. In 5th edition, there is not yet much content, so this is a combination of custom design and wishful thinking. The basic idea is for the warlock to use herself as a voodoo doll. That said, does this 1st level ability seem balanced? Voodoo Pact 1st: *Life Knot* When a warlock makes a voodoo pact, she learns the most well-known trick of witch-doctors, how to temporarily weave their life thread with that of another. As a bonus action, she may bond with a single creature within 30' of her. The creature is entitled to a charisma save to prevent the bond from forming this turn. Until the beginning of her next turn, whenever the Voodoo warlock takes damage from any source, the bonded creature takes that same amount and type of damage. Calculate damage shared before applying resistance or vulnerability. A warlock can use this ability a number of times equal to her charisma modifier, finishing a long rest will restore any expended uses. *Some possible additions:* An invocation that lets this ability transfer status effects, even ongoing disease/poison? A higher level ability that lets the warlock grant advantage on the saving throw, but failure now results in the warlock taking no damage from the effect? Let me know how I could balance this, and feel free to contribute if you have any ideas on improving/expanding on this idea."

All devils have disadvantage against spells or abilities used by Asmodeus that would command them or affect their minds. **Rod of the Lord:** Once per day, if he strikes a devil with his ruby rod, the devil must make a Constitution Saving Throw (DC 25) or die. If the devil is kneeling, the saving throw fails if Asmodeus chooses. Any fiend who attacks Asmodeus while he's wielding the rod must make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 25) or lose its Action, overcome by the powerful presence of the king. If this happens, Asmodeus can use a reaction to use Command spell on the fiend in question. **Warlock of Tyranny:** Asmodeus can cast the Warlock spells with Charisma as his spell-casting ability (Spell save DC 25), (Spell attack 18), (Spell Slots 6, 6th level) **Actions** _____________________________________________ **Multi-attack** Asmodeus can use his frightful presence.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatures saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Asmodeus's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours. **Portfolio Sense** Asmodeus can sense anything that pertains to Lawful evil acts (tyranny, trickery, etc) sixteen weeks before it happens and retains the sensation for sixteen weeks after the event occurs. However, he is limited to the ability to perform this feat beyond Hell except with the use of a Hell's Mouth. **Death Wish** Asmodeus can grant any humanoid three wishes in its lifetime on the condition that it gives a piece of flesh and on its death when its summoned to be resurrected it shouldn't refuse (on agreeing the creature is magically bound to the contract even if wishes aren't fulfilled according to his desires). Asmodeus can interpret the wishes in any manner he wants. **Known Spells** Asmodeus knows the following spells and cast them using his spell slots (if material components are required Asmodeus can use a bonus action to create or teleport required components). *Blight, Banishment, Charm Person, Circle of Death, Demiplane, Dream, Enthrall, Flesh to stone, Hallucinary terrain, Hex,Hold creature, Hold Monster, Hold Person, Hunger of Hadar, Mirror Image, Ray of enfeeblement, Scrying, Shatter, Suggestion, True polymorph, Vampiric Touch, Witch Bolt,.* **Mystic Arcanum** Asmodeus can cast the following spells once per day without spending a spell slot *Force Cage, Power word kill, Feebleminded and Mass suggestion.* **Godly Invocations** Asmodeus can cast the following invocations without spending any spell slot (even if the description requires him to spend one, all spells will be treated such that a 9th level spell slot has been used) *Beguiling Influence,One with the shadow, Visions of distant realm, Sculptor of flesh, Eldritch Sight, Fiendish Vigor, Eldritch Spear and Agonizing Blast, Misty vison, Mire the mind, Minions of Chaos, Mask of many faces, Thief of five fates, Repelling blast, Dreadful word* **Cantrips Known** Eldritch blast, Presdigitation, Mage hand, Chill touch, True strike, Poison spray, **Legendary Actions** _____________________________________________ Asmodeus can take 5 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

Asmodeus regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn. **Chilling Gaze (Costs 1 Action)** Asmodeus target one creature within 30 ft., the target makes a Constitution Save of DC 25 on a failed save target takes 2d10 psychic damage, target becomes frightened and gains 1 level of exhaustion.On gaining six levels of exhaustion creature doesnt die but is dominated by Asmodeus. **Hell's Gate (Costs 2 Actions)** As the King of Hell, Asmodeus has absolute control over all of the gates and portals that lead to Hell, as well as those within Hell. The Lord of the Nine can cause a gate or portal to open, sucking in those within 60 feet into a location in the Nine Hells of Asmodeus' choosing if they fail a Wisdom Save DC 22. The Mouth remains open for 3 rounds. A Hell's Mouth appears as a great, diabolically evil human male face with jagged, chewing teeth. Flames burst from the gaping maw as it attempts to suck in unlucky victims. The gate is two way and remains open for six rounds (suction only during first round). **Call of the Lord (Costs 2 actions)** Asmodeus can summon three creatures (with a challenge rating of 5 or below) who resides within 9 hells. **Hell on Earth (Costs 2 actions)** Asmodeus can cause the surrounding area of 90 ft. to turn into that of Hell any creature that enters or is in the area makes a constitution saving throw of DC 25 on fail they take 5d8 fire dmg for each round they are inside the area on success they take half the damage. The creatures must continuously make saving throws as long as they are within the area. **Contract established (Costs 1 action)** Asmodeus on touching a humanoid or a piece of dead humanoid calls its soul back and forms a new adult body for the soul to enter. If the target isnt willing to do so the spell fails. The body that is formed for the soul is a Tieflings body. The soul retains all its memories and experiences and is friendly towards Asmodeus (his memories are altered such that it obeys Asmodeus). **Lair Actions** __________________________________________________________________________________________ Lair actions only take place if Asmodeus is encountered in the ninth level of hell. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Asmodeus takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Asmodeus cant use the same effect two rounds in a row:  Asmodeus rolls a d8 die and gains one spent spell slot if the die rolls higher than 4. If he has spent no spell slots nothing happens.  An Ice shard erupts from the ground in a 20 foot radius and with 30 foot height centered on a point Asmodeus can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature in the shards area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,taking 13 (5d6) cold damage, 8 (3d6) piercing damage and being knocked prone at the edges of the shard closest to the position they were. On a success they take half the damage and aren't knocked prone.  Magma erupts from a point on the ground Asmodeus can see within 120 feet of it, creating a 20-foot-high, 5-foot-radius geyser. Each creature in the geysers area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-foot radius around Asmodeus as he roars. Each creature other than Asmodeus on the ground in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and take 14 (4d6) psych damage, on a successful save take half the damage and creature isn't knocked prone.  Ghost hands erupt from the ground in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Asmodeus can see within 120 feet of him. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (8d8) necrotic damage until the end of its turn. The creature is immobilized (speed=0) as the hands hold him in place until a successful save. A swarm of flies erupt from the ground in 30 foot radius centered on a point Asmodeus can see within 120 feet of him. The swarm flies in upward direction and lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the swarm must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (4d4) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) psych damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. As long as the creatures are within the zone of swarm their speed is reduced to half and their vision is obscured. A gust of hot/icy wind blows in a 50 foot radius around Asmodeus . Each creature other than Asmodeus in that area must make DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (5d6) fire/cold damage [depending on type of wind] and 10 (4d4) force damage if the creature is flying he is pushed 15 feet from the position he is in away from Asmodeus, or take half the damage on a successful save and isn't blown away. **Edit:** *Changes were made as per suggestions. Lair actions added, spells added, damage of ruby changed, immunity from exhaustion added*"

I'm sure it's hidden in the rules somewhere, but can't find it. What happens if you have both vulnerability and resistance to damage? For instance, a white dragon is underwater, giving him resistance to fire damage, but has inherent vulnerability. Or an abjuration wizard is struck with an effect that gives him vulnerability to acid damage, but he has resistance to all spell damage. What happens when they are hit with fireball or acid splash, respectively?"
221,vulnerability,dndnext,Death Knight Template (based on MM iteration),6,2ut7y6,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2ut7y6/death_knight_template_based_on_mm_iteration/,2015-02-05 10:35:50,"A few things about this: This isn't meant to be balanced. I made this as a tool to make lower level death knight baddies. It could easily be applied to a player but I'm leaving that to DM discretion. The idea was to have it so a converted paladin would be similar to the one in the MM. I left notes where I felt needed and added one or two things for flavor. Keep in mind that Death Knights can still gain paladin levels while using this template. Sorry if my formatting sucks. **Ability Scores** STR: Becomes 20; Retains base if higher than 20 DEX: Retains base CON: Becomes 20; Retains base if higher than 20 INT: Retains base WIS: Retains base CHA: Retains base **Hit Points** Retains base creatures hit points and increases through paladin levels **Traits** Type changes to Undead Alignment becomes evil Proficiency Bonus: Retains base Weapons/Armor: Retains proficiencies Tools: Retains proficiencies Saving Throws: Retains proficiencies; choose 1 additional proficiency (*DK has 3 in the MM*) Skills: Retains proficiencies Damage Vulnerability: Retains prior vulnerabilities* Damage Immunities: Necrotic, Poison; retains prior immunities* Condition Immunities: Exhausted, Frightened, Poisoned; retains prior immunities* Darkvision 120 ft. Immortal: A Death Knight can arise a new even after it has been destroyed. It must atone for its misdeeds before it can die. Can also be permanently killed with a Wish spell. Languages: Retains base Challenge: Paladin level -2 (*These are somewhat neutered Paladins; MM states it is a 19th level spellcaster with a challenge of 17*) **Abilities** Retains Fighting Style, Spellcasting (*cannot cast healing spells*), Divine Smite (deals necrotic damage), Ability Score Improvement, Extra Attack, and Improved Divine Smite (*losing the Fighting Style doesnt make sense logically; Death Knights add necrotic damage to longsword attacks which is similar to Divine Smite*) Loses Divine Sense, Lay on Hands, Divine Health, Aura of Protection, Aura of Courage, Cleansing Touch, and Sacred Oath abilities (*no paladin abilities remain on the stat block*) Gains the following at indicated Paladin levels (*scaling these with Paladin levels so the arent OP party wreckers at low levels*) Level 3 - Channel Divinity: Control Undead and Dreadful Aspect (*see DMG p.97; it fits thematically and pairs well with Marshal Undead*). Parry - (optional) see MM p.47 (*this is mostly a ""monster"" NPC ability so I left it as an option*) Level 7 - Marshal Undead: Unless the Death Knight is incapacitated, it and undead creatures of its choice with 30 feet have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead. This becomes 60 ft. at 18th level (kept this in line with other auras). Level 15 - Magic Resistance: The Death Knight has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Level 20 - Hellfire Orb: Once per long rest, the Death Knight can hurl a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20 ft. radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 DEX saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 10d6 fire damage and 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (*I chose 20 instead of 19 so it replaces a capstone ability*). **Actions** Retains natural weapons and is proficient in their use* *: Subject to DM discretion. Different cases can be argued for different creatures. Notes: MM p.47 treats the DK as a 19th level spellcaster with the inability to cast healing spells."
222,vulnerability,dndnext,Homemade Boss Fight: Feedback Requested,1,2vd431,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2vd431/homemade_boss_fight_feedback_requested/,2015-02-10 11:49:57,"I'm running a homebrew city/horror 5e campaign, started just before Christmas. Started at level 4 because reasons, and they've already hit level 5. As the capstone to level 5, and a mini-arc, I wanted to create a custom boss for them to fight, because it would be unique, and also just for the experience of trying to do this. The group is usually 5-6 PCs, with a rare 7th or 8th joining in. The boss was originally going to be a solo CR8, but since they couldn't finish off his second-in-command, I decided to tone down the boss to CR6, and have his CR5 Cambion friend fight with him. I will also include 2 Zombies for every PC over 5, with the option to add more if they're doing too well. So, here's the actual boss: **Putrudius** Level 6 Human/Undead Cleric, Death Domain (Not sure if he's going to be Human or Undead at the time of the fight. May depend on when they get to him.) AC 16 (Breastplate) Hit Points 90 (Based on chart in the DMG, divided by two for the net one immunity/vulnerability, plus 10 for Undead Fortitude. This is fudged a bit.) Speed 30 ft. Str 17 Dex 14 Con 13 Wis 16 Int 11 Cha 8 Savings throws: Wis +6, Cha +2 Skills: Religion, Insight, Athletics, Arcana Immunities: Poison Damage, Poisoned Condition Vulnerable: Radiant Designed to be CR 6, but maybe 7? Maybe? Spell Slots as a level 6 Cleric: C - Chill Touch, Guidance, Mending, Resistance, Thaumatergy 1 - False Life, Ray of Sickness, Inflict Wounds, Shield of Faith, Command, Bane 2 - Blindness/Deafness, Ray of Enfeeblement, Hold Person, Prayer of Healing 3 - Animate Dead, Vampiric Touch, Speak w/ Dead, Spirit Guardians, Bestow Curse (I mostly just threw together the spell list based on spell names sounding right. If I missed something that may fit the character well, mention it.) *Features:* Channel Divinity: Once per short rest, add 21 Necrotic Damage to a melee weapon attack. Necrotic Damage ignores resistance. Once on each of Cleric's turns, can add 1d8 Necrotic damage to a melee weapon attack. Lair Action: On Initiative 20, one of these options: - Roll a d3, and regain a spell slot of that level. - Call forth spirits of those who have died at the hands of Putrudius. Apparitions attack one creature within 60 feet. DC 14 Con Save, or take 5(?)d6 Necrotic Damage. - Summon a Zombie Okay, there's my rough draft. Originally I had him built without the Radiant Vulnerability, or the Lair Actions. Let me know if this doesn't really balance out. For reference, the party is comprised of: Regulars: Sword and Board Life Cleric, Sword and Board Battlemaster Fighter, Dual Wielding Whips Eldritch Knight Fighter, an CC-Focused Abjuration Wizard, and an AoE-CC/Off-Heal Land Druid. Semi-regular: a Bard. Rarely there: A Shadow Monk, and a Great Old One Tome-Lock. Not much damage from the regulars, but they're tough to kill. Definitely not optimized (myself and the Shadow Monk are the two optimizers in the group, and even then, not that much). Other notes: He's using a Quarterstaff of Warning, because I wanted to give my party another magic weapon for getting through resistances, and I wanted this guy to use a two-hander.... Then realized no one in my party uses martial two-handers! Only the Fighters can, and they're built to only use one-handers. So, I figured I'd give my Cleric and Druid something to fight over. They're also getting a Bag of Holding, and another random magic item. Also, a Blood Jar from [this post.](URL I know it's hard to say how hard the fight will be given my group's variable size, but anything popping out as incredibly unbalanced? I intended this to be a potentially deadly fight, but not a TPK. Obviously, a tough balance to meet. Any feedback would be appreciated. "

Seems to me that - particularly in 5e where ac's are 'flatter' generally - just about every arcane caster would dip into one level of fighter (or, smarter, start as a wimpy fighter so you don't need to waste the high stat on str to multi class into fighter), and then spend the rest of the campaign clumping around in plate mail? I get that casters aren't going to spend much time in melee, but well-protected casters seems to wreck the fundamental balance dynamic of melee vs casters, not to mention making casters vulnerability to attack spells or the ambush-from-behind that much less concern?"
224,vulnerability,dndnext,Personal take on a Psionic Sorcerous Origin (Rough Draft),4,2r5p3u,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2r5p3u/personal_take_on_a_psionic_sorcerous_origin_rough/,2015-01-03 12:08:02,"**Psionic Talent:** You discovered some of your thoughts could manifest in reality at some point in your life and while you have tried to understand it through the lenses of magi tomes and clerical prayers, you can sense your abilities are not coaxed with flamboyant motions or flowery prose, but the bend of reality to your subconscious. Your gift is rare though, so culture has influenced a block into your psyche that requires some external effort to overcome and tap into your inner power. At first level, you have a pool of Sorcery Points equal to your Charisma modifier + Sorcerer Level and can use the Subtle Spell Metamagic. **Autohypnosis:** At 1st level, You have practiced the art of self hypnosis to explore the depths of your latent powers. This brings you to new understandings of magics and the rules that govern it, but also of how to control your body's own automatic responses. As an action, you can begin to concentrate on one of the following effects, gaining its benefits for as long as you maintain concentration on it. * *Bradycardia* - You can slow your heart beat, making you immune to fear and giving you advantage on constitution rolls to hold your breath. You can also spend 3 Sorcery Points to ignore the noninstantaneous effects of poisons in your system. * *Confidence* - You can spend 2 Sorcery Points to psionicly inspire your abilities with posture and inner mantra, granting a 1d6 bonus that can be spent on an ability check, attack check, or saving throw. You also can spend 3 Sorcery Points to focus on an ally with positive intention to encourage confidence from their subconscious, allowing them the same bonus. Only one character may have this bonus at one time. After expending the bonus, a new target may be recipient to it after spending the requisite Sorcey Points. * *Desensitize* - You ignore pain. This can result in being able to rest well on a bed of nails, resist torture, ignore the movement penalty of difficult terrain cause by painful elements such as caltrops, etc. You can also spend 1 Sorcery Point to endure extreme temperatures. Furthermore, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points as a reaction, when you fall to 0 hit points, to remain conscious. * *Feedback* - While not wearing armor, your AC can be calculated as 12 + your Dexterity bonus. You can also spend 2 Sorcery Points as a reaction, after suffering damage from an attack that targets your AC, to deal half the damage you suffered as Psychic damage to your attacker. * *Manifestation* - You treat yourself as an Arcane Focus and using the Subtle Spell Metamagic does not count against the number of Metamagics you can apply to a spell. **Psionic Discipline:** At 6th level, your meditations have lead you down a path toward a paranormal specialty. Based on that specialty you gain the indicated benefits. * *Clairsentience* - You gain proficiency with either the History, Investigation, Perception, or Religion skills and add the following spells to the Sorcerer Spell List: *Alarm*, *Identify*, *Locate Object*, *Arcane Eye*, *Locate Creature*, *Legend Lore*, *True Seeing*, and *Foresight* * *Psychokinesis* - You gain proficiency with either the Athletics, Intimidation, or Performance skills and your spells that deal Psychic damage will deal extra damage equal to your Charisma bonus. Furthermore, you may spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the damage type of a spell to Psychic. * *Psychometabolism* - You gain proficiency with either the Acrobatics, Medicine, or Survival skills and, as an action, you can you can use one of your Sorcerer Hit Dice to heal yourself outside of a Short Rest. You can spend 1 Sorcery points to use one of your own Sorcerer Hit Dice to heal an ally you are able to touch. * *Apportation* - You gain proficiency with either the Arcana, Nature, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth skills and add the following spells to the Sorcerer Spell List: ((spells)) * *Telepathy* - You gain proficiency with either the Animal Handling, Deception, Insight, or Persuasion skills and add the following spells to to the Sorcerer Spell List: *Find Familiar*, *Sending*, *Dream*, *Modify Memory*, *Rary's Telepathic Bond*, *Mind Blank*, and *Telepathy*. **Psicrystal:** At 14th level, you can spend a long rest to attune yourself to a single gem with a worth of at least 50 gold. Doing so instills a portion of your ego, transforming it into a Psicrystal, which allows you to concentrate on a spell while also maintaining an autohypnosis effect or maintain two Autohypnosis effects at once. While a gem helps you with maintaining concentration, it must be free to orbit your body. If it is attacked, it has an AC equal to your own unarmored AC value which includes any magic equipment bonuses, uses your Charisma save for all saving throws, suffers no partial effects from successful saves. A Psicrystal has Immunity to Poison damage; resistance to Cold, Lightning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; and Vulnerability to Acid, Thunder, and Bludgeoning damage. A Psicrystal has a number of hit points equal to its gold value less 49 and each HP the gem loses reduces its gold value by an equal amount, causing it to become un attuned and revert to a Gem with a worth of 49 or less gold after being reduced to less than 1 HP. **Metapsionics:** At 18th level, Spending a Sorcery Point for the Subtle Spell Metamagic allows you to apply Subtle Spell to spells for 1 minute without additional Sorcery Point cost. Also, your other known Metamagics improve: * *Careful Spell* - When choosing allies to keep safe you can choose an equal number of enemies, as you have chosen allies for the spell, to refocus those energies upon to give them disadvantage on their saving throw. * *Distant Spell* - You now triple the range of spells with a range greater than 5 ft. and touch spells gain a range of 60 feet. * *Empowered Spell* - When you empower a spell, you add two additional damage dice to the base damage. * *Extended Spell* - You triple the duration of an applicable spell, to a maximum of 24 hours. * *Heightened Spell* - The the saving throw DC of a Heightened Spell improves by +2 * *Quickened Spell* - You can spend 2 additional Sorcery Points to cause casting a Quickened Spell to not limit you to only being able to cast a Cantrip for your action. * *Twinned Spell* - Twinning a Spell now only costs half, rounded up, as many Sorcery Points, rounded up and to a minimum of 1. Edit: Started a major overhaul. Edit2: Psicrystal developed. Edit3: Added Bradycardia hypnosis. Edit4: Renamed the portmanteau Psychoportation to legit paranormal term Edit 5: Added Confidence. To be developed. Edit 6: Confidence developed. Edit 7: Clarified Confidence. Edit 8: Reduced Sorcery Point costs for several abilities. Edit 9: Improved Psychometabolism Edit 10: Expanded on Psicrystal Edit 11: Overhauled Metapsionic Mastery Edit 12: Added Manifestation hypnosis and changed the wording of the Subtle Spell improvement of Metapsionics. Edit 13: Completed Telepathy and Clairsentience disciplines Edit 14: Dropped Metacreation to make Summoning and Teleportation under the same wheelhouse of Apportation"

As a follow-up to **[this thread](URL I just wanted to ask for opinions about the ***Green Gemstone*** I designed. To sum the story up, 3 kobolds (players) find a green *Chromatic Gemstone* and it's more or less the essence of Green Dragons, left behind when they were made to leave the world. One of the PCs is in possession of an amulet that will purge (part of) the evil out of the gemstone, the latter becoming nothing more than an useful little artifact. ##() G Gs. &gt;*This surprisingly soft emerald shares both its texture and its shape with those of an human heart. By slightly pressing it, and as a* ***bonus action****, you feel part of your vital force leaving your body to fuel its still-accursed power, the gemstone glowing eerily of a nightmarish green.* &gt;* Until the end of your next turn, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have **resistance to poison damage** and **advantage on saving throws** against Enchantment spells. &gt;* Extending the duration costs another Hit Die per bonus action.

226,vulnerability,dndnext,[Homebrew] Pestilence Domain,11,2t7t2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/dndnext/comments/2t7t2c/homebrew_pestilence_domain/,2015-01-22 08:45:26,"To continue my series of Clerical Domains inspired by the Dragonlance Campaign Setting for D&amp;D 3.5 (the previous two being [Forge](URL and [Liberation](URL and to give more Domain variety for Evil deities, I present to you the signature domain of Morgion, the god of disease, decay and pestilence. **== Pestilence Domain ==** Gods of disease, plagues and famine - such as Morgion and Incabulos - are vile deities, often despised even by other gods of evil. They use the fear of disease to spread their influence. Their followers are sent among men to spread the most terrifying blights and when a person falls victim to the ravages of disease, the god appears before them to offer a deal: reprieve from the disease in exchange for life-long servitude. The followers of such deities are usually forced to do their work and worship in secret as part of small cells to stay hidden. They are also often encouraged in the art of creating poisons, especially of those that mimic the symptoms of diseases. **- Pestilence Domain Spells -** *1st | Detect Poison and Disease, Ray of Sickness* *3rd | Blindness/Deafness, Ray of Enfeeblement* *5th | Bestow Curse, Stinking Cloud* *7th | Blight, Confusion* *9th | Contagion, Plague of Rats** *(or Insect Plague)* **= Priest of Pains =** At 1st level, you gain proficiency with the Poisoner's Kit. You also have resistance to poison damage and advantage on saving throws against poisons. **= Acquainted with Disease =** Starting at 1st level, you are immune to the effects of all diseases, though you can still carry and spread infectious diseases. Additionally, whenever you would make a saving throw, the passing of which would alleviate a disease's grip on you, you can choose to fail that saving throw. **= Channel Divinity: Infectious Touch =** Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to touch an adjacent living creature and infect it with any single disease that is currently affecting you. Alternatively, you can cause that creature to become poisoned. The creature can make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success. **= Vile Poisoner =** Starting at 6th level, your god imparts upon you a special expertise in the creation and usage of poisons. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check made using the Poisoner's Kit and while using downtime for crafting poisons you make process at 10-gp increments daily. Additionally, when harvesting poison from creatures, you acquire enough poison for two doses on a succesful check. **= Divine Strike =** At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with withering energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8. **= Sickening Aura =** Starting at 17th level, you can use your action to activate an aura of sickening energy that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it as a bonus action. All enemies within 30 feet of you are poisoned and have vulnerability to necrotic damage for as long as the aura lasts or they leave its range. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. --------- \* The original Dragonlance Pestilence domain offers a unique spell, *Plague of Rats*. I have converted that spell for 5th edition and it can be found below, but if you'd rather use the regular 5th edition spells, you can replace it with Insect Plague. **- Plague of Rats -** *5th level conjuration* **Casting time:** 1 action **Range:** 90 feet **Components:** V, S, M (the tail of a rat) **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You summon 12 Swarms of Rats (MM, p. 339), each of which immediately attacks any creature currently occupying its space. You choose the squares each swarm occupies, but the swarms must all be contiguous. The swarms are stationary and won't pursue creatures that flee. They will however make opportunity attacks at first opportunity against creatures that leave the swarm's reach and attack any creature that ends its turn in the swarm's space. A swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. -------- **Notes:** * This domain relies quite heavily on disease and poisons, and as such the usage of the Diseases and Poisons rules presented in the DMG (pages 256-258) is encouraged to make the most out of the domain. * Also encouraged is allowing the players who choose this domain to potentially create their own poisons, provided that they have access to enough time and resources. Use the poisons presented in the DMG as guidelines for the power and cost of any new poisons. -------- **Discussion is open, any feedback is appreciated!** Do you like the flavour of the Domain? Anything that feels over- or underpowered about it? Any domains or deities you'd want to see brought to 5th edition?"
