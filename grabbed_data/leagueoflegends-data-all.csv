Thank you for showing us your vulnerability in that interview, we know there is a lot of pressure and sometimes its just not your day. I know the team won against GG, but dont get down about your performance. Youre one of the best players in the world and we all root for you, keep doing your best and I know TSM will back you up no matter what. Humblelift."
1,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,I've lost confidence in Riot's ability to create healthy champions. Maybe someone can explain it to me.,1,hsicma,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/hsicma/ive_lost_confidence_in_riots_ability_to_create/,2020-07-17 07:02:57,"In the past couple of years, we've seen a plethora of champions that while well designed from an aesthetic point of view and maybe even fun to play, are questionable for the health of the game. We've seen far too many champions that have ""too much in their kit because otherwise they'd be useless"". That, to me, is indicative of a champ that is not designed well. For example If Urgot needs a passive burst damage wave clear, a ranged slow, a dash/shield/cc combo, a wide ranged modified auto attack aoe that lasts indefinitely and a long range slow/triggerable execution and subsequent fear combo that can't be cleansed off all while being a ranged bruiser/tank hybrid just to make him usable -- that champ is poorly designed and is bad for the game's health. If there are champs who's win condition is something inevitable (like a powerspike from leveling i.e. Illaoi's level 6 or Kayle's level 11) - that despite being ran over before this can rush into a team fight and by shear stats beat out enemies that are even or over them in levels and/or items and its okay because otherwise the champs would be useless -- thats a badly designed champ. I feel like Riot is afraid to make champs that actually punish the player for being beaten. We as a community put a lot of focus on the player's ability and that league is actually easy if you're just not bad. While I think thats absolutely valid, I also think that there are just as many instances of someone playing better than you that leads to the defeat screens. Champs that ignore the second notion and run on the formula that ""if you just make it to this level you will be okay"" or ""There's so much here all you have to know is the basics of MOBAs in general (and there's leeway on even that) to win"" are bad for the integrity of the game. There are many champs in this game already that are perfect examples of the opposite of this trend, champs that have very strong highs at the cost of significant vulnerability or large power spikes that need to be attained through efficient farming and that don't overshadow their vulnerabilities to a point that they cant be exploited. Champs that are absolute monsters in the hands of people who take the time to master them, but by nature severely punish mistakes. Ahri, Zed, Thresh, Ezreal, Poppy, etc there are so many that walk the line of fun gameplay, character aesthetic and healthy balance, so why are we straying away from this? Im excited for Deer Merida and Yone, but I'm also worried that they to will be slotted into the categories of ""if they don't have everything, they are nothing."" or ""timebomb"" that most of our new champs are being tossed into. My question to the community is: am I mistaken and if so how? I, by no means, think that these champs are invincible or unbeatable. I'm aware there are counters and even multiple guides on how to defeat these champs. But even to a that point -- that there are so many guides on how to beat these champs is telling."
2,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,League Account Hijacked points to one thing.,1,gx21wk,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gx21wk/league_account_hijacked_points_to_one_thing/,2020-06-05 20:29:43,"Pardon the clickbaity title, but I have no other way of putting what happened to me. So here's the story: I woke up after a great day of sleeping, as I am a night time worker, at a bright and early 7 in the afternoon on a Thursday to play some rousing League of Legends with the boys as URF is out and I have been promptly ignoring my obligations and life because of it. I start my client to see that I am not only in a champion select, but in the process of selecting Ashe with lethal tempo in a ranked match of all things. Now I'm no Gosu, but I definitely do not play ADC in 2k20 in ranked as I have sanity still remaining. Jokes aside, turns out a guy obtained my password and wanted to play on a borderline Platinum account and ended up friending some dude named with a named, and duo queuing with him for a grand total of 3 games (2 wins 1 loss). I ended up friending his duo partner and explained to him that the account he's been queuing with isn't me, and asked if the guy was intentionally feeding or attempting to grief in some way, also to check and see if he and his buddy had a reason to jack my account along the way. Turns out the guy had no idea, the hacker wasn't disruptive and even more so never typed a word other than asking to duo. They invited me to a discord server and him and his friends not only believed my story, but then something happened. The hacker added my account on a separate account to talk. For those that don't want to read the very broken, almost child-like villain text the guy typed to me. It went something like this: URL [actual conversation] Me: What are you doing on my account and how did you get it HackerMan: Heh wanna duo q? Me: What are you doing on my account and how did you get it. Hackerman: It was easy, I am hacker man. Me: What are you doing on my account and how did you get it. Him: How did I do on your games? also I'm getting your account banned. Me: what why who, please stop, how do you even plan to do that. Him: Your account is mine, Stay friend? I didn't respond then unfriended him and was promptly banned after a game of URF directly after. I already submitted a ticket at this point including all of the attached screenshots and changed my password to a much more complex one. I don't know how he got into my account, but my thoughts are that there might be a vulnerability in Valorant, as that is the ONLY modification to my computer in the recent week. He must've seen my account had a league account with skins and time into it, tried unfriending half my friends list to keep it for himself, but I caught on too quickly and ended up RKO'ing my account before I could take it back fully. I am very concerned about Valorant's safety as that is the only game I've been playing for the past 2 days barring a few matches for my win of the day. I have reinstalled my OS to be certain and reinstalled all of my games already, but this has to be brought up as a conversation. I will not be playing Valorant for the moment until my account has been reinstated, and I recommended to a my friends to take a break for a moment although none of them have stakes for Riot's other games. I am posting this out of concern for the ENTIRETY of Riot's customers, consider your vulnerability when installing anything and I'm not sure what else to point to. This is still a possibility that I just installed some form of malicious program weeks ago and this dude is just a simple jerk with more time than sense on his hands, but this is still a major concern of mine for the time being. Thank you for your time. Peace be with you, don't get robbed, times are tuff right now and people are in the grind with you. TLDR: Dude jacked my account, won some league ranked games for me, wanted to keep the account, and RKO'd it when I said no.

3,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,A Yuumi one-trick's Yuumi rework idea:,1,hanb69,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/hanb69/a_yuumi_onetricks_yuumi_rework_idea/,2020-06-17 18:34:24,"I'm no game designer, just a degen Yuumi main, so be nice. Bop 'n' Block (P) Unchanged Prowling Projectile (Q) ACTIVE: Yuumi fires a missile at a target area that deals AoE magic damage to enemies hit. Champions hit in the center of the blast radius are slowed by 20% for 1 second. While Attached, Prowling Projectile does increased % health damage and slows all enemies hit. You and Me! (W) PASSIVE: Yuumi grants her anchor a scaling flat amount of adaptive force as well as a scaling % amount of adaptive forced based on Yuumi's AP. (Yuumi no longer starts with You and Me! at Rank 1, and the skill caps at 5 ranks.) ACTIVE: Yuumi becomes invulnerable and immediately cleanses herself of all crowd control. She flies to her target anchor and becomes attached for X seconds (think something like reverse Kalista ult). While attached, Yuumi may recast You and Me! on another allied champion to change her anchor and reset the anchor time limit. If Yuumi is attached to any one anchor for more than X seconds, she detaches and the ability goes on cooldown. (This ability should have a long cooldown btw.) Zoomies (E) ACTIVE: Yuumi heals herself and closest ally for X amount, and grants movement speed. While Attached, healing is increased and the anchor gains bonus attack speed. Final Chapter (R) ACTIVE: Yuumi and Book channel for 3.5 seconds, launching 7 waves in the target direction over the duration each dealing magic damage. Enemy champions hit take only 50% damage from subsequent waves, and when struck with three waves, they are rooted for 1.75 seconds, this can only occur once per target. While Attached, Yuumi can rotate the direction of Final Chapter. Early game, this rework still lets Yuumi feel like a cute nimble kitty, able to dodge abilities and eat CC (like her first iteration) while also giving her more windows of vulnerability since she cannot stay perma attached. She needs to decide if she's going to save her W for her own safety in case a fight turns south, or use it from the start of the fight to buff her ally from the get go. It also gives her a bit more usefulness while unattached. In team fights, Yuumi still has the ability to zoom around from ally to ally, buffing and healing them, without being able to just afk on a juggernaut and spam E. Yuumi players need to be active during fights, making sure to stay attached and get off as many empowered Q's and E's as possible by jumping around. The ult change is probably controversial, but I thought it would be a nice QoL update for her, even if it just allowed a small arc of directional influence (like a Vel'koz ult), and keeps the theme of being attached = buffed abilities. All feedback is appreciated. :)"
4,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Instead of gutting Yuumi to being near useless, what about a small rework to address her problems?",1,hb7jag,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/hb7jag/instead_of_gutting_yuumi_to_being_near_useless/,2020-06-18 14:24:59,"So, the nerfs coming are going to destroy Yuumi. Her E is going to cost upwards of 240 mana (averaging 300+ with normal builds), and she's going to be able to cast her E 4 times (5 with arcangel's), then be oom until she regens 300+ mana -- which, you know, is going to take a while. She will lose all of her lane phase since she won't be able to heal, she won't be able to teamfight as well, and she's just going to be generally useless. Instead of going through with this asinine change, maybe we can look at her problems and address them. Her problem (according to people who complain) is that she has no counterplay on her W, and she can just go AFK and win. So, how would we fix that? We could take away her W, but then she's not the same champ -- but what if we just made interacting with enemies and being detached more valuable? So let's leave her passive, Q and R alone, as they do what they're intended to do. For her W, let's add a ""health bar"" that shows up when Yuumi is attached to someone. It could have 2/3/4/5 (or whatever number feels fair) ""health"" and every time her host is hit by a hard CC, she loses one bar. When all bars are consumed, she's forced to detach, and W goes on a small cooldown (3/2/1s?). This gives her some vulnerability, even when attached to someone, and entices her to be smart about when to attach / detach. In return for this, make her W cooldown a bit smaller, both normally and when she's CCed (6/3/0s for normal CD, and 3/2/1s for CCed CD). For her E, make the cooldown 15 seconds (that doesn't go down with rank), but the cooldown ticks down 5s per second (or 3 or 4 or whatever number) while she's detached. Since this would make her survivability jump through the roof when she's alone, make her heal half as effective when used on herself. These changes both entice Yuumi to be out and about, and promotes interactivity, even when using W. It rewards skillful play, while maintaining her ""AFK"" playstyle for those who like it, though it makes it more fair to deal with. When all this is done, we could even consider buffing her passive, making its cooldown go down when she auto attacks and it's on cooldown, further enticing her to be active. Maybe even add a bit of damage to it. I just don't want my favorite champion to be made unplayable. : /"

6,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"New Champion Idea: Yaphumelios, the TRUE Scientist",1,hfsubl,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/hfsubl/new_champion_idea_yaphumelios_the_true_scientist/,2020-06-26 05:51:18,"**Role: Marksman/Mage, range: 550** **Passive - TRUE Chemist**: After 200 years of scientific research, Yaphmelios has discovered and mastered 5 new radioactive elements of Runeterra. His basic attack can not critically strike, but will consume an element and gain an extra effect such as 100 bonus range, heal for 3.14159% to 31.4159% (scaling with level) of the damage, projectile splitting up into a cone of 5 extra projectiles behind the target, slow the target by 2.71828% to 27.1828% for 1 second, and increase the attack speed by 6.022% to 60.22%. Yaphumelios collects an extra element every 2 to 0.5 seconds and can hold up to 3-7 elements at a time based on his level. Furthermore, the elements can be combined into unique compounds using his Q: Particle Accelerator, gaining bonus effects. Each compound has its own molecular geometric shape and half life. **Q - Particle Accelerator** (single target linear projectile skillshot, range: 1000, but can be extended with the right element and compounds, projectile speed: 3108, cooldown: 10-6 seconds): Yaphumelios adds an element to his gun-sized portable particle accelerator, which will fire off in the direction he's facing after 3 seconds. He can cast Q again within the next 3 seconds to add another element to it, creating a compound using the 2 elements inside and shooting the compound towards his cursor. Each element or compound will add a bonus effect to the projectile, and the compounds will stay on the ground for 5-15 seconds depending on their half lives, which can be detonated with his E: mc^2. **W - Buffer Overflow (targeted spell, range: 400 + 50 x length of [longest common subsequence(LCS)](URL of the champion names, cooldown: 22-14 seconds) Yaphumelios exploits a temporary vulnerability of the connection between the target champion and their summoner, applying a debuff where the effect and duration depend on the target champion's level and the length of the longest common subsequence between the champion names (case insensitive). The effect and duration are described by the code below: CC bufferOverflow(Player target) { String name1 = this.getChampion().getName().toLowerCase(); String name2 = target.getChampion().getName().toLowerCase(); int lcs = lengthOfLCS(name1, name2); int targetLevel = target.getLevel(); CCEffects[] effects = { CC.BLIND, CC.NEARSIGHT, CC.SILENCE, CC.ROOT, CC.TAUNT, CC.FEAR CC.DROWSY, CC.STUN, CC.AIRBOURNE } CCEffect effect = effects[(lcs+targetlevel)%effects.length]; double duration = Math.sin(targetLevel*Math.PI/36); //the TRUE scientist only uses radians :) CC cc = new CC(effect, duration); return cc; } static int lengthOfLCS(String s1, String s2) { int n1 = s1.length(); int n2 = s2.length(); int[][] dp = new int[n1+1][n2+1]; //dp[i][j] = lcs of s1[0..i] and s2[0..j] for (int i=1; i&lt;=n1; i++) { for (int j=1; j&lt;=n2; j++) { if (s1.charAt(i-1) == s2.charAt(j-1)) { dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1; } else { dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]); } } } return dp[n1][n2]; } **E: mc^2 (effect radius: 1500, cast time: 0.15 seconds, cooldown: 18-10 seconds)** Yaphumelios detonates every compound within a radius of 1500 units, creating explosions in an area around each compound and leaving behind a radiation field with various effects such as slow, damage over time, a smoke shroud that gives Yaphmelios TRUE stealth, and etc. The hitbox of the explosion and the radiation field depends on the [molecular geometric shape](URL of the compound and the duration of the radiation field depends on the half life of the compound. **R - Schrdinger's Cat (range: 2000, duration: 10/15/20 seconds, cooldown: 120/105/90 seconds)** Passive: Upon taking lethal damage, Yaphumelios uses his 200 years of quantum mechanics experience to become simultaneously both alive and dead, attaching himself to the nearest allied champion within 2000 range, for up to 10/15/20 seconds. While attached, Yaphumelios becomes untargetable and unable to use basic attacks, but he may still cast his spells from the host champion. During this time, he may cast R - Schrdinger's Cat up to 3/4/5 more times to move to a different host, but he must stay inside the host for at least 1 second before moving to a different one. **If the host champion dies with Yaphumelios still being attached, Yaphumelios will become dead as well.** Once the effect of his R - Schrdinger's Cat ends, Yaphumelios's death timer will be reduced by the duration for which the ability was active. THE END Now before everyone starts screaming about how broken his kit is, just remember that he has clear strengths and weaknesses that can be played around. He strives in 5v5s that turn into 2 separate 4v1s because he can still output decent damage after getting deleted right away. On the downside, he has no mobility, cannot crit, and ult becomes less useful in actual front to back 5v5 teamfights (if he's the last one standing on his team, then he basically has no ult). So I'm sure players can just learn to play around this ~~abomination~~ champion by memorizing every little detail about his kit and studying some math, physics, chemistry, and computer science! Plus, he brings a lot of exciting gameplay, ""200 year"" highlight moments, and even some educational values, so adding him to the champion rosters will be healthy for the game as well! Thanks for reading, have a nice day :)"
7,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Champion Concept: Esmeralda, the Emerald Mist",1,hjulj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/hjulj5/champion_concept_esmeralda_the_emerald_mist/,2020-07-02 20:29:16,"**Intro:** Piltover and Zaun are known across Runeterra for their advancements in techmaturgy, capitalizing on the use of hex-crystals and hex-tech to use magic as the driving force of their machinery. But what of Piltover's mages? The guardian Jayce uses a crystal powered invention. The adventurer Ezreal uses a gauntlet to concentrate his latent magical talents. Piltoverans seek to commodify magic in all its forms, be it a crystal or a human... but the Emerald Mist is a tale that discourages many, even the Mercantile Clans themselves to be wary of how they treat the magic they harbor. **Appearance:** Esmeralda is a woman with redwood flowing locks, beautifully pink skin and glowing, eerie green eyes. She roams the Promenade just between Piltover and Zaun dressed in a black trench-coat, corset and seems to always be draped in ghostly green gems. They say a green mist far thicker than the gray follows Esmeralda around, so dense that even the miraculous gray-lifting winds do not seem to phase it. **Info:** Esmeralda is a **Catcher/Enchanter** whose main focus is forcing her opponents out of and into places. She does more than simply stop them in their tracks, dishing out good amounts of burst damage as well for a support. |***STATS***|***VALUE (Level 1-18)***| |:-|:-| |Health|555-2000 (+85 per level)| |Health Regen|6.7-15.7| |Armor|33-68.4| |Magic Resist|33.5-55.6| |Movement Speed|320| |Mana|320-1034 (+42 per level| |Mana Regen|4.5-14.6| |Attack Damage|53-98.2| |Critical Damage|200%| |Attack Range|550| &amp;#x200B; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Lore: ""The Girl from the Gray"" *Starring: Esmeralda* *Mentioned: Camille, Jayce* # Act I: ""Weakness"" No one knows how Esmeralda ended up on the steps of one of the many foundling homes in Zaun, but then again, no one knew where most of them came from. Either their parents died too early, they were too much of a burden, or they simply were not worth the effort; whatever the case may be, you'd find a snipe to match it. However unlike the rebellious and street-smart chem-punks the other children aspired to grow up as, Esmeralda was soft-spoken and considerably clumsy, making her an outcast among the other foundlings. Some kind kids had patience with her but it would always wane after a few weeks, her inability to keep up in games and hesitation to participate in their mischievous escapades a natural deterrent to any other child. Even the orderlies who appreciated her politeness did not wish for her to do much as she would more often than not, mess it up. These feelings of seclusion, uselessness and loneliness built up over her time at the foundling home... and among other things, is what she considered the trigger that unlocked her powers. It started with a ball that rolled towards her as she lay on the sidewalk, watching the other foundlings play from afar. Seeing an opportunity to join, she went to pick up the ball with a smile on her face... until they called out to her to stop, not to touch the ball and to stay away. She sat back down, frustration building within her until the ball found itself rolling towards her again. She did not stand up that time, the ball flew back and knocked over a big kid who was sent to retrieve it. Esmeralda missed the faint green mist that permeated the ball as they shouted insults at her for playing rough. The next time it happened, she was twiddling her fingers over a dead plague rat in an attempt to entertain herself. Slowly, green mist encircled the little mammal and Esmeralda yelped in surprise. Trying once again, she watched as the mist forced the rat to move obscenely, as if forcing it to come alive once more and dance for Esmeralda. With an experimental motion from both of her hands, she pulled at the green mist, slowly until the horrific dance looked more natural. The following day, she used the little trick she had learned to scare all of the boys who had insulted her the last time she watched them play with their ball. As Esmeralda picked the ball up and played with it herself, the children were holed up in their rooms, fearful of the glowing green plague rats scratching at their doors that didn't 'die' no matter how hard they hit them. It did not take long after that for the other foundlings to grow fearful of Esmeralda, just as it did not take long for her to learn she could manipulate more than just dead rats. She fortified her room with iron bars from streetlamps, took all the other children's toys and had essentially made the foundling home her personal playground. Try as the others might to convince the orderlies of her powers, they did not believe the rude and arrogant children. And besides, a powerful mage in Zaun? Perhaps when poro's ate garbage. However, despite the toys and the protection from the glares of her fellow foundlings, Esmeralda found her victory was short-lived. She had everything that the other foundling's wanted but, she was still lonely. She had only antagonized herself even more and ascended from a mere inconvenience to the bane of the foundling home. Esmeralda realized she had to make it right. Dragging a self-made wagon behind herself, filled to the brim with the toys she took, she went to the big kid's rooms in an attempt to apologize. At first they smiled and took the toys back, but not before pushing Esmeralda to the ground, warning her to never try anything like that again lest they do something much worse to her in return, the rules of the orderlies be damned. Her attempt at peace trampled on by the very hate she planted in their hearts, the hate she buried within her own took form and unleashed itself. One could view it from the Sump, eye level with the Promenade and visible if you squinted enough from Piltover; the foundling home a that little girl sent flying, suspended halfway up the cliffs with all the inhabitants still kept within for at least a full hour. The building had been set down just as the girl had finished fuming and reducing the surroundings to rubble, curled up in a corner and crying. All the children kept themselves a considerable distance away, now horrified by Esmeralda's display of raw power while the orderlies were genuinely stumped as to what to do with her now. That very evening, a Piltoveran had descended into the Sump with two mages in tow, looking for the source of a particular source of magic detected earlier that day; Esmeralda's outburst. Amanda Torek, matriarch of the Torek Mercantile Clan and a masterful mage herself, she was the one who sensed the rather enormous energy spike in Zaun and the two students that followed behind her were the ones to see an entire building suspended halfway down the cliffs. They took a private Hexdraulic Descender down immediately. Seeing that the girl was being left alone to cry within her room, Amanda saw a vulnerability she could exploit. She told Esmeralda she was here to adopt her, to take her to Piltover where she could become a part of the Torek family where everyone had powers like her. The shunned and emotionally unstable Esmeralda clung to this kindness and promise like a lifeline, embracing Amanda as she sobbed her thanks and the first tears of joy she had ever cried. That was when she was eight years old. The following ten years were spent with Esmeralda being given a proper education under house Torek's best teachers, specifically in physics, biology, techmaturgy and the elements. Where she did nothing but play in the Sump and long for company, Esmeralda became surrounded with activities and praise, fully immersing herself in the tasks she was given. Amanda watched her grow, standing as a motherly figure who told her what she had to do to become a true Teko. Esmeralda dreamed to explore the vast mansion and meet the other apprenta but Amanda had assured her she would when she also completed her training. And so diligently she did, mastering each subject until she could redraw the schematics of a self-locomotor, and even assemble it, even collect the raw materials to create the parts. Then one day, Amanda asked of her to stay in the laboratory and build one for her with one condition; she had to do it using her powers. Left in the room, Esmeralda was hesitant. She had not implored the use of her powers since the day she lifted the foundling home into the sky and yet she also knew those powers were why she was adopted. Her fear of disappointing Amanda manifested similarly to the negative emotions that triggered her surge of magical energy that day, and she commanded it to take control of the materials. With each stroke of her finger, she made use of what she had learned during her time at the mansion, forging the correct shapes of steel and iron to be assembled, bending the forces at work to the will her magic imposed. In less than thirty minutes, a self-locomotor stood within the lab. A proud Amanda steps in to congratulate her, telling her she could finally take her place as a true apprenta for the Torek household. The years following this turning point were filled with Esmeralda aiding in the construction of several new ventures, becoming one-woman laboratory. Eventually, her prowess went so well with the forms of matter of the material world, Amanda requested her to start attempting to tap into the *metaphysical*. Esmeralda could manipulate matter as if playing with a toy, even on a molecular level. Such achievements made Amanda ambitious and the plan of creating more powerful hex-crystals than the synthetic kind produced by Clan Ferros. Not only would they storm the markets, but even receive help from Zaun as it would mitigate the no doubt murderous Gray they lived in daily fear of. Heart feeling for the people of her old home, Esmeralda agreed. Unlike matter however, magic was a much more complex and vague concept to Esmeralda. Hex-crystal after hex-crystal had been procured for her to work with, but as each one was synthetic, Esmeralda could not do more than amplify their meager magical frequencies. She reasoned that only with a true Hex-crystal or ""first-crystal"" could she even begin to start replicating the unique structure. Amanda, blinded by how close her goal seemed to be, pulled every string she had to obtain one genuine hex-crystal. Such a scheme was difficult but not impossible. However, it was just the type of scheme to catch the attention of Clan Ferros' intelligencer. When Camille had heard word of the Torek's clan to recreate the first hex-crystal through their traditional use of mages, she had planned a break-in to retrieve information on what they could possibly use to craft such a thing when the Ferros clan had no such luck for two centuries. However, Amanda was expecting such an infiltration and had a team of her finest mages guarding the lab along with herself, armed with a modified replica of Atlas Gauntlets that Esmeralda had crafted earlier that week. They fought valiantly but power was a mere inconvenience to deal with for the art of combat that Camille had formed during her century of living as Clan Ferros' intelligencer. Amanda and Camille fought head to head, precision against brute force but Amanda was no fighter. She berated Camille as they fought, for relying on technology and a cheap imitation of what was true magic. She spoke of her discoveries, of what a true mage could do and what Esmeralda was capable of elevating the Torek clan to. Camille in turn told her of her foolish ambitions and how, at the least, machines could be controlled, unlike a human. Amanda chided her, telling her Esmeralda would never disobey her 'mother'. And if Esmeralda should die? Schematics were already being designed to create an automaton to replicate her powers, using the true hex-crystal she would eventually craft and modify to sync with her magic signature in order to continue her legacy. Esmeralda was no more than a product. Esmeralda was no more than a stepping stone. Esmeralda had been listening the entire time. After having finished her replication of he first-crystal she had been given, she rushed to show Amanda but had arrived just at the end of the battle, where her 'mother' was calling her nothing but a tool for her plans to bring the Torek family to greater heights. Esmeralda had always thought that, despite her talents, she was never truly accepted here in Piltover, especially because of her background as a Zaunite. But she did not expect even Amanda, the woman who saved her to be the one to proclaim it so loudly. Just like the day Amanda found her, she fell to her kneels and wailed in sorrow, her magic cascading with the crystal she held in her grip and spreading all over the mansion. Camille was able to escape but all of Piltover remembers the sudden green mist that lifted the Torek main house into the sky and then crashed it into the ground, reducing the surrounding areas into rubble. The Bluewind Court were informed by Camille a false tale of the events, that Amanda had been experimenting with a true hex-crystal stolen from clan Ferros and that a power surge occured that destroyed everything. Camille assured the court that no such thing had happened under the Ferros family's watch and that the event should serve as a warning for others trying to recreate the hex-crystals without the proper guidance in a mad grab for scholastic acclaim. No one knows the truth of that night, no one but Esmeralda who had fled back into Zaun's grey, sobbing all the way for what she had done. She had promised to never utilize her powers for the intent of others, to live a quiet life in the Sump of Zaun where she could alleviate the pain of other unfortunate people like her. She had accepted her fate as a child, to be hated and to push others away with her power. She held on to the false hope of acceptance but knew this day was inevitable. The green mist haunts the mind's of the wealthy Piltoverans and the Chem Barons, wondering how they could compete with Clan Ferros' iron grip on the production of synthetic hex-crystals. But the Zaunites that Esmeralda now tends to in the Zaun gray, they see it as a mist to cling to; pushing away the gray and keeping unfortunate events from happening, the **Lady in the Mist** has become a bubbling rumor in the Sumps. &amp;#x200B; # Act II: ""Down in the Sump"" I step along the cracked concrete streets of the **Black Lanes**, looking for something to eat. Cogs in my hand from my job today with Becker, I smile as two children run past me, playing with a ball. It was a discrete arrangement between me and him but helping the sump-scrapper with his daily quota was easy for myself and easier money for him. Zaun was not a place of quality living in the slightest, especially if one hailed from the Sump. Each stall here could contain something stolen, or has gotten stolen from... but what else do these people have to do? They are struggling to survive and Arriving at Elaine's ""fresh produce"" -the 'fresh' in there being rather relative- I offer the old woman a small smile. ""Ah Esme, lovely to see you."" she greets, reaching out a hand for me to place mine over. ""As strong as ever Elaine, the blight is all but gone from your system. Give it another week and make sure not to stay out too late."" I state, the faint green glow emitting from my hand as I observe her body for the degrading presence of blight. I had withered it's effects greatly but her effort to keep healthy was a big help in curing her. I really didn't need to look at any more augmented people heading to that Gray Lady's church. ""Thank you deary."" she smiles to me, gratitude clear in her expression, so rare to see here in Zaun but it makes my day nonetheless. She gives me the usual few apples and a honeyfruit as a treat and let's me pay half the cogs. ""Most of us old folk around here'd be fairing worse without you, you ken? We really appreciate it."" she stated as she placed the honeyfruit it. I look around to the other stalls. To the east I can see a baker named Jerome whose wife I had caught just before she fell into the sump. More often than not, falling into the sump killed most sump-scrappers instead of the toxic fumes finally forcing their lungs to cave in. Across from Elaine's stall was Marmalade's who owned a small boutique that was robbed by a few chem-punks last week who happened to make the mistake of catching me just as I had arrived. As much as it made me fluster to think about, these were indeed good deeds... but they never felt fulfilling. I helped these people because no one else could. And those who had the power to would rather exploit their powers rather than use it for the people. It felt like a means to an end. What was the use of so much power if you bore it all alone? Truly alone, even if you forced others to surround you. I remember it well. Accompanied but alone, praised but as a tool, pampered to be exploited. I never wanted to feel like that ever again, and each day it makes me hesitant to help these people. My power becomes a beacon of hope they cling to and power always attracts trouble. Though I helped, I keep it to a discrete few I can trust like the elderly or the children who assure me they won't tell their parents. It... was less lonely this way. From my little hut down in the Sump, I could look up at the rest of Zaun, the ever-present Gray blocked the too-bright lights from Piltover and shadowing memories I'd rather leave behind than keep. As I step out of the Black Lanes and back to my hut, a cry stops me in my tracks. Turning around, the familiar churning of alchemical smoke from the Factorywood is made apparent and I can see the Gray thickening. A Gray-out. People shout and run for cover, some bring out bluebird charms and pray to Janna as they back away... and the two children, unaware of the ruckus play with their ball straight into the mist, looks of horror crossing over their faces as they realize too late the situation they are in. It reminds me too much of the day I lost it, the day this green mist emerged from within me. Today it would emerge again, not to hurt, but to protect instead. I know gas, and the density and composition of the gray is familiar to me after all this time. My mist seizes the incoming cloud as I step into it. I let my arms move to my sides, spreading my energy throughout the mist until I can fill it's weight hanging over my head. With an upward push, I direct the gray to surge upwards, to the higher levels of Zaun and to dissipate into the clouds where it can be picked apart by the strong winds. I approach the two coughing children and place my hands to their chests, drawing the smoke they inhaled outwards. The look to me, coughing but alive. Their eyes full of wonder and hope, I gasp and step backwards. I look to the people around me, sharing the expression of awe that the two boys did. I run. Power draws power to itself and I made myself a fire for moth's to fly to once again. But as I look back to the two children hugging each other, the relieved sighs the citizens of Zaun breathe... I think it is okay. This power within me does not only wrought danger... it can also be a force for good. And here down in the Zump, it probably fits in just as much as it's people. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ # Abilities/In-Game Kit: &amp;#x200B; # Energy Field [Passive] **Innate:** Esmeralda gains a 20-120 (based on level) (+15% AP) **Shield** each time an ability of hers successfully damages an enemy **Champion**.

8,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,My Take on Assassins.,1,gf15d8,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gf15d8/my_take_on_assassins/,2020-05-07 16:15:52,"High Risk, High Reward. You've probably heard that so many times. Let's compare two mid lane assassins that are very strong right now. Comparing their stats considering win rate, ban rate and pick rate respectively, Ekko: 51% 22% 5.6% Pyke: 52% 9.7% 1% [URL When an assassin champion becomes too easy their play rate spikes. This time it is Ekko and Katarina. Previously it has been Zed when his combo did 75% of one's health in a lane before his W and Q were nerfed in v9.8 [URL . Playing against assassins is not fun in general unless you feel that a player's skill on the champion warrants the player's success. Players don't feel that way against Ekko, Katarina, and Talon compared to Qiyana and Pyke, why? Because the latter takes more effort to pilot. A Katarina player can be 40cs behind and get 3 kills in bot lane and take over the game. Orianna can't do the same in that situation very easily. I haven't seen a Zed complaint on Reddit since riot made his Q more essential to his damage and increased his window of vulnerability. Easy assassins encourage lazy players and inflate their skill level. A silver Katarina can get to plat while knowing nothing about wave management, mana management, and proper team fighting since the champion is so linear. Playing Akali perfectly is a whole different game than an E Q combo on Ekko and btw I am an Ekko main with 60% wr this season both mid and jg [URL . My opinion on assassin design is that riot makes them extremely hard to pilot comparatively. There should be very little reliable damage on any point and click ability. Riot might think nerfing assassins will be very damaging to the player base but the reward from playing these champions is improving the skill needed to pilot them. One trick Riven and Zed players are still grinding and perfecting their craft and Leblanc is one of the most played mid laners in challenger despite having a 45% wr [URL . &amp;#x200B; Riot, please be consistent with your high risk, high reward philosophy when balancing champions to keep the game healthy balance wise."
9,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Riot really doesn't get the problem with vanguard,2,gfxfr2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gfxfr2/riot_really_doesnt_get_the_problem_with_vanguard/,2020-05-09 03:27:50,"URL Riot recently made this long post about anti cheating and at the end talked about their latest anti-cheat creation vanguard. Good intentions (I think), bad execution. Vanguard permanently runs on your computer with very high level permissions and they are adding it to league. They talked about how they won't use it to steal data but that's not the problem here. When you put something like that on a computer it is a massive security risk that could be abused by people other than riot. And considering that millions of people play league or at least have it installed on their computer, they could potentially create a widespread vulnerability for many people. There's people that have explained it better than me and will go into the exact specifics of how it works since videos on it are easy to find. I'm just trying to make people aware because at the end of the day no anti cheat will be perfect but anti cheats on nearly every other game, don't need to resort to methods like this."

11,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Syndra better change idea,0,gstd0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/gstd0w/syndra_better_change_idea/,2020-05-29 23:50:44,"Syndra is a one sided champ, her oppressiveness is like 100, and her vulnerability is literally the highest in the game. And what to they do? Instead of nerfing her oppressiveness they nerf her vulnerability, against scrappy champs her EQ is almost impossible to hit. Playing against syndra is not fun because her Q is on a 4 second cooldown level 1 with 800 range, i'm not excited that i have a 2 second longer gap to go in for her, pro's or good syndra's will still dominate anyone with her during the laning phase with little to no counterplay. Here's some change ideas. **Q - changed from 4 second cooldown at all ranks to 6/5.5/5/4.5/4** **transcendent - changed from 25% bonus damage against champions to 10%, and spheres have a 75% larger radius but instead of having a 0.6 sec cast time it has a 0.8 cast time** Why this is good? It discourages this 2 dimensional Q whenever your opponent walks up to cs playstyle and it adds actual counterplay to her. Furthermore it synergises with her E transcendent which feels pointless most of the time. It will be fairer because her Q E combo or just Q is easier to react to late game, but also easier to aim since it's bigger as people tend to be a lot faster and mobile in the late game."
12,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Supports please stop building Full AP if you are healer or shielder(lux),1,g5bzt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/g5bzt0/supports_please_stop_building_full_ap_if_you_are/,2020-04-21 19:17:18,"Dear support players please if you're on a champion with Healing or shielding build the proper items not Ludens and Death Cap, this means yes you to lux, I am not saying this because you can't do damage, the full support build just by default with proper runes Aery Nullorb/Nimbus, Transcend, water walking, and secondary take either Ghost poro Ingenious hunter if you like TONS of vision control and wanna be the best player you can be as it takes the 120-second cd support items down to 72 seconds which is far more accessible. Or if you and the ADC wanna both go for Revitalize, take that along with Font of life to Pump the healing potential of one another The build SpellTheifs line, Athenes Asap, Mikeals/redemption( will get both just preference which first) after those get Ardent, and for boots take Tabis most of the time, if not then take lucidity for short Summoners and another 20 ap. Explanations from the top Tldr 400% Mana Regen, 350+AP 70MR 40%cdr and 45% stronger heals and shields. 1k redemption heals, Athenes to heal an extra 362 with super easy consistency. Far Better than any Standard AP build for supports(ex, Ludens Dcap) This rune Page with full support build will give you 350ish AP reliably and still give you 400% Mana regen, 70 MR 200hp and 45% heal and shield power, not to mention the easy 40% cdr and 8% move speed from Ardent, A notice to everyone is that Redemption scales with TRIPLE heal and shield power, so your redemption gets 135% increased power at level 18 this gives it the healing power of 956 to allies below 40% or 869 to those above, if the target has a spirits visage(which they should with enchanter on the team) they are healed for base 1,129 and if below 40% 1,242 this is to all allies every 70 seconds and not to mention its 10% max hp true damage to enemies. Another massively underappreciated aspect of this is, the simple fact you have 70MR and the fact you get 400% mana regen on a healer, lux as my target example gets 80Mana per 5 or 16 a second. Kind of hard to ever run out at that rate of regen, and it's why Manaflow band is not needed as with her base 800 mana, and the 250 the 1% regen of MISSING mana every 5 seconds to match the power of support build you would need 8000 mana and have spent all of it, and I hope that illustrates my point that mana flow bad is not for enchanters rune choices matter, and either nimbus or Nullifying are so impactful as null orb is amped by your shield power and will shield up to 239 and with your MR that is probably enough to save you. Nimbus allows you to get a huge burst of speed when you need it, transcendence is due to the fact this build over caps so intensely on CDR, I Recommend Water walking in this slot as the 25 Movespeed and increased AP at drag and baron fights makes a really big difference and the movement speed is very important to help you ward quickly or to outrun your opponents. Secondary I prefer are zombie ward(if I'm Yuumi) or Ghost poro on all others, pair with Ingenious hunter as I find the 50 seconds off Crucible and Redemp so strong and the fact Trinkets are up more often this takes Sweeper down to 36 seconds late game to completely control the vision game, Alternatively, I can go Font of life/revitalize, Revitalize is pretty obvious as it gives 5% heal shield power(hidden info there) and amplifies all heals on low HP targets and stacks if the target also has the rune for 20% more healing on them. Font of life is a very good choice, as it is 5 healing on hit +10 per 1k hp you have, this actually can be incredibly strong as champs like Lulu Soraka Nami Yuumi Janna and lux they already are applying slows actively in their gameplay. This Will Trigger your Ardent and use available Athenes power. The determining fact, in my opinion, should be is your ADC taking Resolve secondary for Revitalize, if so its worth stacking, As for Aery, it is a clear winner in this build as it will shield 35 to 80 + 25% ap and then multiply by you heal shield power, this comes out to 242 late game but even in the mid-game when it just says 86 if you have 100 Ap And 1 Forbidden idol. that combined with Athens is 186 healing and shielding combined, Note focus on if you have aery available to not always use it offensively,. So for example sake here is the Total Power of a lux W level 9 with Athenes plus Mikeals, running the ingenious page. 441 shield from W 101 shielding from Aery, and healing them for 204 HP, this is a total HP swing in combat of 746 not including the 441 shield you also received. This Effect is on a 6-second cooldown once you have 40% cdr and only gets stronger. This is what supports like Lux are supposed to be providing their ally when they are in bot lane, the second point of all this is support items are INSANELY cost-effective at 2100 for a lot of them compare to Ludens 3200 and its 90AP, Athenes and aether wisp plus 2 faerie charms, which is nearly the same price is shockingly 90AP but instead of a 100+10% ap proc you get huge Shields and the ability to heal your allies, something Lux by default can not do, and that is what makes such a huge difference is the ability to afterward recover hp. End of the day the reason is it is so important is ADCs generally have a weak start or at high levels of vulnerability to the enemy supports, going these builds will give you 70MR which both helps mitigate Harass but in mid-game, you are Very low risk from enemy mid laner and can focus on helping your ADC then not be burst down."
13,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"I've been playing League religiously for 6 years, peaking Diamond 1 last season. I started playing Smite a week ago or so and I can't stop. Here are some things in Smite I desperately wish League would implement.",0,g7vo1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/g7vo1v/ive_been_playing_league_religiously_for_6_years/,2020-04-26 01:49:33,"First off: I DONT want League to become Smite. The two games are very different and thats a good thing. But there are some very good systemic changes in Smite that I would love to see implemented in league for a much healthier game. Second: I literally started playing Smite a week ago and am still on the level 30 grind to start playing ranked. So take my thoughts with a grain of salt, and if anyone with more Smite experience would like to offer their insight, I'd love to hear your thoughts. That being said, with my league knowledge I think I've adapted extremely quickly. The first major thing I'm a huge fan of in Smite is how much more controlled their damage output is. There are 3 classes that deal significant damage. Ad carries, Mages and Assassins. Assassins typically have one or two types of mobility and it's very conservative within that realm. Usually a blink or a dash and that's really everything they have. Mages have huge burst. I mean absolutely nuts burst. Theres one character who basically has Lux E as her main ability, but it deals probably 2 to 3 times the amount of damage lux E deals at any given moment in the game. That same character's ultimate is a small aoe nuke (the size of oriannas ult) with a pretty big delay on cast, but it resets on kills. And the damage is out of this world. AD carries are significantly more balanced and have a shit ton more agency and power due to the fact that their (and everyones) auto attacks in the game are skillshots. So there is a lot more counterplay against ad carries if they get a lead, and the ones that suck are more punishable, which allows for more power in their kit. This one isn' t really changeable in league due to the nature of targetted auto attack based carries, I just thoughg it was interesting. So Mages, Assassins, and AD carriss deal damage. What about bruisers? Bruisers dont deal a ton of damage. They deal good sustained damage. One character I play a ton now is literally Wukong. Except his name in smite is Sun Wukong. Q is the same but a skillshot. His W in Smite is his Ult in league, but its a slow instead of a knockup and just a quick spin once. The E in smite is a versatile mobility spell that can either knock aside enemies and push through them, stun the first enemy briefly and deal damage over time, or be straight mobility (the ""Fuck this shit Im out"" version) which you choose based on how far away you cast the ability. Very interesting and versatile ability. His ult is basically Wukongs W that creates a clone that walks around and fights, while Wukong jumps in the air immune and untargetable and heals for a quarter of his health over 5s and can slam down for a big aoe slam. The thing about Sun Wukong is that when I first started playing him, I was pitifully underwhelmed by his damage levels. I expected a lane bully bruiser to deal renekton kinds of damage. One shot on stun landing with no counterplay. Only after multiple games did I realize that I had to commit my entire kit with 2 or even 3 rotations of spells just to kill someone even if I got a lead. I mean I was literally 9-0-11 yesterday building very heavy damage on Wukong and my Q (which is my first maxed ability for waveclear and poke) did maybe 200-250 damage to a squishy and has around a 10 second cooldown. A 9-0-11 glass cannon wukong in league looks at you funny and you die. Then the teammate next to you dies. Then your whole team dies. I'm a fed as fuck bruiser and my job is to dive the carry and be tanky enough to get a few rotations of my spells off to kill them and distract the enemy team so my team isnt pressured away from fighting the carries. My job is not to one shot literally everything known to mankind Jax, Renekton, or Irelia style. Supports are tanky CC characters or healers. Think Sona in league, but without the 500+ damage targetted nuke at any given time. Think alistar. Characters focused on engaging. So I guess to summarize that up: *Damage is concentrated into damage dealers.* Mages, ADCs, and Assassins are the only significant damage dealers. ADCs do great damage over time, Mages and Assassins burst. This is generally a product of **cooldowns being significantly longer in Smite than in league.** Dashes dont have 3 or 4 second cooldowns. Most movement abilities from what I can see have around 10+ second cooldowns at all stages in the game. Almost every ability from mages have a 7+ second cooldown. But thats balanced off by the fact that not everybody is getting fucking one shot left and right. I mean some people are if they disrespect the enemy midlaner with damage buff. But the supports and bruisers and tanks arent one shotting you no matter how fed they are. The next big difference in Smite is that healing is significantly less bullshit. People on the Smite subreddit claim that they are in a healing meta right now. Healing is supposed to be very strong. And I am not exaggerating when I say that the Smite's healing is pitiful when compared to league. It's very possible that this experience is a product of me still being relatively low ELO and maybe I havent reached the poing where people abuse healing as much as they could. I have seen one egregious incident of healing before, but its nothing compared to league where one Sylas W makes him full health because 14 pregame runes add to his healing. Speaking of pregame runes: They dont exist in Smite. Which is a BIG game changer when it comes to balancing. Characters in Smite are balances around themselves. Not runes. Characters in League are heavily balanced around these artificial damage sources known as runes. We see champions in the patch notes get specific changes just so they can take certain runes (Yay Wukong and Garen!!) And suddenly thats the only rune they can ever take. We see certain chanpions completely broken because of runes that just become unbalanceable nightmares (Yay Dark Harvest Karthus!!) This artificial pregame garbage does not exist in smite. And I didnt realize how much I dislike runes until I started playing Smite. Theres no random burst of 200-300 damage coming from a random auto attack because Electrocute happened to proc. If Im taking damage, im getting hit by an ability and I can expect that damage. Theres no artificial damage boost from outside sources and it makes the characters much easier to look at from a balance perspective because you dont have to limit your balance changes because ""this change might make X busted with Y rune"" There are a bunch more things I could dive into that but these are the major ones that stuck out to me in just a week of playing Smite. TL:DR Damage output in League needs to be heavily reconsidered in my opinion. Put damage on damage dealers. Nerf healing. And not just by buffing Grevious Wounds. Get rid of runes. Theyre a balancing nightmare and a gimmick. Increase cooldowns and make cooldown reduction significantly harder to get. It makes the game significantly less frustrating when strong characters have almost no downtime or vulnerability. Its also less forgiving when you completely whiff your abilities."
14,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,What an update to Aatrox would've looked like if he stayed an aa-based fighter,1,g9hcem,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/g9hcem/what_an_update_to_aatrox_wouldve_looked_like_if/,2020-04-28 15:32:28,"Before we get into it, let's define what was core to Aatrox's theme and what needed to be changed. **Core:** Attack-based healing, Some kind of flight, Auto-attack based, Revival (or some form of immunity from death) **Needed to be changed:** Blood Thirst/Blood Price toggle, Blood Well (not necessarily its existence, but at least the way it functioned) So with those in mind, here's what an updated version of his kit could have looked like (I'll be using mostly the same ability names): **Passive: Blood Thirst** Every third hit against non-structures, Aatrox deals bonus physical damage and heals himself. * This addresses the balance issue inherent with having the heal and damage be separate, where they needed to be stronger than if they applied at once. Keeping them balanced meant one simply had to be too weak to matter most of the time while the other was favored, which is why they ended up changing the heal to %missing HP and removing the cost from Thirst. **Q: Dark Flight** Aatrox dashes to the target enemy, dealing damage and knocking it up. * This addresses the fact a heavily heal-oriented on-hit fighter should be initiating and staying in fights, not using their dash to escape. And changing it to single-target means it doesn't have to have the delay as a drawback. Especially since it technically being AoE was kind of meaningless with the knockup radius was the size of a single champion. **W: Blood Price** Passive: Aatrox fills his *Blood Well* over time and when he procs Blood Thirst. Active: Aatrox expends his *Blood Well*, gaining attack speed based on the amount of blood consumed for 5 seconds. This ability has no cooldown. Activating it again restarts the duration, but with attack speed based on the amount of blood used for that cast. * This addresses the issue of Blood Well requiring you to already be in combat for eight attacks before granting any benefit. I front-loaded the buff and made it so you can continuously cast it, at reduced benefit if you don't wait for the well to refill. **E: Blades of Torment** Aatrox slashes in a cone before extending his sword for a thrust, dealing damage and slowing enemies hit. These attacks count towards Blood Thirst's attack counter and pause the duration of Blood Price. * Here, I wanted him to lose any vulnerability to Yasuo/Braum, and make his poke ability reminiscent of his current Q's large swings. Hence the cone and multiple attacks. Helping him get his next passive attack and pausing the AS steroid are just for QoL. **R: World Ender** Aatrox becomes larger and ascends into the air while gaining attack range and bonus healing from Blood Thirst. Aatrox cannot be killed by damage from outside of his attack range during this time. * The invulnerability to ranged damage somewhat mimics the defensive benefit of a revive without leaving him vulnerable. While the increased lifesteal is similar to his current increased healing. \----- Now, if any of that all sounds way too familiar to you, it should. The point of this is to highlight just how similar old Aatrox was to current Xin Zhao (after his W was changed into a ranged, slowing poke like Aatrox's old E). And how a rework that left/enhanced all of the same strengths while addressing the aspects that caused issues for balance would have had to look like a copy of Xin Zhao. Even if we disregard my rework concept here, the cooldowns, healing, damage, slow %, AS steroid, even the ranges of his abilities were incredibly similar to how Xin Zhao eventually ended up when he got his new W."
15,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Why isn't Yuumi's enhanced abilities tied to her passive?,1,ffrndm,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ffrndm/why_isnt_yuumis_enhanced_abilities_tied_to_her/,2020-03-09 19:35:57,"Yuumi's biggest issue seems to be a lack of skill expression. She is played best when she doesn't take risks, grafting to a single champ that can carry and letting her Adaptive stats do the work, casting as needed. This is what makes her so toxic, she's useless if her team is behind and unstoppable if her team is ahead. If you add skill expression to her kit and vulnerability to her kit this problem disappears. Regular Q slow is weak, want a better one? Need to trigger passive. Regular heal is weak, want a better one? Passive. This, or make it so she has to dash to different champions to gain her full adaptive force. I know she was supposed to be a support for new players to try out, but she's had the exact opposite effect and will continue to be toxic for the game without a major change."
16,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Why are they nerfing Top Lane Soraka?,1,ezoh68,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ezoh68/why_are_they_nerfing_top_lane_soraka/,2020-02-06 17:53:47,"Disclaimer: I don't play Soraka top &amp;#x200B; She has clear strengths (early game, lane control, team power) but also clear weaknesses (vulnerability to 2v1, lack of damage in mid/late). I feel like removing her from top lane further enforces top lane meta where the only objective is to kill the opponent and win the lane. Isolation of top lane is a real problem since establishment of 1/1/2+jg meta and she's one of the very few team-oriented top laners. To be honest, top lane without weird picks (such as Raka atm) is just ""dick measuring contest"". Thoughts?"
17,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,New Champion Concept!,0,f1yyvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/f1yyvu/new_champion_concept/,2020-02-11 10:19:39,"Hey guys, I am Kevon218 and I am coming to you with a new champion design that I thought of for a little while. I will break down everything and my thought process behind every aspect of the champion, or at least try for you guys. So, let me introduce to you my Champion: &amp;#x200B; ***Frank, The Demacian Artillery*** &amp;#x200B; **Passive - MORE FIRE POWER!:** &gt;Frank's Auto Attacks do not scale off of bonus AD and cannot critically strike &gt; &gt;Frank gains an additional 40/60/80/100% bonus AD (Levels 1/6/11/16) I balanced the passive with the math (which might be wrong?) that AP is \~60% more efficient to build than AD. making him break even on efficiency at level 6 and then gaining AP efficiency + Dcap passive at level 16. As you will see later, Frank is suppose to be an AD artillery mage. I believe Dcap is an essential item for artillery champions and with no equivalent being available for AD champions. I believe this is also fine because AD champions lack a lot of the utility that AP champions receive from their itemization (Rylai's, Liandry's, Zhonya's). **Q - Lock &amp; Loaded:** &gt;CD: 24/20/16/12/8 &gt; &gt;Long range AOE damange ability (similar to Lux E, smaller radius but quicker travel speed) &gt; &gt;Frank Launches missile dealing 20/60/100/140/180 (+ 110% BAd) physical damage in a small circle to the targeted area This is Frank's Lux E or Xerath W, an AOE wave clear ability. Very low base damage but has great scaling. The point of investing into this ability is because of the CD reduction you gain from putting points into the ability as the base damage is very negligible but will be your late game poke. &amp;#x200B; **W - Elbow Grease:** &gt;CD: 20 seconds at all ranks &gt; &gt;Passive: Gain 5/6/7/8/9 mana per 5 seconds &gt; &gt;Active: Gain 5% (+ .55 Lifesteal) Spell Vamp for 4/6/8/10/12 seconds Gain spell vamp for building life steal. the life steal to Spell Vamp conversion is inefficient. I thought about making the passive a last hitting passive like Garen W but for mana. something like 5 mana for every minion you kill up to a maximum of 500 mana, but I was worried this synergized too well with muramana. might still be worth looking into. Might be worth it since none of abilities can proc the AWE passive of muramana. **E - Shrapnel Charge** &gt;CD: 14 seconds at all ranks &gt; &gt;Frank fires a short range cone ability in front of him dealing 80/120/160/200/240 (+ .6 BAd) physical damage to the first targets hit. &gt; &gt;Targets hit by Shrapnel Charge are marked as vulnerable for 5 seconds. &gt; &gt;Frank's next damaging ability on a target that is marked as vulnerable expels the vulnerability mark and deals an additional 40 (+ .25-.45 BAd) (levels 1-13) physical damage This is frank's early game ability that he can use to effectively trade. Artillery champions have to have a reason to walk up and put them self in danger and this is that ability. To be able to effectively trade early, Frank has to use this ability. Vulnerability gives him early game burst and kill pressure while tying it to an ability that requires him to over extend and put himself in harms way. &amp;#x200B; **R - Call in the Artillery:** &gt;CD: 140/120/100 seconds &gt; &gt;Frank calls in the Artillery on a champion, shooting three artillery shots in the area around the targeted champion dealing 90/120/150 (+ .35 BAd) Physical Damage per shot. &gt; &gt;Call in the Artillery has 10% (+ .25 Crit Chance) Armor Penetration Call in the Artillery locks onto a target for it's initial position, but fires all 3 shots in the same spot at the initial location. The crit chance into Armor pen allows for you to be able to buy these large AD items items that crit itemization gives you but having a very niche use. with a .25 scaling (10% Armor Pen for every 25% crit chance), every crit item gives you roughly 50% of it's gold efficiency of crit into armor pen. This is made up for in the base pen given by R, but then becomes more inefficient for every crit item bought after. This opens up niche itemization for the champion, allowing for many diverse builds. &amp;#x200B; This is my Champion concept, Frank. He is an AD artillery mage that brings a simple kit into the game that is similar to other champions already in the game, but fills a unique niche. He allows for unique itemization because of how his kit is developed and can use multiple build paths. His passive makes him weak levels 1-6, but scales well into the Mid/Late game. &amp;#x200B; If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer them and what I was thinking while writing all of this down. The numbers I gave can be changed of course, i just came up with numbers I felt would be good as starting points for him! &amp;#x200B; Edit: Formatting"
18,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Champions that should be viable in the jungle for season 2020.,1,f5vrh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/f5vrh1/champions_that_should_be_viable_in_the_jungle_for/,2020-02-19 04:56:20,"As I'm sure many of you have seen, riot is pushing buffs to some mid/top lane champions to make them viable in the jungle. As it stands, the jungle meta has been pretty stagnant and champion diversity is fairly low. I believe that there is a lot of potential for support junglers to become viable. Here are my top 3: Bard: His entire kit embraces the jungle role. The only thing holding him back is his clear. Bard is actually a very strong pick right now with a 53% winrate as a support, and I think he could wreak havoc in the jungle. Lulu: In the olden days, Lulu was played in literally every role. I'm not advocating we return to that, but I think Lulu is a great champion for nullifying extremely aggressive junglers, and would create a meaningful shift in the meta. Ivern: I actually feel that Ivern is an ok spot right now, but I'd like to see them make changes to the krugs camp for him at the least. At the moment, he only receives gold for the 2 starting krugs and for a champ that can be invaded easily I don't think that's fair. I think a QoL buff or two could launch Ivern into relevancy. Bonus Round - Ziggs: Ziggs could operate much like Taliyah jungle does. His abilites lend themselves to good jungle clear and his w provides self peel against invaders. It can also be used aggressively to gank. Overall, I think that support oriented junglers are completely ignored because their early clear presents a huge vulnerability to early invades. If this could be amended, I feel these champions could really change the way the jungle role impacts the game."
19,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Severum (Aphelios sustain weapon) is what makes him broken - take away its lifesteal, swap for a temporary small shield or just remove the gun.",1,emgd8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/emgd8r/severum_aphelios_sustain_weapon_is_what_makes_him/,2020-01-10 08:33:43,"Everyone usually complains about Aphelios insane and unpredictable damage plus some way over the top utility and synergies like Crescendum + Calibrum, and while they are right, personally my concern while playing against Aphelios is his Severum, it is the cherry on top of his busted kit, but a very big juicy cherry, it erases all his weaknesses, you get a very long range adc with utility, aoe, cc + high damage and you simply ad a massive lifesteal, mobility and a flat heal. My biggest problems with him: a) Absolutely broken sustain in lane, no other adc comes even close to his sustain, during laning he probably have 2-3 times the enemy ad health when you count the shield and healing (someone should do the math), he is almost unpunishable, you either kill him in one engage or lose. b) He is virtually immune to enemy assassins if he keeps his Severum in late game, all he needs to do is press Q to survive a burst, between the shield he gets from the talent, ult heal, own heal and flash he can survive anything while doing tons of damage, not to mention if you add items on top of that. For me the best way to nerf Aphelios is to take away his lifesteal, he needs to be vulnerable, sorta like Jhin, his kit is already overloaded, his lane phase is pretty safe, hes got an insane level 6 power spike, great scaling while also strong early game from level 2. He shouldn't also have sustain, not just a sustain but maybe the best one in game without items, he needs another weakness besides not having a dash, do either of the 3: 1.1: Remove Severum heal 1.2: Change heal for a temporary shield with a maximum ammount 1.3: Remove Severum altogether (could fix other problems) If they want to play safe changing the healing for a small temporary shield could be enough for now, it would make his lane phase way more punishable, but i wouldn't mind completely deleting the gun, letting him with only 4, it would be easier to track his weapons and know what he can do against you. Besides that, if they give Calibrum proc a max range like Caitlyn HS and some numbers balancing would be a decent approach to make him healthy to the game and enjoyable to play against. Taking away his lifesteal would entirely preserve his indentity and give him a clear vulnerability."

21,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Increasing tower range for toplane,1,evnku8,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/evnku8/increasing_tower_range_for_toplane/,2020-01-30 01:28:46,"This actually solves three of the biggest problems in toplane which are how long the lane is, and getting dove by the jungler, aswell as dealing with ranged toplaners that poke you under tower. Alot of the time when you play against a ranged toplaner it's very difficult to get onto them, and they will push you in because their attacks can harass you when you attempt to last hit, so what ends up happening is that you are under tower a lot of the game. Now assuming you have the average solo queue jungler that has no idea how lane states work and matchups mean you won't be getting any assistance on the no mobility perma overextended toplaner. The problem is that you can be constantly harassed under tower while they keep breaking tower aggro before taking a shot, meaning you will be losing health while you farm unless you have good ranged waveclear which very few toplaners have, especially early. The length of the lane which is dictated by the distance between the two tower ranges is another reason why toplane is such a horrendous lane which is easy to gank, even when warded. Longer tower ranged exclusively in toplane in such essence means you can retreat easier to your tower and ranged matchups are easier again, maybe increasing tower range by 200-300 is the solution. On disadvanatge i can think is that in traditional matchups with two melee champs, it makes diving a lot harder, which I already mentioned as it's a double edged sword. The additional safety means less kills will come from toplane, which will discourage snowball toplaners, which seems like a healthy thing anyway. Now we don't want the pillow-fights of season 4 in toplane with two 4k health tanks that do nothing all game. But right now the lane, and game, is waay too volatile and the vulnerability of toplane to jungle is far more prevalent than any other lane. &amp;#x200B; Any other benefits or disadvantages of this?"
22,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Part 2, (part 1 is in the last commentary section in my little brothers blog in the last commentary section)",1,e7ckbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/e7ckbh/part_2_part_1_is_in_the_last_commentary_section/,2019-12-07 20:54:01,"This is his brother K0u. Seeing as there has been alot of attention in the media, and alot of commentary, since he has been in a part of the gaming community. I really want to adress something for those people out there today, and nowaday. I left mine 2 cents in the commentary section in his blog, as the last commentary there. I felt suprised, and out of respect kinda, for people who wrote to him, and it didn't not contain flame or toxicity at all, which suprised me. Since I have somehow made a picture that, when you post something on the net, there will always be a bunch of trolls or insenstive comments. So please do take a read on the commentary section on his blog, if you are sometimes struggling with reality. If you sometimes struggles with life, or if at all find yourself in some dark despair. Take it as part 2 of the continued writing from there. After maybe you been reading my commentary, I woke up just now. It has been 5 days, since we found him, I also saw him yesterday for the identification process, to be sure 110% that it is the person yeeh.. I am not gonna go into details about that. Life is tough, sometimes it gets nice, but somehow you always feel like you don't really belong in this world. Somehow sometime the feeling just hit you so hard, that you even question yourself to think so what's the use of living? or continue on? Regarding my life, I really hasn't really been paying attention to myself lately, even before when K0u was alive. I was in a point of life where, I thought I had it good and well. I admit it is quite the problem. Depression? Suicidal thoughts? Well I had it before, not now after going through this experience, I know how and what I will leave behind for those living and that are closes to me. I will never let them go through it. Me and my brother, we are actually not quite that different. The only difference is his first attempt failed, and so is mine. The 2nd attempt, he succeeded, while my 2nd attempt is just was in a fleeting thoughts, and it just somehow pops in occasionaly when life gets rough. We both, are in fact nowadays actually out of society. We both dropped out of school. It's 7 years gap between me and him. He finished 10 grade, whille I only lasted till 8 grade half of the course. How it became like that? I struggled in school, I really did. When I was a kid, I was at the stage where I cared more about having friends, and having a place where I felt I was needed or a sense of belonging. Never got that either. I even never told anyone the story of what really happened back then, and what made me drop out of school. Due to embarresment at that point of life. Well im a bit more mature in my thoughts, so I don't feel so ashamed now, but I really was ashamed. I also talked to my best friend yesterday, and also noticed that he also had the same problem as me, but during the stage at that time, we both found it embarrassing and never shared that part. Nor did we adress more about the problem then. We never felt the need to show that vulnerability side of ourself. Or maybe it's just a reaction that you never want to tell those things, due to many feelings which I don't know how to summarize. But in short I felt ashamed. Maybe it is in a sense an indirect bullying, one of the biggest reason I could never finish school was, I struggled really hard when we had those moments, where the school had breaks. It is divided to couples of times after you finish a course. Which usually last 15 min, and one dinner break that last 30 min. During those break, I was one of those kids, that just stood there in a corner. At first couple of the starting days, you convince yourself that it's ok you can manage it, or you have more motivation depending on different stages of life you are in. But still, I struggled. I struggled with every break, when there was. I was just the one observing others, going to other kids and I actually did envy them alot. That they had a sense of belonging and that they could talk whatever discussion interact. I did not, of course sometimes I had friend to talk to, but I never got the courage to talk to somebody. The idea of just going to a group, and then leave a comment or 2 and pretend like you a part of that group, and then they just might look at you weirdly and shun you out of the group. Left me more terrified than trying to do something about it. So I dreaded those breaks. School was not a pleasant stay for me, when the days turns in weeks, weeks turns in months. Coupled with the fact that both our parents are Vietnamese origin, and due to language barrier, I never had anyone to guide me. So whatever decision or reason I had to handle it alone. It also is kinda sad when if we had parental meeting or stuff like that, me and my little brother had to cook up things and excuses that both our parents couldn't attend. I never attended those, while those other kids had they parents to bring, and if I came for what reason? standing there alone? So other parents can look weird at me? and then start telling their kids to stay away from me? It was those thoughts back then. So yeah I never went to those, or when it was I cooked up some excuses or reason that my parents could join in it. I dreaded the breaks, standing there in the corner, and worry sick death about what those around are thinking about me? Maybe im the weird kid, and they will even more stay away from me. So I had many thoughts and was worried about what those around me thought. It developed to the point that it scared me if I one day got bullied for it. Hence I choose the easy way out, I dropped out. It started with me not attending to classes in school, while during those moments, ahh gaming world was so nice. Yes we escaped to that reality. So school was not pleasant for me, I can swear this problem now still exist today, and it is hidden. The reason it is hidden is because those kid experience those things, will never ever tell anyone or a soul about it. Why? Because once you start doing it, you admit you have problems. You admit that you are getting bullied. It is a shame, and you dread even more what is about to come. Maybe it will get more attention, but those other kids might even fake approaches to you, and you later find they are in fact not genuinely interested in being friends with you. You dread even more of that reality. You dreaded the reality that they are all smiles and ok in front of you, then once you are not there, they will talk behind your back, and say things like: ""yeah he is such an outsider, such a loser lol"". I dreaded those outcomes as well. So I never adressed those problems nor talked with anyone about it, in fact when those adults came and talked to me. I was pretending to be one of those normal kids. I pretended that it was some other shit that bothered me. So I dropped out of school, ocassionly I tried couples of times to go back to school, but the end result I quit. Those feelings came eventually one day or another in school. And the more older you get the more scared were you. Since image was important and if you were one of those popular kids it was ok, but if you were weird they would stay the hell out of you. The outcome today? I am 29 years old with no education. In fact I got a bit lucky when I was 18, I got into a good job that provided me life income. It was so good money that I only worked 2 days in a week, the rest I was free and gamed. I was in no way motivated to work at all, and my relationship with money was it's just paper. My reality check hit me when I was 25, where I got so poor that I couldn't pay my rent for 3 months, I ended up with debts with 9500euro. It has been fixed till this day. After that event, I worked the maximum I could do, so I worked my 4 years 5 days a week. This thing happened with me now recently when K0u got discharged out of the hospital moving in to me. I never knew the weight of the word he told me at that point, but it actually breaks me now.. hard.. I told him to come and stay with me. while thinking he can patch up his wounds, we been training partners for these last 3 months together, so there is this finished food things product that you just buy and only heat it in the oven, which cost about 5 euro, and is very cheap here in Norway, well I think it is cheap as well, and it had a huge amount of protein sources in it. I told him ""Heey tried those fish-filet thingy?"" K0u: "" What fish filet things?"" Me: ""Give it a try it's awesome and high protein source and only 290calories"". K0u after tried it, shit it was really nice and good. How much does it cost? Me: It only cost 5euro, fucking cheap as hell. I remember clearly the reaction he had when I dropped those words. Yes I am breaking now... His reaction went like this. K0u: ""That is fuucking expensive man. I can't afford those, there were certain times I only had to live for 10euros a day"". Can you guys even begin to comprehend and imagine what a 22years old kid goes through when he has to handle life like that? I never analyzed it hardly and clearly enough, since he was with me, and I would support him economy wise. These words were left unsaid, if only I just said during his darkest moment. ""Hey, it's ok you are home with me now, I will help you, let me give support"". I never will be able to get those chance again. He was living and struggle for life, and even tried to give it a chance even though he had those moments where I had to live by for 10 euros a day. Don't start and be judgemental and think well others countries live by 3 euros and etc. We live in Norway everything here is expensive compared to other countries. Add that facts to some recent bill he gets, which gets him more in debt. I can't even imagine what he is going through, while not having someone to handle it, I guess he was ashamed and never once did he come to me for help. He might dread some other thoughts depending on the reaction, or maybe he didn't give himself the luxury, that he couldn't have any positive feelings or something good happens in life, only the next day turn sour. We are both stubborn, and would take those things to the grave, I would also never share this story either actually. So my life got temporary fix, still not in society, and I work in this environment where drug is a common thing, and it is heavily abused by some people there. I work as a poker dealer in Norway, and it is illegal, but who cares. Of course I got into drugs as well, I was late into the drugs things, my first drug experience was at age 26. I really liked it, and I even had the economy to provide, and where it didn't affect my living situation once I enjoyed it. So yes, you guys can see where it leads to. It got to the point that, during family dinner, I had to go to the bathroom and take some lines. Oh don't worry I consume other stuff as well, as Xanax, Attentin, Ritalin, MDMA, but mostly cocaine. It got even to the point that, I even consumed it infront of my brother while I was playing FFXV. He was discharged and home at me this point. I have quit, from the moment I got the call from the police, I threw all the shit that had the words drugs in it. I dread sometimes the battle I will have with drug, once I have it a bit better in life, and where I don't grief so much over my little brother. It's very easy thing to thing, let's have some fun at that point. That is another story and another battle of wills I will have to take. So short to summarize, my life is actually complete fucked up with no education, and drug abuse. I am 29, will be soon hitting 30. It is good with drug sometimes, when you consume it. I so believe so with others who have similar experience. But those substance will consume you one point in life. It get's so bad that it can destroy your life, if it hasn't. Not only does it take a toll on your economy wise, but you will get addicted to it, that it will affect your normal days. The amount of money you use on it will only increase, I don't know how much money I have used on drugs. It is somewhere between the range of 20-35k euro. Imagine what you could have done with those amount of money, to only provide you a better life and situation. So heed my advice and seek help. I got lucky that I could provide my drugs with the income I had, but what happens with the others who can't? Well they start end up doing criminals things... do I even need to tell more? You seen those on the street that has completely fallen out of society. It all stems from a source. Do you honestly think they would want a life like that, if life give them an opportunity? That's how life is, time only goes forward, and there is no medicine called ""regret"" in this world. Thankfully I have fiance, so I have someone that loves me and I feel needed in this world. What I really want to convey to you people out there, be really careful with what you are going through. Don't understimate depression and loneliness. It all stems from some source. If it gets so tough that you don't know what to do, or even see the lights. I can be reachable by email: Acastus@live.no I am not a saint, but I will read and respond. I will even put my 5cents and help or talk with you. I can even tell you what happened with others people, due to my line of work and the clientell that I has. Yeah we get all customers from all range of society, and even those big riches guys as well. So I have seen my fair share with the relationship about drugs, but I also end up consuming and choosing to do it. I have quitted, and I will also have a battle with it, and this is another story for another time. I am only here to tell you that, take careful of yourself. And even those close to you. It cost nothing and no energy at all, to give connect with them. Do it genuinely, it has to come from the heart. Don't do it just because you are a good samaritan. The world has so much more to offer, don't paint it black/white and it's just doom and gloom. Don't make yourself as sage and tell yourself I have comprehended life, and life is just like that. I have seen my life, so what's the point to exist anymore? I wish I never got the wake up call like this, and in this way. In fact even let others the opportunity to ""Understand"" you, don't make it like nobody understand you. Even though they might not comprehend or get what you are going through, in fact if you think about it more carefully, they are not so much different from you. They just have slightly more different experience than you, but they will also have time where they get it rough, where you don't get them. Or maybe the other way around they don't get you. But eventually at some point in life, people will have in some shape and form, some similar experience to you, they will also have different thinking than you. Because people perceive things different. That's where we are unique, not because people don't understand you. Don't understimate depression, don't even start thinking that you can handle it yourself. Well maybe you do, maybe you don't. But you have your choices, but just be extra-careful. There is a reason why there is alot of suicides out there in this world. It all stems and comes from some source, that you rarely confront and admit. Don't believe me? Well have you ever seen somebody take his life because life was going well and good? Never.. there was never this case, nor will there ever be. Alot of those cases, starts with some form of depression, or something to anything at all. But never had there been a case where you life was good, and you had it great, that you took your life. Don't you still get it? it is in fact you are either in some sort of negatively state and darkness and despair, that these attempts or thoughts gets born. It has beein quite the long post. Thank you for being so patient with me. Life is rough, Life is tough, Life is hard, see... don't paint it in black and white. Life is much more complex than that, and it has alot to offer. I have my struggles, If any curious soul out there want to know if I will manage to get back to society one day, have a stable life and good. Or just how I will end up eventually, I know I have some hard battles. I am giving myself a chance, I don't have the luxury of taking the easy way out, once things hit hard. Yes I even might stumble sometimes, and of course those thoughts will hit in that I might quit and give up. I will battle it out, for both of our sake, and a way to tell my little brother that life is more than just black and white. So long for now."
23,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Yummi mini rework (champion become minion or item),1,ea1a4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ea1a4t/yummi_mini_rework_champion_become_minion_or_item/,2019-12-13 19:15:21," Want to write here as Yummi main since her release. First of all, weird patch note - i don't get it when Riot writes me how to play this game. I don't like it. Sometime ago Riot make runes to add variety to playstyles. And now - we have their recommendations about runes. What's wrong with you? **Guardian is still the best rune for Yummi.** Second, her, erm, mini rework that looks like undone piece of code (or shit, whatever you want to call it). I don't know how it is on live servers now. Yummi skills overall: * Her empowered Q - whatever you want to do with it, doesn't matter at all. She is support first of all, and her damage is meaningless alone. * Her E. I don't know, who's idea it was, but it is useless. It is over overloaded with mechs. And it's mana cost is the biggest in LoL ever. 160. Wtf? Anyway, if you need attack speed buff - better pick Lulu and have a real 5 players team, and not Yummi on your side. You want heals - pick Soraka, same argumentation as well. Want move speed buffs - pick Zilean and get his ulti. And we have all this mechs at one skill. With 160 mana cost. And with no possibility to use it on ally after laning phase. * And now the best. Her W. Now we have channel. Okay, 0.25 seconds to catch Yummi - not bad really. But. 5 seconds cd after smallest sneeze at Yummi? What the hell is this? You can't play laning phase, because her manacosts are insane. And her passive can't help it at all. All you can do - try to get shield/mana and instant death because of all in. Remember, 5 seconds cd - you can't survive. And one death in todays metha pretty enough to have 2-3 levels difference after coming back to lane (remember experience difference from last patch?) And yes - Yummi can't use blast cones. They put W on the same 5 seconds CD. Which programmer write this code? Fire him, this is the best way. Ohh, and now enemies also **can see** this 5 seconds of vulnerability - because Yummi has an additional indicator under her hp-bar. Is this a joke? Overall here we only started. Somehow you and your ad-carry survived laning phase. And now this is it - mid game. And we have a champion with insane numbers on her skills - insane damage on Q, insane heal on E and insane stats on W. So what? You can't heal because Yummi also has insane manacosts on her skills. After several heals she becomes... AFK, literally afk. Yummi can try to damage wich Q but... It's duration is less now, so it is much harder to succeed the hit. Yummi can try to get her mana back... Nice idea, because on lvl 18 this mana is enough for one E. But not enough for anything else. After all you simple can't deattach from the ally - you get sneezed and 5 sec cd for W - death. You want to jump on different ally and save him - death with the same reasons. Teamfights are to chaotic to use her passive at all. So after laning phase Yummi has only one skill to use - her W. Once, before the fight. And sit down afk with hope. And todays champion have to many CC skills. Just a words, not more. Just a simple conclusions: Yummi can't help her adc at laning phase, cause she instakilled after a try of get shied and mana. She can't help her team cause the same reason bun in teamfights. So what we have in the end? We have a minion. Minion with mana and skills. But this minion can't use them at all - because manacosts are insane and any sneeze on this minion - its skills are blocked. I don't know whose idea this was - but it is terrible idea. At all aspects. Even with low play and win rate in latest pacth - Yummi was a champion. **And now she is a simple minion. Not more. Or an item for adc. Is this fair gameplay?**"
24,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Some easy ways to fix Yuumi, since Riot needs the help apparently.",1,e044rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/e044rs/some_easy_ways_to_fix_yuumi_since_riot_needs_the/,2019-11-23 04:26:11,"Since Riot can't figure out how to make Yuumi playable without breaking their precious fucking LC$ meta, and literally abandoned the champ... let's look at some potential reworks that maintain her playstyle but make her fair and interactive -- not that anyone gives a fuck about Yuumi, especially not Riot. So what problems do people have with her? * Her ""mindless Q spam"" that's totally guaranteed, unfair damage * Her W that makes it hard to fight her * Her E making Garen and Aatrox into gods * Her W being annoying * Her voice lines * Her W being ""broken"" * Her W ... so basically people don't like that they can't just one shot her at will, unlike most other supports. If we took away her W entirely though, she wouldn't be the same champ anymore. It'd be like replacing Neeko's ult with Veigar's -- wouldn't feel right, would it? So how do we keep her W, but give her some more risk and interaction with people? Well, that's kind of an easy one: You put more emphasis on her passive. # The Rework So, first, cut the damage on Yuumi's Q in half, or down to 60%. We'll be putting that elsewhere in her kit. **Passive:** When Yuumi lands an empowered Q or roots with her ult, it activates her passive. When activated, Yuumi's next auto will do increased damage, slow slightly (the 20% we have now on Q would be fine), and grant her the shield it currently does. This shield lasts until her passive comes off CD. When Yuumi's shield absorbs its full value, she gets some mana back. **This does NOT work if the shield expires normally, only if it breaks from damage.** When Yuumi's passive is on CD, auto attacks and spell hits will lower the CD (empowered Q hits lowering it more). **Q:** So, like I said, the damage on Yuumi's Q will go down by half. The slow would need to go up a tiny bit, maybe to 30%, so that Yuumi actually has a chance to auto for her passive. **W:** When Yuumi's host is affected by hard CC (stuns, knockups, silences, suppression, etc.), Yuumi is silenced for a portion of the CC's duration (70/60/50/40/30 - scaling with W rank), but can still cast W. **This only applies when Yuumi is attached as the CC hits. If she jumps to someone who is CCed, she will not be silenced.** **E:** There are two potential fixes to Yuumi's E. * Fix 1: Yuumi's E heals for a portion of the total healing (50% maybe), and heals the rest over time. This would make it easier to kill the target that Yuumi is attached to, and lower her burst healing a lot. * Fix 2: Yuumi gradually gets sleepy as she stays attached to a single target. As this happens, her E's potency (both healing and MS boost) will gradually weaken, down to a minimum value. This resets when she detaches for at least 1s, or attaches to a new target. **R:** Is fine. Wowie, look at that. Suddenly Yuumi has a lot more vulnerability, and it maintains her playstyle. Too bad no one cares to make Yuumi viable, and even Riot abandoned her."
25,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Is it just me, or is Senna's kit straight up OP?",1,dpcal9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/dpcal9/is_it_just_me_or_is_sennas_kit_straight_up_op/,2019-10-31 07:26:11,"Is it just me, or is Senna's kit straight up OP? (feel free to skip the rest 'cause the TLDR is above) I'm no expert but I've been looking at her kit, and I find the below --- \- Her passive alone is basically similar damage to Jhin, on top of a similar passive to Sivir, on top of a similar passive to Tristana... only at the cost of slow autos and Graves-esque slowed attack speed growth. &amp;#x200B; I did some calculations, and the damage she gets from 20% AD extra damage per auto, 10 stacks in the first four minutes of farming (without fighting the enemy at all) and not counting anything else, that's 700 gold worth of stats in bonus damage... before she's even reached level 6, or bought any items. And then it also gives her range, crit chance, even more damage than just that, including %max hp damage (1-16% based on level), and move speed, and life steal in the late game. Her passive alone seems absurd. &amp;#x200B; Her Q, it actually seems somewhat reasonable, however its range is equal to her attack range, and it reaches even beyond that (like lucian Q) - and also btw heals allies. I'm not sure how relevent this will be, but also its cast speed scales with attack speed, so you have no fear of building a runaans or RFC on her. &amp;#x200B; Then her W is a very significant stun... it may be a slow delay, but if it hits you it hits you, making it ""more than just a pin"" similar to how Zoe bubble is more than just a stun. That extra time where the pin is guaranteed to happen will force your options, a psychological CC... on top of a 1.45- 2.25 second root, which btw roots nearby champs as well. It is a slow moving projectile... But it gives her some good self peel, follow-up cc, and if she surprises you in a bush, it's hard to dodge. Oh, and did I mention, that if you try to flash it, where with a normal binding effect, your flash doesn't get accepted, and you still have it up? if you fail to flash against her ability, you'll flash. And then get pinned for over a second. &amp;#x200B; Then her E is pretty absurd - it gives her a lot of move speed, shrouds her if she isn't attacking, as well as grants a new kind of stealth to any allies who walk into it. Just on her alone, it certainly isn't nearly as annoying as akali's smoke, since she's always in the middle (so you can aim skillshots at her comfortably) but, it enables her teamates on top of this. &amp;#x200B; And then her R - it's a lux R with some heal tossed in... and uh.. it travels accross the map by the way... and the beam is an instant shot when it's done channelling, unlike other mapwide skill shots. Now... let's talk about counterplay. I mentioned a little before... \- when she autos, she stands in place for a long time, making her easy to hit with skill shots. However, this vulnerability is already made-up for in her insane range (600 to start, and scales with her stacks of mist) - not to mention her move speed bonus from autoing, which helps compensate - and not to mention that it's well worth it to wait for her high-damage autos. Overall, this counterplay is not very meaningful IMO. \- She doesn't get to abuse attack speed much. But, she also gets bonus damage to compensate, plus a second-hit a two-hit passive that does %max hp damage, plus two basic abilities that are similar damage to an auto, plus a long-range ult to help finish the job from a safe distance. (or do a lot of burst damage with w-auto-q-auto-ult) .... so, a slow attack speed is not particularly meaningful as a downside either. \- the fact that you can sometimes waste flash when trying to escape from her w certainly takes away from her counterplay, and overall she has a good kit to catch you out between her E and W... if she surprises you, she has good tools to make sure you're caught. Overall, I'd give her kit a solid 15/10... definitely very OP. permaban her on release please. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; TLDR: she's sivir, jhin, and trist in her passive, with extra %max HP damage, with a 2 second root that works like Zoe's sleep, and a Lux ult that crosses the screen, and a lucian Q which reaches as far as xerath's, and by the way those two abilities heal allies."
26,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,A Discussion on how to properly design and balance high skill expression Champions,2,d101bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d101bd/a_discussion_on_how_to_properly_design_and/,2019-09-08 04:57:28,"Hey good people of the internet. I was having a discussion on this topic with a friend a few days ago, and decided i'd post my thoughts on this topic to the internet and see what people think. I'm a game developer and a long term league player, and I wanted to discuss a consistent problem that has existed throughout the design of league champions and especially in the past few years, and how I think it should be addressed. I am in no way trying to bash or attack riot or the design team here, I think they by and large do a great job, but I think it's an interesting discussion to throw my opinions in the ring to. I'll include a TL:DR at the bottom of this for those who prefer that. As a note, i'm going to be using a few specific champions as my examples here, mostly mid-laners since I'm a mid-lane main and am most familiar with them. These arguments could and should be extended to various champions from all lanes, I'm just working with the most convenient examples for my knowledge pool. Also it will likely become obvious oveer the course of the post: I'm an Ekko main, and I consider him an example of champion design done perfectly, so i'll be referencing him a lot. &amp;#x200B; With that, let's get into our discussion. First, let's define some terms. When I refer to a champion as ""High skill-expression"", what I mean is a champion who's mechanics reward player skill disproportionately compared to other champions, which usually results in them having a higher winrate the higher up the ladder you look. Common examples of this are champions like Akali, Irelia, Lee Sin, Azir in times past, etc. This idea also extends to ""Low skill-expression"" champions, who have the reverse effect: their simplicity means that they reward player skill less then most champions. Common examples of this are champions like Amumu, Malphite, Master Yi, Dr. Mundo, etc. Now, while the easiest and primary tool to analyze a champion's results for these purposes is winrate, and I am using it to an extent, it is important to note that it is NOT the be all and end all. Champions can have winrates that aren't entirely indicative to their balance, for reasons such as low representation in a bracket leading to an improper sample, or based on the average champion mastery of players of that champion: if champion X players have on average 100 games played on it and champion Y players have on average 4 games played on it, you'd expect champion X to perform better even if they are equally balanced. We all remember one time or another when a winrate did something objective illogical, mine is a few years ago when Ahri received a straight nerf, and her winrate went up 2% because flavour of the month players moved on and the remaining Ahri players were more dedicated to the champion. &amp;#x200B; Now, there's nothing inherently wrong with a champion being high or low skill expression, in fact, it's a very good thing that there are champions at different levels of mechanical complexity, to provide different player experiences for different player types. Some people want to go for outplays with Insec-style moves, and some want to shotcall and focus on macro, and some want to focus on their positioning in a teamfight over all else, and all of that is great: we want different styles to have different options. The problem exists when a champion's design results in a skewed winrate, like many of the champions at the extreme ends of being high or low skill expression are. These champions become inherently unbalance-able, because they need to be prevented from being too strong in any given skill bracket, and as a result need to be nerfed to the point of being within reasonable bounds of their most favourable bracket, leading to them being useless in all other brackets. This happens both when balancing for pro play, or when balancing for iron play: there's a reason that 45% winrate Azir just got nerfed, or why Master Yi has several brackets where he is below 40% winrate, but it obviously presents a problem. While we all know that not every champion is going to be balanced for every elo, we want as many as possible to be useable by as many players as possible. I think most people would agree that fixing a positive outlier (where a champion's winrate is too high in a specific bracket) is more important then fixing a negative outlier (where a champion's winrate is too low in a specific bracket), but we don't want to condemn a whole pile of really interesting champions to being unusable except for by the most skilled players. &amp;#x200B; Now, how can we solve this? Well now we're going to talk about Ekko, because Ekko has all of the signs of a champion who really should have these problems. He's a high skill expression champion, not quite as extreme as champions like akali but pretty close. I think we can all agree that he strongly rewards mastery of the character, disproportionately so to most champions: 400 games on ekko are going to improve your ekko skills more then 400 amumu games will increase your amumu skills. But, Ekko doesn't have this problem at all: across basically every skill bracket, his winrate is almost identical, sitting around 50.5%. His only spikes are in iron and grandmaster, where very low representation makes me not trust the winrate as a metric. So why doesn't he have this problem? The reason is that his design focuses much more on what the experience is playing AS Ekko, it focuses heavily on the experience playing AGAINST Ekko. &amp;#x200B; Most of this discussion so far has been evaluating champions by the skill involved to play them, but that's really only 50% of the puzzle. Playing against them is just as important a variable, and there's tons of skill expression involved in that. We all know not to chase the Singed, that's part of the skill expression of facing that matchup. Every champion can be evaluated by the amount that skill is rewarded in proper execution of counterplay, and this also effects their winrate. Let's say we have champion X who is perfectly average in the skill expression of playing them, but there is very low skill expression involved in playing against them. Off the top of my head, I feel like Jayce is a fairly reasonable example of this, though i'm not a Jayce player so maybe i'm undervaluing his skill expression to play. Regardless, this champion would experience a winrate very similar to the champions like Riven would: the higher up the ladder you go, the higher their winrate would go, despite they themselves being right in the middle of the list in skill expression to play, because your opponent's counterplay to you effectively becomes less effective the higher skilled you get. &amp;#x200B; Here is where Ekko's design allows him to have a roughly equal balance across all skill tiers: while his skill expression is very high, so is the skill expression in counterplay against him. It's built into his kit in a lot of little ways: the ghost of his ultimate being visible to the enemy, his stun grenade's delay and the visual and audio queue of it's casting if you keep vision on him, his waveclear breakpoints leading to a very punishable early game if you know what to do, his vulnerability to well timed stuns, etc. This way, with both the skill expression of playing as Ekko and the skill expression of playing again Ekko scaling in relative lockstep, he gets to be a balanced, high skill champion. I think that an important lesson has been lost in a lot of the champions following Ekko: the focus has been put far more on the ""play as champion"" part then the ""playing against champion"" part, leading to characters who are very difficult to balance. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, we've talked about a lot of theory here, but how do we put it into action? Typically, when Riot attempts to address a champion who's winrate scales too much with rank, they try to nerf the aspects of the champion that they believe higher skilled players use more then lower skilled ones - they effectively try to lower the skill expression of the champion itself. I think that is the wrong approach - it doesn't tend to be very successful (leading to blanket nerfs to the champion that remove them from use entirely), and also by lowering the skill expression of that champion you somewhat ruin the point of said champion. I feel like approach needs to be focused on trying to increase the skill expression of counterplay of that champion. For instance, let's talk about Akali. Akali has a major problem with the skill expression of her counterplay: between her stealth, her several mobility spells, and her defacto healing in her intended build path, there's not a lot of ""skilled counterplay"" to the champion. Everything involving Akali is solely about Akali and whether she succeeded or failed in her attempted play, which leads to her needing repeated nerfs to put her numbers into the dumpster for her to remain balanced. I feel like if her next rework (because we all know one is coming) focuses a lot more on the counterplay to Akali, we'll end up with a more successfully designed champion. For instance, if her shroud was pink wardable, you removed her jumping back to her e inside her shroud, and she restealthed a half second slower after revealing herself, then the enemy would have a lot more windows to interact with her mechanics. These changes, which would obviously be overall nerfs for her winrate, would disproportionally nerf her effectiveness at higher point in the ladder, which would overall even out her results across all rankings, and then allow followup buffs to happen to bring her into a better state of balance across all rankings. I think a lot of champions would benefit from an analysis in this style, and would end up having healthier overall designs. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, if you read through all that, thanks for listening to my ramblings. If you want to discuss/dispute anything I said, go ahead! &amp;#x200B; TL:DR - Recent champion designs have had balance problems not inherently due to their high skill expression, but because they are too focused on the experience of playing as them and not enough on the experience of playing against them, resulting in them having very low skill expression in their counterplay. An analysis and second pass on several champions to try and improve the ability to use one's skill to counter a champion would allow those high skill expression champions to be able to be balanced across multiple rankings."
27,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Could Kalista Be Balanced By Splitting Up Her Kit?,230,d8q6gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/d8q6gj/could_kalista_be_balanced_by_splitting_up_her_kit/,2019-09-25 03:10:42,"Im someone whos played quite a bit of Kalista and always deeply enjoyed her high mechanical depth and unique E-stacking combat style. However, as we all know this skill floor coupled with her objective securing and reliance on coordination with her Oathsworn has made her incredibly strong in professional play almost since her release. Numbers nerfs in turn made her less of a pick/ban, but also reduced her solo queue playability significantly, which frustrated players like me. I believe I have a solution to the issue, which is to split her kit in half- put the oathsworn mechanics onto a new ADC with a wholly separate kit, and have the hopping and spear stacking stay on Kalista. An example of what Kalistas new kit could look like: **P: Martial Poise** Kalistas basic attacks have several unique mechanics: * Miss if she loses vision of her target * Cannot cancel their wind-up, but can select a new target within range * Make her lunge in the target direction after issuing a movement command during wind-up. * New: Movement speed slows will decrease Kalistas dash distance by their slow percent, rather than her dash rate. * New: Kalistas basic attacks no longer deal only 90% of her attack damage. Notes: With the support duo power being taken out of her W and R, Ive moved a bit back in here by giving her back the 10% attack damage scaling on autoattacks. **Q: Pierce** * Unchanged from current Pierce * Also applies Kalistas (W), Mark of the Accused **W: Mark of the Accused** Mana Cost: 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 Cooldown: 14 / 13 / 12 / 11 / 10 * New Active: Kalistas next basic attack marks its primary target with a Mark of the Accused. The Mark of the Accused lasts 6 seconds and reduces the armor of its recipient by 12 / 16 / 20 / 24 / 28%. * Whenever Kalista hits a target inflicted with a Mark of the Accused with a basic attack or (Q) Pierce, her spear splinters into smaller spears that ricochet from the target to also hit enemies in a 300 unit radius of the Marked enemy. * Each splinter spear is an exact copy of the primary attack, except that they deal only 30 / 35 / 40 / 45 / 50% of the primary attacks damage. Notes: I think Kalistas relatively short range, weakness to attack speed slows and CC, and lack of any hard CC of her own mean that she could stand to be given a little bit of AOE damage threat. **E: Rend** * New Passive: Kalistas basic attacks and (Q) Pierce lodge spears in their targets on hit. Spears store 20 / 22.5 / 25 / 27.5 / 30% of the damage dealt by the attack. * New Active: Kalista yanks the spears out of all enemies within range, dealing physical damage equal to the total of all the stored damage of the spears. Notes: I feel that the way Kalistas current (E) Rend works is fine, but a little bit non-synergistic with both crit (as two zeal items mean the AD scaling does not get very high) and on-hit (low attack damage on on-hit items mean again that the AD scaling does not get very high). Storing the damage of the attack feels a bit more intuitive to me, as well as working with any type of damage Kalista wants to build. **R: Vengeful Wrath** Mana Cost: 100 Cooldown: 90 / 80 / 70 seconds * New Active: Kalista claims vengeance against the enemies who harmed her, gaining bonus effects for 5 / 6 / 7 seconds. If Kalista takes 25% of her health in damage while this ability is active, the duration is reset. * During the duration, Kalista heals for 10-30 / 15 - 45 / 20-60% of the damage she deals, increased by the amount of health she is missing. * During the duration, Kalista deals an additional 5-15 / 7.5 - 22.5 / 10-30% damage, increased by the amount of health she is missing * Maximum bonuses are gained at 33% remaining health. Notes: *With Kalistas weaknesses now defined as a vulnerability to CC and burst, I feel giving her an ultimate that enables her to dive into the fray while keeping her vulnerable to those two things is fitting. Once again the idea behind the flat healing for damage instead of lifesteal is to enable her to build crit and on-hit both.* That seems like less of a monster for pros, right? No reliance on team coordination means her power budget doesn't have to include a free escape / hard engage for her chosen buddy. We could then take the gameplay of the bond mechanic and give it to a new champion. I am not great with lore or storytelling so Ill assume that the more deal-oriented aspects of Kalistas lore could be shaved off and built up into this new character, who well call Kaelos. Again this is just an example kit and the numbers are probably somewhat off, but here goes: # Kaelos Comparable base stats to Kalista, but with 575 attack range. **P: Bond of the Oathsworn** * Kaelos may mark an ally as his Oathsworn using the Black Spear, a starting item. Kaelos may buy a new Black Spear for 0 gold and use it to mark a new ally at any point in the game. * Kaeloss abilities have special interactions with Oathsworn allies. * If Kaelos or his Oathsworn die, the living partner gains a 10 second window during which killing an enemy champion will resurrect the dead partner with 50% health over a 3 second period. This effect has a 180 second cooldown. **Q: Spirit Spear** Mana Cost: 25 Cooldown: 6 / 5.5 / 5 / 4.5 / 4 seconds * Kaelos launches a spear 600 units in the direction of the cursor, dealing 40-220 (+90% Bonus AD) physical damage to enemies hit. This applies lifesteal, basic attack on-hit effects, and can critically strike. * A duplicate spear is launched from his Oathsworn, pointed towards the cursor as well. * Both spears can apply Kaeloss (W) *Soul-Marked* stacks from their respective source. **W: Soul-Mark / Sentinel** Passive: Kaeloss (Q) Spirit Spear, as well as he and his Oathsworns basic attacks, each apply a stack of *Soul-Marked*. When an enemy is afflicted by stacks of *Soul-Marked* from both Kaelos and his Oathsworn, they take bonus magic damage equal to 4 / 4.5 / 5 / 5.5 / 6% of their maximum health. Active: Identical to current Kalista W Active. Notes: *Similar to current Kalistas W, but with the cooldown removed to encourage more active and sustained fighting over short trade engagements. I honestly considered removing the Kalista Sentinel, but it seemed like a waste of the model and coding, so I kept it in as a little bit of utility.* **E: Wraith Walk** Mana Cost: 80 Charge Cooldown: 20 / 18 / 16 / 14 / 12 Use Cooldown: 3 * Kaelos stores a charge of Wraith Walk every 10 seconds, max 3 charges. * Upon use, Kaelos becomes invulnerable and untargetable for 1 second, during which time he gains 40 / 55 / 70 / 85 / 100% movement speed Notes: *This is probably overly strong as a mid-fight defensive and repositioning tool on an adc. I figure given his lack of general steroid in his kit, though, he could use some defensive power.* **R: Fates Call** * Passive: Kaeloss Oathsworn is healed for 33 / 67 / 100% of the healing Kaelos receives from all sources. * Active: Identical to current Kalistas (R) Fates Call Notes: *The passive is to compensate for an ADC ultimate that deals no damage. Its both a way to keep tank supports alive and a way to reward heal supports for their hard work. As far as the active goes, its the same as its always been for the current Kalista.*"

29,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Dr. Mundo Rework Concept,1,cqksxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/cqksxo/dr_mundo_rework_concept/,2019-08-15 13:54:43,"Hello! I sometimes make champion rework concepts for fun, and wanted to post mine here for you guys to enjoy/critique. This concept really amps up Mundo as THE regen champ. All numbers are pretty much guesswork; I prefer to avoid numbers to focus on concepts, but in this case I had to add some as proof of concept. Assume damage is capped against minions and monsters if it would completely break jungle Mundo. Let me know what you think! &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Passive: Do No Harm Dr.Mundo does not have his own health regen, and funnels all sources of health regen into his passive. Instead, he regenerates 2 (+ 1 per 50% health regen) (+.25% max health) per second. Paying a health cost or taking damage from champions increases this by 5% for 5 seconds, up to 10-20 times based on level. Stacks fall off once every second if not re-applied. Note: Dr.Mundo can only improve this passive with unique items, and Warmog's passive is converted into health regen while it is in effect. &amp;#x200B; Q: Cure-All Cost: 55/60/65/70/75 health Cooldown:4 seconds Dr.Mundo throws an infected cleaver, dealing 20/21.25/22.5/23.75/25% current health to the first enemy hit and slowing it by 40% for 2 seconds. Restores 40% of the health cost on hit, and 80% on kill. &amp;#x200B; W: Cleanse Plague Cost: 10/13/15/17/20 health per second Cooldown: 0 seconds (toggle) Dr.Mundo allows an IV bag filled with his own concoction to flow, raising his body temperature extremely high. Gain 10/10/15/15/20% slow resist and tenacity and deal 10/15/20/25/30 (+1% of Dr.Mundo's bonus health)(+10%AP) as magic damage around him every half-second. Cleanse Plague's effects and health cost is increased by 5% per stack of Do No Harm. &amp;#x200B; E: Surgical Prep Cost: 50/55/60/65/70 health Cooldown: 10 seconds After .5 seconds, Dr.Mundo ""preps"" nearby enemies with his own ""disinfectant,"" spraying his own blood in an arc in front of him and marking enemies hit for 4 seconds. The mark enhances his next autoattack or Cure-All that hits them. Autoattack: Deals 20-50 (+ 2.5-4.5% of Dr.Mundo's bonus health) as bonus magic damage and slows by 80% decaying over 1.5 seconds; for 3 seconds, further attacks on that target deal 50% of the bonus damage. Cure-all: Purges the mark, dealing 50/55/60/65/70% of the cleaver's damage as max health damage over .75 second. The infection will attempt to spread to nearby marked targets, dealing them 25% of the cleaver's base damage but not purging their marks. Note: He could also throw an arc of needles, making it more like Vladimir's Tides of Blood or Ashe's Volley, where you can (at least hypothetically) dodge the projectiles. &amp;#x200B; R: The Doctor Is In Cost: 25% current health on cast + 1 health per second Cooldown:110/100/90 seconds Passive: Do No Harm is increased by 1/5/8 Dr.Mundo gains 15/25/35% bonus movement speed, immunity to grievous wounds, and boosts his passive by 1000% for 10 seconds. &amp;#x200B; My thoughts: Rito officially passed Dr.Mundo over for a champ update recently, but I actually don't think he's too far off, mostly needing a visual update moreso than anything. I re-named his abilities because, well, he's a ""Doctor"", after all! He really and truly does believe that he's saving people. ""Masochism"" and ""Adrenaline Rush"" are too big words for him to even say, let alone comprehend. Gameplay-wise, they're currently pushing Mundo as the ""anti-mage"" tank with his bonus magic resist, but I don't think that's a totally accurate depiction of his ideal fantasy. In my opinion, Dr.Mundo should be the king of persevering against sustained damage, no matter the source. This rework concept amps up his regen aspect to the max; in return, Mundo becomes much more susceptible to burst damage, as his passive takes time and multiple hits to fully activate. If he's not focused though, Mundo can quickly reach insane regen, becoming a tanky monstrosity that just...won't...die! Benchmarks for healing: Assuming 4000 health at level 18, Mundo in his live state regens 3.3-16 health per second when including his passive. Level 6-Rework, with Crystalline Bracer and Rejuv Bead: 8.4 per second (currently 5) Level 11- Rework, with Warmogs, Spirit Visage, and Rejuv Bead: 20 per second (currently 11) Level 16- Rework, with 4000 health and 400% health regen: 28 per second (currently 16) As noted, these numbers may be super off, they're just there to provide an example baseline. In particular I'm okay with letting him have crazy late game health regen so he really acts fulfills the role of a carry juggernaut-tank. Warmogs's super heal gets funneled in to his passive, this is intentionally toned down so Mundo has some periods of vulnerability. Yes, it would probably let you keep Cleanse Plague permanently on, but only out of combat so I think that's okay. Hope you enjoyed, and thanks for reading!"
30,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Why should Yorick's pets (Including Maiden) take 50% less damage from AoE?,0,czyc2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/czyc2p/why_should_yoricks_pets_including_maiden_take_50/,2019-09-05 19:11:10,"It doesn't make sense, given the type of champion he is. If he were squishy, then it would be reasonable for his pets to make up for the defense he himself lacked. But he's not. He's a juggernaut. So he can stay around in a fight and because of his hard pushing style will usually have graves ready to refresh them. The main argument is that they die to one auto-attack, but that falls short. Anyone who can kill the minions quickly with autos is forced to use up valuable time that should be possible to use against the actual champion. And there's the fact the Maiden doesn't have any sort of vulnerability to auto-attacks, so there's no excuse at all for her to have that defense. On top of which, he can stay safely outside of his wall and you'll be forced to use up another 2-4 autos on it before you're allowed to fight him. They already provide plenty of safety with the fact they stick right on top of you and can body-block a lot of the ranged abilities that normally should be strong against immobile champions, but to also be able to mostly ignore AoE abilities is overkill. That's why, for some time even before the Maiden buff, he's been far, far stronger against champions he counters than champions that counter him are against him. Even among champions with some kind of advantage, he doesn't struggle simply because you can't reliably focus on him while 5 pets and his wall are on you. Champions who should have an advantage against him, in exchange for being squishier at top laner, simply don't because the minions have defense that they shouldn't. I'd be all for removing the one-AA mechanic if it means making them interact fairly with AoE."

32,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Yuumi nerfs and thoughts,1,cenktt,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/cenktt/yuumi_nerfs_and_thoughts/,2019-07-18 14:09:46,"**TL;DR: The nerfs Yuumi got only promotes quasi-Soraka playstyle and bring uninteractive laning phase. I suggest changes to promote Yuumi's vulnerability.** To preface my complaint, I want to say that at least in my region (Korea), she was either picked or banned almost every game, so the nerf was bound to happen regardless of her performance in-game. I have played 40+ games on her after release and short changes on relatively high elo [(op.gg link for proof)](URL and I feel like the way Riot approached nerfing her was not healthy for the Yuumi player and the opponent. # Here is the way Riot changed her and what I think: 1. **PASSIVE - less shield and no mana restore** This just punishes riskier plays Yuumi do during laning phase and provides less opportunity for opponents to tackle on Yuumi when she's off the target. Yuumi's shield usually get taken off trying to proc the passive as ADC or support tries to auto back. All this promotes is Yuumi to just stay on her partner the whole time during laning phase and that does not make the lane more interactive. 2. **Q - 10 less damage and 15 more mana cost across all ranks. +0.05 AP scaling to compensate.** Riot tried to decrease the free poke Yuumi did. In combination of deleting mana restore passive, this is a big hit on Yuumi. Because of the mana cost, Yuumi will likely raise E early on since she cannot afford to spam Q as much as before. Would that make the lane more fun? No, she just replaced Soraka. At least, you can target soraka but you literally can't target Yuumi. Less interactive lane. 3. **E - +30% base heal scaling and 30 less mana cost across all ranks.** Yeah. Soraka that does not lose HP while healing others for only 30 mana at rank 1, 70 at rank 5. IN CONCLUSION, all Riot accomplished with these Yuumi changes is pushing Yuumi players to play quasi-Soraka and have (at least) not-so-oppressive but uninteractive laning phase. I don't think neither Yuumi players or opponents want that to happen. # Here are my list of suggestions and my rationale behind it: 1. **STATS - Nerf her base mana regen and rebalance her mana regen growth to compensate for it** This would incentivize Yuumi's to proc mana restore from passive more aggressively and have Yuumi off the partner more frequently. Consequentially, opponents would be able to punish Yuumi when trying to take advantage. 2. **Q - Nerf the turn rate or projectile speed** Nerfing turn rate or speed of the projectile would give opponents more opportunity to react and provide feeling of interactivity during laning phase. 3. **W - Nerf the speed** Make her more vulnerable while attaching to a partner, giving opponents more time to react and CC her out. 4. **W - Change CD mechanics** Right now, her W goes on cooldown at the first usage of W, meaning opponents do not have a clear idea when her W is on cooldown or off cooldown. You can go two ways about this. Have W cooldown start when she gets off the partner so that she is more open to catches when she's off (this issue would be resolved with static cooldown going down to 0 seconds at later level). OR, W has respective cooldowns on individuals after she departs from the partner like Yasuo's dash. Both would accomplish the same effect during laning phase since well... you only have ADC to stick to. This change would give clear timing window for opponents to utilize if Yuumi does not manage it properly."
33,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Thoughts on Kayle changes + suggestions,8,ck7qx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/ck7qx2/thoughts_on_kayle_changes_suggestions/,2019-07-31 22:19:10,"Disclaimer: This post is written by someone who played Kayle before and after the rework, but enjoys the new one more. It is ~~possibly~~ almost definitely biased. I know the changes haven't even hit the PBE yet and might never make it out of it, but with all the discussion about Kayle recently, I thought it might be a good time to give my 2 cents on the subject. **What I like:** 1. Base stat buffs: both the AS and the armor buffs make it easier and less suicidal to fight early on, without allowing her to waltz into lane and start autoing people to death. However I think compensation nerfs to her stat growth might be necessary. 2. Mana refund on Q: probably my favourite change. Gives her something interesting to do in lane besides trying to proc Klepto and last hit, and rewards her for hitting skillshots (well, one skillshot at least). **What I don't like:** 1. Swapping the AOE waves and ranged attacks: this not only dilutes Kayle's niche as a melee champion that scales into a ranged carry (because level 7 is too soon to start *scaling*) it also makes it much harder to clear minion waves, forcing her to use her abilities to push. It also makes fighting a lot more boring and less interactive, as it limits her options to ""Stay away from your opponent and poke them"". Currently, once Kayle hits level 6 she can often win trades and skirmishes thanks to her ultimate and her fire waves, if she plays her cards right or capitalizes on an enemy's mistake. 2. Removing the true damage from her waves. I 100% agree that Kayle's true damage lategame is overwhelming. But simply deleting it makes it much harder for her to deal with tanks consistently late game, which was one of her strengths before the rework. I think lowering the numbers on her fire waves late game and keeping the true damage will allow her to remain a threat to tanks while still lowering her overall DPS. **What I suggest:** Stats: 1. Increase base stats to make trading easier at earlier levels. 2. Reduce her stat growth to keep her reliant on items. Passive: 1. Reduce the AD and AP scalings on her fire waves. Keep the true damage. 2. Keep the fire waves and level 6 and the range at level 11. Reduce her range to 525, forcing her to rely on her W and ult to stay safe. 3. Reduce the attack speed bonus she gets at level 11 from her passive, so she isn't as strong without items. Q: 1. Mana refund on champion hit. See above why I think this is a good change. R: 1. Increase the cooldown of her ult at later ranks. One of Kayle's biggest strengths in the late game is how she is a Marksman/Enchanter hybrid. In my view this makes her very safe as she can nullify assassins, who are supposed to counter marksmen, with her ult. Therefore, increasing the cooldown will give Kayle longer windows of vulnerability that her opponents can exploit in the late game."
34,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"As long as Akali's shroud and passive exist the way it is, Akali will never be balanced and will remain pick/ban in high elo and pro play",0,cm8784,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/cm8784/as_long_as_akalis_shroud_and_passive_exist_the/,2019-08-05 18:10:53,"Despite all the heavy nerfs to akali she is still a highly contested pick in top levels of play even now and remains frustrating to play against everywhere else, Akali is quite literally the perfect assasin and has little counterplay other than hoping the akali is bad. The biggest offenders in my opinion as to why she remains strong is because of her passive and her shroud. Her passive lets her get around a common weakness of assasins, that is their general lack of sustained damage. She is able to chip away at opponents quite hard combined with the instantaneous poke on q and remain in the thick of a fight with the amazing safety provided with her shroud, and can constantly pump out damage throughout with little consequence, but her burst is not low enough to warrant this. This is what primarily makes her so problematic in my opinion as she has no real window of downtime other than her cooldown on shroud, so she cannot be dealt with because of how her kit always gives her another option to fight back and win. This is why if played well she is unstoppable, because there is simply no way to exploit any vulnerability on her, because quite frankly she doesn't have any. The key here is that she always has a choice in the matter. She is almost never caught out without any way to defend herself, so she can dictate the lane and fights and have the kind of control over the lane that a mage would have with their range with none of the weaknesses (lack of mobility, heavy mana costs etc.) Her shroud is simply too good of an ability as its use is so incredibly flexible, it is a strong set up tool for engages, it is a strong defensive tool for dodging and escaping, and while people may say that she might have to be forced to choose how to use it, in reality it preforms all of those functions at once. Her shroud is also what enables her to lane so well against mages and match ups with better range than her that are so common in high elo, it almost completely removes any chance for the opposition to retaliate if she chooses to fight. Another point to make is that it's not just that her kit is flexible, Akali herself is flexible and its the same problem with aatrox where often they can be safely blind picked and then flexes into other roles where they are able to perform well and that is so helpful for drafts and team compositions. Because her kit allows her to fight and compete with so many different champions, she is so useful as a catch all blind pick and thats why her pick rate is so high. All this combines to make an exciting but highly problematic champion who is simply too good when played perfectly."
35,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,The Yummi Problem - A busted breakdown,1,c77j7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/c77j7r/the_yummi_problem_a_busted_breakdown/,2019-06-30 11:47:40,"Hey Folks, &amp;#x200B; As someone that has now played a significant amount of games against the dam cat, i think i've come to some conclusions as to why the Cat is generally bad for the game as a whole. &amp;#x200B; My issues: * Lack of Counter Play - There's not much you can do against Yummi outside of completely crushing them in lane, and killing her duo over and over again. This means you're forced to play mega aggressive in order to even have a chance to win lane. However, should you miss an opportunity her healing becomes problematic and you lose super hard. Since you are forced to target one champ they can offset this strategy by choosing longer range champs(ezreal/caitlyn), or champs with get away mechanics to solidify early game victory with ease. Her playstyle is very similar to Janna however, she's by far superior as Janna only offers temp shields which leaves opponents with windows of opportunity, yummi can completely eliminate that window with a good duo with no effort on their part. * Limited Moments of Vulnerability - As with many of the healers in the game, they come with the massive risk of being focused in large team fights. Yummi is the only support in game that offers massive CC/Healing without the inherent risk of positioning that comes with playing a squishy support. This problem is made worse by her ""safe spot"" playstyle which i go into more depth below. * Safespot Playstyle - There's clear champs Yummi synergiezes with such as S-Tier range champions such as Caitlyn/Ezreal. It's pretty simple for most yummis to simply stay on this backline and just use your crazy range/cc to help from the backline while ensuring your adc stays super safe. But there's also a bonus yummis get to act as engagers in the case that your tanks are ahead and they pull this off by simply latching onto them to give them additional healing/cc the entire team from the front line with no risk to yourself. (if you've ever been a super fed tank, there's already a very slim chance for them to kill u, with yummi that chance becomes 0). Which basically means you have two unkillable champs with crazy cc since yummi is invulnerable while attached. * Insane Range - She can sit in the very back line and still throw abilities, and get off her massive ult to hit the entire battlefield. She is not incentivized to jump enough, and simply needs to stay attached to the carry come late game, so she's essentially unkillable and it forces teams to play in the optimal support style. Which makes her more powerful in solo queue, since with every other support you always have the problem of them leaving their carries and being out of position, with yummi you never have this problem. And as an added boonus, if your carry is out of position she has a get out of jail free card thanks to yummi tagging along. * Sustain Overload - The heals are a bit much i've seen sorakas do less healing than this champ, however the engage, cc, heals all together is just too much. I may be a bit biased here as I think healing in general in league is a little busted, it really snowballs the game when one team can recover to full health quickly while the others remain at 25% health. I think it kind of sucks because it forces everyone to build healing items or you just lose if you don't Ace them everytime, for me this is more of a healing problem overall that needs to be fixed. Even champs with 0 life steal, can take a single rune and have creazy lifesteal capability, this use to be an itemization choice but they have decided to build it into every champ which i find less satisfying. &amp;#x200B; Suggestions: * Open more windows of opportunity. There's incentives for her to jump on/off champions, but from what ive seen its not necessary. I'd like to see her be forced to jump on/off champs more frequently and for that off time to not be such a short duration. Maybe an ability charging meter, where the more time she spends off a champion the more abilities she's able to use while attached? * Swap healing to sheilds, i hate healing when i can't kill the healer. Shields feel more appropriate if i can't get to the source, lets my chip damage matter. At some point the other adc will have enough life steal anyways to remain at full health so why let yummi let the adc expediate that time. Give me more windows to attack. * Cut the range, The ult cc is basically an entire lane and wipes any banshees off champs. I'd cut this down to make it less of an engage tool since I feel like she's on the backline 90% of the time and can still use her ult efficiently it would be nice to force her to move into a more risky position to acctually get an ult off. It s just too safe right now and she can hit everything. * Give players a way to know when she can jump to a champion. If there's someone around she can jump to, there should be some kind of tell. This way you don't try to all in the dam cat and waste everything trying to kill their full soul stealer support. * Knock the cat off. Please let us knock yummi off the champ with CC. It will really make choosing position on the cat much more important, and give us a way to stop the healing. &amp;#x200B; Anyways, this is my thoughts havn't been playing much since the game is basically full toxic smurfs/win traders lately, but from the 20 or so games ive played against good yummis into these are my thoughts."

Especially ahri's, cass's and poppy's. That being said, Almost every change on the list is an indirect ivern nerf other than the Akali and leona changes. &amp;#x200B; Let's start with the biggest of the nerfs and the one I'm most concerned about. *""Blitzcrank R and* ***Renekton W destroy shields on the target before dealing damage (anti powerful shield or shield stacking niche)****.""* &amp;#x200B; I understand this is to make renekton an even stronger pick in lane against champs like riven, rumble, shen etc, but this only makes it so that ivern has almost 0 ganking potential against renekton before level 6. This also makes blitzcrank conditionally stronger than ivern after level 6 which I don't think is a huge problem (I think blitzcrank being stronger against heal and shield enchanters is a good thing since that's what he's supposed to be good at, sorry ivern) &amp;#x200B; The next nerf is * Ahri charm stops dashes in progress (anti mobility niche) * and also Cassiopeia and Poppy have their anti mobility effects buffed, with no minimum cast range on Cass W and **Poppy W grounding+slowing enemies it stops mid dash** &amp;#x200B; even though I full-heartedly agree that the current way mobility or dashes interact with CC needs to be updated (As of now, most CC abilities only CC the champ after the dash has been completed, which many times negates the purpose of the CC) It's another indirect nerf. Ivern's Q, which allows him and his teammates to zoom to the person he roots, is counted as a dash. Ivern's only escape ability is his q which allows him to dash to jungle creatures, enemy minions or enemy champions. &amp;#x200B; The next nerf is ""Kat R and Kled Q have a stronger form of Grievous Wounds at 60% reduction (anti sustain niche)"" Don't really need to say much here, One of ivern's main build paths is Athene's, redemption and then into ardent censor. I'm happy kat and kled are getting some love but again, it tones down ivern's effectiveness into those champs. &amp;#x200B; I'm not against champions being given buffs that are indirect nerfs to ivern; there will always be champions that counter another in one way shape or form. I also understand since he's not a very popular that he's sometimes not brought into consideration when they're balancing certain aspects of the game, but the fact that these changes are all happening at once is kind of scary.

38,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,I took a stab at overhauling Akali's kit,3,bviuot,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bviuot/i_took_a_stab_at_overhauling_akalis_kit/,2019-06-01 18:59:56,"I like theorycrafting kit changes in my spare time and I really enjoy playing reworked Akali, so I spent some time coming up with changes to her kit since she's been such a balance problem ever since her rework. In my opinion, there are a couple fundamental issues with Akali that contribute to her wide skill gap: **1. Akali's current mechanics are not very accessible.** Akali's kit has a lot going on. Efficient use of her passive requires you to move very specifically, which is also counter-intuitive movement for a lot of players. Her E has multiple interactions in her kit, but it's hard to use them all effectively. There's 3 different timers in her kit that the player needs to keep track of (W duration, E recast window and R recast window), sometimes simultaneously. Her skillshots are deceptively hard to hit, especially E. Overall, her kit isn't very forgivable unless you're intimately familiar with it. **2. Akali is very reliable when mastered, which means that when she's balanced she needs to be executed near perfectly.** Akali has a lot of tools to pick fights on her terms, which makes her perfect for a professional environment. Once she's in range of you, her main damage sources in Q and passive are near undodgeable. She's a target agnostic assassin, which basically means she can switch her targets very easily (Jatt mentioned this on stream once). She's also really safe and doesn't need to take risks to find success; she doesn't even need to use her basic dash ability (E) to initiate fights or secure most kills. Since she has such a high amount of reliable agency as an assassin as well as good teamfighting ability, her power level needs to be low so she doesn't take over pro play. However, this means that her power is relatively awful in uncoordinated play. So, with these issues in mind, I tried my hand at overhauling Akali's kit so it's more solo queue friendly and not as powerful in pro play. Let me know what you think! _________________________________ **Passive - Assassin's Mark: Remove directional movespeed, add smaller amount of movespeed inside the ring. Remove energy restoration.** Aimed at making the passive movespeed functionality more accessible. Also, removing the movespeed toward enemies means Akali players need to commit more if they want to land their empowered auto. Removing the passive energy restoration limits Akali's ability to go for extended trades, since she is an assassin after all. Don't worry though, she still has a window where she can flex her ""skirmisher"" muscles (see W). **Q - Five Point Strike: Change energy cost to 120-60 from 100-80.** Raising the energy cost at earlier ranks increases Akali's windows of vulnerability in lane, while lowering the energy cost at later ranks still lets her spam it as her main damage source in the mid and late game, especially now that her method of restoring energy is changed a bit (again, see W). **W - Twilight Shroud: Remove flat energy restoration, add tripled energy restoration per second while active. Reduce duration to a flat 6 seconds instead of 7-9. Increase cooldown to a flat 24 seconds, starts on cast (time between shrouds is 18 seconds).** Casting shroud won't give Akali flat energy anymore. Instead, it will triple her energy restoration while the shroud is active, from 10/sec to 30/sec. Overall, Akali will receive 120 energy over 6 seconds, which equals 1 extra cast of Q in the early game and 2 extra casts in the mid to late game. 7-9 seconds is a long time to have shroud on the field, and making it scale with ranks only incentivizes Akali to max it second instead of E. Flattening shrouds scaling and cooldown makes it a one-point wonder, meaning that solo-queue Akalis can invest more points into E for the damage and engage potential. **E - Shuriken Flip: Increase energy cost to 45 from 30. Decrease cooldown to 10-8 from 16-10. Increase missile speed and range.** These changes basically improve Akali's target access from her basic abilities so she doesn't have to play around her ultimate. This helps solo-queue a lot more than pro play, since yolo queue players are always looking to fight whereas pro players tend to play it safe. The energy cost is raised a bit to compensate for the power bump. **R - Perfect Execution: Remove R1. Add a very small cast time (less than 0.25 seconds). Add reset on takedowns that happen within 3 seconds of casting (reset must be used within X seconds).** Removing R1 of this ability solves a lot of problems. First, it reduces Akali's *reliable, on-demand* target access, which is really important for pro play but less so for solo-queue, especially with the E changes. Second, it reduces Akali's safety, since she has one less dash to escape with. Third, it removes the ""timer"" aspect of Akali's ult, which makes it easier to use for players unfamiliar with her kit. Fourth, it makes it possible to add a ""takedown reset"" to the ultimate so that Akali actually has a way to tower dive - finish off the enemy within 3 seconds of using the ult, and use the reset to escape tower range. (Currently, Akali only gets one reset even if she kills another person with the second use. I debated whether the ult should reset off of reset uses, but I figured that would step on Pyke's toes too much. Regardless, it's an option that can be added if desired.) Adding the very small cast time gives a bit more counterplay to Akali's opponents, since Akali having a ready available near-instant execute dash sounds very scary. ______________________________ So that's it! Let me know if you like it, or if there's anything you think should be changed or improved."
39,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Yuumi needs a nerf, but the W nerf is not the way to go. How about one of these nerfs?",0,bwv5vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bwv5vv/yuumi_needs_a_nerf_but_the_w_nerf_is_not_the_way/,2019-06-05 08:38:55,"(For context, I have almost 300 games on Yuumi. I know how she works, and what she's too good / bad at.) So, high ELO people complain that she's too safe, and that her Q isn't easily avoided, while low ELO people complain she's AFK all the time and doesn't do anything. The W nerf (where all CC cancels it) is going to make both people upset, because it's going to force her to be AFK even more. Instead of that, I have a few other ideas. * Revert the Q hotfix. It does too much damage, and really doesn't need to do as much as it does. * Make her Q track the mouse a little less accurately. It's easy to dodge if you play Yuumi, but if you don't play her, you won't know the angles it can turn at. So make it turn a little less sharply (or make the hitbox smaller), and people could actually dodge it. * Make it so that, if the person she's attached to dies, her W goes on a short CD (I'm thinking 3/2/1s that scales based on the CD of her W going down) -- this gives her windows of vulnerability if she fucks up, or if she tries to save someone and can't. I feel like these nerfs would make high ELO people happy without gutting the champ, but wouldn't overnerf it for low ELO. Yuumi is a higher skillcap champ despite what people would have you believe, so a steep mastery curve is kind of expected. A lot of low ELO people play her as an AFK item, and that's why her winrate is so much lower down there. In high ELO, people understand she needs to be more active, and her teams actually use her kit well. Just please don't gut Yuumi. Almost every new champ that isn't named Pyke or Kai'sa lost a good portion of their kits, I don't want to see it happen to Yuumi too. : /"
40,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,How to make Yuumi less broken + insights,0,bx4cii,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/bx4cii/how_to_make_yuumi_less_broken_insights/,2019-06-06 02:10:19,"Hello everyone, So I have noticed a lot of people are dissatisfied with the current Yuumi and saying she's 'broken', which so far I've only seen used as an excuse to refrain from posting properly formed arguments with full sound logic, but I won't go into that right now. The reason I am writing this, however, is because I want to actually be able to play Yuumi and not have her be perma-banned. So instead of making her useless I wanted to make my voice heard by offering another way to increase Counter play options. The biggest complaint people have is that she is untargetable when attached, which would offer no counterplay. To elaborate, Licorice did an interview in which he compared Yuumi to Soraka: ""Soraka is really annoying, like healing, you can't kill anyone, but you just kill the Soraka you know? But Yuumi is inside the champion so that isn't really an option"". However, Yuumi is not Soraka in terms of healing. Soraka has much more Heal power than Yuumi does, and she isn't bound by anyone as to who to heal. Not to mention her ultimate, which is global and heals everyone almost back to full. And it's not like she's just gonna roll over and die. You have an AOE silence zone, movement speed buffs, slows and your own heals and not to mention your teammates to peel for you. So you're still going to need to invest a lot into killing the champion. But to go back to what Licorice said, it is true, having a champion that is completely invulnerable that can heal and kite for someone is not really balanced. However, there is a weakness. For Yuumi to work effectively she has to jump out and give shields. Otherwise, she won't have enough heal power as she can only cast her E (Zoomies) twice with a relatively long CD to cast again. She needs to buy time to get that E again, so she has to jump out, which is where you can kill her with any spell due to her insanely bad base stats. Additionally, Yuumi's host isn't invulnerable either. That host is going to die with the same investment you would put into killing a Soraka, but then Yuumi can still jump to another. This is another option of counter-play and one I would like to see changed so that it would be easier to counter, but I'll go into that later. When she jumps she is vulnerable to anything. You can cc her, which would make her drop to the ground and an easy to pick up kill, due to having 0 defenses and almost no hp. Or you could pressure the host with aoe spells, which makes it impossible for Yuumi to jump out, since any AOE spell from a carry will instantly kill her. Also it is not like Yuumi's jumps aren't easy to read. If you think it isn't then you should consider playing the character yourself, as that always provides a lot of insight. Which brings me to my next point, all this complaining about Yuumi is mostly out of ignorance. Licorice said in that interview that he hadn't even played the champion. Hell, he doesn't even know her abilities well. Then how do you expect to counter something? Information offers power, and if you haven't taken that power you shouldn't make statements like saying something is broken, which goes back to the thing I said about 'broken' being used as a excuse to dodge giving proper arguments. So, Yuumi has strengths, but unlike popular belief there are also counter-play options which fit with her power level. Yuumi isn't as strong as Soraka in terms of heal power, but in return she gets more safety, which made riot increase her vulnerability when not on a host. However, the counter-play has a limited time window and jumping to another ally is super easy when right next to each other, in contrast to the longer range ones, which are super easy to counter. So, this made me think and come to the conclusion that if they want to increase counter-play, which they should, they should focus on this very mechanic of jumping to one another. My suggestion for this is something along the line of: Decrease the flying to another host speed for close ranges and have it accelerate over distance (i.e when jumping to a fast hecarim you won't still be flying to him untill you reach the enemy fountain"". There could be variations of this, but this is something I would like to see happen instead of nerfing her stats and cooldowns and making her completely useless again. I think her power level is good the way it is for the shield, healing and ult, but the only things I could see changed is the Q cooldown by a bit and something with her attach mechanic, which, as mentioned, would be something along the lines of toying with speed and/or having a small jump delay to telegraph what Yuumi is doing, which could be accompanied by a new little animation. But please don't touch her healing (or W late-game cooldown by too much. The only thing I would see as possible would be to put a cd on it when canceled, which would be like 1- 2 seconds. Definitely don't make it too long, since at that point you might as well just have her be killed on cancellation (which she pretty much already is). Lastly, I'd like to offer one last insight that many people are not aware of. Yuumi has a mechanic where if she jumps on someone the cooldown will start to tick. However, this means that if she jumps on someone, she can't jump off for 10 seconds or she won't have the option to safely go to her host again, which is definitely bad for her. Especially so if she hasn't procced her shield yet. So to get to my point. If Yuumi jumps on her host without the shield proc she won't be able to give that shield for another 10 seconds, which is a huge part of Yuumi's defensive capabilities. Meaning that there is oppertunity to get a good trade or an all in easy kill. This of course depends on the other champions, but is something that I would consider to be a considerable weakness. To summarize, people think Yuumi has no counter-play, but she does. However, the counter-play windows are too short for its significance, which needs to change. I offered the idea of decreasing close range jump speed and increasing longer ones or try telegraphing that she's about to jump. Focus on the counter-play more rather than nerfing her stats. Also a lot of the lack of counter-play isn't due to the champion itself, but due to the ignorance of many players, who don't know her stats or maybe even abilities, and the saying ""information is power"" isn't just there for show. I hope that I have done a decent job at giving everyone more insight on the matter, and hopefully we can now have a proper and civilized discussion rather than just bashing on her, because she's 'broken', while dodging full logically sound argumentation. To make a statement about something you at least need to have some knowledge about the matter. Saying something is 'broken' without even understanding the champion is ridiculous.

That is, some champions have way too much agency against their opponents because they don't have clear weaknesses any more. To summarize: &gt; Definition of the problem insufficient weaknesses -&gt; when a champion played optimally invalidates options for their opponents to proactively beat them or defend against their attacks, effectively leaving them with no clear vulnerability. &gt;We have had a number of champions that have crossed this line over the years (Leblanc, Vladimir, Azir) and some recent examples (Irelia, Aatrox, Akali). RiotScruffy then listed 11 common tools that were problematic if more than 1 or 2 were in a champion's kit. I realize that RiotScruffy was mostly writing about new and reworked champions, but... Since then, Riot has gone on to make the game dominated by champions that don't have sufficient weaknesses and grab all the agency from their opponents. In other words, they did exactly what they said they were going to watch out for. Consider Vayne. Historically she has had a clear weakness - a bad early game. Now she spikes so early that she quickly gets to the point where she gets all the agency and most of her opponents have to just pray that she misplays (which to be fair, happens a lot in low ELO). Riven is in a similar category. Riven has always been strong when ahead, but now she seems to win lane way too often, giving her an overwhelming midgame. Or we can have Zed, a mobile, manaless champion that pushes well and has extreme damage at level 6. Ever been a level 5 jungler who let a level 6 Zed get within half a screen of you? Your agency gets reduced to how you are going to spend your gold while gray-screened. Riot has responded to complaints about these champions by arguing that they might not be completely overpowered based on some play stats. But that's not really the argument. These champion don't have sufficient weaknesses (as RiotScruffy wrote about) while still being very strong numbers wise. That's a huge problem. I wish that Riot would pay more attention to some of their own design posts."

Even though akali's ban rate is one of the biggest, her winrate during the last patch was about 45%-48%. Her winrate is now at 43%. With the W nerf she is now much more vulnerable as her extended duration was cut short for a third of the original time, this during the whole game. The cooldown was also increased by 4 seconds at lvl 1, which means she now has a 25 second window of doing absolutely nothing in lane as she has no way to maintain energy during any sort of trade, making her biggest damage output in a quick trade 2Q instead of potentially 3. If a trade is made using her W, she now has a 25 second window, during laning phase, of vulnerability. I know she has been hated for a long time because her w has no way of counterplay, but I always though that wasn't true as you should always try fighting out of it. At the end of it all, I just don't want a champ with 46% wr getting nerfed to the ground."

I think its design is really odd and confusing. I don't think it should be *removed* per se, but within the rest of his kit, it's oddly hilarious to me. So, remember when Veigar and Lissandra had mana-sustain passives and how bad they were? The reason why mana sustain passives aren't fondly looked at is because they tend to be deceptively useless. A significant weakness given to mages early on is high mana costs, because if they had too much mana to bombard their enemy with, they'd probably be a lot stronger and overpowered. The purpose of Veigar and Lissandra's previous passives (flat mana regen and a mana-free ability every flat cooldown [ignoring Veigar's even-older passive where he used to steal enemy AP]) is basically intended to give them a unique advantage over others through that... except that just makes them stronger and more unfair to other mages, and because mana regen and cooldowns are flat stats, their baseline stats can be nerfed. Mana sustain passives are like the equivalent of being in a hot car and turning the air-conditioning on, but when it becomes too cold, instead of turning it down, you additionally turn the heating on. Sure, it might balance itself out, but it also negates an artificial problem, and now you wasted a lot of resources for no reason -- in League's case, an actual passive that benefits the champ and gives a unique power. And then Veigar and Lissandra got completely new passives that actually did something, and people rejoiced. Within the context of Xerath as a champion, I understand what it does and why it's there: he's a very long-range burst mage whose strength is from dealing damage from afar, and a weakness is being in close range, as well as high mana costs, especially early on. Xerath's passive basically encourages him to get in auto-attack range and rewards him if he lands one to proc his passive and give him a burst of mana, and it's also a decently clear window of vulnerability for his enemy to punish him. In comparison to Veigar and Liss' mana sustain passives, Xerath's is a lot more interactive than simple stats where basically all you can do is wait or buy CDR to wait up to 40% less time. It actively incentivizes manual play between yourself and the enemy, and it makes Xerath less binary beyond ""blasting the enemy from afar all the time until you run out of mana and need to base, or you don't,"" which I think is good game design on paper. However, at the same time, I just realized: *""Wait, so this passive only exists to give him a weakness?""* I'm trying to think of another passive in the game that essentially exists to enforce living dangerously in the way Xerath's does for little in return. There are some passives like Irelia's or Jax's that encourage aggression in a potentially dangerous situation, but I feel that bonus attack speed and mixed damage have a lot more dimensionality in making or breaking a trade/fight over just flat mana that decides whether you're allowed to use an ability or not. Especially since in the end, mana and mana regen are base stats that can be used to nullify its purpose. I'm not trying to say Xerath is unbalanced or anything or that the passive should be replaced with something else, because he is decently functional as is; I just think it's really strange with how his kit is constructed in a way that rather than having a passive that gives him a true unique power, it just enforces putting him in a dangerous situation just to be fair."

This is in no way a buff to any ability but it does offer more creative tools to use as neeko while still requiring skill to act in the manner of these companions to pull off the ruse. obviously this comes with some problems with magical attaching lines as with yorick but that can be either added or remain as is. it might be easiest to implement as a drop down change menu on those specific champion icons. another use of these champion drop down menus would be the ability to choose which form you take as those transforming champions. 
46,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,A lengthy breakdown and defense of Kayle and Morgana's new characterizations and their tragic and messed-up relationship,1,at6myd,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/at6myd/a_lengthy_breakdown_and_defense_of_kayle_and/,2019-02-22 05:34:28," # Intro: So there's been a bit of debate around here about Kayle and Morg's new lore, and basically the general understanding going around now is that ""Morg is a good person now, she's not evil and we all like her now, but Kayle's now a mean knight templar; a bad guy who only looks like a good person and that's stuff"", the latter of which has branched out in a bunch of further varying reactions ranging from ""eh, it's alright"" to ""this Kayle sucks now"" to more ""rito pls, fire your writing department"" because it's such a sharp departure from her original and complex ""an eye for an eye"" angel lady justice person. Because the lore hasn't been out for more than a week and not everybody has properly experienced the entire character package (biography, in-game dialogue, supplementary color stories that aren't out yet at time of this writing), I'm willing to overlook this and assume that a lot of the more antagonistic reactions comes from a knee-jerk reaction of people not having the time to properly absorb and digest we have now and what they imply yet, and that in time, people will start to better ""get"" it and stop talking about it (except for the people who don't and vocalize their animosity, because internet). However, if I can just entertain these reactions for a post, I do wanna talk about my findings through their biographies and in-game dialogue so far, and in turn why I personally think Kayle and Morgana's current characterizations are actually really compelling and great, and especially a lot more nuanced than most people are giving them credit for (so nuanced that it requires A LOT of context and discussion to make comprehensible). I might sound pretentious when I think that many people don't quite ""get"" it , but this is just my analysis and I hope that from the perspective of someone who likes it and finds it complex, you MIGHT change your mind. And if it doesn't, hopefully time will do it for you, but here it goes: --- #Getting Straight What Actually Happens Before I break down the subtext, let's actually agree on what their lore actually is and get the record straight of what's happening, because a lot of problems many people seem to be having come from misunderstandings of the actual canon, not helped by how both sides of this story are split in two bios. Sources to follow along with: [Morgana's biography](URL [Kayle's biography](URL (no tl;drs, because that misses the point of having this summary) Once upon a time during the Rune Wars, a couple, Mihira and Kilam, headed to scale Mount Targon for divine power to protect their tribe, and Mihira (who was already pregnant) became one with the powerful Aspect of Justice. After this, Morgana and Kayle were born and Mihira became a force to be reckoned with, but became so increasingly warlike and fearsome that dad (Kilam) fled from her with their two children, ending up at an anti-magic refugee settlement which was the birthplace of Demacia, which wouldn't become the military kingdom we know it as currently until much later. Kayle and Morg grew up with different worldviews: Kayle venerated her mom as the Aspect of Justice, and came to associate the law with general goodness and safety, and took it very seriously within the settlement even at a young age. Conversely, Morgana came to hate their Aspect mom for causing dad enough grief to force them all to leave, and developed a much more personable, empathetic attitude, including with those outcasted by the settlement (remember: Demacia's origins were based in refuge from magic, and its anti-magic attitudes have been around since day one). At some point, their mom's sword of shadow and starfire fell from the sky and split in two in front of them, and the two became blessed with her power (what exactly happened to mom isn't clear). Kayle jumped at the call to be like mom, to become Demacia's protector and upholder of its values of justice, but Morgana resented these powers... until she came to realize ""Wait, this means I can keep dad safe,"" so the two started fighting together to keep Demacia safe. For a time, at least. Now here's a moment I think many people don't fully get: Kayle's ongoing desire to be the legacy to the Aspect of Justice led her more to develop a judge-jury-executioner attitude; she formed a judicator order because she wanted to most objectively uphold what she considered justice and those who were proven guilty would be rightly punished. (I think it's important to point out that there's some ambiguity of whether the ""justice"" she's upholding is based on some kind of universal, objective truth, or simply the law of Demacia. [Kayle thinks modern Demacians ""have lost their way,""](URL make of that what you will. Also, note how I nor the biographies state that Kayle or Morg themselves are actually the Aspect of Justice themselves; they have its power, but the wording implies that they aren't truly one with the Aspect like their mom.) In the meantime, Morgana's empathetic outlook led her to recognizing the capacity for atonement and redemption; she began pleading with Kayle and her order ""Hey, maybe we should give these guys a second chance. If they admit their guilt and want to redeem themselves of their crimes, we should let them, and I'll help"" Kayle actually was willing to fork the rules a bit to allow her sister to do this (THIS MOMENT IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT, put a pin in this), but the mortal council was not amused. One of the judicators and Kayle's protege, Ronas, saw Morgana's actions as dangerous and criminal based on Kayle's rhetoric, and so without informing Kayle or asking for her permission, he went to arrest Morgana with the intent of imprisoning her, but Morg ended up killing him in self-defense, which caused an uproar in the settlement. Because Kayle wasn't aware of Ronas' plan or context, it just looked like Morgana spontaneously killed him, and the objective-(ish) judge-jury-executioner she was, Kayle, ""**consumed by rage**"" was about to smite the city to hell in the resulting riots (the wording is important, again, pin it), but was confronted by Morgana, and by then, Kayle decided that if she was ""to purge the darkness she saw in mortal hearts, she would have to start with her own sister."" They fight, but in the ensuing chaos, their dad gets killed from collateral damage. Morgana gets furious and is like ""What the fuck, Kayle!? Were you planning on smiting dad to death too? What was *his* crime? Stealing us away from mom?"" Kayle doesn't give an answer, because she doesn't have one, in turn because she realized ""Holy crap, I really screwed up."" Essentially, in spite of her proposed stoic mightiness and trying to be the legacy her Aspect mom deserved, she let her emotions get the best of her and it resulted in a senseless disaster. She simply took off into the sky and vowed to not let mortal emotions sway her any more, and so she started heading back to Mount Targon, ""where she would seek perfect, celestial clarity. There she would stand at her mothers side, and fulfill her legacy to the Aspect of Justice."" She hasn't been seen for centuries since, though she may be returning soon. Morgana, meanwhile, never even wanting her powers anyway, chose to bind herself to mortality. She couldn't cut off her wings, so she simply bound them in chains, and is now walking the earth. Despite all of this, she still wants to help those she deems worthy of help, and ""she bides her time in the kingdoms shadows,"" which I take to mean she's either an incognito wandering good samaritan, or in hiding but quietly helping people with her magic (might be detailed in a color story later). She knows Kayle will return someday, and ""as magic begins to rise again,"" figures it'll be soon. --- # Breaking Down Kayle and Morgana Characterizations and Morality tbh I'm gonna mostly talk about Kayle in this section, because people seem to be generally on board with and understand Morgana, but I'm gonna go over her too for a bit. So what I find neat about Kayle and Morgana's motive dynamic isn't that it's solely driven on ""should we be lawful or should we be compassionate?"", but it's also more intertwining a related but still significantly different age-old ""stoicism vs. emotions"" conflict. As established, Morg is a very sympathetic and emotion-driven person, and that's what drives her to be more ""human"" and less of a demigod templar like Kayle or their mom, who are driven by the desire for justice and rules over empathy. I'd think just the fact she's explicitly more emotional inherently makes her more relatable, which is why people are gravitating to her more to the stoic and rule-driven Kayle. And it's kinda interesting and neat how she has this personality despite still looking like a Sailor Moon villain with evil-looking powers (though remember, her ""dark fires"" was one of her mothers' stated celestial powers along with starfire that went to Kayle). Kayle, meanwhile, aspires to be a stoic who deliberately wants to eschew human emotions. She sees mortal emotions and vices as not just the driving factor for injustice and disorder in the world, but also what stands in the way of being the Aspect of Justice's true legacy, as in her eyes, pure ""justice"" is represented by carrying out an objective, black-and-white, ""you're either guilty and to be punished or you're not"" worldview, summed up as [""There is right, and there is wrong. All else is rationalization.""](URL Guilty according to what is unclear (again, is she upholding a divinely-defined, legitimately universal truth, or just what she *thinks* is the truth? Personally, I think this is intentionally supposed to be uncertain, as I'll get to in a bit), but either way, she condemns emotion, both in humanity, and more significantly, in herself. If we can specifically discuss how she acts in the gameplay for a bit, Kayle SEEMS to have reached that point. Her biography page is introduced with [No human is perfect. But I am not human.](URL Her champion select pick quote is [""They shall tremble at my perfection!""](URL [A LOT of her voiceover](URL (apologies for not being able to find a list, the League wiki still hasn't updated yet haha) has her claim stuff along the lines of ""Only the divine may judge,"" ""Mortals are blinded by their own misery,"" ""The law does not tolerate imperfection. I am no exception,"" etc. The general takeaway is that she's and heightening her own divine status as this ""true"" judicator of objective justice, and downplaying her own faults as things she moved passed, like ""I was once marred by human vices and emotions because I know they're terrible things for my supernatural duty, but it's in the past, and now I'm ready to take it on for real."" Here's the thing, though: **She isn't.** Her flaws aren't in the past. Whatever she is now -- an actual Aspect or just a winged lady with half of her mom's powers and her sword, while she may no longer literally qualify, as a person, Kayle IS still human. She has flaws. She has moments of emotional vulnerability where they betray her. She isn't discarding her vices and weaknesses, she's simply ignoring them. And do you wanna know why? It's because one of them is Morgana. Her sister. --- # The Torrid Tragedy of Two Sisters More than just ""justice and law vs. compassion and moral obligation"" deal, Kayle and Morg conflict in my eyes is about one sister dedicating her life to a supernatural role that destroys her humanity, while another sister who was unfairly roped into everything with no way out herself wants it all to end and for them to be normal again, both of which are equally unmoving. [There's an interaction for when Kayle and Morgana are on the same team](URL and it honestly kinda destroyed me once I realized what it meant: &gt; Kayle: Today, it looks like we must put our animosity aside. &gt;Morgana: **We've never been enemies, sister.** &gt;Kayle: How beautiful your mind must be, to think such things. &gt;Morgana: How tragic yours, to believe them. Going back to the whole ""stoicism vs. emotions"" angle again, Morgana is almost aggressively idealistic in that she forgives wrongdoers and believes in their capacity for redemption, and surprise surprise: even though she's rightfully pissed off that a calamity (which admittedly, wasn't directly Kayle's fault; at worst, she was complicit for motivating Ronas' scheme) that killed their father (the last of their only other existing family members), it seems Morg is willing to apply some degree of that same forgiveness with her sister. In return, the thing is that as much as she doesn't seem to want to admit it, while Kayle does view her sister with antagonism, she lets her off the hook far more often than the supposed duty she's assigned herself will actually allow, and is completely dishonest with herself as to what she's actually doing. Kayle fudges the rules she created an entire judicator order to be based around just because Morgana asked. When Morgana stops their fight to cradle their dead father in her arms, Kayle doesn't finish the job of killing her (reminder: **""Consumed by rage""**. **""If Kayle was to purge the darkness she saw in mortal hearts, she would have to start with her own sister.""** **The whole thing about almost burning the entire city to ashes.** *She was in full inarguable kill mode at that moment*), she can only stay silent and leave. She also doesn't bother pursuing Morgana for centuries. What she spent all that time doing is unclear for the time being, but it sure didn't have to do with Morg or her equally-mysterious hidden shenanigans. But at the same time, Kayle has a duty to fulfill. Not just because she feels a personal obligation to do right, but WORSHIPS her Aspect of Justice mother despite not having met her, and had built up her entire mortal life trying desperately to be worthy of her example. She believes that with the power she has, she must serve Runeterra, [and considers it a gross disservice to relinquish it](URL [as she believes is the case with Morg](URL ...so Kayle deadlocks herself and Morgana into a potentially unwinnable scenario. Both are blessed with their mother's power, but Kayle self-professes discarding all of her humanity just to fulfill a self-imposed, yet divine and in-her-eyes truly righteous obligation, but because [she seems to still love her sister despite it all](URL she's opted not to end her, [but to simply ignore her.](URL She doesn't want to actually fix the flaws or emotional attachments that hinder her, she just simply wants nothing to do with them. [But the same cannot be said for Morgana](URL [She's super not happy with the path Kayle's taken](URL but regardless, [she just wants her sister back](URL and to stop all the insanity that she never even asked to be part of. Which like... yeah, changing Kayle's mind is gonna be just as difficult as changing Morgana's. Unless some extreme miraculous breakthrough happens, it seems the two are essentially doomed to be enemies forever, not just because both of them are so stubborn in their beliefs and self-imposed obligations, neither of which are de facto WRONG, or the fact theyre basically ancient part-to-full celestial demigods with eternal life and incredible powers, both from the same mother but most of all because [its pretty clear that as sisters,](URL [neither one wants to pull the trigger](URL [and neither wants] to see](URL [the other gone forever](URL --- # Conclusion So yeah, Kayle and Morgana's situation is really screwed up, and frankly, it's so juicy in its screwed-up-ness that I adore it. I hope I've articulated myself well enough for this chaos to be comprehensible, because it's just not as simple as a ""good guy is objectively really bad and bad guy is objectively really good"" scenario like their original pre-relaunch lore suggested. Here I think it's far more personal and based on a more nuanced take of humanity, especially human flaws. We all make really bad mistakes, guys. Even the lady with goddess starfire powers and wings from her mom. I personally really commend /u/Jellbug, /u/thermal_kitten, and everyone who was involved in Kayle and Morg's lore, because personally, it's really some of the best and most exciting from this game in a while. I can't imagine how colossal an undertaking it must've been to convey this really gargantuan and epic dynamic based on divine obligations and contradictory emotions between these two, but I'm very satisfied with them, and super-excited to see where things go. This is mostly conjecture, but it's been hinted at for a while that [Demacia's ""heading for a major shake-up""](URL and my personal theory is that Sylas' mostly lukewarm release is merely kickstarting it, and when Kayle/Morg are officially released, the conflict's gonna go on full blast, pretty much guaranteeing the two will return to Demacia. I can't wait to see what happens next."

I hope I've articulated myself well enough for this chaos to be comprehensible, because it's just not as simple as a ""good guy is objectively really bad and bad guy is objectively really good"" scenario like their original pre-relaunch lore suggested. Here I think it's far more personal and based on a more nuanced take of humanity, especially human flaws. We all make really bad mistakes, guys. Even the lady with goddess starfire powers and wings from her mom. I personally really commend Jellbug, thermal_kitten, and everyone who was involved in Kayle and Morg's lore, because personally, it's really some of the best and most exciting from this game in a while (I'd directly ping their names, but my first post got taken down haha). I can't imagine how colossal an undertaking it must've been to convey this really gargantuan and epic dynamic based on divine obligations and contradictory emotions between these two, but I'm very satisfied with them, and super-excited to see where things go. This is mostly conjecture, but it's been hinted at for a while that [Demacia's ""heading for a major shake-up""](URL and my personal theory is that Sylas' mostly lukewarm release is merely kickstarting it, and when Kayle/Morg are officially released, the conflict's gonna go on full blast, pretty much guaranteeing the two will return to Demacia. I can't wait to see what happens next."
48,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Writing a story based on LoL and would like some input on which version of the universe you all liked and other things.,1,afak9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/afak9w/writing_a_story_based_on_lol_and_would_like_some/,2019-01-13 06:14:09," Hey guys, long time League player and Kat otp, I'm not that good though only being silver 3 xD. I love the lore and a lot of the stories behind Kat and I'm currently working a Katarina x Garen story that I've already dove 2600 words into. I'ts not that deep so far and I can go back and alter bits or just drive the story differently in the next chapter. I know what I want for the plot, but in regards to the story I'm still not entirely sure how I'm going go about it. As most of us know Summoners and the Institute of War are no longer a thing in the lore. I don't know how I feel about this as it gives some unique opportunities and deepens the universe making a bit more making it easier to work around. On the other hand not having an organization that controls the continent allows for me to create wards and further the conflict between Noxus and Demacia. So one question to you guys is what did you prefer? Did you like the idea of the Institute of War and the Journal of Justice? Or do you prefer the current state of things were nothing is determined and we are free to make our assumptions and use our imagination. I'm torn on this part a lot. Another question is how do you guys believe Kat is as a person. I have my own idea about her being loyal to a fault, diamatrically opposed to Garen. A fierce fighter and assassin that loves the thrill of combat, and relishes her work as a killer. But I wanna flesh out her personality that would be seen behind closed doors or with someone she could actually trust. I've gone into great depth on my own with how I feel that would be, but I'd be gracious for any other ideas. I'm way more comfortable in writing Garen's personality out and most of the story will be from his perspective. But again, how do you think his feelings are towards the state of Demacia on personal level that he wouldn't share openly. We all know what he is to Demacia and how he is percieved, but adding some vulnerability and faults that aren't obvious is fun. Thanks :)"

51,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Neeko's Transformation Trouble,1,9ykdgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9ykdgj/neekos_transformation_trouble/,2018-11-20 07:05:10,"It was a beautiful day on the Summoner's Rift, not a cloud or an elder drake in the sky. Gromps ribbited their baritone music, joined by the shrill songs of the birds fluttering just above in the Rift's gorgeous treelines. Through the shrubbery underfoot, taking refuge in the shade, stalked a curious creature hungry to crack open the secrets of this calm forest. Her curious nature made her heart flutter whenever the crunches of sticks caused the nearby wildlife to lurch into motion, cawing and padding and barking away from the intrusion to their idyllic scene. Some of these animals stared on, indignant, yet kept their distance--even so many of them, like the two-headed wolves, are known to attack for lesser transgressions. ""Neeko loves this place!"" Neeko said as she bounced along. It reminded her of the Vastayan forests of old--those times felt both very close and very far. How familiar it all was, though, with the scent of sap. The aroma of dewy grass, and of packed dirt. It put Neeko into an abnormally playful mood (which is to say, *incredibly playful*). Giggles rose through the forest. A song so rare, legends would say only one mortal man of a hundred-thousand will ever hear it. Soon, Neeko happened upon intelligent life. The human Neeko discovered, however, kept swinging a broken sword around. Intelligent; questionable sanity. The chameleon wouldn't find a better playmate. Neeko's tail flashed. Then, its hexagonal scales alighted to different colors and began twisting, as if freshly invented by Piltovan engineers. There was a thrum, underplayed by the occasional crackle. And, as the thrum tapered off, a fully formed Riven stood across from the Riven practicing in the clearing. The legitimate Riven started as Neeko approached. ""What are you?!"" She called. Her sword remained pointed at the apparent enemy. Instead of answering, Neeko brought her hands up to mock-cry. ""Waaaah! M-M-My sword is broken!"" ""You do not understand my story,"" Riven growled at herself. ""If you understood an inkling of my mysterious, intrepid pa--"" ""My swoooord!"" ""I was falsely acc--"" ""I want my sword fixed, waah!"" ""And I kee--"" ""Can someone kiss my sword and make it all better?!"" Riven dropped her guard, shoulders shagged. She gave a *whatever, then* sort of wave and shambled off to find a new training spot. One where she wasnt visited by apparitions of herself. Really mean apparitions, at that. Neeko fell on the ground laughing. She reverted to her original form in a fireworks display of shooting colors. Last to go was the warrior's ashen hair, which jumped away as if it was a bunny. She waved at her departing magic adoringly. The next human she found was capsized, barrel of ale resting on his giant belly. Pint after pint of brew poured onto the man's beard, as he laxidaisically gulped between the deluge. Neeko's eyes lit up at the sheer size of the drunken man, and it wasn't long before the thrumming began. Gragas didn't notice himself until Neeko was standing right over his belly. He put a thumb onto his barrel to cork it while he glanced into his own glassy eyes. Never had he rolled to his feet faster. ""Just what are ye?!"" He cried. Neeko giggled and lifted up her giant belly. It was so soft and accommodating. And when she dropped it, the skin and fat rippled and tickled her. Gragas gaped. ""Yer... me. Is that really what I look like? I..."" ""You're funny!"" ""You callin' me a joke because I enjoy a good keg?"" Gragas spat. ""I can quit whenever I want. It's just, the barrels, they're the source of my power..."" Neeko-Gragas put a stubby finger up to her chapped lip. ""Source of your... power? Haha, Neeko thinks that's incredible!"" The man hunched down--tears began to roll. ""I... gods, I want to cut it out. My village elders say all the drinking'll kill me, magic or no. But I can't quit. It makes me strong 'nough to fight through the day. What's a man to do?"" ""Glug glug?"" She suggested with a small shrug. ""You're damned right!"" Gragas bellowed. He surged up to full height. ""The brew sent me a vision o' myself to make me learn to *love* myself. But more importantly, to love the version of me in my head that..."" Neeko ran off to play with someone more interesting. In some bushes not too far away, the chameleon found another playmate. The weird, fuzzy creature sat humbly on a log. He kept chipping away at a fluted piece of wood. On the finished end, it looked smoother than the finest example of Demacian faewood. His ears danced to the tune of his own simple marching tune, feet in time with the rhythm. Her giggle, followed by those telltale magical crackles, made the creature's ears twitch. Unlike the last two, the Yordle didn't seem surprised upon twisting around to see his own body. ""Hello there, me,"" Teemo said. ""Do you want to take a seat?"" Neeko nodded and pranced over to the log. Teemo chuckled as she tried to get used to her newfound stoutness. ""Beautiful day, today."" He shaved more wood-flakes away from his blowgun. ""It's nice seeing a friendly mystical being. In the Rift, that's an unusual thing."" ""Neeko thinks everyone is funny."" ""Neeko... is that your name? Nice to meet you, Neeko. You seem like you like fun."" ""Fun? I live for fun. It's very colorful."" ""Yes. It is. Although I wish I could get to know the real you, too."" He looked up at the sky with a gentle smile. ""When I scout, I try to take the good bits of those I meet, and apply them to myself. Kind of hard when the thing I'm meeting is me!"" Their laughter filled the clearing. They talked for awhile longer, about the different landscapes they'd visited. Dreams, funny stories--even fears. And, as the sun started to wind down over the Rift, they talked about their hopes."" ""Neeko wishes to visit where home was. Understands home is gone, but... wants to stand on grass where it is."" Teemo huddled up close, hugging his newly finished blowgun. ""I also want to be less... homeless. Scouting ahead, but nowhere to report to."" He clapped a hand on Neeko's shoulder, squeezing softly. ""Anyway. I'll see you around, friend."" And with that, he picked up his things and darted between the trees. Neeko cocked her head to the side. The strange creature seemed to resonate with her feelings. It was as if Teemo spoke to Neeko, and not the cloaked mimicry going on before him. To do so would require such an utter lack of ego, to be just like her. Shaking her head of sobering thoughts (as Neeko hated sobering thoughts, which are very colorless), the chameleon decided it was time to change back. Except on top of the thrum and the crackles was a fizzle. She tried again. But every time the Yordle's colors jumped off her skin, they came rushing back like angry leeches. Neeko let out a little yowl. Tried again. Then again. Never had this happened before, in all history: her mother used to warn her, *transform too much, and you'll get stuck that way.* Even she understood this was just make-believe, intended to scare Neeko. This really scared Neeko. She waddled away on her stubby furred legs. The sensation of vulnerability set in immediately. Not that she came up to any decent height--it was the combination of being short and rendered powerless. ""Teemo!"" Neeko called. ""Need help!"" Maybe if he was present, she could transform back. The forest returned silence. Night fell. Moonlight shone through cracks in the branches above her. New body awash in moonlight, Neeko ran (crying) over to a hollowed-out trunk to hide. A wolf's howl started in the dark, and the chirps became crickets. Time passed. How much was unsure. Enough for Neeko to finally look up from her huddle. It was about a couple hours into the night. Still dark. Still threatening. She inspected the Yordle's body in detail. Mastering transformation didnt mean one had to dwell on their many forms. In fact, doing so might invite envy, or pity, or fear. The Vastayans referred to the ability to forget oneself in the body of another as *the lack of ego.* No transformation is permanent-- on that tenant, she could experience life as Urgot without batting an eye. Yet, stuck in a tree in a dark forest, those old lessons became futile. These last few hours served a sort of supercession of her habits. In a single night, untold decades of practice took just a crucial moment to lull its eyes. The body, despite being small, was a nice fit. Short, yet lean and sinewy with well-earned muscles. The fur hid that strength well, yet it could be summoned from hiding with a flex. Flexing, biceps and thigh muscles rose to the surface, kind of like how a lillypad bounces up to the surface of a pond after being held at the bottom. And, as t least at the time of her copying, Teemo had groomed himself well. There weren't any clumps in the fur, nor did it tangle as she ran fingers along her chest. It was interesting: all her life, Neeko loved scales. Yet fur had its own special quality. Warm, welcoming. It felt great to press through the short beige strands to feel the skin underneath. Beyond the petting, there were the fingers doing so. And these particularly interested Neeko, in a way she'd had once spurned. One hand took the other into an infected. The short claws on each end danced for Neeko, twisting around and writhing. Then, in a moment of inspiration, she pushed down on the flat of her index finger until it gave a satisfying pop. Breath escaped her in a tiny burst. Afterward Neeko let both hands stretch out, inspecting their fuzzy palms. It was too late to stop herself. An ego developed, a comparison grew. Teemo's hands were *better* than her hands. Taken in a thought she shot a hand up to her muzzle (strange thing, this quasi-muzzle, that felt better than her face). The fingers hooked onto all sides of the muzzle, soft palm squeezed against her small black nose. Teemo's hands smelt better. His nose was smoother and colder. Hungry for more contrast, Neeko tried peeling up her muzzle to start rubbing at where Teemo's gums and teeth meet. Such a congruent set of teeth. A pinch of the tongue--it was slender, yet paradoxically heftier. Weight, with grooved buds that could taste better than Neeko. Neeko tested the smooth underside of Teemo's tongue and squealed with delight. Every discovery felt like a reward. Hours ago, being stuck as Teemo felt scary, but it was a reward, a damned beautiful reward, for Neeko to be Teemo. To know Teemo is to love Teemo, and to love Teemo is to be Neeko. She threw off the scout's shoes, not noticing. Unaware of the wild fact, that trying to remove an article of clothing should have been impossible. Yet those wonderfully adorable feet had wonderful toes that were better than Neeko's and soles that felt squishies than Neeko's. The heat coming off of them from being on all day made Neeko loathe the many years she spent barefoot. Then there was the pants. Neeko felt an odd feeling in her Yordle gut as she stared at his britches. Panting softly, Neeko wrenched their brim up and slowly started to slip a hand in... ""Do you feel you've earned that yet?"" Neeko let out a cry. It was Teemo, smiling at her from outside the tree. ""N-Neeko so sorry! She is stuck as you. You are n-n-not bad to be stuck as, Neeko means no offense--"" Teemo laid a finger on Neeko-Teemo's muzzle. She swooned. ""Shh..."" he patted her shoulder comfortingly. ""Just because you are me, doesn't mean you have the right to be all of me. You Vastayans are all the same. Negligent to the bitter end."" Neeko shook her head weakly. ""Would you like to be me forever?"" Teemo asked. ""I will no longer be Neeko?"" She asked. ""You'll always be part-Neeko, lucky for you. However... you'll be a Neeko with a home. Want to find out what that entails? Then take my hand."" The clawed thing hovered inches away from her shoulder. The smell of two Teemos in a small tree was intoxicating. At this point, Neeko knew her choice. Many chameleons go insane envying after certain shapes. Not often do those insane ones get a chance to *become.* Her furred arm extended into his. Their hands clasped together in a squeeze tight enough to threaten joints. Then, Teemo-Neeko's hand started to fuse into Teemo's. Lucid again, she let out a cry and tried to tug back. The other Yordle easily kept her in place as all of Neeko's colors bled into the real thing. Each strand of her fur seemed to yank pit, becoming long unraveled strands of rope. They coiled in on one another, then dug into Teemos wrist. Small red blotches formed around the entry points, yet Teemo continued to tower over Neeko with a malicious grin. ""Neeko changes mind! Give arm back *now*!"" ""Don't lie,"" the Yordle growled. ""That's the animal in you speaking. When you're absorbed, you'll feel every part of me. You'll feel how I scrub away plaque on my teeth; you'll know what my liver feels like when I splash its insides with Bandle Brandy; how my kidneys squeeze as I relieve myself in a bush; the tickle of pollen on the inside of my nostrils, the light tinge of my lungs as I dunk my head underneath a pool of water to wash my body; every toeclaw growing back into place after I clip them. You'll be conscious, 'alive.' Except all of your senses will be in my great form. In return, all I ask for is your power."" He scooted his leg up. And Neeko's bare toes started to pop out of their joints, sunctioned by his shoes. In an instant, they were side-by-side. Teemo-Neeko slowly melted away, face distorting into the true Yordle. The other side of her, the side yet free, scrabbled for purchase on the inside of the tree. No matter what Neeko grabbed, nothing would ever allow her to pull free. So, instead, Neeko's, body twirled around, what was left of her embracing Teemo. With a soft, wheezing whine, the chameleon became nothing but another consciousness inside of the scout. Teemo let out a large sigh and laid against the tree. Absorbing Vastayans always tuckered him out! A part of him almost felt bad for tricking someone so... clueless. It was going to be okay, though. After all, Neeko could see his memories now, too. She'd finally get to see what happened to her village. She'd get to revisit its soil through his own feet. "
52,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Regarding Akali nerf pleads,1,a0zocl,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/a0zocl/regarding_akali_nerf_pleads/,2018-11-28 09:14:52,"So apparently there is another circlejerk of begging for akali's gutting. First of all, I don't main akali, but I have reached level 7 so I grasped some basics. I'm not at a very high elo, so everything I say should be taken with a grain of salt. The main problem most people are complaining about is the W. Many find it oppresive that she can drop turret aggro, although she isn't the first champ that can do it (she can do it several times though). There are also champs that can kill you under tower without even taking aggro. The whole notion of little to 0 counterplay is blown way out of proportion. ""She regains stealth real quick, there is very little time to target her with autos."" True but she is designed to counter AA champs. The shroud also has a 21 second cooldown level 1, so that's a pretty big window of vulnerability. The heal is way less oppresive than before the rework as well. Most of the nerf suggestions seem like an attempt of making a 30% winrate champ. Even if Riot were to nerf her W, whether they remove obscurity (which would be a blasphemous thing to do), or give her the azir treatment (shroud lasts shorter under turret), or make her visible but untargetable wherever she uses her shroud, a heavy compensation is needed to the rest of her kit (given she has a sub 45% winrate with being ""broken""). Tl;dr She is perfectly fine as she is. "

CrownJJ's preference for Kench will probably result in something like Varus which complements Crown's inevitable mages. This results in a 4-1 over a 1-3-1. When they make their lame attempt at wave control, Sion, Alistar and perhaps a Galio could take advantage. Bans should prioritize keeping Haru off of farmers and C9, on red side, should be able to supplement that by picking away the likes of Taliyah to provide secondary damage. IMHO... &amp;#x200B; **Gen. G's Fall from Grace** &amp;#x200B; It's been quite enjoyable to see games be as competitive as they were for the last few days of the group stage, especially against Korean teams; do mind I hadn't pinned any hopes on Afreeca. What I do hope is that CHN and EU have made empirical and permanent improvements over the last seasons and will continue to be competitive when the meta changes into lane swaps, poke and etc. So far though, Gen.G seems to be failing to serve as a proper benchmark in light of their subpar macro: lane control, rotations and etc. Not only did they fail to close out a 6-1 lead vs VIT, they also lost a 4v5 baron and blew a hard-won 2K gold lead, as well as the game, against what many consider the best team in the world. &amp;#x200B; Crown certainly shares the brunt of the blame. His insistence of defensive mage picks of Syndra and Lulu have been detrimental in lane control going up against Echo and Ryze, which have the mobility advantage on top of the superior 1v1. This led to the aforementioned 4v5 baron attempt with a line-up of Ashe, Kench, Gragas, Syndra and Urgot. And the composition was obviously going to expose them longer at the pit against VIT who had a 5.5K lead. But they had no other alternatives despite the first tier top tower being up. ([Clips](URL &amp;#x200B; But what I think is worth reminding is that CuVee shares the blame also. His predilection for lane aggression left open game-changing picks like Orrn and Sion to their detriment. It should be noted here that C9 also failed to pick these up but in C9's case, they had the Galio to fill their role. &amp;#x200B; This would be a simple matter of personal taste in today's meta as long as CuVee had CoreJJ's map awareness or if CoreJJ didn't need to roam so much, sacrificing lane pressure and sometimes the ADC or if Crown could give direction to the team by taking charge of lane pressure as he should. [But alas...](URL &amp;#x200B; **C9, ""Who Craps out First?""** &amp;#x200B; C9... ALI URGOT TRIST (KENCH LISS XAYAH) JARVAN GALIO (VARUS EZ) &amp;#x200B; GEN G... AATROX TALIYAH RAKAN (NOC KAISA KINDRED) POPPY LUCIAN (CAMILLE XIN) &amp;#x200B; What C9 chose to do in their game against Gen.G was artificially prop up their bot-lane by spending 4 bans and camping Jarvan in the mid-lane to take advantage of Crown's supposed vulnerability. But they did not pick into a better 1-3-1 or a more teamfight oriented top-lane as VIT and RNG had done. They chose to go with Blaber and Jarvan because Gen G. ""can't handle aggressive JGs."" But I maintain that Gen G. should have won both games going up against VIT's Noc and RNG's Lee Sin but for their clumsy or rather non-existent rotations at the baron pit and when CuVee's Camille was pushing up to inhib towers. &amp;#x200B; A pick like Taliyah isn't just secondary damage that C9's comp sorely needed; it's a pick away from Haru. Gen G. spent 4 bans on the JG because a rookie was coming in but the role is also where their shortcomings are largely made up. Haru with his impressive ability to farm and maintain efficient lane presence, on top of what CoreJJ can shore up in roaming has been responsible for what semblance of success Gen G has had. Let's note here Haru's contributions of 3-0-4 and CoreJJ's 1-0-6, compared with the carries' kill participation of 5/8 at the end of the match-up. &amp;#x200B; **A Prayer** &amp;#x200B; Reapered ""coached"" a team with a Bronze 1 [into victory](URL against MakNoon's team with a Gold 3 mid so here's to hoping he could possibly knock the previous champions out of worlds. &amp;#x200B; Also, check out t=472, it's pretty hilarious.

I mean how can a champion, an actual assassin, lack core weaknesses that define the category in the form of cc vulnerability, cooldown rotations boundary, be allowed to pretty much break the competitive scene. It was like i was watching solo queue. Like seriously, diving into the enemy team (red team red buff) whittling them down uninterrupted in her shroud by landing two 3-4 man Qs and the moment they actually get a chance to cc her (alistar) no wait she goes invisible yet again completely undetected, then proceeds to E away over the wall. This actually triggered me so much and i know why. We encounter akalis every day in our games, she is a pain in the ass to deal with but right now she sits at a very low win rate despite being pick or ban. She is not definitive issue though, she is a nuisance, a threat much like the likes of katarina, zed, talon because solo queue players will greed, they will go for the kill, step out of the shroud get focused down. Scouts performance shows what the champion is truly capable of and it wont be long before it becomes the standard for high elo solo queue as well. Oh she will get nerfed, she will be nerfed hard but not before she breaks the balance of world"
55,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,[Article] 10 Reasons why 100 Thieves might perform better than expected at Worlds 2018.,1,9mw7ib,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9mw7ib/article_10_reasons_why_100_thieves_might_perform/,2018-10-10 15:03:02,"I wanted to make this post for a few reasons. If you don't follow NA, many of you may never have even heard of 100 Thieves, and they have been getting a huge amount of negativity both from casual fans and from analysts, with many people thinking they have no chance at worlds and putting them at the bottom of their group. Personally I don't think they are completely wrong... The analyst's criticisms make sense as the team ended summer in a serious slump - which will be the first thing I address - BUT this is Worlds! We want a Cinderella story and 100T might be the perfect team to make an unexpected deep run. So this post is going to focus on 10 things that you **should** be excited for about 100 Thieves, as a way to build hype for their fans, to introduce the team to anyone around the world who doesn't know them and their main players to watch, and to let people know that **if** a big upset happens (and they turn out to be a top team) that these are the reasons why! #Reason 1 Rikara is not starting &gt;So I said I would start off with mentioning why analysts are so down on the team right now. 100T qualified for worlds on points, which means that we did not see them in regional qualifiers. The last time we saw them play was Summer playoffs, and it wasn't the prettiest sight - they lost 1-3 against Team Liquid in the semis and lost 2-3 to TSM in the 3/4th place match. This means the last time we saw them win a game was in late August for their Quarterfinals match... So with recency in mind that's a big reason that analysts assumed they are on a downturn. &gt;All that said, we need to take a look at why they lost in Playoffs. A big reason (from the view of an outsider) was the last minute substitution of their backup AD carry Rikara, taking out their all-star Cody Sun. Rikara racked up large deficits in lane and didn't seem co-ordinated with his support. So from a pessimistic analyst view - not only are 100T losing, but there **must** be some team conflict causing them to not work together. &gt;Well the good news (this is supposed to be a positive, I promise!) is that Cody Sun is back in and will be starting as their AD carry at worlds. The team has had almost a month since to settle their issues and return to form, so if we are watching the rise of 100 Thieves, it is going to start on reuniting this starting roster. #Reason 2: sSumday is a fucking monster &gt;When talking about 100T, the number one thing that gets brought up is just how good sSumday has been. This year has had incredible competition among Top laners in the NALCS with Korean juggernauts Flame, Impact, + Huni, NA all-stars Hauntzer + Darshan, as well as surprisingly great rookies Licorice and Solo. With all of those, sSumday still won out among all of them, winning 2018 Summer All-Pro top laner, and coming in 2nd place in MVP voting behind Doublelift. &gt;sSumday's strength has been in being an anchor for the team to play around. He consistently draws pressure while getting relatively little jungle resources. He wins most tank vs. tank matchups and he has some deadly counterpick carries, and his incredible map awareness creates massive sidelane pressure on anything that can split push. On top of that, he has been consistent both splits... So it is safe to say that no matter what else is going on with 100 Thieves that sSumday will be grinding out advantages in the top. #Reason 3: Best of 1's &gt;NA and Best of 1's is a bit of a meme because of NA's weak history at Worlds previous years, but it is no exaggeration to say that 100 Thieves has the best bo1 record in all of NA. With 2018 being the first year that best of one started, 100 Thieves finished in 1st place in Spring split and 3rd place in Summer split (barely beating out Team Liquid who finished 4th + 1st respectively). While critics seem to be focusing on their shaky best of 5 performances where they are 2-3 in the org's history (9/11 in games), it would be fair to say that their bo1 performance is a good enough reason to be wary of an upset in groups. #Reason 4 Spring 2018 MVP - Aphromoo (Support) &gt;If you follow NA LCS at all, you have probably heard of Aphromoo, one of the longest standing players in NA. He was the heart and soul of CLG who crashed and burned without him, instead leading 100T to victory as a shotcaller in their first two splits, and in Spring earning himself his first ever MVP award. There has been criticism of 'Moo lately as he struggled alongside Rikara in their Summer playoffs, but this is a player who is comfortable on the worlds stage and who has been playing League at a pro level for a long time. #Reason 5: AnDa, The Solo-Queue God &gt;100T's Jungler, AnDa, is the only player on their team who does not have experience playing at worlds - he went to worlds as a rookie in 2017 but as a sub for NA's Immortals - but there is one thing that AnDa has: Solo-Queue God Status. AnDa was the first pro player to hit Challenger in Korea solo-queue this year, and he remains one of only 10 worlds participants holding his spot there (with the only other Jungler being Karsa). Many dismiss Solo-Queue ranking as not perfectly translating to Pro play, but this is a hype thread so instead I'll just say that this proves AnDa is the 2nd best Jungler at worlds. &gt;Or, if that doesn't get you excited, many who watched worlds/MSI last year may be fans of Levi, formally of the Gigabyte Marines... Levi is the backup jungler for 100T domestically - so AnDa not only practices with Levi frequently but he has also held on to the starting position over Levi. #Reason 6: The Meta is Perfect &gt;If I were to make a complaint about 100 Thieves, it might be that they are somewhat inflexible in their champion pools. They were not a team who went hard into mage carries bottom lane, they don't have a deep pool of pocket picks, and they didn't pick up some of the FOTM like Quinn or Fizz. Pretty much across the board they play a specific style: Aphro plays playmaking supports, Cody plays safe late game carries, AnDa favors junglers who farm to 6, Ryu plays a split pusher like Ryze/Malz/LeBlanc, and sSumday rocks a bruiser. They have a specific style and they tend to stick to it... Normally you might think that this is a downside of the team, but after seeing Play-ins at worlds, this meta could not be more perfect for 100T's style. &gt;In every lane, the 100T comfort picks align very closely with what is the current worlds meta. In top, Aatrox and Urgot were not picks when we last saw sSumday play, but you can be sure he has been testing them and is exactly the kind of player to carry as either side of that matchup. If those are banned out, his most played include Sion, Ornn, and Cho'Gath, and he is not afraid to style on a carry like Jax/Gnar/GP if the opponent doesn't respect his counterpick. &gt;For midlane: Ryze, Malz, LeBlanc, Ahri, and Azir are all core champs for Ryu and are good in worlds meta, and he has looked great on Akali/Irelia as well. In the Jungle, AnDa has Graves, Kindred, Nocturne, Olaf, and Taliyah in his recent picks, and can still play it safe on Trundle/Sejuani. Bot lane is maybe the biggest example of where 100T will shine, as Cody Sun almost exclusively played Kaisa, Trist, Lucian, and Xayah. Aphromoo meanwhile favored his signature Alistar, but also heavily played Braum and Rakan. &gt;So my point is... Pretty much across the board the meta right now is something that will work to 100T's advantage. I don't see a single lane where there is vulnerability for their comfort picks to be banned out, and 100T's ""narrow"" playstyle seems unlikely to be punished when their comfort picks are **the** best meta picks right now. #Reason 7: Spring 2018 All-Pro AD Carry Cody Sun &gt;Cody Sun showed up in 2017 and made an immediate splash, making back to back finals appearances and showing that he is the next up-and-coming NA AD player. His worlds run ended in heartbreak, but he bounced back for his best season yet - once again going to the finals and winning All-Pro AD of the split. The team relies on Cody as their consistent late game carry, and his CSD charts show that he can make it through almost any lane without falling behind - only beaten in the West by his rival Doublelift. He gets memed for a bad flash at worlds last year, but I look forward to seeing what Cody Sun can do at his second worlds without the nerves he had last year. #Reason 8: The Legend, Ryu (Mid) &gt;Speaking of getting meme'd... Many might recognize Ryu from the infamous Faker Zed outplay, but Ryu is someone who has been a high-performing midlaner for years in the competitive scene - six to be exact. In his last appearance at worlds he made the Semi-Finals with H2K and brings his years of experience as a level-headed midlaner to the team. Ryu may not be a highlight-reel kind of player, but in Group D he is perfect: FNC and IG are both depending on their Midlaners to carry for their teams, and even if they can get small advantages they will have a hard time turning that into a carry performance against Ryu who has held his own against the best of Korea. Ryu is also in a good spot to play spoiler in those matchups as he excels on champions that roam or split push well, drawing the star players Rookie and Caps into sidelanes away from their teams. #Reason 9: 2018 Spring Coach of the Split Pr0lly &gt;Last but not least, I need to give a shout-out to 100T's Coach Prolly, whose clean drafts, team cohesion, and leadership lead 100 on the victories they have found so far. Pr0lly is best known internationally as the former coach of H2K, where he won Coach of the Split on his debut season and brought the team to their two worlds appearances. Compared to Semi-Finals, not getting out of groups would be unacceptable for this renowned coach. #Reason 10: The whole world is underestimating 100 Thieves &gt;If there has to be a number one reason why 100 Thieves are likely to overperform in groups, it is because the bar is so low for them. Ratings put them as one of the weakest teams in the whole group stage, which means that their opponents are likely not spending the time researching and preparing for them as they deserve. Coupled with that, their international exposure hasn't been the best performances - they showed Rikara as their AD in Summer Playoffs, and when they went to Rift Rivals they brought their subs Brandini and Levi instead of their starters. Their opponents may not even realize just how strong 100 Thieves can be at top form. On top of everything else, 100 doesn't have the pressure to ""not lose"" which has plagued some of the past NA teams like TSM and IMT. ----- So just to wrap things up, I've already given 10 reasons why 100T might be stronger than expected at worlds, but I also want to throw out a few reasons why they are a team **worth** rooting for: * As mentioned earlier, this is a brand new organization which only started in 2018 and has already come this far. * They have the sweetest branding and the absolute coolest Merch - [Just look at Aphro chilling in one of these bad boys](URL * They are backed by the Cleveland Cavaliers * Nadeshot (the former pro CoD player) is the coolest owner around. Watch [just one video](URL with the guy and you see how genuine he is and how much he supports this team. * Great content production - Again Nadeshot gets credit but they've had consistently high quality YouTube content which shows a unique side of pro League. ----- That's all I've got! Hopefully I gave everyone enough time to change their pick'ems, and I hope to hear everyone's voice cheering for the ONE HUNDRED THIEVES! -Xahhfink6"
56,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Tryndamere rework concept: The undying warlord,0,9e0hre,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9e0hre/tryndamere_rework_concept_the_undying_warlord/,2018-09-08 11:34:20,"**(TL;DR at bottom and after each skill)** As I see it now, tryndamere has a few problems. 1: Random crits as early as level 1 is VERY RNG, and tilting to play against. 2: Ult is EXTREMELY strong against anyone with no CC. 3: Hard to teamfight with. And I'm sure there's more. But these things make him very toxic to play against for many champions, and allow little skill expression for him. To remedy this, I suggest a large change change to his passive and his R, and a mild change to his other abilities. **Passive: Battle Fury** FURY: Tryndamere gains 5 Fury each time he lands a basic attack, and 10 Fury resource fury on critical strikes and each time he kills an enemy. After not dealing or receiving damage for 8 seconds, Tryndamere loses 5 Fury resource fury per second. BATTLE FURY: Tryndamere gains (1-6) Physical damage on-hit And (0.2-0.6% increased healing) per point of fury. TL;DR: Instead of crit chance, Tryndamere gains on-hit damage against everything, and increased healing when he has more fury. **Q: Bloodlust (12 seconds) (No cost)** PASSIVE: Tryndamere gains 5/10/15/20/25 AD per rank and gains 0.5% additional bonus attack damage per 1% of his missing health. ACTIVE: Tryndamere heals himself for 30/40/50/60/70 (20% AD). **TL;DR: Tryndamere no longer consumes his fury, and the extra heal per fury point has been transferred to his passive.** **W: Mocking shout (14) (No cost) ** ACTIVE: Tryndamere reduces the attack damage of all nearby enemies by 20/35/50/65/80 for 4 seconds. Targets with their backs turned are also slowed by 50% for 3/3.5/4/4.5/5 seconds. **TL;DR: Mocking shout now scales up the slow duration as the game goes on, allowing him to lockdown a target in a teamfight much more effectively.** **E: Spinning slash (13/12/11/10/9) (No cost)** ACTIVE: Tryndamere dashes to a target location, dealing physical damage equal to 80 / 110 / 140 / 170 / 200 (+ 130% bonus AD) (+ 100% AP) to enemies in his path and gaining 2 Fury per enemy hit. Spinning Slash's cooldown is reduced by 0.5/0.6/0.7/0.8/0.9 seconds whenever Tryndamere lands an autoattack. Spinning slash's cooldown is reset by 90% when tryndamere gets a kill or assist. **TL;DR: Instead of crit CDR, now allows him to make riskier plays via a katarina-like reset mechanic, and lowers the CD via autoattacks instead, making him able to spin more early game, but slightly less lategame, encouraging teamfights to get kill resets.** **R: Undying rage (95/85/75) (No cost) ** ACTIVE: Tryndamere fills his fury bar to 50/75/100 and gains damage reduction and increased healing equal to 1% for each 1% of his missing health for 5/6/7 seconds. If Tryndamere falls below 6/12/18% of his health when undying rage is active, the damage reduction and healing increase maxes out at 99% instantly, and cannot be reduced until undying rage wears off. **TL;DR: Now gains damage reduction and healing increase instead of undying, and allows him to stay at lower healths by maxing out the damage reduction at low hp levels.** ***Goals for this rework:*** -Allow trynd to have strength/vulnerability windows, via timing his heals to get more healing at low health by risking life and limb, or to play it safe and stay medium hp. -Make teamfighting as viable as splitpushing, with a spear of shojin-like ult and increased healing, with a healer on your team he becomes an extremely powerful initiator who almost never dies, but still can be killed by piling on the CC. -Allow him to actually be duelled by Melee assassins (Talon, Rengar, Zed) As opposed to pressing R and 3-auto killing them. -Make him have skill expression, as now it matters more than before when you use your R/Q/E/W as opposed to mashing them almost whenever you can. -Give him the ""Undying rage berserker"" style of playing by piling on heals and damage reduction, as opposed to just having 5 seconds of pure invulnerability. -Vulnerable to a true damage execute (Olaf, infinity edge ADC's, pyke, darius) and I forsee he will have difficulty vs those matchups, but the damage increase and teamfight potential makes up for it. -Less RNG and less tilting to play against. If you have any ideas for improving this rework, I'd love to hear them in a comment! **TL;DR: He doesn't get free crits, and his ult is a ton of damage reduction instead of unkillability. Heals are now a big part of his kit, and he can teamfight now.**"
57,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,What Happened to Riot Design Philosophies?,1,8zebs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8zebs9/what_happened_to_riot_design_philosophies/,2018-07-17 06:08:53,"Hi, first time post, but I'm a mid diamond player who has been playing this game on and off since the end of season 1, and after being dissatisfied with the game since season 5, finally decided to make a post on their design decisions. I have a lot to rant about, so don't expect any good organization in this post, I'm kinda just writing it up as stuff comes to mind. Anyways, I'm not sure what has happened to riot in the passed few years but to me it seems like they've lost their way with everything regarding balance and champion design. These days, with every new champ/rework (not limited to champ reworks), riot is more concerned with ""innovation"" and ""creativity"" then fun. It honestly feels as though the individuals working on these things are more concerned with prioritizing these over the state of the game, and that their colleagues are too afraid to rock the boat (the vibe I get from their corporate culture) and just tell them no. I'm not sure how many of you guys remember how busted evelynn was back in the day for example, when she had stealth and a point and click stun and burst and could just one shot you without counterplay. But I specifically remember Morello having a discussion on why they nerfed these problem champions like evelynn, shaco, and soraka (to which he said something along the lines of constant burst heals are bad for the game and anti-fun). He said that they'd rather have these champions unplayable then to let them wreak havoc in the game, because while it was fun for the player playing these champions to pop in and blow someone up, it provided little for the people playing against it. I believe he also mentioned this for champions like riven and lee sin (I'm not sure on this one), who just had so many tools at her disposal, or get out of jail free cards while being able to kind of assert their for a lack of a better word, bullshit on you, and it felt like you had to get through a million hurdles while getting shit on just to punish their limited windows of vulnerability. Anyway I also know kits were a lot simpler and more binary back then and we've come a long ways, but why does it feel like although kits are being modernized, the idea that you have to take into account the sort of ""level of fun"" for players playing a champion and everyone playing against it has been lost? Morello made it a point that if the overall enjoyment of the people playing against champion supersedes that of the person playing it, that it was anti-fun and shouldn't be strong (for example, evelynn was kept complete shit for a very long time until her eventual rework). Nowadays, I don't know how many times riot is going to have to continuously buff and nerf champions like jayce and teemo and kennen and gnar and rengar and khazix and rework ryze and azir and akali before they forget why they were nerfed in the first place. Seriously how many times do they buff gnar, kennen, jayce for worlds only to remember oh wait, thats why we nerfed them, they take away line diversity and are so overbearing and unfun to play against that you feel like have zero agency in lane! My favorite example on how Riot went back on their old philosophies is how they made rengar and kha'zix and let them keep their stealth literal heart attack jump scare one shot kits for so long despite having discovered that evelynn and shaco were extremely anti-fun to deal with in the past. (And of course, they gave eve her stealth burst and cc back with invulnerability, then slapped on the waiting thing for her W to label it as counterplay.) Who actually has fun getting one shotted by a dash out of stealth with no time to react. Who actually likes getting ganked by zac from an entire screen away from fog, through all your wards, and getting cc'd by almost every single ability and often under your turret because of how tanky he gets with decent base damage and a revive passive? How many Ryze reworks are we going to go through before we realize wow, maybe keeping his dps burst mage style does not work with his spammable point and click *ranged* root, movespeed buff and shield and defensive itemization options? When are we going to realize that akali's 8 second pseudo-invulnerability, sustain and chase potential are bad for the game? To be clear, I am not talking about the champion's strength, viability or current states when discussing these, just that their kits are fundamentally anti-fun for anyone playing against them, and Riot always always seems to forget that, despite discovering problems MULTIPLE times in the passed, and then overtime end up buffing them and having to nerf them again anyway. (Sorry if I sound salty, I'm just passionate hehe excuse me.) (warning side riven rant below I know I'm gonna get a lot of haters for using as an example) Remember why riven's health regen stat was so low in the first place? Because she could shield all your harass and negate aggressive play and attempts to trade back while ""riven taxing"" (yes her zero counterplay free harass trade pattern is so annoying that its a term, at least to me), and regen what little she lost back. The only way to play aggressive on her is if she messes up really bad (with her 4 dashes, 2 cc, and shield. Because of how many tools she has in her kit, the ball is always in her court, the dictates the lane and how it has to be played, you can never play aggressive (unless ur like kennen or jayce, i guess) unless she does it and messes up. A bad lane for riven is just playing passive and shielding harass while in a good one, you can just keep riven taxing your opponent even under turret with your dashes and shield until theyre &lt;70&amp;#37; hp and blowing them up with your next ult all in. Whereas many champions with less tools in bad matchups are forced to miss a lot more cs or lose like half their health to harass. I'm not even going to go over the power creep issues and kit overload in the newer champions like Camille (though I think pyke is fine), who are just so ridiculously overloaded that even with ""counterplay"" built-in, has tools to overcome any obstacles when strong, and still completely takes over games when weak. To be clear, I am not talking about the champion's strength, viability or current states when discussing these, just that their kits are fundamentally anti-fun for anyone playing against them, and Riot always always seems to forget that, despite discovering problems MULTIPLE times in the passed, and then overtime end up buffing them and having to nerf them again anyway, or even just reworking champions, but giving them back their root problems. For god's sake just scrap it, I for one would rather play against something that doesn't make me wanna hurt myself over having something that I think has a unique gimmick wreak havoc in the game.Personally I'm a fan of the simple kits in the game (I was an old Irelia main and hate the direction they are taking the reworked one) and while designing binary champions has its own problems, I'd rather deal with that then ""innovation"" at the cost of everyone else's enjoyment of the game. Anyways, sorry for the long terribly structured post, as I said I was just typing this out as it came to mind, and I don't really post stuff anywhere so I'm not used to all this. Have a lot more to say but going to leave it at that and post it so that I don't lose what I've typed by accident. Sorry for the salt, I'm just passionate about the game that I used to love and play all the time. I'm just terribly disappointed and CONCERNED with the direction it is being taken. Thanks for reading. TLDR; BRING BACK MORELLO'S DESIGN PHILOSOPHIES"
58,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Some Ideas for Rune Changes,12,94a8qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/94a8qg/some_ideas_for_rune_changes/,2018-08-04 00:53:41,"Hello! I'm literally a random dude from reddit; I have no degree in game design, and I don't even play ranked. My largest claim to fame is that I listen to Mark Rosewater's podcast. I don't have a bunch of playtesters to try things out, I don't have the experience to change numbers - but I do hope that I can at least spark some discussion. No, this is not a shitpost, in case you were wondering. **Philosophy** ----- **Brief Overview:** In my opinion, Keystones should have two purposes. For new players, they should help you define your playstyle. For more experienced players, they should provide some skill expression. **New Players and Keystones:** There are some great Keystones out there. Lethal Tempo, for example, is awesome. If I'm a new player, testing out Kog'Maw, and my friend tells me to go Lethal Tempo, reading it will actually *give me an idea about how to play my champion*. I attack quickly, and it'll help me attack even faster. Glacial Augment, Comet, Spellbook, Dark Harvest, and Aery all kinda suck in this regard; they don't really give you insight in how to play your champion, they just give you benefits. **Experienced Players and Keystones:** Keystones should also provide some level of skill expression for more experienced players. Whether it's using Spellbook at all, managing your up/downtime with Lethal Tempo, or weaving spells and autos for Klepto, many keystones are more effective if you know what you're doing - this isn't always the case though. Again, Aery and Comet don't do great by this standard. Okay, so now that we can all understand where I'm coming from (feel free to comment if you agree/disagree), let's talk about stuff I'd change. Keep in mind that this is all stuff I came up with fairly quickly, and nothing I'd push to live if I were in charge of the servers. I haven't kept 3 runes in each row, though that's mostly because I run out of ideas. **Changes I'd Recommend** ----- **Precision** * Press the Attack - Removed, but check Inspiration * Fleet Footwork - Moved to 1st row of minor runes, Heal removed * Conqueror - After triggering, goes on 10 second cooldown * **New (Keystone)** Killer's Blood - Deal 10% more damage to low-health enemy champions. After getting a kill, recover 15% health and 15% mana, gain 25 gold. * Triumph - *Removed* * Presence of Mind - *Removed* * Coup de Grace - *Removed* **Domination** * Electrocute - Lowered damage, damage scales up based on number of number of hits (range from 3-6 or so). Cooldown shorter, increases based on abilities hit. * Ghost Poro - Poro limit increased to two, damage removed * Zombie Ward - Extra damage after ward kill removed, gain 5-20 adaptive force while Zombie Ward in enemy territory. **Sorcery** * Aery - *Removed* * Comet - *Removed* * **New (Keystone)** Spellslinger's Safeguard - Hitting an enemy with 3 or more seperate *spells* gives you a 50-220 shield (+0.3 AD)(+0.3 AP) which lasts for 2 seconds. Hitting a champ with another ability refreshes the shield's duration, but not it's health. 60-30s cooldown. * Nimbus Cloak - Switch places with Water Walking * Celerity - No bonus movement speed. Now gains 10 AD/15 AP per 75 bonus movespeed, capping at 375 bonus movement speed. * Scorch - Removed * Water Walking - Switch places with Nimbus Cloak * **New (3rd Row)** Glacial Comet - Damaging an enemy champion with an ability shoots a *nondamaging* comet at their location, creating an icy field that slows by 30% for 3 seconds. 25-8 second cooldown. **Resolve** * Grasp - No longer permanently increases health. Damage/Healing increased from 4%/2% of your max health to 5%/2.5% * Bone Plating - After 4 seconds of not being hit by a champion, the next time you would be hit, you take 26-60 reduced damage. * Conditioning - Gives +8 Armor/MR immediately. Still waits until 10 mins for the 5% bonus. **Inspiration** * Glacial Augment - *Removed* * Unsealed Spellbook - *Removed* * Kleptomancy - Gold reward increased, random consumable removed * **New? (Keystone)** Reveal Weakness - Hitting a champion with *4* consecutive basic attacks *or abilities* makes them vulnerable, taking 10-14% increased damage from all sources for 6 seconds. * **New (Keystone)** Generalist Principles - Gain 5% CDR, Max CDR, Summoner Spell CDR, Item CDR, 50% Base Health/Mana Regen, 5 Armor/MR * Cosmic Insight - *Removed* **Theorycrafting Behind All the Changes** ----- * **Press the Attack** is weird as a strongly offensive option; the thing that seperates it from, say, Electrocute, is the vulnerability. Therefore, to make it more distinct option with it's own identity, I moved it Inspiration and let spellcasts trigger it. * **Fleet Footwork** has always struggled with identity problems; it's a rune meant to help you get through lane, but when it does that it's too strong. As it doesn't really promote a playstyle, it's not a great keystone; therefore I removed the heal and took it to a regular rune spot. If you really want to survive lane that badly, go Grasp. * **Conqueror** is plenty strong enough, but needs more downtime to promote playing around it, rather than just being a thing you get all the time. Otherwise it's just a bruiser statstick. * **Killer's Blood** is something I came up with for a couple of reasons. I like it because it does, in fact, promote a playstyle - popping off. If you're taking this rune, you'll be playing Essence Reaver Lucian, and either you'll have a great youtube video or you'll die in a corner. Regardless, Triumph almost always felt like an auto-pick to me, and it wasn't that healthy as a regular rune. I dunno, what do you guys think? * **Electrocute** is interesting. Personally, I'd rather it be stronger and up less often than weaker and up more often. Also, I think that it could use some more skill expression - Zed hitting you with a full combo and then three shiruken should be rewarded more than Zed missing half his stuff but still getting the proc; scaling damage/cooldown based on number of hits (&gt;= 3) sounds like a good way to do that. * I was actually going to switch Nimbus Cloak and Predator, but then I realized that it would leave you with no keystone until level 6, which didn't sound great. What do you guys think? * **Ghost Poro** giving damage is pretty stupid, because it's this little not-even-a-unit thing that's so easy to miss. Rather than that, giving it extra utility sounds better to me. * **Zombie Ward**, on the other hand, requires *killing one of their wards* - so they have to know where yours is, if they're paying attention. This leaves more room for counterplay if you get the damage, and is just a better change imo. * **Aery** and **Comet** were removed because they neither promote a playstyle nor skill expression. I mean, you can make an argument, but it's a weak one, and I just don't think that they're worth a Keystone slot. * **Spellslinger's Safeguard** is kind-of the anti-Electrocute. It won't give mages any more damage, but it'll make them a bit less afriad to go in and get some hits, without being anything too crazy. Ryze shouldn't be taking Aftershock. Notably, unlike Electrocute, this only triggers off spellcasts. * I wanted to rearrange some of the minor runes in the Sorcery tree. I like that Manaflow and Nullifying Orb are both on the same row, as they're both lane-based runes, in different ways. I wanted to make the choice to take them a little more up-in-the-air. If you wanted to be mean, you'd put Gathering Storm with them (lane/lategame trade). I'm nice, so I put Waterwalking there instead (lane/jungle trade). Also, this lets you still take Nimbus/Celerity/Waterwalking if you so choose. * **Celerity**, by the way, is a little abstract at the moment. I think it would benefit greatly from a more unique identity, so I removed the bonus MS, upped the ratio, and gated the bonuses behind MS blocks. This means that some champs that get a lot of movespeed will love it, while others that don't won't take it - which is where I think it's always been trying to be. * **Glacial Comet** replaces Scorch, and lives in the memory of Comet and Glacial Augment. I've also thought about it just being a single-target slow (Glacial Aery?), but decided to put this out for now. Tell me what you think. * **Grasp** needs some more work. In my opinion, Grasp is a great *lanebully* rune. It does everything you want; over time, in combat, it deals damage to the enemy champ and heals you. That being said, it's quite good on Tanks, too - and that's not healthy. Therefore, we should take out the lategame health boost it gives for tanks (and make it thereby less useful) and help it into it's real role. * **Bone Plating** on the other hand, isn't great. What does it really protect against? Early game poke waits for it to drop, and late game damage goes right through it. I guess early game trades/all-ins? You usually die to those anyways. I think that we should really cement it's role as an anti-poke rune. Therefore, it'll block a significant portion of the first damage you take every so often - sorry Jayce. On the other hand, if you even go for 2 or 3 hit trades, it'll do less work than before. Numbers might need changing. * **Conditioning** is now giving it's Armor/MR right away. This should help compensate tanks for the Bone Plating/Grasp changes without being too major. * **Unsealed Spellbook** has always been a value rune; it just provides some value over the course of the game. It's not necessarily bad to have a rune that's specifically targeted at more experienced players, but when no pros are using Spellbook, then who's it really for? I think it's best to just get rid of it. * **Glacial Augment** again doesn't really promote a playstyle. I think giving slows via runes is good (I put it in the Sorcery tree, after all), but I don't think it's worth a Keystone slot. Thus, I removed it. * But wait, /u/1pwny! **Generalist Principles** is everything you said you don't want! It's *actually* just stats! And yes, this is true. Generalist Principles indeed does nothing other than help you survive and give you some free value, in the spirit of Unsealed Spellbook. However, I do recognize that it's important that there's a rune for you if you don't know what you're doing, are first timing a champion, or just want to survive. Generalist Principles is exactly that. * **Cosmic Insight** was absorbed into Principles, and therefore removed. There's one last thought I'd like to leave you all with. While some numbers need adjustment, obviously, I think Generalist Principles is pretty good where it is now (maybe nerf HP/Mana regen to 25% each?). And if Generalist Principles is ever the best Keystone for a champion, it's probably not a problem with Principles - it's probably a problem with the rest of the runes."
59,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Kaisa and xayah were really poorly designed ad carries for game health.,0,96e42m,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/96e42m/kaisa_and_xayah_were_really_poorly_designed_ad/,2018-08-11 15:02:36,"am going to make this short there is a reason vayne and tristana have garbage early game. because of decent mid game and god tier late game but the biggest thing. is that they have self peel. kaisa and xayah are problematic . I cannot do anything. anything to these two ad carries if they get out of lane doing well. its just. not fathomable how am I expected to deal with an ad carry and a support with great self peel a 1 item vayne is quite trash compared to a 1 item kaisa. but vayne needs that self peel even tho there are other issues with vayne (true damage) but thats besides the point the point is. xayah and kaisa. are far too difficult. to engage on. and sometimes impossible with the right support. and that just makes for a very shitty gameplay of hoping your mid laner lands some cc on her from very far away and instakilling her. this post isn't really intended for super low elo no disrespect. but if am having a winning kaisa or xayah on the enemy team and am a diver or a tank then i might as well go afk. because its useless what I do. the team fight end in 2-3 seconds. giving invis and vulnerability and mobility to ad carries that are strong in the early game is ridiculous. I absolutely loathe seeing them get a kill or two early in lane because I know its over if am playing vs a jhin which he is decent in lane. at least am like ""well hes fucking immobile. we can engage on him"" miss fortune. same deal. shes also strong in lane the two other ad carries not really. this isn't about strength overall. this is about shitting all over divers and assassins with their kits because they are untouchable for them if am on a melee diver or an assassin and they are fed. I just give up. because no matter how I try to twist it and make it work it just doesn't. kaisa just uses her mini vayne ult and am dead. xayah just R. and I get jumped on by the rest of her team tristana's W is just a dash. no invis. no invulnerability. so there is a god damn chance. vayne is at least garbage early game "

62,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,League of Legends PvE game mode idea Part 2,1,8swogv,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8swogv/league_of_legends_pve_game_mode_idea_part_2/,2018-06-22 09:39:04,"This is a continuation of a post I had posted a couple of hours ago. I had realised I left out A LOT of details that League of Legends is capable of. Runes, Some sort of Leaderboard, Items, Rewards, and some of the Summoner spells I missed. here is the link to the original post [**URL **Runes**\- Runes as they stand right now are great, Almost every champion can use any of the runes to some extent and I think that is personally awesome. Sadly, It would be very expensive to convert them to the PvE system and would require a whole new set of runes which I do not think is really worth it until Riot would think this is 100&amp;#37; profitable enough to warrant that. Disregarding that though, here is some rune changes that would require the minimum amount of effort and would actually be useful in the PvE environment. I will go down each tree and see what I can think of. **Precision** Press the Attack - Press the attack is a perfect rune for people who can get those 3 attacks in and more within the duration of Press the attack but, I think in PvE 6 seconds is a little too short for auto attackers. The only change I would put forward for this in PvE is to make it so it is an infinite buff as long as you are auto attacking the target. But, to balance it, the debuff has a shorter duration so it eventually runs out. Also, a decent cooldown so its not a continuous dps increase. Maybe a 30 second cooldown would do it good for 12&amp;#37; vulnerability. Lethal Tempo - See Above, similar changes except, a longer delay between the initial attack and the attack speed bonus. Fleet Footwork - No Change. Conqueror - No Change. Overheal - Heal for 5&amp;#37; of all damage done, and gain an extra 10&amp;#37; healing from all sources. 30&amp;#37; of all healing recieved while at full health, is converted to a shield lasting for 2.5 seconds until extended by another heal from another source. (Is not applicable to summoner spells.) Triumph - Every time you kill an add, heal for 4&amp;#37; of your missing health. Presence of Mind - Restore 50&amp;#37; of Missing Mana on add kill, 1&amp;#37; of your Ultimate's remaining cooldown is restored as well. the Legend Runes - this is applicable to all 3 of the legend runes, instead of a flat buff over the course of the fight, it stacks up and once fully stacks grants an extra &amp;#37; for 1 minute and then you must re-stack. Stacks off of Adds. **Domination** Electrocute - After 3 seperate Attacks or Abilities, you will Electrocute the targeted enemy for (25&amp;#37; for Adds) 1&amp;#37; of its Max Health. (Within a 5 seconds period) Predator - I am sorry Predator users, I just do not see a way that Predator would work in a PvE environment. It is an amazing ganking tool in PvP and is a great rune overall. If you think differently please do shoot some ideas over :D Dark Harvest - Stacks on Adds, and is Released on boss damage. Resets on death. Hail of Blades - No change. Cheap Shot - Deal bonus damage to Bosses while he is casting no abilities or attacking no champion. Taste of Blood - No change. Sudden Impact - No change. the Tracking Tree - I don't really see where these can be used. With exception to Eyeball Collection, which I would only change to stack on Adds. Wards or Vision is not important in PvE (or at least in league's sense of vision.) Hunter Runes - Stacks on Adds, 5 Seconds cooldown between stacks. **Sorcery** Summon Aery - Increases heals and shields by 10&amp;#37; on allies, and Increases heals and Shields on yourself by 2.5&amp;#37;. No change otherwise. Arcane Comet - Randomly applies on damage to a boss enemy. (For example, on Ryze, could apply on a e&gt;q on both the E and the Q.) No cooldown between each comet. 25&amp;#37; chance per spell for a comet to be summoned. Phase Rush - Deal an extra 2&amp;#37; Magic damage to Adds, no change otherwise. Nullifying Orb - If you take lethal damage, you instead are forced to the nearest ally and is granted a 10&amp;#37; max hp shield. (you are left at 1hp, it is up to the healer to pick you up at that point.) Manaflow Band - Applies on Boss damage, after fully stacked (stays stacked between attempts) you will recover 1&amp;#37; of maximum mana every second. Nimbus Cloak - When you ult, you are granted an extra 3&amp;#37; Magic damage to the next 3 spells casted. Movement speed buff is intact and the same. Transcendence - After 3 minutes, you gain 10&amp;#37; cooldown reduction and &amp;#37; base movement speed. Celerity - No change Absolute Focus - 80&amp;#37; hp, I feel it would be too strong for a dps if it was such a loose 70&amp;#37;. Scorch - Deals damage over time per spell cast on a boss (every 2 seconds) . Stacks up to 5 times. (1, 0.01&amp;#37; max hp damage. 2, 0.05&amp;#37; max hp dmg. 3, 0.1&amp;#37; max hp dmg. 4, 0.25&amp;#37; max hp dmg. 5, 0.3&amp;#37; max hp damage Waterwalking - 60&amp;#37; reduction to all slows and 20&amp;#37; tenacity. Also increases movespeed after every ability. Gathering Storm - Reduced time per buff, and resets after every attempt. **Resolve** Grasp of the Undying - No change, resets after every attempt, cooldown of 10 seconds and doesn't require you to go out of combat to start cooldown. Aftershock - After you use an ability, you gain extra resistances before releasing a great explosion, dealing 0.5&amp;#37; of the boss's max hp and 15&amp;#37; of Add's max hp. Guardian - When near an ally, you and the ally gain a shield, stacking per second you two are close together Moving apart causes the shield to go on cooldown and only stick around for 1.5 seconds. 25 second cooldown. Demolish - After losing 15&amp;#37; of your max hp, you charge up an attack dealing 15&amp;#37; of your max hp to the enemy that caused this to apply. (Example, you are tanking the boss, and an add attacks you for that last .1&amp;#37; of hp that Demolish needs to happen, you deal damage to the add instead of the boss.) Font of Life - After using 3 spells on a target, you mark it for your allies and allow them to heal for 1&amp;#37; of your max hp per attack or spell casted for 3 seconds after this is applied. 20 second cooldown. Bone Plating - Gain a flat 10&amp;#37; damage reduction until attacked by a boss enemy. After this, bones of your ancient ancestors protect you for 3 attacks (incuding damage over time attacks). Conditioning - After attacking a boss enemy, you gain 30&amp;#37; of your base resistances instantly and refreshes everytime you attack the same target. lasts for 5 seconds after you stop attacking. Second Wind - After falling below 30&amp;#37; hp, you gain a 40&amp;#37; missing hp shield and while the shield is applied, you deal 20&amp;#37; extra damage to the enemy that made this apply. (read Demolish example, applies here.) Chrysalis - no changes, applies from add kills. Overgrowth - No change. Revitalize - Heals and Shields casted by yourself, on yourself are 10&amp;#37; stronger, you gain 5&amp;#37; extra healing from all sources. Unflinching - No change. **Inspiration** Glacial Augement - Any attack or spell during a boss spell, Interupts it and extends its other ability timers by 5 seconds. cooldown: 30 seconds. Kleptomancy - Attacks against Boss enemies have a chance to grant extra gold or a random buff elixir. 0.5&amp;#37; chance to grant a special item based around the boss. (Baron Nashor = Nashor's Tooth, Vilemaw = ?? {probably will be a new item}) Unsealed Spellbook - No change. Hextech Flashtraption - At the beginning of the game, adds this item to your inventory and has 2 uses, allows the user to use flash instantly. Magical Footwear - 5 minute (from 10 minute) 20 second per Large add killed (down from 30 seconds) Perfect timing - No change, 2 minute timer instead of 8 minute. Future's Market - No change Minion Dematerializer - No changes, Doesn't apply to large adds. You gain adaptive ad/ap per stack used. Biscuit Delivery - Every 1 minute 30 seconds. Cosmic Insight - No change Approach Velocity - General bonus towards allies. an extra bonus towards low hp allies and impared allies. Time Warp Tonic - 10&amp;#37; instead of 20&amp;#37; I apologize for that really, really long rune section, now that thats done, lets get onto the Leaderboard system. **Leaderboards**. Each boss will recieve his own leaderboard. It will showcase the teams Time spent in the encounter, Amount of attempts, The champion's used, and finally, the amount of Add's killed. There will be no ranking system for this (for say) More like medals. Medals would be a great reward to put on top of your border, just opposite of your Master score. You can choose which medal you would like to sport. For Example, in your ""trophy room"" You would have the choice of either a Gold Baron Medal or a Silver Vilemaw medal. (Just has the boss's face on a bronze/ silver/ gold/ diamond medal.) **Rewards** See above for one idea I had, but I do not mind repeating here. Medals based on your time spent in the encounter. Another idea would be a special plate somewhere on your summoner loading screen. Such as a diamond Baron Nashor plate that goes below your summoner spells or your name. Along with special chests for getting good times. (First time getting a bronze time on a boss rewards a Bronze Champion Chest which contains champion shards (450 BE to 3150 BE) . Silver is a Bronze champion chest and a Silver champion chest (3150 BE to 4800 BE) and Gold gets the last two along with a Gold Skin chest containing a Skin shard (390 RP to 1350 RP) Diamond gets the last 3 and a Diamond Skin chest, Containing a skin shard of your choice (Up to 1820 RP) ) Only applies for the First time getting that Medal on that boss. I will continue this in a Part 3 sometime in the future if this gets good reception. I really hope someone out there is enjoying this idea &lt;3 Signing Off, Summoner Imcog"

But I have it now. I'll go ahead and post it in its original state. # Vs 2018 ending (tentative) Garen thundered through the fog of war, both blades ready in hand for cutting and splicing. The battle of eternities had become nothing but a haze of blood and death, a hazy call to the glory of old. Naught but suffering stained this battlefield, and it was the straining in Garen's heart telling him, this war was soon to close. Would he be victorious? Or would Darius, the man who betrothed himself to the axe and gave up his humanity for power be the one to survive? Normally, such a thought would put vigor behind Garen's slashes as he cut down droves of human soldiers--mere specters of the original combatants centuries ago. Something else twisted in his gut. It put a stay to his blades. He had been watching Darius for so long, catching glimpses of him through the flashes of forged Noxus steel. But finally, the time was upon him. Darius stood in his path. He hefted his axe, and leveled it directly at the knight of Demacia. ""You can feel the end, too?"" Darius asked. His voice sounded off in the clamor of war like echoes through an empty room. ""Yes. It is time we end the endless war."" Garen let his blade shine in the sick, swollen light of the dying sun. Then he leapt off and attacked! The two clashed. A sword deflected axe, and axe tried to break through. This was the constant. Yet both felt a vulnerability in the other which never existed before, which made them go all the harder, fiercer, madder in hopes this hunch led to victory. Soon, the first cracks made themselves real when Garen managed to get a vicious knock on Darius's weapon. The Noxian groaned as his wrist snapped back with all the weight of his killing tool before managing to bring it back to deflect a stab in the heart. Afterward, he used his other hand, but immediately landed a kick that stole the breath from Garen. It went on for hours. Then, the unthinkable happened: the two broke apart beset by consternation. ""Why won't you die?"" Garen asked. ""I am the wolf of Noxus, the old aspect of power in the Tricorne. You think my actions murder. But I have honor."" ""Do not lie, villain--"" ""I caught you washing off in the river. You were completely naked, open to attack. And yet I did not attack."" Heat rose to Garen's cheeks. ""You are a true villain..."" he lifted his blade to resume the fight. Darius's eyes lit up with alarm. ""Wait! Before that... I want one thing. I may be a villain--then owe it to my worthiness as an opponent. As your equal."" Garen knew the Noxian had *some* perverted honor. So he felt comfortable letting his guard down, step one step closer. ""And what's that?"" Without any warning, Darius dropped his axe and lunged forward, swooping up the Demacian in a clinking of armors. When Garen gasped, he gasped the air inside of his worst nemesis. It was... strange. But it seemed as though he was being kissed. Their lips rolled together in a neutral, apathetic embrace, until the very point where the heat began to gather between them. It was not the engines of war producing their wicked smoke. If it was a trap, it was not set by either of them. Garen mustered his will and shoved Darius away. ""W-What are you doing?"" They stood there. Then, he dropped his blade and dove back into the kiss. They crashed into the ground, writhing in the dead grass. They rolled through it, topsiding the gray clouds above them. They pushed, they tore at the binding between armors. After so many centuries, it was bliss to feel anyone's touch again. Garen knew in his heart of hearts that Darius was still a being who loved. Who could love. All this time it was war. It could have been love. It could have been saved lives. The irony of it all only made both of them retreat into the kiss more, breaking through with tongue and testing the teeth, roof, tongue of their partner in a rabid tangle of devotion. Then, panting, Garen broke the kiss. ""Turn into a wolf for me,"" Garen asked. ""It will get your armor off faster."" Darius obliged, his body magically twisting into that powerful, infernal wolf form of his. The kiss resumed, now even stranger as human lips met that of a dreadnought wolf's muzzle. A long tongue looped around the inside of Garen's mouth, overwhelmed him with pleasure. Garen's only reply, like a warrior, was to challenge the wolf's domination with a squeeze on his thigh. The wolf Darius whined and slid up a bit. The two continued deeper into their romance. The specters faded. The sun came out bright and healthy. And soon, no evidence of the two lovers existed on the Rift. Nothing except for an air of warmth and peace in an otherwise bloody, difficult place. ***** Anyways this seems really strange from Riot. But if they want to go this way I guess it's really cool and you never know--after the Varus lore anything can happen. "
64,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Thoughts on the state of Vayne and how to fix her in a meaningful but balanced way.,16,8ux4we,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8ux4we/thoughts_on_the_state_of_vayne_and_how_to_fix_her/,2018-06-30 08:08:14,"It has come to my attention, along with many other Vayne players, that Vayne is in a very unhealthy state in the game. Before patch 7.23, Vayne had some buffs tested in PBE that were reverted, and from them there were only two points where she was a potent choice in the bot lane, which were in s7 worlds and in preseason 8, which were both short lived. Since then, be it in the form of rune nerfs, item changes and nerfs, or personal nerfs, as well as the introduction of Kai'Sa, she's been spiraling out of not only the meta, but out of relevancy or impact in the game. Even for the faithful who continue to play her in ranked, the amount of games where she really shows up are fewer and further between, and held at the mercy of her laning opponents and support. Her already infamously weak laning phase got nerfed in 8.11, and while some solace was provided in the BORK price reduction, the 8.13 Rageblade nerf (suspected as an indirect Kai'Sa nerf) caused collateral damage to Vayne as well. The recent bruiser buffs (which were much needed and great for the health of the game) were strong, but with the combination of Vayne's greater weaknesses early and Bruisers' greater strengths in the early and mid games, her once niche but viable identity as a duelist and tank shredder have fallen by the wayside. Accordingly, I will enumerate the issues she currently has: (Lane bully meta: this can't be changed, it is what it is, the meta shifts and this is based on small changes, so times of weakness for champs are normal.) Passive: the 30 ms towards enemies, while useful in engages, doesn't live up to the amount of peel that is present in the game, and by current standards as far as passives go, it's a little bit on the weak side. Perhaps it could provide a little more movement speed. An alternative would be to reflect on her identity as the night hunter (and as a duelist) and give her a passive (akin to Kindred marks) that only gives her the bonus movespeed towards (and 33% of this bonus away from) only her chosen targeted champion (picked with a left click, one second application informing the target), as well as dealing 4% of the chosen target's missing health as true damage (minimum of 5 damage) on hit. The chosen enemy can be changed on a 5 second cooldown if they are alive, but the cooldown is reset if the target is killed (as long as Vayne participated in the kill). The damage effects are tripled during Final Hour, and cooldowns on target choice are removed for its duration. Q: The crit synergy with her q was potent for trading and allowed her to work well with crit even more, but when she had the prospective double silver bolt proc the change to not give crit was a decent trade off, but then the no crit part was kept and the double proc was taken away, and the 70% at max rank bonus damage was for bonus AD only, not all. Part of the tradeoff was that 4 seconds were added to the ult for each KP as well as the removed rejuvenation bonus. Overall, the result was weaker Q's. Maybe instead of 70% of the bonus AD added to the empowered auto, 70% of total AD is added. Another option would be to give her scaling bonus range on her empowered auto, maxing at 600, which would give her more defensive and offensive opportunities without being overwhelming. Because of her vulnerability early, having this little bonus wouldn't overwhelmingly buff her early game, as Q is typically maxed until level 9. Another issue is the 7 seconds allowed for her empowered auto before the CD starts, while seemingly nice, is cumbersome. In an offensive circumstance, it is incredibly unlikely that this 7 second duration will be used, and in a self peel situation, this duration can be injurious. Reducing this to around 4-5 seconds would be greatly beneficial, especially in hard shoved, fatal laning circumstances. W: Around 7.23, the w passive damage was a little more front loaded, but was then changed to scale harder as you leveled up the ability. That was reasonable back when sustain in lane was greater and bruisers were weaker. Now with damage in the form of Q needed to deal with the laning phase, W is at a weaker spot once you get to the mid game, unless your cs was immaculate or you outplayed in lane really hard, you are left with being irrelevant until 4 items, which in her case are even harder to come by. She almost had a W buff this patch, but it was taken away, and instead buffs were given to crit carries Twitch and Tristana (which is fine, as the bot lane needs to be diverse but not making ADCs irrelevant and displacing dedicated marksman players). Perhaps this could have a higher percent true damage at rank 1 and 2 to make entering the mid game not underpowered. E: It's great to have hard CC on a relatively low CD, but with all the CC that is common in the bot lane as of late, it could be a bit lower at rank 1. Also, back in the old days of League, her E had an AP ratio. While nothing to write home about, considering that Rageblade is generally considered a core item on Vayne, adding an AP ratio to her E would make Rageblade more efficient for her. The CD and AP ratio would have to be balanced such that there wouldn't be a 1000 AP build where she could one shot with her E every 5 seconds. R: Overall it's fine, might be good to have a little extra AD and/or 5% rejuvenation per KP. Other moveset considerations: Perhaps Vayne could be given AP ratios to her abilities to make her more versatile and customizable build wise. Overall issues: Kai'Sa comparison: When Kai'Sa was announced, she was supposed to be high risk high reward champion in the vein of Vayne. And while she's a cool and fun champ, she turned out to be a low risk huge reward champ. The additon of an AP marksman was great for the game, but with early game waveclear, the ability to be a lane bully, long stealth, and also being a late game hypercarry, she not only missed the goal of being high risk, she made Vayne irrelevant. Waveclear: In the current state of marksmen, good waveclear is almost universal among marksmen, with Vayne as the exception. Yes, champs like Draven don't have direct waveclear, but with his high damage Q's, you don't need laser precision to last hit. Even super late game hypercarries like Twitch and Jinx have more waveclear than Vayne. Moreover, there are multiple champs like Kai'Sa, Varus, Twitch, and Kalista that apply stacks on hit, but Vayne's is on target, so while the aforementioned champs can utilize Runaan's Hurricane to apply stacks, Vayne does not, which also affects her waveclear. Accordingly, Vayne needs ways to compete in the waveclear game against other marksmen without having to rely on Runaan's Hurricane or Statikk Shiv. There are multiple solutions to this issue, either an AOE active on her W, or her silver bolts being changed to an on hit effect (or both). Item issues: Rageblade nerfs hurt Vayne and all the other non Kai'Sa on hit marksmen like Varus and Kog'maw, as well as the melee champs who used it, among others. And while it may very well been an indirect Kai'Sa nerf (as many ADC players suspect), it put on hit ADCs in a bigger bind than before. If it was meant to nerf Kai'Sa, then the Rageblade nerf dealt considerable collateral damage. Relevancy in the meta: While this shouldn't be a huge factor to the issue, it should be noted. Compared to champs like Caitlyn, Twitch, and Kalista, Vayne has seldom had any pockets of time when she was a great or solid choice, but rather a lot of time as an average, mediocre, or awful state. In recent seasons, she had 3 times where she was good (once each season). Once for a patch in Season 6 (before my time), during season 7 worlds when she started relic shield into Rageblade during the Ardent Censer meta, and in preseason 8 when relic shield start with PTA was meta. During that time, Caitlyn was oppressive until her Runaan's Hurricane interaction was changed, but even from then she was still a solid choice. For season 7 until now, Twitch too was a solid choice. The same could be said for Tristana, among others. The point of this paragraph is to show that while many ADCs have been relevant for much of the seasons that have come and gone, Vayne has not been in a healthy state as often. Other thoughts: In the wake of the widespread depression (for lack of a better word) that ADC mains dealt with in 8.11, it's disheartening to read the patch notes only to see other marksmen get buffs and see the light at the end of the tunnel while Vayne is left in the with empty promises of buffs that fell through... again. I understand the legitimacy of the uproar that Vayne's proposed super buff before 7.23 caused, but that doesn't mean a champion should be left weaker and weaker 9 months later. Summary: Vayne really needs a mini rework to bring her up to date in what the current state of the marksman class has become, which can retain the identity of her as the Night Hunter while giving her a toolset updated for the modern state of League of Legends. The standard for high risk, high reward champions has changed, and because of it, Vayne has become a huge risk, moderate reward champion. Early weakness in the game is acceptable and reasonable, but not early irrelevancy. Fixing this is imperative. Thank you for reading, and if there's anything incorrect in this post, please correct it. Ultimately, I wanted to express the frustration of Vayne mains and attempt to come up with ways to help her adapt to the current state of the game. While I cannot deny that I'm a bit biased, I love to play Vayne, and 300k mastery points in, I don't see a sign of stopping. I, along with Vayne mains worldwide want to see our favorite champ back in a state of health, and hope that improvements will help more people play and enjoy her as much as we do!"

Before patch 7.23, Vayne had some buffs tested in PBE that were reverted, and from them there were only two points where she was a potent choice in the bot lane, which were in s7 worlds and in preseason 8, which were both short lived. Since then, be it in the form of rune nerfs, item changes and nerfs, or personal nerfs, as well as the introduction of Kai'Sa, she's been spiraling out of not only the meta, but out of relevancy or impact in the game. Even for the faithful who continue to play her in ranked, the amount of games where she really shows up are fewer and further between, and held at the mercy of her laning opponents and support.

66,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,The PBE Talon Nerfs Are The Wrong Way to Nerf Talon - By a Challenger Talon OTP,689,8xrbbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8xrbbx/the_pbe_talon_nerfs_are_the_wrong_way_to_nerf/,2018-07-11 03:18:28,"Hi, I'm Yamikaze. I have 4k+ games combined on pre-rework and rework Talon since S2 and I was Challenger for 5 months this season. Currently D1 because Talon is straight up broken and perma-banned anywhere above D2 (and probably D5 at this point). After months of waiting, the Talon PBE nerfs are probably the worst nerfs Riot could have implemented. For those who aren't aware, the nerfs are: Rake (W) * damage lowered from 50/65/80/95/110 to 50/60/70/80/90 * return damage lowered from 70/95/120/145/170 to 70/90/110/130/150 The main problems that make Talon broken in this meta are his insane waveclear with Tiamat (you can literally clear a wave with W-Tiamat-AA-meleeQ, leading to Talon being able to avoid interaction with any mid laner post-Tiamat buy) and his strong early game damage (which used to be balanced by Talon falling off lategame, but in high elo, games no longer go long enough for Talon's weakness to be abused). This nerf seems to be directed at the first problem, waveclear. With damage nerfs at max level W, you can no longer clear caster minions in one W at lvl 9. But the problem is, without being able to 1-shot casters, Talon is forced to build Tiamat to kill the caster wave (which most players already do). And the thing is, for the players who are already building Tiamat, this won't solve a thing. The tiamat active will still kill the caster minions after a W and Talon will still be able to clear a wave with the combo above. The damage nerf to champions is irrelevant as well, as Talon's mid game powerspike allows him to overkill most squishies with one combo, so the 20 damage both ways won't do a thing. Rather than simply whining and demanding that Riot finds a better solution, I've come up with some recommendations to nerf Talon in a healthier way. Obviously I don't want all of these to be recommended, but I believe that all of them are better than the current nerfs on PBE (which are honestly a joke). * NERF HIS Q RANGE. Talon doesn't need a long range on his Q. Its short range before the bug fix was balanced by his insane mobility on E. Can't get in range? Walk out of lane and use your E. Now, since your q range is the same as most mage abilities or adc autos, Talon literally walks up and kills carries with little counterplay because the counterplay of staying out of Talon's q range is no longer a thing. High q range does nothing but lowers Talon's skill floor and makes Talon strong into many matchups where he previously struggled (think champs that could poke him out of his Q range in lane, as they now take Talon's full Q-W-AA rotation when they try). * Nerf his base MR. The MR buffs a couple patches ago were designed to help Talon survive in rough lanes with low q range. Now, with the increased Q range and the absence of difficult poke matchups in high elo (Ryze, Azir, Orianna), Talon no longer needs such a high base MR. Combined with a corrupting pot start versus poke or just AP matchups in general, Talon gets a free ticket to his first back, where he picks up Tiamat and can avoid laning versus the enemy laner entirely. * Increase his W cd. Although this doesn't solve the problem of Talon insta-clearing waves with Tiamat, it provides a greater window of vulnerability for Talon when he uses W to clear the wave, which is still healthier than the current nerfs (that do straight up nothing to Tiamat buyers). * This one may be over the top but, shift some of his early/mid game power to lategame by nerfing his early passive damage and giving his E a passive that gives bonus AD per level (so he remains relevant as he puts points into E, as not getting anything but cdr is one of the main reasons why he falls off so hard lategame). It seems that, with Talon's current state of being broken early and garbage late, he's either gonna be broken when the meta is short games or garbage when the meta is long games. * Nerf Tiamat. Perhaps this can be done by increasing the cost or by reverting the +5 AD buff. While I can't make a statement for the other champs that use Tiamat (as I'm a Talon OTP), I think a 1.2k first buy (or 850 if you start long sword) Tiamat results in waveclear that is too easily accessable for melee laners. With the shift away from waveclear mages, perhaps waveclear melees may need a nerf as well. Hopefully someone at Riot sees this and will reconsider the PBE nerfs :)"

Why it is so hard to admit that Master Yi is too powerful? The thing is, Master Yi is like Kog'Maw in that when he has a composition built around him, he will absolutely carry games. Otherwise he will fail. But unlike Kog'Maw, people tend to not build comps around Yi because he is not the bot lane ADC. People don't realize that it is not just the ADC that can be the hypercarry. I get that this strategy can also be done with champions like Twitch, but there is a reason why Master Yi is the most efficient choice. He is a champion that has insane amounts of sustained damage with true damage against tanks, great attack speed and movement speed steroids, outplay potential, and immunity to attack speed slows. All he needs is things that can make up for his weakness; Vulnerability to burst damage and CC. Guess what? There are many champions that can help him in that regard. Taric, Morgana, Kayle, etc. Taric can even ""provide"" Master Yi with hard CC, another thing that he lacks. I wouldn't be against Riot just nerfing Master Yi. Or better yet, reworking him because he is a ball of stats (especially with ult up)."

Disclaimer: This concept have a LARGE words. Kring was born in the dirty blocks of the waste level of Zaun. His mother worked in a Shoe factory, and his father was a scraper. The large family barely made ends meet. No wonder Kring learned to beg and steal early. He was expected by a sad fate to live on the city day, working for pennies in factories and getting drunk as a father. However, Kring had ambitions, perseverance, and a striking talent for learning and hands grew from the right place. He set himself a simple goal - to break out of poverty at all costs. But the incredible anger on others, is constantly spurred to it. Kring's father brought home scrap, got drunk and beat his sons with his fists. Most of his discoveries were useless junk, but some of the invention it is possible to fix it. Recovering from the next cuffs, Kring did not spare the time to figure out how and what works. Soon he realized-you can not only fix, but also to make their own improvements. And since the materials were in excess, Kring was accustomed to make the most of any little thing. Kring's father, though he was a drunkard, still thought of turning it to his advantage. So Kring began to repair things day and night in a miniature workshop. Of course he didn't get a dime for his work. But Kring was freed from the routine work and sometimes visited the mezzanine level of Zaun, gaining experience from the best masters of the underground city. Soon his spotted one greedy master (greedy people according to Kring always stood in his way). Seeing the boy's talent, he bought it and made an apprentice. It was during this period of his life Kring whole heart hated Piltover. The arrogant surface dwellers stuffed their pockets and lived in fabulous luxury while the likes of him languished in tight quarters with the rats. Pileski could breathe without fear of chemical poisoning. Sounzan they contemptuously threw the garbage and leftovers. Of course, such a scenario seemed Cringe grossly unfair. Life on the mezzanine level had its drawbacks, but the poor from the sewage level would seem lucky to be able to settle there. Kring didn't rely on luck  only on his own strength. For the implementation of personal plans he needed a lot of money. His climb the criminal ladder started small. At first, Kring was selling drugs, but realizing that he could synthesize drugs on his own, he moved to the laboratory. Alchemy was harder, but he mastered this science. Making progress, eventually Kring was promoted to assistant chem-Baron. In this he helped a small hobby - the elimination of competitors. Kring each time tried to exceed himself, inventing all new mechanisms death. Enemies died from traps disguised as harmless things. Once he became the boss's confidant, there was no release from the enemies, which allowed him to sharpen the skill of killing to perfection. Soon even the boss rightly began to fear Cringe. His life had improved greatly. Kring became a wealthy man, having accumulated a decent fortune for the time of work for the Baron's chemical and even managed to marry several times (and divorce). But having reached the wealth and power, he simply could not stop. His ego grew and demanded more. Kring's activities have grown to incredible proportions-weapons, drugs, fake money, even a hex-Jack. He was already preparing an attempt on his boss and tried on the laurels of the winner, when he was ahead. Kim Baron learned about the activities of Kring, and fearing that he would put under himself the entire criminal business Zaun decided to eliminate a competitor. Kring was captured, all his wealth was taken and sent to an underground mine - ""Pit"". Mining minerals hid behind a real slaveholding Empire, where thousands of kidnapped people languished. At the same time, secret laboratories and weapons workshops were located in the Pit. It was one of these objects sent Kring, unaware that He had already conceived a plan of escape. For all the devilish ingenuity king knew that he would never get out of the"" pit "" alone. Fortunately, he was relieved of the need to look for helpers. At that time, Kring was addressed to eliminate prisoners and even supervisors. One mustachioed gentleman was eager to get out. Having realized that the mechanic can arrange it, he came into contact with him. The determination of the man immediately liked the King, and in his eyes he realized - that can be trusted. It was not difficult to gather volunteers. Collect bombs - is more difficult. Explosives have Cringe no problems. The pit was mined himtek-explosive chemical, which sent the old Zaun to the seabed. It was necessary to calculate the power of the explosion, so as not to go to the forefathers ahead of time. Working in workshops, king had a special status and was released from heavy work. He carefully searched the workshops, warehouses and laboratories. The safety in the Pit was not smooth. Partly because the hard labor was deep underground. It was possible to get to Tuta by a few lifts. That's when Kring met Bucks. The big man was lying in the laboratory connected to the life support apparatus. An augmented thug could be a great help in the escape. It was only necessary to withdraw him from a comatose state to get them on their side. Beliefs, and if need - wash brains. Fortunately, there were the necessary skills and equipment at hand. Happiness brains of the Dollar was not damaged too much and he could tight, but to think. Apparently the surgery didn't go well. But still the big guy kept his mind. In one word-an ideal partner. It was not difficult to get into trust. Kring spent a lot of time putting in order the mechanisms that useless lab technicians hastily installed the Dollar. When his comrades revolted, charges began to break in different parts of the block. There was a real chaos among the guards. The convicts were able to recapture part of the mine. Kring was captured in the ill-fated laboratory when he was preparing to escape. Someone must have followed his actions. Kring was about to be subjected to a forced vivisection, when suddenly there was a sound of tearing tubes and wires. Buck came in handy. He painted the wall with two guards, and the third, who threatened to spoil the face of the King, crushed his head with his fingers. From the back thugs Cringe gave a great view. Using a homemade nail gun and brute force, they fought their way out. Because of this brawl, Kring did not have time to arrive at the appointed time. The moustache and the rest had to use the bustle and run without it. Kring didn't have time to regret it. Even if they took part of the mine, hundreds of people will not last long without food and water. The taskmasters should have just waited. In addition, the separated prisoners will not be able to resist the guards who are armed to the teeth. Kring had to do what he could not stand  to lead. On his happiness in the very moment emerged a new player. A foreign prisoner-executioner in the past, he terrified all the convicts, but Kring was not afraid of him. However, the foreigner also did not show fear, although it would be worth it. Kring thought it would be wiser to throw off his boss position. As time has shown, it was the right decision. The new boss was crazier and angrier than anyone Kring had ever seen (and he saw plenty). In the end, blowing up the house of chemicals, they opened the way to the city. Wealth was no longer his life's goal, although Kring did not give it up. Using a huge influence among the escaped prisoners, he often makes forays into the dumps and the warehouses of Chimbarongo.

Bax, The Homie A short BIO.(author GoodLar) A monster  half man half machine, smashed, Bax growth is almost three meters. Its appearance is terrifying, both enemies and allies. In the past, a violent criminal, Bax was damaged by the attack, completely bereft of memories. In General, by its nature, Bax good-natured guy. Only easily falls under someone else's influence and his current social circle is not very conducive to good deeds. By the will of fate, he was in the pit and contacted Kring-a dangerous criminal and part-talented mechanic. Keeping track of the new sidekick, the Bax did not once pulled the old Cringe out of this mess. Detailed history.(author GoodLar) Bax are silly good man with great physical strength, everywhere following Kingom. His body is covered with numerous scars and prostheses. Despite the incredible physical strength, repeatedly reinforced with prostheses and mechanisms, Bax is not different in mind. But that wasn't always the case. When Bax was a cruel robber who gained notoriety on the Zaun streets. The eldest son of the chemical Baron, Bax from childhood had all and all the roads in front of him were open. Even in his youth, his strength was manifested  he could bend nails with his bare hands and break the skin. The father was proud of his firstborn, wishing that he would become a decent man and was able to break into Piltover. However, felts family heritage felts surrounding Bax criminal environment impact. He joined a gang whose members were mostly from low-income families at the mezzanine level. Because Bax stood out among them. Together they were engaged in robbery for the sake of thrills. Relatives of Bax knew about this, doing everything to protect my son from the problems. Impunity finally gave the gang hands. Their actions became more and more terrible. Residents of the waste level called them ""crazy thugs"". Sooner or later the thugs would have to pay for the sins. And such day came. One day, walking along the black lines in search of the victim's Bax missed the homies. He was not afraid of anyone, because at hand was a ""barrel"" and a huge physical strength, even without mechanical prostheses. But from what he had to face, did not help any weapons or force. At their heels was a long hunter, he was attracted by the smell of blood, which soaked Bax for years of atrocities. However, the pursuer was not a man. A huge monster attacked from the darkness. Swift and deadly, the beast lashed out at Bax like a bullet, breaking his ribs and bursting into flesh. Usually the attack ends, but Bax was strong small. In this situation, he only had to kill the attacker, Bax promptly did. Snatching a hefty knife, he began to hole the belly of the creature with the fury of a Berserker. Pouring a Bax of poisonous blood, in agony, the beast tore the bully's right hand. Came to the rescue ""thugs"" was taken Bax to the hospital, but did not find the carcass of her attacker. Baxs Father used all his wealth and power to cure his son. He took a Bax to the best doctors, even turned to alternative medicine. The blood of the beast entered Bax's wounds and poisoned him. Doctors did a disappointing conclusion Bax fell into a coma. The last hope was a young specialist in prosthetics, who, according to rumors, could return the dead to life. Chemical Baron promised for the salvation of the son of a huge amount and threatened with brutal punishment for making a mistake. The mechanic just said that he would do everything possible, but does not promise success. He had to replace most of the organs with mechanisms, and the bones were fused with steel. While working with the body of Bax had changed. It grew unnaturally fast, preventing mechanic attempts. After a long and tiring work, he still managed to make Bax a new flawless body. However, the mechanic warned the Baron's chem that the poisons had irreversibly injured the brain. Waking up, Bax can completely lose memories or even personality. Such a result did not suit the Baron's chemical at all. He left the lab saying he would find someone who could give his son back his identity. The operation on the human brain even in Zaun was considered illegal. Because the chemical Baron went to underground mine ""the Pit"", where the constraints are not acted at all, and most importantly it was full of test subjects. Bax was taken to a secretly equipped laboratory and connected to a life support device. Under the knife doctors got a lot of prisoners and enemies of Chemical baron, they got a lot of valuable information, but no closer to the task at hand. It was at that moment Bax was noticed by Kring -- a prisoner, a former master, overheard conversations of scientists while sweeping the floor. And at the same time Kring looked after what parts can be quietly pulled. According to Bax's brains, he could be awakened, but his identity and memories would be erased. Kring decided to turn it to his advantage and began to inspect the equipment. Knowledge of mechanics and intuitive understanding of the technique told him how to act. He decided to use the mechanical parts of the Buck. Kring found out that the big guy had a lot in common with the Golems. This allowed to use the vulnerability inherent in the machines and affect the mind of Bax. Bax's brain was like a blank sheet, as if It had just been born. Kring has written a new Chapter, at the root of the forest past the giant, but that retain the basic memories. No matter how hard the mechanic tried to erase everything, the deepest memories are preserved. Then he went ""a roundabout."" He compelled Bax into thinking he was his older brother. They worked together, looting and robberies, and had acquired a bad reputation. Once they were hired by a scientist from Zaun, but it was an ambush. So they were in the ""Pit"". Kring spent all his free time on the thug not because of interest or good intentions. His accomplices were preparing a Grand escape. So, just in case, Kring decided to improvise and prepare a plan ""B"", in case someone should come out. This decision was correct. His accomplices do not spill the beans, but Kingom installed surveillance. The wardens are too late. The mechanics were caught in the laboratory when he had already completed the basic preparations and made improvements. Cringe already wanted to operate on the brain, suddenly a series of explosions rocked the ground. Escape started. The confused guards had allowed the mechanics to yell a code phrase -- ""BAAAAAX AMBUSH! At first, nothing happened, but the installed vulnerability worked. Though with a delay, the team was transferred to the brain of the bully. Before Bax spun fictional and true memories. He finally woke up from a coma. So, finally died the Bucks past and the new born. Heard the crackle of bursting hoses and crashing steel. This giant hurried to the aid of his sidekick. The guards holding Kring he just threw against the wall. Scientist, threatened the man, grabbed his head with a huge hand and crushed the poor thing's head. Plan "" B "" came into effect. The people of him Baron raised the alarm in the laboratory and hurried to stop the fugitives. Started a mess. Mechanical bull took down everything that stood in his way. Not behind him and Kring, showering the room with fire from a homemade gun. Even if you managed to hurt the big man, the wounds in his organic parts heal with astonishing speed. A clever mechanic was always hiding behind this human shield. Breaking free Baxconstantly follows a friend who became his personal mechanic and a new friend. Armed with the core found in the dump on the chain, as if he deftly wielded it, without Kring, the thrust to destruction gradually weakens. Sometimes Bax dreams of his forgotten past, but the only thing he sees clearly is the moment of the attack. The big guy knows for sure, the beast who tried to kill him in the past, survived and lives somewhere in the Zaun. Bax believes -- when he and Kring destroy this source of nightmares. In the meantime, he's enjoying life on the outside. In the end, what could be better than a faithful partner, intoxicating Braga and delicious food? Only a good fight. And fists at Buck are always at the ready Bax's Abilities Passive 1; homelike:In the beginning of the game, Bax chooses ""mates"" and links his chain with spikes. The maximum length of the chain 800/900/1050( 1/6/11 levels, respectively), passing between the Bax and ""homie"" (that is, hitting the chain, in Russian speaking), the enemy Champions slow down by 30/50/65% for 1.5 seconds and they are dealt physical damage equal to 25/30/45% of the total hell ""sidekick""for 4 seconds. The same champion re-takes damage from the chains if he touches them 7 seconds after the initial interaction. Passive 2: is support also can not afford to upgrade devices?. Are you worse than Kring? You also have the following improvements in the store, though you can choose only one( not you the same rink-then drag, e-my).

If the target of the skill is a Union champion, the barks, after the throw, increases the movement speed of the ally by 15/18/21/23/25 (+5% for every 1000 additional HP) for 5 seconds (the effect weakens over time). If the target is an enemy champion. the barks deals 100/120/150/200/220+ 5% extra health, slowing Champions by 60% for 2 seconds( slowdown weakens over time). Cost 10% current HP at all levels, KD 10/9/8/7/5 seconds at all levels. W; Heavy burden; Passive; your attacks cause 2%+(1% for 1000hp) from the current HP target and restore health by an amount equal to 25%. from the damage. Active: you pull the chain to save your ally, after pulling your ""sidekick"" crashes into you and you will be stunned for 0.3 seconds. The rate of attraction is 500.

E; breaking bad ;Favorite bowl of Dollar-a dangerous weapon and without magic. The buck whirls with the ball on the chain for 3 seconds, becoming immune to control (Ala + ). Enemies take less damage from the chain and extra damage from the ball. When you press again, the Buck will fly in the direction of the ball. Upon colliding with an enemy champion it stuns for 1.75 seconds (he applied 120/135/150/175/220 (+10% of extra HP) magic damage) to Enemies caught near the site of the fall is applied to 15/19/22/24/27% less damage for 3 seconds..

Active: barks takes his ""sidekick"" in his hands, then he runs it in any direction, at a distance not exceeding the length of the chain. If barks hits an enemy champion, he deals physical damage equal to 100/150/250% of his friend's extra HELL, and barks ' sidekick, like Draven's axe, bounces off the enemy champion and is preempted at the marked point. If barks catches his ""sidekick"", Ulta roll back on 35/45/55%, if other Barks is Kring, then under apprehending he automatically leaps once on back .During the flight, the friends are invulnerable.

Heavy flow: the champion with a big LAKE . Slow flight speed. Short range. Average damage. Large area of damage. The effect of a concussion: Enemies caught near the site of the fall is applied to 15/20/25% less damage for 3 sec "
70,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,An Idea For Reworking Banner of Command,1,8qdg0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8qdg0q/an_idea_for_reworking_banner_of_command/,2018-06-12 07:55:30,"Hey guys, I've just posted an idea on the boards ([URL and wanted to run it by here just for max visibility. I'll copy/paste the idea, thanks in advance! **Intro** Hey guys, I had an idea for reworking BoC that I thought I'd share and get some feedback on to see if we can maybe shift the item into a better and more interactive place. Any numbers/ranges etc are pretty hypothetical, I'm not a game designer/balancer and the point is really to spitball the idea to see if it's something useable. I'll try to format this to make it a bit more readable. One of the issues with the old BoC is that it was very uninteractive. It require little input from the user and often pulled a member of the enemy team to lane which usually made it way easier for you to do Baron or take another objective. I'd like to see BoC become an item which revolves around seigeing. Right now it seems that the only way that people win games is by dancing around/taking Baron (which is great, there should defo be a large objective which heavily rewards a team for getting it) but it has lead, I feel, to the game feeling a bit predictable in how teams go about actually winning the game (get turret to open map \- vision \- baron \- end, to over simplify). I think this change could also address this and give teams another way to win the game. **Idea** The change would work something like this; activating banner would place a marker (resembling a planted flag) on the map. This marker would have 5hp (like the old Pink Ward, so would require 5 autos to kill) and its effect would have a radius of 550\-650 units (again, not a set figure or anything). The item would cause any minions within the radius to deal 10\-50&amp;#37; more damage to structures and take 5\-25&amp;#37; less damage from turrets and champions (the number would scale with how many friendly champions are within the range). The active would have a rather large cooldown (210\-240s) and the marker would perish after an amount of time (30\-45s). The item's stats should be quite cost\-ineffective also. Providing only a small amount of armour/hp (such as 40/200) to prevent it from being a 1 item wonder. Perhaps rather radically the item would have a **global team\-wide cooldown** in order to discourage Top/Jung/Supp from buying it when far ahead and pushing to end super early. **What Does This Achieve?** So I think an item like this presents a lot of interesting gameplay. First, it encourages grouping up when ahead to try and press an advantage; the effect of the Banner is stronger when you're whole team is there making it ideal to break open something like Mid turret and then move to an objective like Dragon or Baron. Similarly, it is less effective when used in a side lane by a split pusher as they cannot take it with them and offers minimal use when used by only 1 champion. Secondly this can also help games from dragging on if the enemy team drafts mega waveclear comp (such as Azir/Sivir) as the ability could stack with Baron buff making 'passive' waveclearing (where you do not interact with your enemy in order to be able to kill a wave) very difficult. The counter\-play to such an item would be quite simple: hard enagage. The item shares the same vulnerability that seigeing without Baron has always held, namely being flanked and engaged on by the enemy team. The marker itself is static meaning that the enemy team have to be quite close together to get full effect. The banner would also have to be somewhat close to the enemy tower if the enemy team wanted it to effect every minion which could leave it vulnerable to long\-range ADs (Cait). Similarly, ADs with engage (Ashe/Varus/Jhin) can help facilitate a fight for the objective. **Possible Shortcomings** One potential outcome of such an item existing is that it becomes too effective when combined with Baron and simply becomes a ""win more"" button. Eg, it is only useful when super far ahead, rendering it somewhat redundant. I think that this could certainly be addressed in some ways. One way could be that it did not effect minions with the Baron buff which would solidify the item's identity as that of one used to accrue a lead and not to multiply it. Alternately, the item's range could scale with what enemy turret is nearest. Eg, when nearest an enemy Outer Turret the range could be large like 700\+ but when near an Inhibitor Turret it could be much smaller, such as 450\-500. This again would emphasise it as an item to 'get you going' so to speak and would give the enemy team more opportunities for counterplay the more you managed to take from them. Thanks for taking the time to read, I'm looking forward to hearing what everyone had to say! \~Daro."
71,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,How to fix tank items,0,8cqwea,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/8cqwea/how_to_fix_tank_items/,2018-04-17 06:47:43,"I was reading the Wingsofdeath thread. [synkronized](URL made a really good point on the state of tank items: &gt;That's because the core 3 Crit items build makes 1 point of AD worth 4 Damage thanks to the effect of multipliers. &gt; &gt;As a result, there's no way a Tank will survive a 6 item ADC unless he's unkillable by everything else. Every season, whenever adc's are strong in the meta. This issue always comes up. And it will continue to come up unless we get serious reform. Crit isn't going away. ADC's love big numbers. Riot loves adc's wallets. Riot needs to take a page from Battlerite. Tanks in Battlerite are not inherently tanky. They are tanky because of their abilties. If you use your abilities incorrectly/abilites are on cd. You die. Instead of having non\-interactive stat boosts as items. Lets tack on abilities. Ability items already exist! **Gargoyle Stoneplate** is a great item. There is a limited duration. There is a drawback. There is a window of vulnerability. Thus, there is counterplay. Many offensive items have defensive abilities: hexdrinker, edge of night, banshee's, zhonya's. **Randuin Omen/Spirit Visage** are bad items. Big chunk of stats. Nothing an opponent can do besides continue\-to\-hit. Boring. *How can we improve these items?* **Direction\-aware** Shields should only give you armor on your frontside. It makes sense doesn't it? If you turn around and run like a pussy. You shouldn't get free armor. If a tank gets in a scrap with a bruiser. He should be able to tank\-him\-on. But, there should be counterplay. He is forced to stand his ground. Thus, risk incoming reinforcement. If Gragas ults Sejuani into 5 players. Sejuani shouldn't be like: ""lol ima tank"" and q away. If she tries to run, turning her back towards 5 players. She should die. We could also have armor that protects our backs. Good for running away. Fck you Shaco. **Channel\-based** Similar to the rune [Predator](URL You only get your armor/magic resist if no one interrupted your channeling. If Malphite is standing in a warded bush getting ready to engage. The counterplay is to poke him and interrupt the channel. Thus denying a tanky engage. **Bone Platting** Similar to the rune [Bone Plating](URL Tanks need to be weary of poke that waste the proc. There are windows of vulnerability. Counterplay! **Counter items** This is a Battlerite thing. Many melee champs have counter abilities. It's a 1\-2 buff. If they get autoattacked during this 1\-2 window, they get bonus stats. Not sure how well this can transition to LoL items. **In** **Conclusion** People always complain about how braindead tank play is. Let's make tank play more interesting! Let's allow junglers to visit top lane in tank vs tank matchups. Since tanks can actually be killed when running away."
72,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,A Bottom Lane Reimagined,0,89vjji,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/89vjji/a_bottom_lane_reimagined/,2018-04-05 11:22:28,"Let me preface this by saying I know nothing about game design/balance from a creators standpoint, so some of these ideas may not be feasible or make sense outside of my imagination. Riot has expressed many times their wishes of opening bottom lane up to other choices in the farm role. This role is traditionally, solely filled by marksmen. And while which flavor of marksmen changes, its always been marksmen. In my ~6 years of playing this game, Ive only experienced 3 times where a non-marksman was routinely chosen for the bot-lane in high-elo and/or pro play: -Juggernaut reworks, when Mordekaiser was disgustingly overtuned -Ziggs bot meta. I actually really enjoyed this -Release of Runes overhaul. Bot lane was a shitshow of Jayce and TF and any other siege mage that could abuse comet/scorch/manaflow. Period 3 is arguably the most diverse the position has ever been, but it was incredibly unhealthy and made the majority of an entire class obsolete. This brings me to my next point: Riot has hinted many times, before outright saying so last year, that they wanted the position opened up. Mordekaisers rework was focused on putting him botlane. Yasuo, while not explicitly stated anywhere, feels like a prototype to a melee adc. Kindreds team looked to have them play adc from the jungle, while allowing for experimental or non-traditional champions to farm botlane with a support. Quinns changes were in a similar vain, only with top and mid. None of these changes held the desired impact on the game. While, over the years, marksmen have successfully found alternative roles, the botlane role has not opened up to other classes. I dont know what the role needs, or other classes need to achieve a diverse lane, but I have a few ideas, and would love to hear yours as well. Here are a few classes I would like to see/play in the bot lane: Melee ADC this class is a fighter subclass that are standardly attack speed or triforce focused. This class will be abused early by marksmen due to lack of range and vulnerability to kiting, and so I think they need a method of dealing with this in gap closers or survivability. They also need to be capable of smashing towers similar to marksmen. Champions that currently fit this class: Jax Tryndamere Master Yi Irelia Xin Zhao Yasuo Aatrox (due to be reworked tho) Fiora Siege/Artillery/Poke mages This class can be AP, or AD. AD siege mages, however, need desperate help atm, and fall very flat. This class should be able to poke and abuse their opponent in lane, but be vulnerable to ganks, all-ins, and sustainability in both hp and mana. AP: Ziggs Lux Twisted Fate Xerath AD: Jayce Miscellaneous  other champions I think could work bottom, and honestly Im not sure whats stopping some of them currently. Kayle AD/On-Hit TF Azir Cassiopeia Gangplank Kennen Teemo Sorry for the wall of text, but lmk your thoughts! "

I get that you want them to be a sort of yin-yang, but maybe instead using a brighter pink/lilac color gradient for Rakan on top of the white, removing the dark gray-purple tones, and then crimson/burgundy gradients for Xayah would get the same stark change in color between the two without pulling away from the theme. Her main hair color should be changed to a dark crimson or burgundy/maroon which fits way better with her character and keeps her from straying into the territory of an uncanny Ahri. The single-color-hair doesn't suit Xayah anyway without her hood to balance out the colors, and Rakan's hair being such a starchy white with no contrast is a huge step in the wrong direction from his usual blonde with a red tuft. (**No black. Only dark purples**) The reason Rakan's white color is fine and can be worked with is because it's present in most of the previous valentines skins. Black and blue-toned colors are not, and should be avoided at all costs. This can be likened to adding green. Important: Blue tones do NOT have a place in this skin set. The black used in Xayah's hair and stockings is from the blue family. These need to lean more towards red, aka purple. Another issue arises with saturation, all the valentines skins are highly saturated and these two are just dull. Extremely dull. The saturation needs to be upped quite a bit for these to fit in. --**My Changes**-- .:Connection and Colors:. Some of the first changes I made were color for a reason. I've taken the whole image and saturated it by 28, then changed Xayah's dress and their hair colors. The way I've achieved the same 'opposites making one whole' theme goes as follows: I've given Rakan a light to dark hair gradient, and Xayah a dark to light. Next, I've stripped the stocking off of Xayah's left leg and Rakan's sleeve off of his right arm. I then added a golden spiral down from her garter and one up from his gauntlet/glove on those respective areas, basically pulling their hips together. Xayah is the right wing and Rakan is the left, so when standing together they create a whole bird silhouette. I played off that by also adding a shoulder accessory to both her right shoulder and his left, which I'll go over in their respective areas. These changes pull them together in a more obvious way, and I think this way you can really feel that they're meant to be completing each other and their most vulnerable side is where their partner should be. I'm a sucker for details like these. --**The Issue**-- .:Thematics:. The use of a card theme is way too dominant, really it shouldn't be there at all. It's not used even once in other valentines skins, and also is already presented in the High Stakes skin set, and that causes these two skins to now look exactly at home there. **See what I mean here  URL ** When in a group with other valentines skins they don't fit at all and look extremely out of place due to both this and the color issues. The one big thing that definitely needs to be changed; the card theme has got to be toned down for these skins to truly fit in and be some of the better skins in the game. --**My Changes**-- .:Thematics:. I've removed some of the card-motif by editing Xayahs accents along the bottom of each of her cape feathers to be a true heart, and also added a chevron to further accentuate it and keep the fanciness that was originally there. Next, I removed Rakan's sleeves fully. This exposes his arms and that alone gives Rakan more of a flirtatious appearance. I know some people want him to be shirtless, but I don't think that'll help these skins without turning him into a stripper. :) I extended his white glove on his left arm to cover more of his skin there and leave the vulnerability to only the right side, we talked about the reason why earlier. The puffy sleeve is a cute thing on Sweetheart Annie, but here on Rakan it eludes to a jester, especially with the colors. It also pulls away from his theme as a charmer and to be honest makes him look like a clown. I've decided to go with a much more prince charming style pauldron attached to his cape and resting on his shoulder. I added more definition to his cape with a golden trim around each feather, the way Xayah's is, and to help them match better I'm also going to add a faint feather texture similar to hers as well. This will also help add more detail to the bland gradient covering 90% of his cape. --**The Issue**-- .:Silhouette:. This next problem is a rather big one that happens a lot with skins. A rioter on twitter mentioned the team wanting to fix it, and I hope my explanation helps. Xayah needs her silhouette back. It was removed by taking away her shoulder piece and hood, I highly suggest elaborating on the existing hairpiece. You need to replace her bird skull with his golden feathers that she has in her classic skin. She's now missing this and it already takes away from her character but namely changes her silhouette. **Silhouette:  URL ** Rakans hair is simply out of character and weird. I see his silhouette as more as a Vladimir skin than Rakan simply due to the hair and those jester-puffs he had before I removed them. --**My Changes**-- .:Silhouette:. My solution to this was to extend on the minimalistic crown she has by giving it roses beneath it, which places it higher atop her head. I can't draw them too well but they should look like how the one Rakan holds does. I emphasized the shape of the beginning of Xayahs cape to flare out more in the feather-style, which gives her that defining edge shes missing. Lastly, I gave her a pauldron as mentioned earlier, and the one Rakan now has also fixes his silhouette. With Rakan Im opting to change his hair to a curlier and more laid-back version of his classic hair. **Hair Test:  URL ** --**Why do you care?**-- Because I just want to help and Ive been waiting for new skins :) I can see why youd wonder though. I'll tell you a little about why my opinions are the way they are and who I am so maybe I prove to be a little more knowledgeable, I'm an art enthusiast and hobbyist, a gamer, and I play a crap ton of league. I'm a graphic designer, a big color theory fanatic, and a practicing wanna-be concept artist. My league background: Doesn't matter much but I do care about this game a lot. I've been playing it since mid season 2, and I'm more than proud of how far it's come. I'm an adc main, so that means Xayahs under my belt. I've played a considerable amount of Rakan as well. Xayah is my second main, first being Jhin. I'm nowhere near the best, or even considerably good at any of these things, but I'm trying my hardest. Also, my English isn't all that great but I hope I do this justice :^) --**Conclusion**-- I had a lot of fun writing this post and I believe these sorts of things help me get some experience analyzing for potential future concept artist work. Regardless of if any of these changes are made, I hope they perhaps give some insight into some things either the community or Riot was looking for feedback or ideas on. I appreciate anyone bearing through my post and I hope yall have a great night! --**Misc**-- --**Notes**-- According to Riot Kitty Kiosk, the puffy sleeves will stay, but Im going to continue with my edit as planned regardless. URL I can stream progress on these occasionally if anyone's interested. "

An In-Depth Guide by Chay Kun.",472,7dlfe1,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7dlfe1/kindred_the_eternal_hunters_and_how_to_tame_them/,2017-11-18 01:51:18,"*Kindred, the Eternal Hunters; and How to Tame them. An In-Depth Guide by Chay Kun.* **-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** **Introductions.** Good evening! before I get into the meat of the guide, I feel (and have been told.) that it's important to give you some context on who I am. As such. Hey, my alias is Chay Kun I've been playing League of Legends ever since season two. During my time playing league, I've spent most of the seasons in diamond, but never push much past that. This is for a variety of reasons. However lately it's been because I spend most of my time theorycrafting, analysing and working in relation to League. I've done coaching, casting &amp; written pieces for various people at various times. However, I'm not content with that anymore. As such am going to be pursuing higher elo as a player during season eight. With that said, and the preseason lasting about two months, all the more time to test it with! I hit my highest elo (Diamond 2) during the last time that Kindred was viable, partly because I am a player with decent Jungle and Marksman experience but also because of the passion I had for the champion. Ever since their tease, I was heavily invested in the champion, she reminded me of everything I loved and wanted in the game (particularly reminding me of Princess Mononoke, my favourite film.) something I do and am known to do is overanalyse the ever living hell out of League of Legends, Kindred was no exception to this rule, especially as I had a passion for them. They weren't getting a free pass! I'm here today to have a formal written post/thread for discussion on Kindred, and analysis. I, obviously, will be providing my take. HOWEVER. I would like to stress the openness in this thread, and offer up a space for all of you to give your insight as well! (Note there is a good chance I may disagree and spark a discussion about it, but it's all friendly) So without further ado, I'll cut the introductions and get on with the 'guide' **-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------** **Introducing Kindred, the Eternal Hunters.** Im making this segment to the guide purely to give players/people who have never heard of nor played Kindred some context as to what they are. Firstly, and IMPORTANTLY, NEVER, EVER, use the wrong pronoun for Kindred. Like RekSai, the second you use the wrong pronoun youll be swarmed with comments saying something along the lines of. &gt; *SNIFF* Actually, the correct pronoun is THEY, if you could please stop miscategorising my champion I think we would all be able to take you more seriously. All jokes aside. Kindred is, in all forms, a Jungle champion. However! She is a unique champion, in that she was the first *true* Marksman Jungler. These days she has contention from Graves, Ezreal and the like. But they've always had differences from the traditional Marksman role. Kindred stays true to the role. In order to make proper use of their kit, you must be able to utilise decent Marksman micro, be it positioning, auto-placement, target prioritisation, stutter stepping, animation cancelling, etc. However, do not be deterred, these are skills that you will develop over time, that are necessary and encouraged to learn in League of Legends as a whole. And she is a great champion to learn them on, especially if you also simultaneously wish to learn Jungle fundamentals as well. The other aspect that defines Kindred would be their passive. Kindreds passive places marks on jungle camps and enemy champions, these stacks give benefits to Kindred. Adding an incentive/minigame to both teams in the game. Efficiently getting these stacks, whilst not getting tunnel visioned is a huge part of being successful on Kindred. **So, to summarise.** **Kindred is the first, true Marksman Jungler. you should pick them up if you like the idea of this. on top of this fact, they also have a really interesting dynamic with their passive. that adds a layer of depth to Kindred that not many champions have. Whilst Kindred, being a marksman does rely on decent micro play. There is no huge barrier to entry with their micro. Kindred is a champion which relies incredibly heavily on good Jungle &amp; Marksman fundamentals. As such she's a great champion to practice these on, and a great champion to flourish with once you've got them nailed.** **---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** **Base stats.** [](URL I feel a healthy place to start when analysing a champion would be to take a look at their base stats. And with Kindred, it really does show the design that they were trying to go with. Giving them the stats of a traditional Marksman more so than a traditional Jungler. Important or noteworthy stats to talk about will get a full paragraph. However, ones after that point will be talked about more briefly. **Movement Speed.** One of the most important base stats available to Junglers is Movement Speed (MS). This is important for a plethora of reasons, be it; pathing, farming, ganking, positioning, pressuring, etc! Movement speed is important. This is one of Kindred's biggest problem areas, as she has **325 base movement speed** this is tied with Ivern for the lowest MS of any of the viable Jungle champions. This is clearly an intentional design aspect from Riot, as she and Ivern both have interesting interactions with the jungle and both have an interesting role as a Jungler, Kindred's being as a Marksman. However, this does not exclude their want for good base MS, as it is needed for all Jungle and Marksman fundamentals (the Marksman fundamentals are patched up with bonus MS later on though. On top of this, Kindred doesn't have traditional pathing, as they will prioritise predictions on stacks, and obtaining them. Having a higher base MS would help them in this regard. Which might have been broken in the past, however with the new stack system in place, they do not **hyper-scale** as much as they used to and as such could probably take an MS buff. **Armor.** Another stat which is incredibly important for most traditional Jungle champions. Armor basically decides if your champion will be able to survive the Jungle, and typically dictate how healthily they do their first (and latter) clears. Kindred, once again falls to one of the lowest base armour tiers in the game **(29 +3.5 per level)**, comparable to Ivern once again. However! Once again, just like Ivern, they have reasons for this. Kindred, being the first Marksman Jungler has the ability to kite camps, and it is entirely possible that you can clear both Red and Blue buffs whilst taking next to no damage. This makes their clear feel similar to Nidalee, and other micro based Junglers. Which can be both exciting and intimidating, as screwing up your Jungle micro can drastically impact the pace of the game. Some will see their low base armour as a challenge and be enticed. Others will be put off by this and avoid champions with this aspect. I personally, really enjoy it. Their scaling can be described, like most of the rest of their stats, as pretty average for Marksmen. **Other Base Stats.** The rest of Kindred's base stats can be described as pretty average and reasonable. For a Jungler, who has aspects of a Marksman, none of their base stats stands out as extraordinary, in fact. They are, across the board pretty unimpressive. But none of them are bad enough to make their unviable, as such I would say that they're in a relatively good spot of balance when referring to their base stats. If anything, their Base numbers could do with slight tweaks on the positive side. With that said though, they don't really need them at this point as they're managing to find themselves in a good place viability wise and can have really great success reliably with their base stats being the way they are right now. **-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** **Passives and Abilities.** After looking at the Base Stats of a champion the next thing to analyse would be the champions **Passives and Abilities**. We'll be taking a look at what they are, the relevance of the numbers surrounding them and what they enable Kindred to do, I'll also talk briefly about some of the synergies that the abilities have with builds etc, but that will be furthered in the relevant part of the guide. **Passive: Mark of the Kindred.** [](URL Kindred's passive is inarguably one of the most defining parts of their kit, it defines how they path, and the pressure that they have on the map, without even having to do anything. Simply put Kindred's passive allows you to mark enemy champions and periodically marks enemy/neutral Jungle Camps. It is vitally important that you learn which camps will be marked, and can predict your pathing based upon this knowledge to stack efficiently. Killing a marked target gives Kindred a stack. Mark of the Kindred stacks grant Kindred's auto attacks bonus range, and their abilities gain bonus effects. I'll now list the full benefits of their passive in full once I have discussed the ability that they are attached to. * Auto Attack; Kindred gains +75 range once they gain 4 stacks. And after that +25 range for every additional 3 stacks. Capping at +250 range at 25 stacks. Some people don't even realise that Kindred no longer gains on-hit %health damage from her passive on autos. This is important. Kindred's new version of the auto attack passive is interesting, being one of the few auto attack range modifiers in the game. In a typical game, you'll gain at least +100 range. This gives Kindred one of the biggest auto ranges in the game toward the mid stages of the game, and easily the largest if you stack correctly in the late stages of the game. This allows them to siege, contest objectives, harras, etc. at an incredibly safe distance. This is even more important when you realise that you can pressure people inside of your ultimate with them knowing you have range creep on them, forcing them into a scenario where they are less comfortable in your ult than you are. Meaning most of the time, if played correctly you will win any 1v1 inside of your ultimate and if played correctly feel almost completely impervious to being all inned, but also punish half-assed all ins insanely hard. As if they try to retreat you can auto them from a safe distance and run them down. Kindred's new auto attack interaction with her passive isn't quite as defining as it used to be, however, is still really impactful, especially when put into context with the rest of their abilities and builds. **Q: Dance of Arrows.** [](URL Kindred's Q is an incredibly useful piece of kit. Both from the perspective of a Marksman and of a Jungler. As a Jungler, one of the most important and most defining tools inside of any Junglers kit would be any abilities which provide terrain scaling. Kindred's Q provides and an insane amount of terrain scaling, with a low cooldown, and an almost non-existent mana cost the closest comparison would be Nidalee's pounce. I'll throw an image in here that shows every wall that Kindred can jump. [](URL On top having insane terrain scaling that allows Kindred great pathing/ganking options (I'll discuss terrain scaling more in the play style part of the guide.) Kindred's Q deals a good amount of damage, with a solid 65% bonus AD scaling, on a low cooldown. On top of this, their Q resets their auto attack timer, which is amazing for kiting jungle camps and champions alike, whilst dishing out a really solid amount of damage assuming that we build *some* bonus AD. However, lately, some Kindred's have been ignoring bonus AD, which I believe to be a bad call, more on that later. The last part of their Q, the bonus attack speed is better talked about with context to the bonuses given to their Q from their Passive, so I'll do that now. * Q; Dance of Arrows. Kindred gains the same bonus range that they receive on their auto attacks on their Q's effect radius. (Note this does not increase the range of the dash, but instead how far the arrows can fly.) On top of this their Q grants them 5% additional bonus attack speed per each Mark of the Kindred. Typically, in an average game, whether Kindred is ahead or behind, you should be able to gain about 10 Marks of the Kindred every game, provided that you stack correctly and efficiently, which I'll talk about later. Now with that said, Kindred's Q should be granting you almost +60% Bonus Attack Speed upon cast. This is an extremely high amount of attack speed, which is important as it allows Kindred to function as a Marksman without having to build a tonne of attack speed in her build path. Once upon a time Kindred's main damage came from her on-hit passive, so stacking attack speed wasn't a bad move what so ever, but these days building enough attack speed to function as a marksman and then grabbing bonus AD to play into her impressive scaling and safe auto attack range is a better idea, and your Q's attack speed amplifier really does help Kindred to do this without having to invest too much gold into attack speed. One of the common mistakes that I see Kindred players make is to continue building Kindred in the old traditional way. Not adapting to how she should be played these days, I'll talk more about this in the build section of the guide, however. **W: Wolf's Frenzy.** [](URL Unlike the previous two abilities, Kindred's W is not a hugely defining ability, though that is not to say that it isn't powerful. Kindred's W is amazing at all stages in the game for a verity of reasons. It can be used to scout vision over walls, is an amazingly efficient clearing tool because of the *cripple* that it applies to monsters (alongside its decent damage values.) But arguably, the most important function of Kindred's W is that it lowers the cooldown of your Q exponentially. If you mix this with the ongoing damage that is constantly being applied from your W you end up with a very powerful zoning tool as if someone is inside of it they're likely not going to be able to out trade or out fight you. As such, getting the cooldown as low as possible to keep the uptime as long as possible is vital, so we max it second and try to get early CD. (warriors, tri, bc etc, more on that later.) Ignoring all this, if we look at its scalings it not only has a 20% bonus AD scaling but also shares a 50% attack speed scaling also, which is affected by the attack speed you get from your Q and other sources we'll discuss later. * W: Wolf's Frenzy. Kindred's W gains bonus 1% current health damage for each Mark of the Kindred. Kindred's W also has an incredibly relevant %current hp scaling, meaning that her W actually does do a great job at chunking large minions/monsters and tankier champions, this only scales increasingly hard into the game as they gain more HP and you gain more stacks. All of these scalings put together, and the utility that this ability provides Kindred make this one of the less flashy, but more important parts of her kit. Positioning it well to get the most optimal Dances with your Q is really important. It can also be used to snipe kills under tower or to stop people from backing from a safe distance. Really, the better the Kindred player, the better the utilisation of your W. It's something that will come with time and practice, not something that can be taught as readily as some of the other abilities. **E: Mounting Dread.** [](URL Kindred's E is a high damage execute that is procked by hitting a target three times after the initial cast. Kindred, being a champion that innately has good attack speed and good attack range can prock this relatively easily this ability has an insanely high AD scaling of 80%, it also has the ability to crit targets for bonus damage if they're below a certain health threshold. Combine this fact with the missing health scaling and you have one of the best non-ultimate executes in the game. Like with the Q, having such a high scaling insensitive getting as much bonus AD as early as is possible, once more making Warrior an amazing option on Kindred. All of this said we're also ignoring the fact that it's a great opener in a gank and better still in duels in the jungle as it also comes with a 50% slow for 1 second to help pin a target down initially before you finish them off. Because of the incentives to take points in your Q and W, combined with most of the damage from this ability coming from scalings, we feel comfortable maxing E last giving us a nice, standard skill prioritisation of R &gt; Q &gt; W &gt; E. * E: Mounting Dread. For every Mark of the Kindred, their E does an additional 0.5% missing health damage and gains the same range bonus that your autos do from the passive. This is one of the more underwhelming passive upgrades, as the scalings are already insane, this relatively small increase doesn't stand out as much, however. It is not to say it is irrelevant. It adds up, some games you could get upwards of 20 stacks, which would be 10% bonus missing health damage, which is a considerable deal. However, just like I said before. Most of this abilities power comes from its initial scalings, making it a great 1 point spell. HOWEVER, the bonus range that your E gets given from the passive is no joke. It means you can cast it from a safe distance and run people down, and prock it in certain situations without the enemy even being able to retaliate. This being the last ability that is boosted by Mark of the Kindred I feel it is important to stress how vital it is to get as many stacks as is possible, without tunnel visioning or falling behind as a direct result. They're powerful, they're one of the main things that enable Kindred to be BETTER than other champions, without them you're just a glorified Twitch jungle without stealth. A good Kindred will constantly be thinking about where the next stack is going to be. **R: Lamb's Respite.** [](URL Kindred's ultimate is one of the single most interesting pieces of utility any jun- no, any champion gets in the game. It has a plethora of uses, and its utilisation singlehandedly decides if a Kindred player is good, or great. Understanding it's many uses, and how to best abuse it is incredibly important. First, understand that not just your allies gain the benefits, but your enemies too. So using it at the wrong time can actually turn the tide of the fight into your enemies favour, sometimes you're going to have to let an ally die whilst it's up, getting the discipline to hold this ability until the perfect moment is very important. However, it is just as important to be able to use the ability to save an ally rather than yourself, and have the self-control to use the cooldown for that reason. Once you understand when to use it the next thing to concentrate on would be HOW to make the best use of it. Firstly, understand that once you're at the 10% threshold you CANNOT gain healing. Make yourself and your allies hold all healing until the end of the ultimate and burst it to get higher HP totals than enemies that are inside of it. Also, consider that you are the one casting it, you have elective control over the ability and know exactly when it is coming down. Use your E, W and Q's wisely whilst inside of your ult, timing them to create as much pressure as possible towards the ending, but also utilising the W to deter people from leaving your ult for free. This leads to another concept, which is that with all the added ranges that you have you can use your ultimate and hit people who are standing outside of it. Using your ultimate as a zoning tool, declaring to enemy champions that they have to walk towards you, or get outranged safely and killed is a very powerful tool. The last trick that I can teach you would be to ult for objectives. Imagine the scenario... A baron fight, coming down to a 50/50, the enemy jungler jumps over the wall, about to burst and force the 50/50 with smite... You use your ultimate, preventing Baron from dying to the smite, then finish it with your own before or after dealing with the enemy jungler. This is a great example of how YOU are in control of your ultimate, and although it might give both sides advantages, understanding its use can sway even a 50/50 to much greater odds in your favour. Like I said before, being able to utilise this amazing piece of kit is one of the most important things a Kindred player can learn, but it is, similarly to your W. Not something that can be taught, it's something you must practice and actively be thinking about, it'll come with experience. But getting off a game-winning Kindred ult feels amazing, and is more common than you might think. **--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** **Builds: Pre-game, Runes.** [](URL One of the most important things I value in League of Legends is ensuring that everything in your power before the game starts is as optimised as possible. The reason for this is because it's the one thing you have complete, elective control over. Going into season 8 this has become a lot more simple with the runes/masteries system becoming much more streamlined. With the new system combining runes and masteries we now only have to optimise one system for the game that we're going into. *I highly recommend and always have only having a single page that you edit for every game that you go into, this helps you learn all the runes, and how to adapt them to the game in question. Inside this section, I'm not going to mess about too heavily. I'll talk about the two pages in contention for Primary, what they offer and which one I feel is best, I'll then go over every rune in the primary page and the options that are decent takes in secondaries, including situational options. I've already released a relatively in-depth video on Kindred runes, but this will be more in-depth and less condensed for video form. [](URL **Primary Options, ending the debate.** Ever since the release of runes reforged there have been two different opinions on which page is the better Primary option, Domination or Precision. Hint, I'm a hugely in favour of Precision and think Domination is a terrible primary choice, and I'll explain why. When deciding on a Primary page, there are a few fundamental rules that I feel should be followed; 1. The champion should make effective use of the path bonus 2. The champion should make effective use of at least 2 minor paths, ideally all 3. 3. The champion should make GREAT use of at least one of the keystones. So, to end the argument and to articulate why I love Precision as a primary choice, Kindred makes great use of the bonus attack speed from the path bonus, loves all 3 minor paths and has multiple good options in each of them and has positive synergy with all of the keystones, with one seeming overwhelmingly good. Domination, on the other hand, you like 2 minor paths, don't really make insane use of the path bonus and do not LOVE any of the keystones, at least not to the extent of the Precision tree, so in my opinion, there is almost no argument. Precision is your primary tree, almost always. **Primary choice: Precision** Talking briefly about the path bonus, the 18% attack speed you get helps you a tonne with early jungle clear, allowing you to more easily kite camps, combine it with the 15% attack speed you get from machete and the attack speed boost you get from your Q and you have a great clear, you barely take any damage if you micro properly, except raptors and krugs. On top of this attack speed just generally scales well with Kindred's kit, so it's all happy days. **Keystone choices** * Press the Attack [](URL Press the Attack is insane on Kindred and is usually the correct choice over the other two keystones that you have available to you. To quickly explain why you don't take the other two, Lethal Tempo would have been good in the on-hit era of kindred. However, she's outlived that phase and no longer builds, nor supports on-hit builds, as such Lethal Tempo falls short. Fleet Footwork is awesome, it pays homage to old Kindred W passive just like warlord's did, however, Kindred no longer needs this, combine that with the abysmal 10% bonus AD scalings that it has, it simply doesn't cut it and is out-valued by Press the Attack almost all the time. Kindred being a champion that already has a 3 hit ability, that they can readily prock instantly should make you realise that procking Press the Attack is insanely easy for them, making use of an AA reset from your Q, the large AA range and attack speed that they possess means that they can prock Press the Attack insanely frequently, on top of this the 12% vulnerability further enhances your E's execution damage as well as the rest of your kit, and your teammates damage. As long as your target prioritisation is correct the amount of pressure you can put out with Press the Attack and your E is simply insane, the positives of Press the Attack on Kindred are endless and evident. Take Press the Attack. **Minor Path choices** Looking at the three minor paths in Precision you have great options in each of them in Heroism you have Triumph [](URL this is an insane tool for Kindred as one of the main resources that Marksmen and Junglers have to watch is their HP levels at all stages in the game. Typically in a late game team fight, you will fall to almost 10% HP and survive with elective use of your ult, to instantly get a kill after the stalemate that was created ends. This allows Kindred to regularly get full value out of the missing % hp heal and regularly creates clutch situations where you can get aces in situations where without it you would simply just die. Overheal is another 'ok' option, as you have synergy with your lifesteal and ultimate, and can enhance any healers in your team (Which is cool as Kindred loves Ardents.) however most of the time I feel that Triumph is a more solid option, even when you do have healers. However, I wouldn't criticise choosing overheal as an option if your team has a Soraka, or something similar. The legend tree is insanely awesome for Kindred, a champion that spends a lot of time farming both camps and champions. You can get your Legend stacks insanely consistently and make great use out of all three options. Although typically I would say that Bloodline is the correct choice, tenacity is also a good option when looking at a team with insane amounts of CC, and alacrity is 'ok' but I would say the demand for some lifesteal without having to opt into building some, and the value the stat provides is just straight up better than the attack speed you get from Alacrity. Legend Bloodline is an incredibly solid option for Kindred, most Marksmen really want lifesteal but hate having to divert their spike items to grab it. Kindred is no exception to this rule, but also uses her health as a resource when farming the jungle, adding even more value to grabbing some lifesteal as early as possible. Kindred used to love picking up BotRK as early as possible, but these days there aren't really any lifesteal options that Kindred wants to buy outside of perhaps their 5th-6th item options. As such getting Bloodline is invaluable and I highly suggest taking it, as it opens so much more aggressive and defensive options during fights, trades and paths. The final minor path that we have to choose from is the Combat path. Picking an option from here is actually really simple, we just look at which one is going to give us more damage, more consistently. We never pick Last Stand, as taking it is basically amusing a losing position, something which you should never do. Kindred clears healthily and has lifesteal so usually shouldn't fall too low naturally. Coup de Grace is typically the best option in the combat tree, simply put. If you ever kill an enemy champion, at some point in time you will be getting the 10% increased damage that it grants you. On top of this, as a jungler when you go to gank a target, usually they can already be below this threshold. As such you can make great use of Coup de Grace on a regular basis, which makes it a solid choice most games. However. You might consider taking Cut Down vs 1-2 large tanks that you will find hard to get to the 40% threshold, as that will increase your damage more consistently versus them, however, this is rare. **Secondary Tree choices.** Seeing as Domination is in contention for your primary path, it's the obvious choice for your secondary, as the minor paths are really nice. However taking a quick look at the other trees you'll notice that very few of them actually give Kindred anything that is too wanted, the only option that I would say is tempting would be Gathering Storm in the sorcery tree in games that look to go insanely long. But that aside, I think domination is the correct option most of the time. Assuming we're not playing in competitive, taking options in tracking such as Zombie ward and Ghost poro aren't going to be as impactful as the other minor path options in Domination. Cheap shot and Taste the blood are traps that a lot of players fall into taking, as simply put, the damage that Cheap shot gives you is outvalued by the consistent lethality you can get with Sudden Impact and the tiny inconsistent healing that you can get from Taste the Blood is also outvalued by Sudden impact, which, hint, is the option I like to take majority of the time. The Hunter path, similar to the Legend path really suits Kindred's style of hunting down champions for their Marks, and also provides great bonuses. Ingenious hunter is basically useless on Kindred, though. Relentless hunter is typically the better option for Kindred as the movement speed out of combat that it gives you is insanely useful for all forms of macro rotation, be it pathing, hunting marks, rotating etc. 48 out of combat movement speed is nothing to gorp at. Ravenous hunter can be better sometimes if you're playing in matchups where teamfights will be drawn out, but it's rarely a superior option to Relentless hunter. Your typical final page. [](URL **----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** **Builds Item options.** Something that I can't stress enough going into this section is that Kindred has changed. Gone are the days where on-hit builds are good options for Kindred, so if you're coming here looking for some Rageblade, BotRK action, I'm sorry to disappoint you. I love those builds and they can be fun though. Typically Kindred will opt into one of two builds, both of them are good, but are good in different scenarios. * The first option is a crit build. This build will take Shiv, IE, RFC after warrior. [](URL This is the most popular build option for Kindred at the moment and is one that most players will build without question. However, I do believe that it's not always the correct choice and sometimes should be avoided. Examples of this would be when your team already has one or two crit champions, which means that the enemy team will build randuins, you don't want to give them more value, or the option to build randuins in the first place. Typically this build is best when playing with a non-crit ADC, but you can still do it with one, assuming you're getting ahead enough for the spikes to out value randuins/tabi stacking. Other scenarios where you shouldn't build this include when your team doesn't support having another squishy marksman, in which scenario you'll need to tank up a bit with item options such as cleaver, etc. Believe it or not, both builds on Kindred do a tonne of damage. The reason you build crit is to increase your power spikes, not because the other build doesn't do enough damage. You can still solo crit carries with the other build, the only reason to build the crit build is to capitalise on power spikes and end the game sooner rather than later. Which is very valuable in solo queue. Issues with this build include the fact that it lacks a lot of early AD (warrior patches this up) Kindred has great bonus AD scalings that shouldn't be ignored. Especially when you get enough attack speed from your Q, path bonus etc. On top of this, you're squishy as all hell, if you get CC'd and don't get your ult off it can be game losing, so remember this and play more complacently. However, to stop talking smack on it, this build is solid, especially in solo queue. * The second option is a more traditional CD/AD build, making use of cleaver/tri. [](URL This is the build path that I personally prefer and will take most of the time. It still does great damage consistently throughout the game, scales better towards the 6th item slots and means that you will never be a liability to your team's layout. (Unless you desperately needed a tank) This is something that cant be said for the crit build, which can sometimes put a strain on your team if built in the incorrect moment. Kindred has great bonus AD scalings, so grabbing warrior, cleaver/tri and other AD items are really amazing on Kindred. However, towards late game you do feel having less attack speed, so grabbing PD is a good option as it gives defensive stats and the attack speed that you'll be missing. Generally speaking this build also has the option to build more defensive options, such as thornmail + tabi + randuins and as such can become more of a bruiser than a true marksman, whilst still dishing out an insanely high amount of damage, being able to solo kill most champions in the game, even when built more tankily. This is partially due to red smite though, so don't get too cocky without it. You typically want to build cleaver when the enemy team has champions that can build armour, or if your team is a little armour heavy. Situationally with both builds grabbing an LW isn't a bad idea if you're too heavily stacked with AD. You typically grab Trinity force, (which gives has awesome synergy with your Q, being able to readily prock sheen) if you're super ahead or if the enemy team has no good options to deal with you, this pays homage to the crit build by spiking harder than they can react to. Now. There will be people who will ask questions about boot choices, Jungle item choices, etc. so I'll quickly address this now. You always go Warrior. Always. The only exception to this rule is when they have 2-3 tanks but even then warrior is typically the better option. Its the most hyperefficient item in the game. Period. On top of this, Kindred makes great use of the +60 AD that you get and also the 10% CDR you get. It's amazing. If you don't trust me and still haven't changed to it. Try it. It's literally Kindred's bread and butter. 9 times out of 10 you'll want to take red smite. The only times you don't want to take red smite is when you will get more value out of vision than the duelling presence. Which is rare, and only really a factor when you're very far behind, versus assassins/invaders. For boot choices, you simply decide between Tabis/Merc/Beserkers based on each game. If they have AD threats you go Tabis. If they have AP threats or CC threats you go Merc Treads. If they have neither, and you're ahead you go Beserkers. Simple enough, right? You can build Mobis some games where you will be constantly chasing around the enemy jungler trying to provide more pressure than them, or if you have to race them to get stacks. I'd like to take a moment to mention as well that late game you want to buy red elixirs most of the time. However, if you're struggling with CC and need more hp/tenacity going iron is also a nice option. Also, you always start Machete now. ALWAYS. the 15% attack speed it grants is simply way too good. You never start talisman now, literally. NEVER. LW is a good item choice when the enemy team is going to begin stacking armour, deciding on which item to go is as simple as deciding if their healing will heal more damage than you will gain by building lord doms. But you also have to consider that you reduce the healing of other carries/supports as well. Which is really nice. Your lifesteal options are pretty cut and dry. Sometimes you'll need to pick up lifesteal. Build BT if you don't need CDR and will overcap if you build deaths dance. Build Merc scim if you need MR and the enemy team has important CC to remove (for example Malzahar.) Maw if you just need MR. And Deaths Dance if none of the other rules apply. I'll include a twitlonger to an item set that I personally use and recommend you check out. It contains every item choice for Kindred, alongside build examples. Seriously, using itemsets is a great idea, especially when you can share them now. **URL **------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------** For the remainder of the guide, I'll be posting it in a Twitlonger that'll be linked. The reason for this is simply that I'm running out of characters on Reddit. The final topic that I'm going to be covering is how to play Kindred. This will go over when to pick Kindred, matchups, early game (including pathing), mid game and the late stages of the game. I hope you guys don't mind, but it's the best solution I could come up with. I hope you've enjoyed the 'guide' up until this point and will enjoy the rest of it over on Twitlonger.

75,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Why you should be maxing E on Zoe instead of Q,1,7gbllz,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7gbllz/why_you_should_be_maxing_e_on_zoe_instead_of_q/,2017-11-29 18:48:45,"Going to try and make this as short and sweet as I possibly can. After testing in the practice tool, having at level 9, with E level 5, and Q level 2, you are giving yourself 60 more damage per E -&gt; Q combo at max range with a Morello and Dorans ring, which is pretty average / below average for a decent farming player. Not only are you getting more raw damage output, you are also lowering the cooldown of your biggest playmaking ability by a significant margin compared to your Q. The one drawback is that your wave clear is marginally worse. But keep in mind, Zoe at level 1 with 1 long range Q can do about 150 damage to the melee minions with one ability, which is more than most champions at level 1. As you get more and more AP, you are adding a lot more to that damage making her waveclear pretty decent in comparison to other champions. Maxing E also allows you much more playmaking potential, to further gain advantages in the laning phase. We all know what it feels like to get hit with an E and see your chances of winning the early laning phases go down the shitbox. Your window of opportunity is a bit wider, but you get paid for the smaller window of vulnerability in spades with more raw damage / playmaking potential while still retaining the benefits of good waveclear. Linking the Wiki page for Zoe so you can see the in depth numbers of her kit including the 30% increased CDR from hitting a unit with the E. URL **TL;DR:** Max E instead of Q. You don't lose out on waveclear that much, and gain more raw damage, as well as increased playmaking capabilities."
76,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Discussion regarding Zoe's 'Counterplays',0,7gkeb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7gkeb9/discussion_regarding_zoes_counterplays/,2017-11-30 17:36:11,"I constantly see people defending Zoe's current state by claiming she has 'lots of counterplay' and I'd just like to share my opinion on why I feel that is easier said than done. Passive: I am actually fine with her passive because it encourages her to get up close and personal, which SHOULD be trading more damage for more vulnerability, but her other abilities make it a lot safer than it should be. Q: I actually have no issues with her Paddlestar. It's extremely predictable and the sound queue really helps trying to play against her. Still, the damage might need to be tuned down when she can literally do 50% of my HP in conjunction with E as a full tank. W: This is where things start to get sour. Not only does she have what is pretty much a copy of Ahri's Foxfire, but it also gives her large bursts of MS. While I haven't personally been on the receiving end of the RNG nature of her spell stealing, there are plenty of horror stories by people facing her out there. Lv 3 gunblade (which by itself does a huge chunk of dmg at that stage in the game), barrier spamming, free teleports, global ganking with redemption... the list goes on and on. E: To me, this is the main reason why she is so broken and un-fun to play against. Fast projectile, large hitbox that gets even bigger when it turns into a trap behind you and hits you anyway and ridiculous range through walls making sieges a nightmare for the enemy team. Not only is she rewarded for landing it with a CD refund, she's also rewarded if she misses by turning into a huge zoning tool. A player should NOT be rewarded for missing an already easy 'skillshot'. This ability also makes it a nightmare for a tank or assassin to try and catch her because she just throws it pointblank and your attempt is pretty much done for. You're left sitting there contemplating your life choices while she walks away and either takes off half of your HP if you're a tank, or completely one-shotting you if you're an assassin. God forbid you cant kill her in 1 second before her sleep kicks in. R: This by itself is very fair. When used in tandem with her other skills, is NOT. Some people claim it's easy to counter because you can see her return portal. Sure, that's true... IF the Zoe is a pleb using it in plain sight. What about good Zoes that use it from behind walls in the FoW? You cant punish her for attempting to jump in and E or Q someone in the face with cc, because she returns to her original spot NO MATTER WHAT. If her abilities are going to remain as oppressive as they currently are, then make her return portal visible even in the FoW. I would love to hear your thoughts on her current state, because I personally think she's good at all stages of the game and can protect herself from tanks, bruisers and assassins WAY too well. I have no idea what the downside to this champion is."
77,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Tristana Rework Idea,0,7h9nk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/7h9nk2/tristana_rework_idea/,2017-12-04 00:33:28,"Since her visual update, she got a lot of very exciting voice lines that sell her as a mix between demolitionist and commando, however she's played as a very safe and tame ad carry. I would propose a small rework to give her more highlights when she goes in, and greater reward for making plays. Passive: The Bigger They Are, The Better They Boom When Tristana kills a unit, 10-25% of it's max health is dealt to nearby units. (Radius increases with target size, minion and monster damage capped at 500) Q - Draw A Bead Cost: 20 Mana CD: 24-14 seconds Tristana gains attack speed, and the range of her attacks and spells are increased for the duration, 4/5/6/7/8 seconds. (Moves the overpowering passive into a window, increases W range as well.) W - Rocket Jump Range: Equal to Tristana's current attack range (and thus modified by Q and a charged Rapidfire Cannon.) Jump, damage, slow. Reset on takedowns and E max detonations on champions. E - Explosive Charge Now a skillshot that behaves similar to Zilean Q. Throw an explosive charge which will stick to the first unit hit. Attack the unit to stack charges, increasing the DAMAGE and BLAST RADIUS. Recast E to detonate, or damage the unit with one of Tristana's other spells, dealing bonus damage. The charge will dissipate if the target does not take damage from Tristana for 2.5 seconds. (has diminishing returns on the damage and range stack, but can stack infinitely.) R - Buster Shot Target unit is knocked back very far. Now deals less base damage, but a small amount of % max Hp damage. If Buster Shot would detonate Explosive Charge, the target will fly the full distance before the explosion. Summary: Putting Tristana's long range into a window gives enemies a chance to do something between her Q. Poking with RFC and Shiv will still do its job, but now has a cost tied to it that exposes a vulnerability that she lacks. The new Passive and Buster Shot give her incentive to go full gun-ho on a large Frontline target, ideally turning that 6k HP Chogath into a very big explosion waiting to happen. Reducing the range of Rocket Jump is absolutely necessary to put a lid on the ridiculous safety of her laning phase, but tying it into her Q cooldown and potentially RFC's energized shot opens up new windows for really aggressive maneuvers that you would expect from the Bandle Gunner. All in all, she would have less (uncanny) safety during the laning phase, but just as easy a time killing squishy targets that expose themselves. Requiring the detonation to be primed and detonated manually allows counterplay to her dangerous all-in. She will want to detonate E by using W or R, and will actually be rewarded for doing so by causing significant damage to nearby enemies as well, instead of simply getting another op escape. ------- Please, tell me what you think! Bandle Gunners Victory!"

LZ won the LCK Summer Split and steamrolled group B, finishing undefeated. This matchup is a tale of two play styles- LZ seeks to draft team compositions that can apply early pressure and maximize those advantages while SSG prefers to draft scaling compositions and play for late game. The problem for SSG is that they have not been consistently successful in hanging on until the late game, while LZ has played their early pressure compositions to overwhelming success. At 3.290, I dont hate SSG as an upset play. Those are good odds for a team that has been to a world final and has experience in a best of 5 format, where LZ has none. And struggles aside, SSG is still a talented roster, featuring arguably the best top laner in the world, Cuvee. However, form is key at the world championships, and theres no team in better form than LZ. LZ is the pick at 1.344. Here's my analysis on the rest of the matches for the QF's - URL"

As a jinx OTP who has, at best, G5-level dodging / general micro skills, I found myself climbing through G2/G1, despite often getting outlaned, with the following practices. I would like to note that many of these practices require rethinking in Plat due to the extreme toxicity - in Plat I lean more toward simply muting toxic people: * Counteract the toxicity on the team. Provide a more positive perspective for others on your team to be anchored to. In the game I got triple tilt proof, I said things to the effect of ""I disagree. I think we have a really strong chance to win this game because of our scaling, even though we are down towers."" The rest of your team is reading the chat. Give them an alternative perspective. * Don't go overboard with the positivity. I find this annoying and lots of other people do too. I think there is a big distinction between having a positive mentality vs simply being positive. Sometimes it lets off steam to just be like ""Damn. We are getting crushed in lane. This draven is really good."" The best mentality is one of zen-like focus and impartiality, where you are only focused on playing the best you can. * Admit when you made a mistake or bad call and apologize. * Try to get team consensus / buy-in with questions, as opposed to being bossy. Ex: ""What do you guys think - is it time to group?"" as opposed to spamming ""GROUP GROUP GROUP"". If someone explicitly disagrees with your calls, ask for their reasoning consider if they are correct. I like to be the shotcaller but I am always very ready to consider. * Show concern/vulnerability as opposed to scorning your teammates. ""Damn guys, we are really going to throw at this rate if we don't group quickly."" * Be extremely aware of potential baron calls. All the way up through G1, I FREQUENTLY won games that my team was heavily behind by making good baron calls. Gold teams are very sloppy with closing out games."

This is the preseason where everything goes to hell and everyone is crying. To help you understand the torrents of agony that flowing through League of Legends, Im going to breakdown the balancing changes and new gameplay contents for you. Note: I will skip over Leveling Up and Blue Essence  IP Merging, etc. Video Format: URL _____________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________ # Runes Reforged Runes Reforged is essentially the old masteries tweaked in a way so that each champion can have multiple option going into a game, and removing the grindy nature of the old Runes System. Everything is free and unlocked now from level 1. The most impactful of the new system is the Keystones, you can equip one of the Keystones from the 5 trees. Pick carefully as they usually define your playstyle and sometimes even combo sequence. Before I dive into the new system, theres a new word thats key to understanding the changes. Adaptive  It means to choose automatically between AD or AP depending on which one you build more/what will offer more. For example, if you are an ADC, adaptive runes would offer AD and physical damage procs. If you are a mage, adaptive runes would offer AP and magic damage procs. ### I will only be breaking down the keystones __________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ ### Precision: Become a Legend ###### **Press the Attack** * Hitting an enemy champion with 3 consecutive basic attacks will deal 30 - 120 bonus adaptive damage (based on level) and makes them vulnerable, increasing the amount of damage they take by 12% from all sources. Press the Attack is essentially the old Fervor of Battle except with a twist. Instead of ramping AD to a cap, 3 auto-attacks would trigger an adaptive damage pop and make the enemy vulnerable, causing them to take 12% more damage from **all sources**. The 3 auto-attacks can be from animation-cancels, ability-empowered attacks like Lucian passive and Renekton W would stack the same way as the old Fervor, but the vulnerability is where things get interesting. Take Renekton for example, in order to get the maximum amount of damage off of a combo, you want to hold the majority of your burst until after you get the proc. W can be used to get the proc earlier, but the follow up Q would do 12% more damage. In ganks, skirmishes, or team-fights, getting the 3-hit proc then have others dump their load can amount to a couple hundred more damage easily, which can mean the difference between snowballing and objectives. The reason I didnt use Markman too much as an example is because Press the Attack somewhat punished you for switching targets. Currently, if vulnerability is popped on one target, the rune will go on cooldown until the vulnerability expires on the first target, meaning you cant get any bonus damage if you popped it on the tank beforehand. Regardless, its still a solid choice in the bot lane, as it does provide more pressure and damage in normal trades compared to Lethal Tempo. **Users:** Bruisers, Marksmen, Leona(?) __________________________________________________________ ###### **Lethal Tempo** * 1.5s after damaging a champion gain 30 - 80% Attack Speed (based on level) for 3s. Attacking a champion extends the effect to 6s. * Cooldown: 10s * Lethal Tempo allows you to temporarily exceed the attack speed limit. Lethal Tempo has huge potential if its requirements are met. The attack speed burst and cap break means that some nasty DPS can be outputted in skirmishes and team fights. In built on-hit or AS steroids are valued even more in the late game. Trading in lane is also surprisingly efficient, its quite easy to get an extra auto or two if you get a slightly longer trade in, bonus points if you get have an AS buff from yourself or your support. Melees arent as encouraged to take this because of their limited range. It takes 1.5 seconds to kick in, meaning Melees cant get the full benefit of the AS buff duration if they cant get a poke in beforehand for the rune to pop. **Users:** Marksmen, Melee Hyper-carries ____________________________________________________________ ###### **Fleeting Footwork** * Attacking and moving builds Energy stacks. At 100 stacks, your next attack is Energized. * Energized attacks heal you for 5 - 50 (+0.10 Bonus AD, +0.2 AP) and grant you 30% increased movement speed for 1 second. Healing is 60% effective when used on a minion. Fleeting Footwork is your old Warlords Bloodlust, except now the heal scales off of both AD and HP. Nothing too exciting, a nice defensive rune for repositioning in team fights and tanking lane. **Edit:** Just reviewed the numbers again, did some calculations, the healing is Dog in the mid and late game, and a tad bit better than old warlords in the early game. If you want to take it, it would probably be only for the MS steroid. **Users:** Marksmen _________________________________________________ _________________________________________________ ### Domination: Hunt and Eliminate Prey ###### **Electrocute** * Hitting a champion with 3 separate attacks or abilities within 3 seconds deals bonus adaptive damage. * Damage: 50 - 220 (+0.50 bonus AD, +0.3 AP) damage. * Cooldown: 50 - 25s Electrocute is essentially the old Thunderlords. The main difference is that rather than 3 sources of damage, its 3 **unique** sources of damage. The actual damage from the mastery has a slight delay, so dont get trigger happy with your flash when playing against it. The rune has nasty damage across all stages of the game, and especially against carries in the mid game. Anyone who can proc this rune easily and wants to be a threat to the backline can run Electrocute. **Users:** Assassins, Bruisers, Aggressive Supports ____________________________________________________ ###### **Predator** * Enchants your boots with the active effect **Predator** * Channel for 1.5s out of combat to gain 45% movement speed for 15 seconds. Damaging attacks or abilities end this effect, dealing 60 - 140 (+0.4 bonus AD)(+0.25 AP) bonus adaptive damage. * Cooldown: 180s - 120s. Starts the game on cooldown and goes on cooldown if interrupted while channeling. Predator gives roaming a whole new platform to work on. Its essentially a mini Rengar ultimate thats activated on boots. The additional damage doesnt amount to too much, but still feels significant. But wouldnt this make Assassins too strong? Well, no, not entirely, new ways of vision control like Zombie Ward and Ghost Poro can hold them back pretty effectively as long as the carries play cautiously. **Users:** Roaming Mids, Junglers who likes MS (Hecarim) ______________________________________________________ ###### **Dark Harvest** * Champions, large minions, and large monsters drop soul essence on death. Collect souls to become Soul Charged. Your next attack on a champion or structure consumes Soul Charged to deal bonus adaptive damage * Soul Charged lasts 20s, increased to 300s after collecting 150 soul essence * Bonus damage: 40 - 80 (+0.25 bonus AD) (+0.2 AP) + soul essence collected * Champion souls  6 soul essence * Monster souls - 2 soul essence * Minion souls - 4 soul essence Dark Harvest in my opinion is the most unique rune in the Domination tree, its essentially a Thresh passive minigame, stacking souls every time you are around the death of a champion, cannon creep, or large jungle camp. Every time you get a soul, your next attack against a champion deals bonus damage based on how many stacks you have. Which means you are running it on an Assassin, it might be a good idea to keep your raptor camp up to access the bonus damage if the enemy team is sieging mid. The rune deals disgusting amounts of damage 30+ minutes into the game, often capable of one shotting carries combined with duskblade proc. ADCs, buy your Control Wards, Stop Watches, and Guardian Angels and stay safe. **Users:** Any champion who wants to power farm and burst squishies ______________________________________________ ______________________________________________ ### Sorcery: Unleash Destruction ###### **Summon Aery** * Your attacks and abilities send Aery to a target, damaging enemies or shielding allies * Damage: 20 - 60 based on level (+0.1 AP and +0.15 bonus AD) * Shield: 30 - 80 based on level (+0.25 AP and +0.25 bonus AD) * Aery cannot be sent out again until she returns to you Summon Aery is in my opinion the best for general laning if you cant abuse Electrocute. The damage is much more reliable than Arcane Comet, the cooldown is very generous, if you have a shielding ability to go along with it, thats just another cherry on top. Arcane Comet only procs when you hit the opponent with an ability, and will most likely miss if the ability doesnt have a strong attached slow or a hard CC tied to it. While Summon Aery procs on just basic attacks, and is a guaranteed hit. **Users:** Any ranged champion looking for a bit of extra harass in lane. _______________________________________________________ ###### **Arcane Comet** * Damaging a champion with an ability hurls a comet at their location * While Arcane Comet is on cooldown, damaging a champion with an ability reduces Arcane Comet's remaining cooldown by 20% * Damage (Adaptive): 30 - 100 based on level (+0.20 AP and +0.35 bonus AD) * Cooldown: 20 - 8s * Arcane Comets cooldown reduction is reduced for: * Area of Effect: 10% * Damage Over Time: 5% Arcane Comet on paper seems like a great rune. It has a decently short cooldown, shortens even more when an ability hit, the damage is quite nice, and it scales nicely too. But if you play a few games with it, you would see that the damage on Arcane Comets tracker is excruciatingly low. The reason would be how unreliable it is. I can see a few champion take it if all of their abilities have hard CC and strong slows, but otherwise, Summon Aery is the better alternative. **Users:** Lux, Carry champions who cant use Electrocute and have strong CC ______________________________________________________ ###### **Phase Rush** * Hitting an enemy champion with 3 attacks or separate abilities within 3s grants 15 - 40% Movement Speed based on level. * Duration: 3s * Cooldown: 15s * Melee: Additionally, gain 75% Slow Resistance for the duration. Phase Rush is the equivalent of Stormraiders, whose proc mechanic, similar to Electrocute, swapped to 3 unique sources of damage rather than bursting out 30% of the targets max health. This makes the rune ridiculously good on combo mages like Ryze and Syndra if they are willing to give up the extra damage from Electrocute. Phase Rush also works with scaling from Celerity, which gives AP and AD adaptively based on bonus MS, so you can get around 15 bonus AP or AD while running around. **Users:** Ryze, any combo mages looking to kite ________________________________________________ _______________________________________________ ### Resolve: Live Forever ###### **Grasp of the Undying** * Every 4s in combat, your next basic attack on a champion will: * Deal bonus damage equal to 4% of your max health * Heal you for 2% of your max health * Permanently increase your health by 5 * Ranged Champions: Damage and healing are halved and gain 2 permanent health instead. Grasp of the Undying is kept pretty much intact from the old masteries system. However, it now gives a nice scaling reward for trading in lane, which is what Grasp is designed to do anyways. By mid game, its average to have around 175 to 200 bonus health from the mastery, and it deals decent damage in the all stages of the game. Overall, a super nice rune that can be taken on anyone looking for a bit of bonus health and harass. Ive seen some ADCs even take it to get a bit of bonus health. While I dont agree with it entirely as Lethal Tempos DPS increase is incredibly impactful, they didnt perform half bad. **Users:** Tanks looking to trade in laning ____________________________________________________ ###### **Aftershock** * After immobilizing an enemy champion, increase your current Armor and Magic Resist by 20 + 30% for 2.5s. Then, after 2.5s deal damage to nearby enemies. * Damage: 40-140 (+3.5% of your maximum health), Adaptive * Cooldown: 20s Aftershock is your old Courage of the Colossus. Except instead of a massive % health shield, it grants an ample amount of resistance and deals a nice chunk of burst damage after it wears off. The cooldown is also quite low, in longer skirmishes its possible to pop it twice. Trading in lane with Aftershock feels incredibly good, and long range CC spells would no longer waste the buff unlike Courage of the Colossus. (Ex: Long range Thresh hooks would only give a 1 man shield, but now it still gives equal amounts of defenses.) Take this rune as a general defensive rune, its just a nice rune all around. **Users:** Any tanks or bruisers with hard CC. ______________________________________________________ ###### **Guardian** * Guard allies within 175 units of you, and Guard allies you target with spells for 2.5s * While Guarding, if you or the ally would take damage, both of you gain a shield and are hasted for for 1.5s. * Cooldown: 45s * Shield total strength: 60 - 150 +(0.20 AP) + (+10% bonus health). * Haste: 20% increased Movement Speed. Guardian is incredible for peeling tanks and enchanters alike. The shield is massive and hard to waste as it only procs when you or your ally take damage. The cooldown is a little hefty though, so dont run into a trade when its on cooldown. The Haste component is in my opinion what makes the rune so strong, the MS might seem insignificant, but it offers both chase and peel potential that can be fight-changing. **Users:** Tank and Caster supports looking for more carry shielding power, Braum _______________________________________________ _______________________________________________ ### Inspiration: Outwit Mere Mortals ###### **Unsealed Spellbook** * Gain a Summoner Shard at 2 min and another every 6 min after (Max 2 shards). * While near the shop, you can exchange 1 Summoner Shard to replace a Summoner Spell with a different one. * Smite: Buying Smite won't grant access to Smite items (But taking Smite level 1 and swapping it out for later will) * You cannot have two of the same Summoner Spell * Swapping Summoners wont automatically put it off cooldown Unsealed Spellbook is the rune with the highest learning curve, but at the current moment, it feels lack luster. I dont have much to say on the usage of this rune other than cheesing with an early Ignite Exhaust or lvl 1 support invades with smite. The idea is that you can pull off an unconventional early combination of Summoner Spells but can swap it out for more late game oriented Summoners like TP and Flash. __________________________________________________ ###### **Glacial Augment** * Basic attacking a champion slows them for 2s. The slow increases in strength over its duration * Ranged: Ranged attacks slow by up to 25% - 40% * Melee: Melee attacks slow by up to 35% - 50% * Slowing a champion with active items shoots a freeze ray through them, freezing the nearby ground for 5s, slowing all units inside by 50% (max 3 rays per item use). Cooldown: 6-3 second per-unit cooldown Glacial Augment is quite literally a free Frozen Mallet. I dont think people give the mastery the attention it deserves. The sticking power is ridiculous, by late game, it actually feels **more** powerful to Frozen Mallet, as it aids not only in splitting, but also in team fighting if you run a Randuins or Hextech GLP. On top of that, if you have a key skillshot you want to land, you can auto attack then throw the spell at the heavily slowed opponent. Granted, Glacial Augment is still a bit niche, but people should definitely be trying it out more. **Users:** Gnar, Swain, Champions looking for sticking power more than damage __________________________________________________ ###### **Kleptomancy** * After using an ability, your next attack grants bonus gold. There's a chance you'll also gain a consumable. Kleptomancy is the most lane-oriented rune in this patch. It offers gold and consumables like Health Pots, Mana Pots, Mini Elixirs, wards, etc. Kleptomancy accelerates gold income by a VERY significant amount, as you can sell pots and wards for gold if needed. So if you have a reliable way of procing this rune in lane, and are looking to quickly hit early item spikes. Kleptomancy is the way to go. **Users:** Any champions looking for early item spikes and can proc this easily. ________________________________________________ That concludes the Keystone breakdown, if you want me to break down the rest of the runes, just tell me. Feel free to criticize this in any ways you feel like. "
84,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Hi, hello, how are you, I'm ristiuMMask, with over 2 Million Champion Points on Garen. I'd like to talk about the dead mechanic of Mana Burn and how Garen could bring it back to be more viable/let him deal with tanks",1564,71ftf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/71ftf1/hi_hello_how_are_you_im_ristiummask_with_over_2/,2017-09-21 11:21:31,"OP.GG - URL As the title suggests, I've played 1800 ranked games of Garen this season. The highest I ever brought the champion was Diamond 1 Promos about a month and a half ago. Many of you know me as that ""Streamer who wears a mask and is really happy/weird."" I've played Garen long enough to know that he's still one of the weakest juggernauts in League of Legends. He is a champion with predictable trade patterns and either gets beaten in toplane by shields/true damage (Irelia, Ornn, Cho), outscaled past laning phase (Fiora, Jax,Trynd), or even both. I even bring him midlane mostly to avoid the struggle of every single toplane matchup to farm and hunt the villain more actively in the early game. **My Biggest disagreement with Garen's kit is currently, he loses trades against tanks in lane.** Juggernauts, are to my understanding, champions that possess offensive and defensive prowess, with bulkier stats and offer good options in each catagory while sacrificing the disruption and hard cc options that a class like tanks. **Lolwiki's definition of the Juggernaut Class** - *""also known rarely as off-tanks, are the toughest (or tankiest) of fighters, but also the least mobile. These heavy-duty champions boast powerful defenses in addition to tremendous natural resilience (or tankiness), and while entering a fight is particularly difficult for a juggernaut, actual combat heavily favors them once they are in range. Juggernauts tend to favor heavily defensive builds, though what few offensive items they purchase significantly enhance their already potent innate damage.""* Now let's go toward the definition of a tank. Great disruption in fights. Many of them possess the ability to initiate fights well. Amazing defensive power, at the cost of offensive prowess. **Lolwiki's definition on the Tank Class** - *""Tanks are tough melee champions who sacrifice damage in exchange for powerful crowd control. While able to engage enemies in combat, a tank's purpose isn't usually to kill opponents; rather, tanks excel at disrupting enemies and diverting their focus to themselves, allowing them to lock down specific targets (or several targets at once), as well as remove (or peel) threats from their allies. In addition to strong base defenses, tanks generally have a means of amplifying their tankiness even further with their abilities, and tend to fully invest in defensive items to maximize their resilience. However, tanks lack the tools to truly succeed in single combat, and their influence is limited by their low overall mobility, preventing them from constantly staying on top of their targets. As tanks can handle burst damage very well, they tend to succeed against assassins and most mages, but their vulnerability to continuous damage puts them at a disadvantage against fighters and marksmen. Subcategories of Tanks are vanguards, and wardens.""* Garen is a juggernaut, however when it comes to the laning phase, tanks such as Maokai, Ornn, Nautilus, Poppy, Galio, Shen (A champion who can only use three abilities in lane) beat Garen in trades, flat out, 100% of the time. Garen simply has no way of dealing with percentile damage on top of having to spin through Courage of the Collusus. **Garen I believe is the weakest Juggernaut in League because he can't beat the class he is classified to beat in damage. Imagine being unable to beat a Charizard as Blastoise. That's Garen right now.** Many of these tanks have to respect the likes of Darius, Illaoi, Mordekaiser, Trundle, to the point of them getting one complete item, will often have to sit at tower and wait for jungler assistance to have a fighting chance. Garen on the otherhand has to spend the entire laning phase playing passive against a champion class that surprasses him not only in the laning phase, but the teamfight department in terms of disruption and lockdown. And since Garen has no control over the villain mechanic, Garen only has rare opportunities that it will land on the toplaner. Nasus is the only other champion that will get bullied by tanks but after he gets a few hundred stacks, tanks seek their turret for any fighting chance. **Garen's damage can't be buffed, otherwise he'll be nerfed again just like what happened after the juggernaut rework.""** **Garen already has sustain in his kit, so adding in-combat sustain would be problematic as well. Many Juggernauts depend on their in-combat sustain to deal with tanks.** Building Lifesteal items such as Blade of the Ruined King and Death's Dance are already inefficient on Garen since he can't utilize lifesteal on his spin. So, I'd like to propose that Garen is the first champion to re-introduce Mana Burn in League of Legends. **Why should Garen get mana burn somewhere in his kit (Like his Q)?** **1. I believe Mana Burn would be easier to balance on Garen.** The last item that had Mana Burn, Wit's End, burned mana on **every auto attack** - Garen's can only land Decisive Strike only at best, **every 10 seconds**, in addition to sacrificing his cleanse for slows on top of that, which is a big escape card for him. This means that in order to burn mana, he has to engage on the tank which can still be hazardous for Garen if he gets flanked immediately after. If it burned a flat amount or a small percentage, that also means lategame that it will have visibly less impact on tanks who often have higher mana pools or even get 1-2 Mana items. **2. It would allow him to deal with tanks. Tanks use mana to trade heavily**, and if Garen was to slowly burn a tank's mana over the course of several minutes in a laning phase, than the enemy tank will be forced to make tougher choices in trading/vs saving mana for a tp play, or be harder pressed to back. Mana Burn I believe is a healthier alternative than simply giving Garen more armor penetration and turning him into a tank-buster like how Fiora is currently. Lategame tanks will have larger mana pools, so Mana Burn just on Garen's Q means that it will be more useful in laning phase and less noticeable in teamfights for tanks. **Right now Garen players have no good reasons to engage on tanks without jungler assistance pre-11, because it literally will be a losing fight.** **3. It would fit Garen thematically.** Demacia is policied to be against magic, with many anti-magic runes and weapons. Mana is the basis for many magical abilities and spells, and since Garen's sword is hinted to have anti-magic qualities with a silence, then slapping on the ability to seal/drain magical resources within his target thematically fits and would be a sound addition. **4. This change gives Garen more of an identity without making him oppressive.** There are currently no champions in League of Legends that have a mechanic that burns Mana. Garen could be that champion, allowing himself to separate his identity further from Darius, who is typically not only superior in laning phase, but also teamfights as well. **5. It would encourage the champion to trade more.** Do you know how many times I say on stream - ""Yeah, we're going to have to play passive and avoid trades."" ? About 95% of my matchups, unless I get an early kill from a gank or something. If I had Mana Burn on Garen's Q, I would actively have more reasons to trade. **6. It would raise Garen's skill cap.** So long that the mana burn doesn't do anything silly like take 20% of their maximum mana away, instead going for smaller burns, expert Garen players can stress additional decision making in resource management and siphoning, indirectly increasing the players mastery with the champion, and the skill cap for Garen. If you know that you can survive the next three trades on Garen and make the enemy toplaner run close to oom, you can potentially make their tp flank bottom less effective because you planned ahead, but if you make foolish trades then you're basically sitting at tower denied while waiting on your passive. His viability will certainly increase, and this change will definitely impact other toplane matchups as well that use mana, but I wish to remind everyone that the game was very different when Mana Burn was in the game, compared to what it is today. Garen used to be an oppressive laner back then, but now the only person he can consistently win trades with toplane is Wukong, and that example is saying volumes. This change not only will help Garen against tanks, but boost his toplane viability overall. In addition to this - **we also have many more champions that don't even use a mana bar.** This means that this addition will not work against the likes of Shen, Kennen, Renekton, Tryndamere, Dr. Mundo, etc, meaning that Garen will still possess very viable counterpicks. You can't burn mana if the enemy doesn't have a mana bar to begin with. **Want a better identity for Garen, Riot Games? Why not make him the Juggernaut that tough it out more than other Juggernaut in lane, including Nasus. He already has his regen passive, but allowing Garen to shorten how long the many mana using, Corrupting Potion chugging toplaners stay in lane would make his identity more unique without him being as oppressive as buffing his damage or stats. His passive is literally called ""Perseverance"". Make Garen engage the enemy's perseverance as well.** I apologize for the long post, but I have a burning passion to see Garen viable as a champion someday again, and in a way that doesn't make him healthy. I know Mana Burn has been a controversial thing in the past, but I hope that this can spark a healthy discussion of what it would be like on Garen in today's game. I know Garen needs some work, but I believe his biggest problem that I disagree with entirely is that even the class that carries shields more than swords can still put the man with the big sword in the ground. Thank you for reading. :) EDIT - Biggest suggestions that I like right now is the mana burn being percent of current mana (So the enemy has a chance of recovering from OOM) or Garen increasing mana costs for a short duration after landing Q, so the enemy has a way to preserve their mana by not activating abilities.

85,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"I think people sabotage their own games, ie - You are your own worst enemy.",0,74z5kl,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/74z5kl/i_think_people_sabotage_their_own_games_ie_you/,2017-10-08 13:14:22,"#You are your own worst enemy I truly believe that i can make people perform better in game, by making them better people. I believe by making someone either a better/happier person, they will ultimately perform better, because there's certain things that are restricted by personal development and sadness. I'm not attempting to make anyone pro, just a better happier all rounded person. This post will highlight some mentality issues and show you why you're your own worst enemy. This applies to league because it impacts your performance in game, it's not so much a mechanical thing as much as it mental. (If you don't appreciate that, then it's fine.) ---- ###Contents 1. My justification * I talk about why you should read this and attempt to validate the effects of mentality on a players performance. * **Skip to section two if you want the actual post.** 2. The 10 bullet points of why you're your own worst enemy. * The list is repeated twice, once as quick bullet points, the second is each section explained in detail. 3. Mentally surrendering games - self-sabotage * This is just a piece about giving up and how big of an effect it can have if we take your effort percentage and apply it to something else. 4. Stop attacking yourself. * The words(language) you use to describe yourself and the things you do can be toxic and self harming! ---- ###1. My justification : This issue is real Some people tell me this has nothing to do with league, I say they're wrong and i'm willing to prove them wrong. As much as some of you might think this is an ego stroke(of course it low-key is), i genuinely want to help people, after coaching a few people i've realised that mentality is a consistent inhibitor to a lot of their success. Basically your characteristics impact your league play as much as your game knowledge, you could be forever hardstuck gold 5 but able to get plat in a month if you could get your emotions in check. Because mechanically you're able to play at a plat level, albeit with a tiny bit of improvement, but your attitude(characteristics) are holding you back from success not necessarily your skill. (I'm not saying you don't need skill **because you do**, i'm saying that this is a consistent problem for many people and they fail to recognise it.) Let's say we have a top tier [footballer](URL who's having personal problems off the field, he will subconsciously bring them into work, IE on the field. It will impact his performance and he will play worst. Now imagine if this was a permanent thing, let's say a player who has the ability to play at tier one is inhibited by stress or depression for an entire season, he'll play like a tier two, everyone will call him master instead of challenger when his coach knows he has he ability of a challenger player he just can't perform because of this mental block. Long story short, don't look down at this post, what i'm talking about is real and impacts people in every part of life, it exist in people who play this game and i tell you now, it effects more people than poor game knowledge because it's persistent in people who even have good game knowledge. Let's get on with the actual post and not my justification of mental issues and their effect on performance. ---- ###2. The 10 bullet points of why you're your own worst enemy **Just the list** 1. You prefer the easy way * You dont manage your expectations * You assume * You create unrealistic demands of yourself and wonder why you've always ""failed"" * You wait for someone else to ""save"" you (or fix situations in your life) * You perpetuate unhealthy behaviours because you value other people's attention over presence with yourself * You value the comfort of not trying more than you do the discomfort of vulnerability * You ignore the fact that you have emotions * You let your emotions get the better of you or refuse to control them * You deflect blame **The list explained** 1. You prefer the easy way * Basically you fail yourself by wanting to not fully understand a topic, you're looking for 5 quick tips to diamond and not a comprehensive guide that will give you a fundamental understanding of the game or topic that will allow you to objectively understand and then improve because it's seen as ""easier to just take advice from people that know what they're talking about"", anyone who's had real success in something that requires holistic learning and was punished for taking short cuts understands that sometimes you just need to learn the basics. I appreciate that tips can help, but in the grand scheme of things, understanding the basics of the game are the most important things, stop trying to skip them before you get abused. A lot of quick guides fail to fully communicate the ideas behind the tip because they're quick, the point is they remove the reasoning and provide the answer so you become reliant on that person and incapable of doing it yourself. 2. You dont manage your expectations * Its good to expect a certain level of play from your self and others. However, if you walk into every situation with an expectation to gain the most out of it, youre going to almost always come out of it feeling unfulfilled. If you set ridiculous goals for yourself or others you will constantly be met with disappointment in situations where you are the one who needs the reality check, things don't often go to plan. Expecting nothing is hard to do and not the goal, but you need to make sure what you're expecting is realistic with a chance of failure, you must prepare for the 'perfect' gank to fail, you must prepare emotionally for that 'bad' jungle, who never ganked you after you lost that forced fight due to unexpected 'luck' which came from your wilful ignorance and anxiety, failure to meet your own expectations can cause very stupid things to happen because you just decide to ""go in anyway"", only to die, then say ""if only you had come easy kill"". 3. You assume * Projecting certain assumptions onto certain situations can be disastrous. Our brain works to fill in the gaps however it can, forming answers on faulty presumptions if necessary. You assume your jungle will gank you because you're winning lane and can dive your laner with ease but because they have their own perspective and reality they don't come and your expectations are not met based on your assumption that your situation means you should get the gank. You then spiral into some resentment, get anxious and make a solo dive in a situation that you knew was bad only to back track and blame the jungle when you forced the wrong play. 4. You create unrealistic demands of yourself and wonder why you've always ""failed"" * A lot of the time, when we don't know how to exercise real self-control, we cut ourselves off entirely from something that's ultimately necessary or desirable. I'm not going to say you should blame yourself for every loss, because i'm talking about something else, i'm talking about going into a game with 50 goals and never achieving 1, because you've forgotten who you are. You're not that robot, stop attempting to be, cut down on the amount of things you're trying to achieve and work towards one solid goal each game and have specific realistic and manageable steps to getting there. Understand that each game is a learning experience and sometimes your goal is bad, you need to adapt whilst in game and remember that the win is the win, stop trying to farm when you should be with the team. 5. You wait for someone else to ""save"" you (or fix situations in your life) * Top ten tips to challenger - don't be fucking challenged, use your mini-map, is the jungle in someone else's lane? If no, then assume he's in yours and don't engage like a mongrel you had enough information to make a sensible choice take a look around you before you die to a roaming mid laner and say ""where's the ss?"", use your god given eyes and do more than the people around you so you can climb out of your elo. Seriously, take a look your self, you're literally given a tool that shows you if someones visible, if they're not and you have no reasonable idea of where they are, **ASSUME THEY'RE GOING FOR YOU**. Challenger tactic, don't wait for someone to SS so you can back off, look at your damn map and take the initiative to move. 6. You perpetuate unhealthy behaviours because you value other people's attention over presence with yourself * No one cares about you on the enemy team, straight up fucking mute them. Seriously people value what the enemy say far too much and get baited into situations that should never of happened. You died in a 1v1, they've come back with more items, DO NOT FIGHT THEM. The only way you prove that you're better is by winning the game not some micro 1v1 with a person you'll probably never see again. You have nothing to prove to anyone even yourself. Because this is retarded. No one cares if you win your next game but you, don't sabotage your self and your chances of winning by thinking ""the enemy thinks they're better than me because i died, it was luck, ill kill him now"" only to die again for the 5 fucking time it stops being close(r) each time you die. 7. You value the comfort of not trying more than you do the discomfort of vulnerability * The reality is that nobody feels ""comfortable"" doing something scary and new that has the potential to be infinitely rewarding. Yet, there are some people who let this hold them back, and some people who don't. Valuing over the comfort of not trying (... guaranteeing not failing) over temporary vulnerability. Learn to prioritise, and learn to see objectively what's best for you, a good example would be to limit your champion pool to 6 or less champions and 2 lanes, ideally focus on 1 lane and max 2 champions if possible, don't pick the most pick or banned champs to be the ones you play, use your brain. 8. You ignore the fact that you have emotions * You do tilt, shut up with the ""i don't tilt, i've lost 3 games i'll win the next i need to go to sleep on a win."". Stop that, we're emotional creatures and most of us care about winning more than anything else, losses are demoralising compound losses are even more so, it'll lead to an emotional failure where you tilt and throw a game or don't play as good as you otherwise would because you're angry, not just because of the current game you're in but the 3 you can't stop subconsciously thinking about. Take breaks when you need them (long breaks, then go play flex or normals and learn to enjoy the game before you go and attempt to get that rank again, make sure you're ready for the trivialities of league of legends before you play). 9. You let your emotions get the better of you or refuse to control them * I feel like this could be summed up by my rage with me saying ""Stop your cry baby 0/3 afking bullshit"", you died 3 times, yes it might of been someone else fault (lie it was yours stop being trash and blaming someone else for the position you where in you could've not been there). Get your shit together and play the game, stop being passive aggressive and suggestive in game, you might thinking asking ""why"" is not as toxic as saying ""fucking noob"", **but you know what, you do it more often** and don't realise it, it goes on for so long that you think it's ok because you're not punished for driving people off the edge. You demoralise more people with your emotionally fuelled actions than you think, stop that shit. Seriously grow up not everything can go your way. 10. You deflect blame * If you're one of these people you'll probably deny it, a friend kinda needs you tell you this so you accept it or you need to see someone else do it that can recognise what you would've done in the same situation and how you would feel. Basically if you're a normal person who's not already blaming bot lane for their death because they told you to shut up after you died to 'luck' watch the ""League Of Children - BRONZE AFK STREAM"" video, i'm not linking before a mod nazi's me. Youtube the ""Reality denial cait"" and then google ""league of legends reality detail"". This is some stupid shit. Refusal to accept responsibility and be accountable is something that needs to stop. The videos will show you what i'm talking about i can't really explain it as well as seeing someone explains it. --- ###3. Mentally surrendering games - self-sabotage The cause most of your problems or most of the bad things that happen to you is yourself. It's a lot to do with your character and how you react to situations. Like, you're allowed to call bullshit and say that theirs so many things that happen to you that you can't control and that's not he point, the point is you can control what you do after it happens which is the major issue. It's like ""oh my team died it's 5 mins in we're 0/5, **games over**"" &gt;**games over** This is your mental reaction to the situation, you did this. **You** never went 0/5 but **you** stopped giving it 100% because **you** don't think it's worth it. You are the problem here. You're literally giving up. You might not say it but let's say this. Let's take the percentage of 80%. That's what you automatically start to perform at when you look at a game and say ""it's over"". Now lets take 1000 sky divers, 200 of these people are now 100% guaranteed to die. Because 200 of them were given an unprepared shoot because someone could not be asked to pack it correctly. Ya.... would you fucking sky dive if there was a 20% chance that you'd die? No. So fix your fucking mentality and put that 20% of effort back into your game and stop giving up. You might not type it, you might not say it, but you're fucking thinking it which means you've mentally surrendered the game because that 20% will get better as the game goes on regardless of how many good things happen because you'll tunnel on the bad things soon it'll become 50%, imagine going into a ranked game at 50% and expecting to win. Your reaction to the situation, your giving up is the consistent problem here not your teams dying early, you can come back from that, you can't come back from a mental surrender as easily. Cry all you want about being demoralised, i don't care. Stop making excuses and play the damn game with 100% or uninstall and go play a solo game where you don't have to rely on anyone and you can cry about he mechanics of the game losing you the win. --- ###4. Stop attacking yourself. If you say these things about yourself there's a high chance that you have an issue. This is more than just dying and saying you're bad because not everyone has the same mind, sometimes we treat things differently, one person might be cool with saying this to them self and it gives them positive effects, another can push their self into depression via feeling hopeless. * Im such an idiot. * I SHOULD have known better. * Im stupid. * Ill never get it together! * What was I thinking? People seem to forget at it's core, league is a game, games are usually meant to be enjoyed, they're meant to bring happiness, enjoy the game. Stop hating on yourself for making mistakes, they're natural, seek to learn from them not punish yourself. I can't express clearly how important this is but what i'm getting at is, for some people, their tolerance for such thoughts is non existent and you need to make sure you approach the situation in a way that works correctly for you, not everyone else. Go easy on yourself if you need to. ----- The first step to stop self sabotage is awareness. I hope if you read this you can identify the issues with a friend or yourself and work on them. ---- Promo - i'm doing a series of videos &amp; post talking about topics like this (series is called """"Mental CC"") because it interest me, i think people need more personal development than anything else, i see it a lot and it frustrates me that people have such poor development in basic areas and there's just a real lack of character amongst a lot of people that have asked me for help, it's not so much their skill level as it is their attitude to the game that's holding them back, they can work on skill because they acknowledge it's a problem, they don't see themselves, the person, the character as something that can develop though and i think this is important. If you've read this far and you're interested in seeing more post or videos comment =D. This is actually the 30th post in the series so there's a lot more. "
86,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"An actual counter to shields proposal - ""Vulnerability""",7,6vpd6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/6vpd6z/an_actual_counter_to_shields_proposal/,2017-08-24 17:56:50,"I have read many opinions here. I main enchanter supports - that means those who heal, shield and do their best to protect you. I guess we can all agree that **healing is a no-mechanic skill**, because it doesn't matter when you receive the damage, you heal it all back. The only things you have to consider are your mana pool and your cooldowns, so you can efficiently keep healing your carry on the max cooldown to prevent them from dying. **Shielding is a little harder**, because you have to shield the player in the right moment - if you shield your teammate when he's not receiving any damage from enemies, the shield is mostly wasted (let's ignore, for example, waveclear for which Janna or Lulu can boost your AA damage - I will talk just about shielding HP now). You will not have protected them in any way, that's why you have to **time the shield right**. Now, for us, protectors, shields are the ONLY thing we have that give us a chance vs. fed enemy assassins and fed burst adcs/mages. Assassin mains complain that shielding is a mechanic, that can be by no means countered and they get upset that they can't oneshot a carry if we shield them - but that's literally the only thing we can do, and it's here to prevent oneshotting (take Veigar or Syndra R for example) as it's very unhealthy for the game, to die and have no means to change the outcome of the fight, unless you stay in the base. #Now let's talk vulnerability Imagine a shield - just a reverse shield, perhaps with a red color on the HP indicator. Example as Janna's E: **Vulnerability** **ACTIVE**: Janna anti-shields the enemy target and makes them vulnerable for 5 seconds, stripping her target of 10 (+20% AP)% Armor and 15 (+30% AP)% Magic resist while the shield holds. ANTI-SHIELD STRENGTH: 80 / 120 / 160 / 200 / 240 (+ 70% AP) Vulnerability can be used on turrets, causing Janna to be credited for any kills it earns while the anti-shield holds. **Explanation** So, by point-clicking the enemy with my E, I give them a red (anti-)shield that is, for example, 240 HP. As long as this shield lasts (that means either mentioned 5 seconds, or the full HP scale of the anti-shield), the enemy target takes more physical and magic damage. It's literally the same mechanic as shielding, just reverse. It's not a burst, it's not a point-click stun. It's an anti-shield that you have to **time right**, just like a classic shield, in order for it to have effect. Enemy carry is being shielded by enemy Lulu, but at the same time, your support casted Vulberability on them, so in the end, they do receive more damage and you are actually **countering** the shield. Thank you for your time."
87,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Lore Power Level Analysis: Rengar, the Pridestalker",27,67pz1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/67pz1j/lore_power_level_analysis_rengar_the_pridestalker/,2017-04-27 04:14:57,"Whats up guys its me KatarHero (or Hyper10sion) back with a flurry of Lore Power Level assessments of the newly updated Vastayans: Ahri, Rengar, Nami, and Wukong. This particular analysis focuses on the knife cat, but the rest you can find at the end of the post, along with the unupdated lists and the previous assessments. You guys know the drill at this point, I am going to analyze Rengar in five categories: **Makeup, Physical Abilities, Magical Abilities, Weaknesses,** and **Feats**. I will then place him into one of my five tier lists, explaining the placement as well. #Rengar, the Pridestalker **Makeup**: Rengar is of the Vastayan race, a species of shapeshifting animal-human hybrids, in tune with the magicks of the world. In particular he is of the Kilash tribe, massive cat-like beings known for their prowess in the art of the hunt. **Physical Abilities**: As a Kilash, Rengar is a physical freak. He is fast enough that he killed his father, a highly trained and highly experienced warrior of greater size, before the chieftain could react. His strength is insane, able to go toe to toe with a beast big enough to trample a tent with a single step and plunge his blade into its hide, which was undamaged by physically fit humans wielding steel weapons in a fight that occurred just before Rengar got there. In addition, Rengar is considered a runt by his people, but still stands at an impressive height, somewhere around 2.2 meters (7+ feet) at least. **Magical Abilities**: Rengar does not seem to possess any magical abilities, as his invisibility was chalked up to his aptitude in the art of stealth in the story. There might be some magic to his roar, as it appeared to come from all directions at once, but this is hardly worth mentioning when accounting for Rengars power. **Weaknesses**: Rengar has the same weakness as any Vastayan: vulnerability to weapons and stronger opponents, and the occasional Oracle Alteration. His overconfidence has gotten him in trouble before, as it is what caused him to lose his eye to KhaZix, but not before getting a few really good licks in. **Feats**: Rengar is strong enough to cleave someone in half, and fast enough to move before people can react. He survived being pushed down a ravine as a child, and butchered his father before the old hunter could move to try and stop him. His most notable feat is surviving a fight with KhaZix, who can turn invisible and has claws that can cut trees in half. #**Summary:** Rengar might not have the power to turn invisible anymore, or blow up an ADC in less than half a second (SURPRISE! BUTTSECKS!), but the Pridestalker has become a physical monster. With his *combined* speed and strength, Rengar solidifies his spot in the Magus tier, albeit for different reasons than before. *Tier:* **Magus Tier (Beast Subtier)** Did I overrate Rengar? Did I underrate him? Are you Rengar mains going to try and 100-0 me in the comments like old Rengar did? Talk to me about it in the comments. If you want to see the original lore power levels, they are: [God](URL [Transcended](URL [Harbinger](URL [Magus](URL and [Mortal](URL And here are my other assessments: [Galio](URL [Xayah](URL [Rakan](URL [Ahri](URL [Nami](URL [Wukong](URL "
88,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Removing Mechanics: Why is this a new go-to balancing technique?,0,68w377,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/68w377/removing_mechanics_why_is_this_a_new_goto/,2017-05-03 07:31:52,"In the most recent patch notes *Graves* the soloQ terror at [an astounding 48% WR](URL has had his ult E cancel removed. As a Graves player, I recognize that this was not particularly mechanically intensive. It also wasn't a constantly useful mechanic. The situations where his ult was used in this way were relatively infrequent. With that said, why remove mechanical prowess from a champion that is in a fairly balanced state? The most recent nerf to true grit was a very effective and smart way to balance Graves. He's open to counter picks and is less effective into any AP. It removed one of the most frustrating predicaments where Graves could tank basically everything you could possibly throw at him and gave him some vulnerability. Which leads me to my point: why is it acceptable to remove mechanics where numbers can easily balance a champion? Riot continues to release more and more braindead mechanisms that require zero thought or awareness to reap rewards. Examples of this, Camille shields, Sejuani slow immunity, Malzahar cc immunity / damage reduction. All of these mechanisms are freebies you get for merely playing the champion. Whereas champions that require absolute mastery to perfectly execute combinations with animation cancels / auto attack resets etc. in order to be effective continue to be knee capped by the nerf bat. I don't plan to have an expansive piece on every champion I want to include **{cat lady}** but I'm at a loss for understanding why mechanical intensity is being shoved aside for champs to be played in a cookie cutter pattern with less and less success being attributed to skill and mastery of their kits. If a champion needs to be nerfed there are always numbers that can be tweaked. It is unnecessary to gut a champion's play style to make it less effective for the average player. This type of balancing is a slippery slope that most drastically effects players that sink the most time and effort into a champion. Not to beat a dead horse but it can also lead to champions being immensely less fun (in my experience). TLDR: Removing mechanics from champions as a means of balance is terrible and hurts players that sink the most time and effort into champion mastery (in my opinion). "
89,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Lore Power Levels Day Three: The Harbinger Tier,869,5vkmkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5vkmkn/lore_power_levels_day_three_the_harbinger_tier/,2017-02-23 06:02:16,"Day Three of the tier lists, with the God and Transcended Tiers out of the way. Next up is the Harbinger Tier, but here are the tiers for those new to the series, ranging from most to least powerful. As a side note, whoever gilded me..thank you. Dont know exactly what to do with it, but I appreciate it! Tiers: **[God](URL [Transcended](URL Harbinger, Magus, Mortal** A reminder that this list is based upon the CURRENT lore. No Summoners, no League, no Summoner's Rift. Cinematics not on the Rift are acceptable. Just as a reminder, Jaxs win streak is not canon, and as thus doesn't matter. (Because I know someone will bring it up, much to my chagrin) The same thing goes for Nasus being a world smashing demigod, any fan theories, etc. The list is completely unbiased, as if I was showing bias, my two favorite champion would not be in this tier. I would also like to express that just because a champion is in a tier above another, does not mean they would be guaranteed to win in a fight. Two tiers does, but some Mortal champions can definitely take on a few of the Magus champions for example. &amp;nbsp; **Harbinger Tier**: Beings in this tier have the power of entire armies, if not more. They can summon armies to fight for them, destroy vast areas easily, have a form of indestructibility, or have the sheer size to overpower any enemy on one of the lower tiers. There are five subcategories in this tier: **Abnormality, General, Scion, Supernatural,** and **Titan**, with two sets of honorable mentions. *Champions in Harbinger Tier*: 21 **Champions**: *Brand, Braum, ChoGath, Hecarim, Ivern, Janna, Kalista, Karma, Karthus, Malphite, Malzahar, Maokai, Mordekaiser, Ryze, Rammus, Soraka, Syndra, Thresh, VelKoz, Yorick, Zyra* *Side note: Summoning or creating minions to do a champions bidding qualifies as under their power. Kled calling Skaarl does not count, but Annie summoning Tibbers does.* I left the Honorable mentions till this list because putting them in the same page as the previous lists would just feel out of place. They belong in a pseudo-Tier floating between the bottom three, Im calling it **Limbo**. **Honorable Mention - Illaoi:**The Kraken Priestess is an intimidating figure, even without the powers her god Nagakabouros gave her. A mountain of a woman, Illaoi is the prophet of Bilgewaters squid god, and can call upon the deitys power. However here is the catch: *Can Illaoi use the tentacles without the idol?* If that answer is yes, then she definitely belongs here. If no, then the idol holds all the power, and Illaoi gets moved to Mortal, because the power is not innately hers. Seeing as I could not find a definitive answer, I will leave Illaoi in Limbo. Sorry guys, had to make a call. **Honorable Mention 2 - Shaco/Nocturne/Jax**: Because even Riots biography doesnt know what these.things are. I dont deal in theories, so they are in Limbo too. Basically, not enough lore to go off of. I apologize, but this was the safest place to put them. (P.S. I now hate Shaco with the fury of a thousand tilted Riven Mains) **The Abnormalities**: These champions dont really fit into any of the other categories, but are powerful enough to make it into this tier. They each are wholly unique, powerful, and deserving of this tier. They miss higher tiers due to lack of feats or a lack of power, or lacking the immortality thing. **Champions: Braum, Ivern, Janna, Ryze, Rammus, Soraka, VelKoz** **Braum**: The Heart of the Freljord is, DESPITE POPULAR OPINION, an actual being whose feats have caused most to consider him a tall tale, paralleling folk heroes like Paul Bunyan. Braum has proved this wrong by aligning with the Avarosans under Queen Ashe. He can hold up a mountain, launch ice blasts, and has an indestructible shield. In addition, he has lived for hundreds of years without visibly aging, indicating he possesses some degree of immortality or longevity. When the going gets tough, stand behind this guy. *Note: While the shield is not an innate power that Braum possesses, but a tool that adds to his power, he would make it here regardless due to his freakish resume.* **Ivern**: The Greenfather is an ancient being in tune with nature itself. He can call upon various animals to help him, and is a master of preservation magic. While he is not the most offensively talented, the age old Treant is deceptively powerful. After merging with the God-Willow of Ionia, Ivern was imbued with its strength, such as the power to communicate with animals, which will come to his aid whenever needed, some of them extremely fierce. In addition, he can communicate with trees, able to scout with the ground itself. He can even raise plants to grow immediately, able to obsure an entire battlefield if necessary. He might not be a fighter, but that doesnt mean should fight him. **Janna**: The Storms Fury started as a small wind spirit, but has grown great in power. She can call upon typhoons or tornados at will, defending those who raise their voices in seek of her aid. A fickle spirit, she can do things from send people falling hundreds of feet to getting a ship out of the eye of a storm. Janna avoids higher tiers due to requiring the prayers and praise of mortals to be powerful. The winds are hers to control, and she is very testy. **Rammus**: The Armordillo is a creature surrounded by mystery. If not for the Shuriman Lore that was released recently, Rammus would be in the lowest tier. Wherever Rammus goes, things happen. His shell appears to be indestructible, as entire buildings have fallen on Rammus and it didnt leave a scratch. He creates tremors for a massive area around him, which are powerful enough to collapse multiple buildings at the same time, and now can even shake mountains. If you see him rolling, get out of the way. Okay? **Ryze**: The Rogue Mage takes on world shattering powers all of the time. They made Ryze jump a tier with his rework lore. As a master of the arcane arts, Ryze would be dangerous based on his abilities alone. When taking into account he takes on beings who wield artifacts capable of leveling cities, Ryze becomes downright terrifying. He can launch a wave of arcane energy, freeze an enemy in place with a magical barrier, create shields, and teleport himself and allies. He may just look like an overgrown smurf, but hes a force to be reckoned with. *Note: When taking into account Ryzes power, I took him *without the World Runes*. He expresses his distaste for them and that power really belongs to the Runes, not him. **Soraka**: The Starchild used to be a Celestial, of the same race as Bard. She gave up this power, but still retains some of her otherworldly might. She is the foremost expert on healing magic in Runeterra, is immortal in regards to aging, and can call upon the power of stars for defensive aid. While not the most proficient at offensive magic, you want this celestial to be there when you get hurt. **Vel'Koz**: The Eye of the Void is the most intelligent denizen of the dark realm, and processes information by disintegration. He can fire plasma blasts from his eye and his tentacles, which allow him to analyze who or whatever is unfortunate enough to pique his interest, including other Voidborn. His Lifeform Disintegration Ray in particular can destroy an entire building. Curiosity didn't kill the cat, the plasma beam fired out of curiosity did. **The Generals**: These beings can call forth armies to fight for them. While they can fit into other categories, they collectively fit best into this one. **Champions: Karthus, Malzahar, Yorick, Zyra** **Karthus**: The Deathsinger is unusual among the denizens of the Shadow Isles. As a human, he was fascinated by the moment of death, so he embraced the Black Mist. As a result, he is in a state between the end of life and the start of death. He commands an army of undead wraiths, who are the souls he has liberated from life. He can create blasts of spectral energy, conjure a wall of the same energy, and create a vortex that drains the life of living things inside. His most powerful spell, Requiem, brings death to all living beings within its range. This lich finds beauty in the end, and will happily provide you that beauty, whether you want it or not. **Malzahar**: The Prophet of the Void has been to the dark realm, and returned as its emissary to Runeterra. Malzahar can open portals to the Void, calling forth minor Voidlings and even some more powerful ones such as KogMaw. While he has no power over the major Voidlings such as Vel'Koz and Cho'Gath, they still respect him and his position as the Voids Prophet. He can also call upon Void energy, channeling it in blasts, focused beams, and infection of the minds of his enemies. He, for one, welcomes the alien overlords. **Yorick**: The Gravedigger is the ferryman to the Shadow Isles, with a wholly unique situation. He is neither alive nor dead, and can channel his power through his shovel. He can call upon the spirits of the dead, allowing him to create an army of ghosts, called Mist Walkers, to fight all comers. While not nearly the most powerful being of the Shadow Isles, the last Mori can still command a massive undead host, earning him this spot. Yorick walks into a bar. **Zyra**: The Rise of Thorns may as well be Mother Nature herself. Once an ancient plant, Zyra imbued her consciousness into a human woman, giving her the ability to see beyond the jungle she resided in. She can call forth an army of plants of all kinds. From vines with razor sharp thorns, to ones that can shoot spikes, to a giant mass of thorns that can entrap enemies, the vegetation of Runeterra is Zyras to control. At the end of most thorns you can find a rose, at the end of this one you find a host of man eating plants. **The Scions**: These beings have raw power equalling those of higher tiers, but have the unfortunate vulnerability of a human, meaning someone like Jhin could take them out given the element of surprise. **Champions: Brand, Karma, Syndra** **Brand**: The Burning Vengeance is an ancient spirit of fire who only desires to burn everything in sight. However the spirit of Brand must possess a human body to use its power, similar to Soul Caliburs Inferno, which is why Nasus and Renekton were able to seal him in the first place. Brand has complete mastery over the blaze, able to create it at will, from pillars of fire to balls of flame. This is one fire that you can't truly extinguish. **Karma**: The Enlightened One is one of the most powerful humans in Runeterra. As the Duchess of Ionia, she can unleash spiritual power unlike any other human. From shielding allies to spirit chains to blasts of spirit flame, Karma can harness her spirit powers in many ways. One of her most impressive feats is being able to create spirit dragons that can tear their targets soul out. She is a reminder that peaceful doesn't mean pacifist. **Syndra**: The Dark Sovereign is probably the most powerful human in Runeterra. Through telekinesis she can use her orbs, which are pure magical energy condensed into a spherical shape, to terrifying effect, from throwing people like rag dolls to lifting an entire temple into the sky. Her power grows continuously, so it could reach an extremely high ceiling. Her orbs can even be launched through people, leaving a basketball sized hole wherever they go. This is one femme fatale who can literally rip your heart out and show it to you. **The Supernatural**: These are beings who have transcended humanity and inhabit the Shadow Isles. While not all of these beings are equal in power, they are all deserving of this tier. As their power is of a more spectral nature, and most were human at one point, this felt like a safe place to put them. **Champions: Hecarim, Kalista, Maokai, Mordekaiser, Thresh** **Hecarim**: The Shadow of War is a truly terrifying entity. An impressive warrior, Hecarim is a rampaging force of nature in undeath. Hecarim gained more power through betraying Kalista than he could have imagined, being fused to his horse and given immortality. He is the most active of the specters during the Harrowing, and is said to be the only one nearly on par with Mordekaiser. He is strong enough to destroy ships with his charge, cleave through buildings, and summon a host of undead riders to his side mid charge. When the Black Mist rolls in to Bilgewater, you can bet this monster will lead the charge. **Kalista**: The Spear of Vengeance was a respected warrior in life, and a figure of legend in death. Betrayed by Hecarim with several spears being shoved through her back, she was resurrected as a spirit who would answer the calls of those who seek vengeance. In addition to immortality and nigh invincibility due to her spectral form, Kalista can pursue her prey as a dark mist, throw spears that pierce solid brick, and use the souls offered to her as sentries or projectiles. To this ghost, the price of betrayal is death. **Maokai**: The Twisted Treant is the manifestation of the life magic that once fueled the Blessed Isles. Once a spirit of the isles forest, he inhabited a great oak tree when the corruption gave him no further options. The spirits of the dead were drawn to the life energies flowing through Maokai, which imbue him with great power. He can create shockwaves from hitting the ground, and can crush stone with his iron hard limbs. He can create saplings that explode, transport himself underground at blinding speeds, and create a magical maelstrom around his body. Vin Diesel would be proud. **Mordekaiser**: The Iron Revenant is the most powerful being on and the ruler of the Shadow Isles. Once a warlord-king who rampaged through Valoran wearing a nigh indestructible suit of armor, he was finally felled by an army of enemies. He was resurrected as a wraith, with his only weakness being his bones, which his liches use to resurrect him if he is actually beaten. When released by the corruption of the Shadow Isles, Mordekaiser quickly took control, enslaving the undead denizens and recalling the souls of his slain enemies. Mordekaiser is one of the few spirits strong enough to not be bound to the Black Mist, but it still amplifies his power. He has limited telekinesis, incredible strength, can project blasts of unlife, a mace imbued with dark sorcery, and can create a storm of metal. Bow down to the King, or get smashed by his mace. **Thresh**: The Chain Warden was a man who guarded ancient artifacts, and he specialized in the torture of his living wards, provided that his victims would heal from his acts. As a wraith his cruelty was taken to new heights, with the ability to torture and hold his victims soul. He keeps hundreds of the souls in his lantern, with each growing his power. Thresh can use his hook to hook his victims, rip their souls out, and he can create a box of spectral energy that keeps a victims soul inside. While he is probably the weakest of the champions from the Shadow Isles, all but the most powerful inhabitants fear his cruelty and what he can do to their souls. Try and break the chains, he will only break you. **The Titans**: These two beings are massive, with their sheer size being a weapon. There is much debate about how tall each of these beings are, so I did the math based upon their splash arts, obtaining the current height. Seeing as Riot is based in America, I used an American Male, 1.78 meters, for the average height of the soldiers in each splash art, comparing the pixel count of the soldiers heights to a nearby body part, Malphites finger and ChoGaths pincer, and compared using the pixels of their measured body parts to the whole using in game models. While these two are massive, their feats/size do not merit Transcended Tier. **Champions: ChoGath, Malphite** **ChoGath**: The Terror of the Void stands at an approximate height of 22.2 meters, or 72.8 feet, but this number will only grow as time passes. ChoGath is the strongest of the Voidlings *on Runeterra*, and it is clear as to why. Possessing immense size, strength, and high intelligence, ChoGath is a force of nature. In addition to power coming from his size, ChoGath can summon spikes that erupt from the ground, create impale-a-man sized spikes to throw at his enemies, and his roar can send entire battalions flying. His most powerful ability is his ability to grow whenever he eats another being, constantly increasing his size. This otherworldly beast is truly the apex predator of Runeterra. GODZILLA! **Malphite**: The Shard of the Monolith stands at a gargantuan 25.8 meters, or around 84.6 feet in height when standing in his usual *slouched* position, meaning he is far and above the largest champion other than Aurelion Sol, who creates stars that dwarf planets. Malphites sheer size allows him to create small tremors by striking the ground, and when he gets into a charge practically nothing can stop him. He can harden his skin so to enhance his already devastating punches, and he can create giant wheels of rock that make the Indiana Jones rock look like a pebble. While not a full sized mountain, he is still a hulking figure, if you smell what I am cooking. Think I am wrong, that I missed someone, or have any questions? Put it in the comments, and I will post the next list tomorrow. "

So to counter, I proceed to invest on some MR + dmg items, to stand him in lane and go Youmuu's + Duskblade just in late game. That went well in some plays, but then the jungler, without being offensive actually told me I was build talon all wrong, and that I should go Youmuu's + Duskblade asap in a game with an assassin for the damage And that got me thinking, should I go full leth and AD for the damage, or invest in some ""passive agressive"" build? Am I hurting my team for not going full offensive items? I also start thinking ""well he probably just knows the meta assassin build and is tellling me that, but it as been working so I'll just do what I'm doing"" It worked for some matches to, when we won the game and I actually got like 8/0/11, good CS, and even got myself some S but that's my part, I want to know if my thinking is health for teamplay and team composition I'm unranked btw, just want to know if I should trust my own way to build or go for standard build, in order to work better with my team, and climb when I feel trust enough to get myself into ranked play Thank you."

This work suggests that one way to address the gender gap in gaming is to better understand and improve the social dynamics within popular games."" **Mechanics and Metagame || Exploring Binary Expertise in League of Legends** Scott Donaldson || First Published June 4, 2015 *Abstract*: ""This article examines the significance of two types of expertise in the popular multiplayer video game League of Legends. Previous research into multiplayer games has explored a variety of expertise models, some which concern only a players mastery of the controls and some which take negotiation of a games sociocultural context into account. This article analyzes play in League of Legends through the lens of a binary model of expertise, outlining examples of the in-game and out-of-game practices used by players in their pursuit of competitive success. I argue that forms of out-of-game or metagame expertise are of particular importance in League of Legends and are of such depth that further research would be highly valuable."" **Video gamers of League of Legends: The role of passion in abusive use and in performance** Bertran, Enric E. || Adicciones (Palma de Mallorca) *Abstract*: ""There is growing concern about the addictive potential of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG). The Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) is a new genre, poorly studied but very popular, in which performance holds priority over immersion. The aim of the current study was to explore the influence of passion both on abuse and performance, using the dualistic model of passion. A total of 369 participants completed an online questionnaire that included problematic use and the Passion Scale. From players' nicknames, performance statistics were obtained. The results show that harmonious passion is a protector from negative consequences. On the other hand, obsessive passion predicts negative consequences and use of videogames for evasion. Obsessive passion also predicts better performance. These results suggest that distinguishing the two kinds of passion is important because they influence vulnerability to developing maladaptive behaviors and also players' performance.""

94,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Perspective on ADC 2017 from a Returning ADC 2012 Player,91,5spbtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5spbtj/perspective_on_adc_2017_from_a_returning_adc_2012/,2017-02-08 11:25:08,"Im a returning player that last played LoL seriously during season 2, which began at the end of 2011. I used to play ADC, and naturally I am quickly realizing that the role has transformed significantly since I last played. While I see a lot of posts complaining about ADCs, or ones complaining about the complaints, I noticed a trend: people are primarily focused on itemization differences between old ADCs and new, and current ADCs relative to the rest of the roles. However, as someone who is experiencing a number of changes quite suddenly, I am noticing many things that have changed the way ADCs play now compared to 2012. I thought it might be helpful to outline some of these, which will hopefully help to identify some of the more subtle shifts in the meta that cause ADCs to be in their current state. As a disclaimer, I am not really advocating for any change, and certainly not a return to how ADCs were in 2012. Under the old meta, I personally think ADCs were too strong, and able to operate independently from their team more so than is reasonable. However, the current state of ADCs is almost certainly not ideal either. **Far Less Damage Early Game**  ADCs cant bully their lane opponents as easily, and are far more reliant on cooperation with their support to win trades. Not sure if this is just because of DB nerf, masteries, or some combination. **Stronger and Jinkier Supports**  In the past, supports came in two major flavors: healers/shield, or utility/cc. A wider array of support champs, combined with the fact that AP skills out damage AD auto-attacks before items, means ADCs are more vulnerable in early game and have a harder time farming. Im looking at you Malz, Zyra, Brand, etc. **Dorans Blade Nerf**  In the past, you either got a double kill early in your lane and recalled for the BF, or you got wrecked and would spend some gold on a second (or even third) DB to keep yourself in the fight. Now you either win and get a BF, or lose and get a pickaxe. This has broader implications since the losing player is now forced to go IE first, whereas the winning player can afford to go Hunaans first. Its also worth noting that DB is very weak compared to earlier iterations, where it used to be around 100 hp, 10 dmg, and 5% lifesteal. **Jungle Camps Are Tougher**  In the past, bot lane blue side would shore up their vulnerability to tri-brush by getting the golems at lvl 1, ensuring a quicker lvl 2. That offered some protection against ganks, and an opportunity to pressure their lane opponents. **Everyone has Wards**  Its 2012 and youre an ADC in lane. What do you do? You abuse the shit out of those bushes. You make sure that you are forcing them to buy wards and re-ward that bush every damn time, otherwise theyre going to get zoned. And eventually, the support would run out of wards and have to recall. More importantly, those bushes were your friend against ganks. If the lane is pushed away from you, the enemy team wards the bush close to their tower, and the bush near your tower is unwarded. The enemy jungler ganks because you have to be far from your tower to cs. You run to the bush, and now the jungler wastes his engage on your support rather than getting out of position and running into the bush. That wasnt every gank, but it was enough of them that the bush offered some survivability and outplay potential. Free wards for everyone means that the bushes only exist to punish people who forget to ward them. **Weak Early Game ADCs are Food for JunglersThat Then Melt ADCs in Team Fights**  There is a combination of things going on here. ADCs do less damage early game, CC/heal supports are not the only supports played nowadays, there are more high mobility junglers, bushes offering less protection from ganks, all mean one thing: the jungler can leave the jungle with less of a feeling of falling behind on gold. The same champs that can wreck an ADC on a gank then get fed, and this translates into a persistent advantage they have against the ADC. **Fewer Champs with AOE Ults Means a Tougher Teamfight Engagement**  Years ago, most team fights were a battle to get whoever on your team had some incredible AOE to the middle of their team in order to deal the most damage. Nunu, Fiddle, Kat, etc. Team fights were pretty closely grouped, and this meant an ADC had more options on who to engage on. Now, ADCs are so squishy that they have to hang back. Lots of champions are high mobility, those huge AOE ults are not as strong as before, and assassins/tanks are able to rush the ADC unimpeded. This all translates into a team fight scenario that went from ADC trying to stay out of ults and find the squishiest person to attack from a distance, to either diving in and doing some damage or trying to 1v1 their tank/assassin that is keeping you out of the fight. I honestly feel like the physical shape of team fights now is a long string, rather than a group with a frontline and backline. **Bloodthirster**  Now it offers a shield and lifesteal, in the past it was a stacking damage increase for each minion killed (max to 40) and lifesteal. This is a big deal. It went from being a damage item that you took if you needed some survivability before getting IE, to being a semi-defensive item that you only get after getting your main damage items. The shield is pretty worthless, since it only builds after being able to attack enemies. In most situations where the shield would be useful, youre not able to just sit there and build a shield. More importantly, it changes the dynamic of an actually useful early game defensive item, the Vamp Scepter. Since a BT is not a great first or second item anymore, getting a VS during the laning phase is a waste. The lack of viability for early lifesteal items further diminishes your ability to survive ganks and stay in lane. **Shorter Games**  Reduces the impact that ADCs, that have always excelled in the late game, have overall. **Instead of the Team Needing You, Now You Need the Team**  In 2012 if you wanted to have an early or midgame team fight without your ADC, you were going to have a bad time. Your team had a reason to protect you. They had a reason to gank for your lane. Nowadays, ADCs do so little damage before itemswhich are very expensivethat your team has practically no reason to protect you. Your contributions to early team fights are not substantial enough that they should compromise their own damage to save you, and this exacerbates the feeling of ADCs as having no impact on team fights. Furthermore, if the game lasts long enough for you to be relevant, chances are that youre able to farm enough to get your items regardless of how many kills you got in the laning phase. This is the core problem I see: you need your team to do anything except farm, but your team has no reason to help you do anything except farm. Thats just my two cents. Obviously Ive been out of the game for awhile, so take it all with a grain of salt. Also, I purposefully avoided talking about all the new champs that have come out, because my honest opinion is that there were *always* annoying champs that could dive you. Teams are still 5v5, so I dont think it makes a big difference if that fighter/assassin/whatever has 10 champs to choose from to jump on you with instead of 3. **Edit: TL;DR:** the reason ADCs are so weak now is not because of just a few item changes, or because of new champs that easily kill ADCs, but because the opportunities for ADCs to outplay lanes and contribute to team fights have been slowly whittled away by non-ADC related changes."
95,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Open Letter RE: Camille,0,5jo729,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5jo729/open_letter_re_camille/,2016-12-22 13:52:57,"""Camille is the latest effort in our evolving understanding of melee combat in League of Legends. Her kit is based on all the lessons weve learned so far"" - Riot Jag What a disheartening statement. I firmly believe Camille is the most blatantly overpowered, overloaded and unhealthy champion that has been released. I've been playing since season 1 and this is the first release where I have genuinely despised this champ as soon as she was announced. Even watching the champion preview it is obvious that she was going to be broken. Lets break it down. **Her Kit** In [this](URL dev post, Riot Jag explicitly says that her kit is ""Overloaded but not overpowered"" and then goes on to justify this by basically saying that binary champions like tryndamere cannot deal with the wide variety of skill sets in the top lane, and thus overloading is necessary for a top laner to function. I think this is blatantly wrong, but i'll come back to this. Lets analyse her kit by making a list of 'attributes' that she has, where an attribute is some mechanism or sub-skill that is desirable for a melee dps (For example, auto-resets, true damage, self healing, etc). Camille's kit has: * Self-Shield from passive (I also want to note that at 20% hp scaling, this is the largest hp scaling shield in the game - sions shield is 10% hp scaling at max rank) *from her q alone - precision protocol* * Two auto resets * 2x AD scaling auto enhancements * up to 100% true damage (consider that this damage includes sheen proc - this is mind boggling) * % based movement speed boost. 20-40% at max rank (Compare this to lucian's w which similarly augments movement speed but a flat 60-80 - at max rank, Camille's is more than twice as powerful. These skills shouldn't be equivalent but I just wanted to highlight the strength of %MS boost) *from her w - tactical sweep* * area of affect damage * 90% slow (!!!) * %max hp damage (still aoe) * uncapped self healing vs champions based on damage dealt *from her e - hookshot* * two seperate dashes (I'm not sure of the maximum range but it is absurd. One of the largest gap closers to date, pretty much on par with Zac - see [this](URL link. Its absurd) * aoe stun * aoe damage (it actually has insane damage for a GAP CLOSER - 250 + 75% bonus ad max rank) * up to 80% bonus attack speed *her ultimate - holy shit. Might as well read ""Press R to kill a carry""* * UNTARGETABLE DURING CAST (cc/damage immunity) * the psuedo-cc effect of locking your opponent into the zone for 4 seconds. (4 seconds in this game is massive. Teamfights sometimes end in 4 seconds) * more %hp damage - up to 8% per auto. * aoe knockback effect - pretty much janna ult / xin ult but infinitely better. Think about that. I'm going to try list other desirable attributes for a melee fighter: * knockback/knockup effect * self hp steroid (renek ult) * I actually can't think of any more. Thats it - she can pretty much do it all. Say i'm going top lane, why would I **ever** pick wukong, olaf, pantheon, kled, fiora, yorick, trynd, riven, gangplank, garen, trundle or gnar over Camille? I wouldn't, because I would have 1/5th of the influence on the game simply because most of their kits pale in comparison to what she can do. She builds tank and busts other tanks. She even assassinates a carry better and easier than zed or talon which is fucking sad. **Power Level** Now, I get it. From a financial standpoint this champion is probably making riot bank. But trying to justify this kit, saying things like overloaded is not necessarily overpowered is just a cop out. You only need to look at the [stats](URL * ~54% winrate top - shes been out two weeks, with a **75%** winrate on her optimal build. I know these statistics aren't always indicative of a champions power but these numbers are still disgusting. I don't think I need to say anymore on her power level. Overloaded IS overpowered. This champion is going to choke so many others out of viability by simply existing. Enough said. **Holistic Fun** Another attempt at validating Camille's kit, from the dev post, was a discussion on windowed kill opportunities. Things like cooldowns, suggesting that she needs to walk out of melee range to use her w, things like this that create dynamic interactions between Camille and her opponents. Lets explore this in a second, but first I want to reference [this](URL post from Fizz Enthusiast on game health &amp; fun. He talks about fizz WQ instakilling someone and how this may be 10/10 fun for the fizz player but his opponent is having 2/10 fun - thus being unhealthy from a holistic perspective and needing reworks. Now let me show you [this clip](URL While it looks cool and flashy and the Camille is probably having 10/10 fun, how much fun do you think the Caitlyn and Naut are having? Caitlyn walks up to the teamfight, protected by her support (Nautilus) and her top laner (Poppy). Despite this, Camille covers a massive distance and kills naut and cait with ease, all the while tanking poppy. I know this is Huni, and he's probably fed, but this isn't exactly uncommon behaviour and anybody that has played against Camille will have experienced something like this. Where are the windows of vulnerability the counterplay? Where are the long cooldowns? Her shield comes up twice that fight, and she uses her gap closer 4 times in less than 30 seconds. She takes two forms of hard cc, and still kills everyone. She uses every ability, multiple times, and ends the fight having spent only half her mana. She is clearly not gated by resources? So tell me riot - how do you counter this? Camille isn't fun for her opponents, because there IS NO COUNTERPLAY. She has mobility, assassination potential, tankiness, sustain, cc utility. She does everything, and does it well. It is ridiculous to think that a champion like this passes internal QC, and its sooo contradictory to read these recent posts on holistic health and windowed opportunities when camille just so clearly breaks all these rules. **TL;DR** Riot thinks that overloaded  overpowered, justifies Camille this way. I believe this is false, and even if they did bring her power level down, she would still stifle many champions out of viability simply because she can do everything, and does it better than most. I don't support this, if you value champion diversity then you shouldn't too. Thanks for reading, let me know your thoughts on Camille below. "
96,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Pantheon rework brainstorm,1,5l8ilq,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5l8ilq/pantheon_rework_brainstorm/,2016-12-31 17:54:56,"As we all know, pantheon falls of very hard late game because of his vulnerability to CC and single target only CC.

97,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,A Look at the Top 5 junglers from patch 6.23,73,5fn1zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/5fn1zi/a_look_at_the_top_5_junglers_from_patch_623/,2016-11-30 13:34:28,"**Vi** With a relatively easy playstyle, quick clearspeeds and a game changing ultimate. Vi slowly creeped through every other jungler in solo queue. If we take a look at the jungle changes we see that vi was given a pretty big gift in terms of clear speed. Counter-junglers would once ruin Vis day due to her long cool downs and early game vulnerability. Since the release of the new jungle it is more about farming camps efficiently as the reworked raptor and krug camps make champions with better aoe. What also benefitted Vi was the ability for every jungler to Clear Red into Krugs for a fast level 3. This benefits vi especially because of how potent her Level 3 gank is, no longer are the days of being safe against a double buff Vi now laners have to adjust to the fact that Vi may show up with Flash&gt;Q before the laner even hits 2. Thanks to the new mastery Courage of the Colossus, Vi also found herself with an improved Keystone that is not only good in the early game but scales very well with her kit and vi tends to buy heavy HP items such as steraks gauge and Deadmans plate. Overall VI has gotten indirect buffs across the board as has successfully secured her position as queen of the jungle for the time being Runes: * Attack Speed Quint * Attack Damage Red * Armor Yellow * Magic Resistance Blue Masteries: * URL Skill Build: * W&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;R&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;R&gt;E&gt;E&gt;W&gt;W&gt;R&gt;W&gt;W **Shyvana** Shyvana saw a rework on 6.23. Many of her abilities changed and all of it for the better. Riots goal was to make Shyvana the large menacing dragon that she was designed to be. This required trimming off irrelevant features(While flame trail looked cool what was the point of it?) and giving Shy quite a bit of love. Shyvana received several size changes in her Dragon form. Shyvana herself as well as her Burnout(W) range grows at ranks 2 and 3 of her ult. This size buff isnt just visual as she also gains a substantial amount of HP when she flys into battle. She also had her Flame Breath(E) updated in dragon form as well. While still marking targets for bonus on-hit magic damage, she now throws a fireball down on an area and leaves a aoe that deals persistent damage(Think morgana pool here). The biggest issue with Shyvana was that when you played her passive farm play style, she was easily dealt with and ignored even when in dragon form due to her squishy high income build(Bloodrazor&gt;Blade of the Ruined king) and need for level 11. With these buffs and a much tankier build path Shyvana outputs much more damage and is much harder to ignore. Runes: * Attack Speed Quint * Attack Damage Red * Armor Yellow * Magic Resistance Blue Masteries: * URL Skill Build: * W&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;W&gt;W&gt;R&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;Q&gt;R&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;E&gt;R&gt;E&gt;E **Ivern** Ivern received a blessing when the new jungle came out. While everyone else struggled to figure out their new clear path, Ivern did the same old song and dance with a buff into a Level 2 gank. People underestimate the ease of Ivern in the early game and his ability to repeatedly punish a single lane due to how unpredictable Iverns clear is. This biggest issue with Ivern was figuring the optimal build path, but it appears everyone has settled on an AP Support build, with Athenes and Redemption. This is purely to keep uptime on daisy to a maximum.The 70% aoe slow on Triggerseed makes it very easy for Daisy to disrupt and knock up several people in a fight. In addition the minor healing from Redemption and Athenes keep daisy alive longer so stall out the next cooldown. This build also gives Ivern the mana sustain for midgame teamfights because he also gets blue. Runes: * Movement Speed Quint * Magic Penetration Red * Scaling Health Yellow * Ability Power Blue Masteries: * URL Skill Build: * Q&gt;E&gt;W&gt;E&gt;E&gt;R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;R&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;W&gt;R&gt;W&gt;W **Skarner** This one was a surprise to me but after doing a bit of research I realized that skarner is pretty impossible to get away from on the current patch. This again has to do with how strong jungle experience and gold is on the current patch a jungler with an above average pre-6, a point and click disable and a uses CoTC well rises to the top of the jungle food chain. Skarners main issue was a Feast or Famine play style where snowballing was crucial to hit a critical mass of items. With the current jungle meta being heavily focused on farming due to the massive advantages you get from it Skarner can safely ramp up until hes ready. Runes: * Attack Speed Quint * Attack Damage Red * Armor Yellow * Magic Resistance Blue Masteries: * URL Skill Build: * Q&gt;W&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;R&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;R&gt;E&gt;E&gt;W&gt;W&gt;R&gt;W&gt;W **Shaco** The last jungler on our list has appeared out of thin air. Shaco saw some love in the Assassin rework and as the dust finally settles Shaco has found himself back at what he does best, making squishies cry. While other junglers are able to farm into an unkillable state, shaco excels as blowing up carries thanks to his Decieve&gt; Two-Shiv Poison&gt; combo. Its important to note that shaco received extra on hit damage from Decieve that scales with Ability Power as well as extra % missing health damage on Two-Shiv Poisions active. Where old forms of AD Shaco would fall off, AP shaco gets to scale exponentially into late game thanks to a 1.5AP ratio before including things like Runic Echoes, Gunblade, Crit(Yes shacos Decieve bonus damage can crit..) and Lich Bane. The breakdown of all this math is that Shacos early game has more than likely received a huge buff because of the execute of Two-shiv poison. From there Shaco transitions into an incredibly frustrating assassin that deletes carries within a thunderlords proc. All the problems with shaco in the late game are more or less gone. Runes: * Attack Speed Quint * Attack Damage Red * Armor Yellow * Ability Power Blue Masteries: * URL Skill Build: * W&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;Q&gt;R&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;E&gt;R&gt;E&gt;E&gt;R&gt;W&gt;W&gt;R&gt;W&gt;W **Analysis of Top Junglers for Patch 6.23:** I think Riot has already pinpointed the best way to nerf Ivern. Removing the 70% slow on Iverns shield explosion should tone him down and force the Ivern player to farm up levels more strategically rather than taking camps on a whim and repeatedly punishing lanes over and over as well as making Daisy more manageable to deal with early mid game. I dont think there needs to be any more nerfs past this as Ivern has a refreshing and unique playstyle and should be preserved and viable as there are very clear counters to it such as Iverns poor Dragon pressure pre-6. Shaco will probably need some excess power trimmed off in his late game. Currently shaco take AD marks and quints to make his early ganks more potent for the shiv execute. If riot trims off the ratio and % missing hp damage on Two-Shiv Poison in later ranks his power curve should smooth out to a much more reasonable level. As for the other champions on this list, its more of a general problem of junglers on the current patch. This issue is the experience and gold of a kill equates to farming two jungle camps. This gives the jungler an ability to gain huge advantages before even equating for global objectives like dragon and towers. The biggest offender of these advantages is the Krug camp which in combination with red buff gives the jungler the highly prized level 3. If the jungler succeeds in the gank after hitting level 3 every lane then has to worry about said jungler terrorizing their lane for the rest of the game as well as knowing there is a bomb with a very short fuse about to go off in the next 5 minutes due to the massive experience gains in the jungle. There other issue that many players are not seeing at the moment if the change from Specific Camp Smite Buffs to a 100+10% max HP gain on every smite changed jungle health as well. This especially enabled Skarner to get through more camps before needing to recall which accelerates him through his early game. Between the 10% health heal and CoTC its very hard to ignore the free power you get from hard CC tanks. While Outliers do exist like Shaco, the jungle meta in large is dominated by Hard CC tanks with AoE clears. Long gone are the days of squishy power farmers that offer nothing but damage like Olaf, Nidalee and Graves due to their inability to compete with 21% max hp shields controlled by champions that can farm just as well if not better. A side note , Jax and Nocturne have spiked up in the jungle as their former core item Blade of the Ruined King made them quite formidable. This is good enough for solo queue but I doubt it will make any splash in competitive. **TL;DR:** **Smite rework + Courage of The Colossus makes tank CC champions overbearing.** **Skarner benefitted the most for the Smite rework because it smoothed out his early game clear.** **Vi saw the most benefits out of Red&gt;Krugs Level 3 path over Elise Lee Sin and Zac** **Shaco makes his return to make Squishies cry throughout the game rather than just early game.** **Shyvana's buffs worked.** **Do keep in mind this is a general overview based on win rates. This does not invaldiate other champions in this meta that may be weighed down by player inexperience. It is simply a took to help people understand the jungle on a basic level and why certain picks are made.** Tommorow Ill be discussing how the meta appears to be forming and what picks you should look out for in every role. -Hi Im Messiah **twitter.com/HiImMessiah** Credits to Rutgers University's Master Mid Laner Shrew for Information on Ivern. **twitter.com/shrew_lol**"

""VelKozs changes in the Mage Update were a perfect example of good intentions and a solid direction that unfortunately fell short of the mark. "" Now Sona has gone from reduced Aura size to increased aura size, from super movespeed to URF like cooldowns, from bonus attack range on [E] to doubled down movement speed, but yet nothing seems to work. If they want to fix Sona, then they have to seriously try fixing Sona and not applying some childrens animal sticker band- aid. An example would be reworking her passive into something that gives her a meaningful window of power to help her land that perfect crescendo, while at the same time telegraphing to her opponents when she is most likely to go in. Plays and counterplays, windows of power and windows of vulnerability, this is only one of many example how they could add some depth to Sona instad of glittery gimmicks. For the sake of this example I've whipped up a token example of what I even mean with all this: **New Passive:** Whenever Sona casts a spell, hits enemy champions with basic attacks or effectively uses her Auras she gains a stack of Tension. When reaching 10 stacks, Sona gains a short burst of Movement speed and her next attack within the next 8 seconds is a Poweraccord. **New Ult:** Stun duration and Range are increased by how much Tension Sona has built up. This would be the sort of changes that I'd like seeing on the PBE right now. It's broken/weak as f*ck? Tune the numbers and it's fine! It just doesn't work out? Back to the thinking chair! All I am saying is that when they think a champion needs mayor changes and are trying to deliver such changes they should go all the way and try addressing the problems in a convincing manner, instead of just sprinkling some spices over stale old bread, hoping it will fix it. *""Ultimately it felt like change for changes sake rather than actually pushing and evolving the champion.""* DL; DR Sona changes on PBE have been half assed and won't fix anything, just like Vel Koz or Syndra changes.

It makes no logical sense to me no matter how hard i think about it. First of all, her early game was already strong, she outduels most top laners, maybe except for Riven, Darius, and Pantheon. She has massive late game scaling, so giving her a large early game buff makes NO sense. I literally cannot wrap my head around it. Here is Riots reasoning behind buffing Fiora: ""Were improving Fioras early trade potential to help tip the scales in her favor when the Grand Duelist starts making the right moves."" I don't know where to start with this sentence. First of all, why is Riot so eager to make the lane phase tip in her favour despite having massive late game scaling? It makes me want to rip my hair out when Riot makes such stupid decisions, lets it get through PBE, and gives flawed logic behind the changes. Why is fucks name are you buffing her already above average early game?! NOW SHE HAS NO WEAK POINT IN THE GAME. The most annoying part about all of this is that Riot then goes on to say: ""its important for late-game powerhouses to have early windows of vulnerability"". My god, I cant comprehend the logic behind these changes. The contradictory in what that sentence says just blows my fucking mind. I don't even want to get started on talking about Ryze."
103,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Ryze Rework: Incredibly Disappointing,0,4tcltq,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4tcltq/ryze_rework_incredibly_disappointing/,2016-07-18 11:13:58,"So new Ryze has been out for a while and I have to say that this champion rework is one of the most disappointing I have seen in a long time. I'm no Ryze master, but I did have about 100 games on Ryze before this latest rework. The champion is much simpler; and even more broken than the previous iteration of Ryze. He's just not fun to play since it takes no effort to master him anymore: The current build I'm running is: RoA -&gt; Seraph's Embrace -&gt; CDR boots -&gt; Morello -&gt; Void staff -&gt; Death Cap This build gives you over 1000 AP and something like 5000 mana. Remember that Ryze's damage scales with both AP and mana. To have a massive impact, just walk up to people and perform the following combo: E-&gt; Q This 'combo' will do well over 1k damage... If you feel like doing it to everyone: E -&gt; E-&gt; Q I have found you do not need to build any sustain at all as long as you are smart about positioning. This is because you can survive lategame by starting a fight with E -&gt; W -&gt; Q and running around with you're massive shield and movement speed buff. If that shield isn't big enough, you can activate seraph's embrace for an instant 1k hp shield. Point is that the current Ryze can just decide to ""get tanky"" if he needs to be. The runes are irrelevant and don't require even close to the depth of management as the previous stacking mechanic did. They don't even help your opponent track Ryze's kill potential because Ryze can just go from 0 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 0 instantly. You can go through your full DPS combo if you really want to but people usually just die or flash before you can get more than half way through it. As long as you remember to one shot then get tanky you can play the champion effectively. It's the same champion as before just simpler to play and more damage. Before Ryze had windows of vulnerability when he was low on stacks but now he can combo at a moment's notice. His ultimate is more or less irrelevant atm. I only use it to get back to lane faster at this point. Ryze scales harder than before so I don't feel a lot of incentive to bother trying to make plays with it (can be very risky) since it's almost guaranteed we can win any straight team fight. tl;dr What I am saying is, the champion is much stronger and easier to learn. For a mid elo player on old Ryze, I would give him 30-50 games before he has all the muscle memory, positioning, and stack management to make people cry OP. New Ryze is more like 10ish games (you can hard carry after your first 15 minutes on him if you were experienced on old Ryze as long as you avoid messing with his ult). I feel no satisfaction when I perfectly execute my combos anymore since they are too simplistic."
104,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Azir, my two cents, feedback appreciated!",0,4u9a8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4u9a8q/azir_my_two_cents_feedback_appreciated/,2016-07-24 04:01:00,"Hi everyone, i am no hardcore Azir main but he is my most played champion and i wanted to react on the topic that was here 5 days ago about incoming rework and the path Riot decided to follow with it. * First of I truly thin that no change should be dictated by competitive play alone and should instead focus on the entire player base to some extent. It makes no sense to change a champion because 0.2-2% of players (diamond to challenger) abuse him while the other 98.8-98% don't benefit as much from his current state due to lack of game knowledge, mechanics or whatever. You litterally cripple their opportunities of climbing. * Second, I think it is NORMAL for Azir to be obnoxious when played correctly, every mechanically hard/demanding champion should be obnoxious to play against when in the right hands. 41% of win rate do not reflect that, and i think nerfing damage and utility was and still is a terrible decision. * I'm going to talk about the changes that occured, the current state of things and what makes him really powerful and what i think would be a good idea as to how go for a change with him, i thought about this with friends of mine and we came up with farly good points if I may say so myself. Feel free to give constructive feedback :) When first released Azir's attack speed scaled off of CDR, if you hit your soldier in an EQ combo you would stop, you would knock up and get a shield when hitting an enemy champion with E. He had much more utility than now, the only thing that was added is the follow of azir till the end of his journey with his W. Azir's strenghts is that even in early laning phase he can act as a real lane bully, and his purpose is to be a damage god late game. Here are a few ideas of changes you should be consifdering. * ***IDEAS FOR FUTURE CHANGES*** They're not meant to all be taken obviously. *And all changes should be taken with changes to his W damage accordingly: when it's a nerf buff his damage, when it's a buff shift his damage or reduce it.* 1. -All Abilities have scaling base dmg and fix AP/AD ratio on spells, (or at least most of them, haven't checked them all) Why wouldn't you introduce scaling AP ratio to his W. It would allow you to more accurately balance him throughout the game. 2. -Currently you do 25% more damage with the second soldier when two soldiers are hitting the same target, You could change that to increase the percentage so that would mean that Azir has to commit with two stacks of his W to increase his dmg output, which leaves him more vulnerable to ganks because he might run out of W stacks, and more vulnerable to high mobility champions, so you increase his power in early but you give him a significant weakness. 3. -You could do like you did to Cassiopeia and remove his ability to buy boots to increase his vulnerability when his EQ combo is down by hindering is overall mobility (and maybe have his movespeed increase with levels of ultimate or just level) if you do that you should parallelly had a slow to his W when two soldiers hit the same target. this would also increase his damage late game since he will have one more item, which is supposed to be his strength anyway: the late game 4. -To attack with soldiers it is like an auto you have to click on the champion you want to damage and all champions within the aoe of the soldier's attack will take the same damage, which is one of Azir's strength in teamfights. Let the targeted champion take full damage from the first soldier then 50% of the second and the others would either take full dmg from the first none from the second or 75% from the first and none from the second, which would add more complexity to azir's Teamfights, you would have to prioritize/choose your targets. (this does not address the laning phase problem it's meant to give azir a weakness in early teamfights) this could also change with the W rank or ultimate rank or just level of course, decreasing with time obviously. 5. -In his current state Azir's early damage has been gutted really hard, isn't it time to give him more utility? Such as bringing the knockup back? Maybe a slight attackspeed scaling off of CDR like before ? Increase the strength of his shield and make it last longer? The tower damage was good but not essential to his kit, still an idea worth considering 6. - let his damage as it is but allow him to compete with long range mages and mid picks (such as Varus for example to just give one ) and increase his Q and W range ? 7. -Maybe his soldiers could last longer? 9seconds currently why not 10 or 12 so that you take risks when you put it down then you get safe again even though you still have no damage against enemy champions (in his current state) **BUT PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE his ability to EQ** Thanks for reading I appreciate that a lot. Schrap' TL;DR Too many things to really sum up but basically a set of idea to balance Azir once and for all instead of just flat out nerf him and make im playable by everyone through a rework, read the numbers and should basically be enough to give constructive feedback :)"
105,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"As a veteran Swain player, here are my thoughts on the recent change (Warning:Long)",4,4ojl0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4ojl0n/as_a_veteran_swain_player_here_are_my_thoughts_on/,2016-06-18 00:51:55,"As most of you already know, in the next patch, Swain is receiving a devastating nerf to his ult cooldown that will drastically reduce the opportunities that he has to use it. The intention of this nerf is to introduce more counter play to his kit and make his ult something that teams have to play around. As a long-time Swain main, I believe that this is the wrong direction to go with his kit. I, and many other Swain players feel that this change, if it goes through, will kill players enjoyment of the champion and in fact reduce counterplay and decision-making to his gameplay style. First of all, a little background about me. I am currently a Gold V Swain main who has played the champion since early in Season 3. I peaked at Gold II in Season 4, and while neither of these ranks are in any way impressive, I feel that Ive played the champion enough to formulate a valid opinion on his power and playstyle. Though the changes have been discussed frequently, no one has come forward yet and presented all of our issues with it coherently yet. As such, I am writing this post in the hopes that Riot will recognize our concerns before making their decision. **1. Taking away his core identity** This is probably the biggest gripe that I have with this update. When I first picked up Swain, I was actually shocked that his ult was on such a low cooldown. I had always thought that it was a turn on for a limited amount of time then goes on cooldown ult. Soon, I came to love the toggle function and understand it as a core part of his kit. When you ask yourself who is Swain? the answer isnt hes a fairly squishy mid-range control mage, but rather hes a drain tank. Thats what his ult is all about, and thats what makes his kit. Swain isnt about walking around in human form poking people down with DoTs and occasionally ulting for damage. Hes about dealing constant DPS and healing from it. His ult is what ties everything together sure, his skills do damage, but he would be incredibly weak without his ability to get into an enemys face and soak damage and harass. Essentially, what this change does is make him more like Maokai: someone who turns on his ult for an all-in and then has to wait to use it again. Thats not who Swain is, thats not how he was designed, and thats not how he should be played. For those of you whove played WoW, the term we use is homogenization. Instead of giving each champion, or class, a separate identity, we make them similar to each other instead. Thats not a good thing at all. With the changes, Swain is no longer the demon-bird man who morphs and drains your life. Instead, he basically becomes just a discount Maokai, except he isnt as tanky and lacks a gap closer. **2. Breaking his gameplay** This is the second pressing issue I want to go over. This change to his ult completely changes his playstyle in lane, and it does not do so in a good way. For those who are familiar with Swain, hes a very potent lane bully. His level 6 harass is very difficult for a lot of champions to deal with, as he can land a snare combo and ult for 1 or 2 ticks of damage then back off. However, this is NOT a bad thing. There is nothing wrong with being strong in lane. Its simply part of what Swain does, and a good Swain will know how to capitalize on his strength. For those of you who say that he borders on oppressive, I concede that this is true, but I will also mention that he has always been like this. In fact, I feel that his previous incarnation was even more so due to the point-and-click Q which allowed him to dominate some matchups that are harder for him today (Yasuo and Leblanc), and he was perfectly balanced in the past. These strengths are balanced out by quite a few weaknesses, such as his complete lack of mobility, massive vulnerability in his human form, and susceptibility to grievous wounds. From what I understand, this nerf is meant to introduce more counterplay to his ultimate in teamfights, but it does so at the cost of completely gutting his laning phase post-6. How can Swain be expected to harass enemies out of lane if he has to wait 30 seconds before even turning his ult back on? It leaves him an extremely long period of vulnerability in which he basically cannot do anything, and it allows enemy laners to simply destroy him as soon as he turns off his ult since they know he will be useless the moment he loses it. In short, he loses a core part of his kit and functionality and becomes simply unfun to play. **3. Removing decision-making and counterplay** One of the marks of a skilled Swain player is his ability to properly manage his ult cooldown. 10 seconds may not seem like a long time for such a powerful skill, but believe me it is. Most matchups that I lose in lane are against those players that are able to capitalize on that 10-second window of opportunity, whether it be to go all-in against me or to call for a gank at just the right time. When youre playing Swain, you have to be constantly aware of the map and realize when it is safe to ult for waveclear or harass, because you know if you get engaged on while its down, you are a dead, dead bird. Personally, I feel that this makes for very interesting counterplay that makes skilled matchups extremely fun to play. To make it clearer as to what Im talking about, I will use a specific example: Riven. Ive played against a few skilled Rivens in my career (for my ELO at least) and have both outplayed and been outplayed by them. Riven has the power to all-in a Swain at level 6. However, she is weak when her Q and E are not up, and as a Swain player, I will take that opportunity to harass her. However, I cannot keep my ult on indefinitely, and once it is down I am vulnerable. Normally, I try to disengage from the fight safely, but Ive lost kills to smart Riven players who immediately flash-re-engaged on me when I left myself open and destroyed me while I was a sitting duck. Thats the type of counterplay and decision-making that will be lost with the new Swain. Now, it will become very difficult to win a Riven lane, and not in a you counter me way, but rather a theres nothing I can do way. You cannot afford to aggressively ult, because you are forced to save it for defense when Riven attempts an all-in you, and she can easily disengage you with her mobility if you do try to go aggro. Without that power, it becomes far more difficult to harass Riven to a point where she can be killed by you, which makes her all-in that much more powerful. In short, you lose control completely. This is true for a lot of other lanes as well, especially in the mid lane, where you simply cant choose to trade aggressively at all against strong burst champs. **4. His ult is not inherently broken** This is not strictly a complaint but rather a rebuttal of many claims that Ive heard on the boards and reddit that Swains ult is inherently broken and cannot be balanced. I find this statement to be statistically untrue. Swain has historically been one of the most balanced champions in the game. His ult had healthy counterplay in its downtime (which, might I add, was never more than it is now) as well as grievous wound items which put a big damper on his healing. Furthermore, his winrate has always been very consistent. Unfortunately I can find no statistics for him further back then back 6.7, but if you look at the chart on URL his winrate prior to 6.9 hovered at a very reasonable 49-50%. Im fairly sure that this has been true for a long time running as well, because he has never seen any major balance changes nor has his pickrate really spiked past 2 or 3%. It was only with the mid-season magic rework that he took a major dive (largely due to a frustrating ult bug and people getting used to his new Q) then returned to a decent 46% winrate once the bug was fixed and people learned to max Q first. It was 6.10 that first broke him with the new ult that scales off AP rather than damage done, and despite Riots attempts to nerf his healing, he still remains incredibly powerful. **5. How to nerf him** There is absolutely no denying Swain is incredibly powerful right now. His healing is incredibly oppressive and cannot be shut down by anything aside from grievous wounds, and he has the option of building very tanky and still dishing out tons of damage. Theres also no denying that needs nerfs. But increasing his R CD is not the way to do it. By doing this, they are killing him for the loyal Swain players who have been playing him for years, and introducing a form of counterplay that does not mesh at all with his kit. Instead, I propose we simply make one change that should reduce his power greatly while letting him keep his core gameplay and identity consistent: **REVERT THE CHANGES TO HIS ULT.** Riots logic (if you were following /u/shinkazuo on /r/swainmains) is that the new ultimate would make it easier to balance Swain, as it would be simple to just tune the numbers if they were too high or low. It seemed reasonable at the time, but experience has shown this to be untrue. Giving Swain a flat healing amount introduces all the problems that it was meant to avoid: the ult becomes impossible to balance because the numbers are either too low or too high. The old Swain ult is tried and true. It has remained balanced for all the years that it remained unchanged, and it allows more healthy counterplay to Swains healing in the form of building MR. Just chalk 6.10 up to an experiment gone wrong and put him back how he used to be: a niche but balanced pick for people who truly enjoy and have mastered the champion. Finally, I will end simply on this. PLEASE DO NOT FORGET WHY SWAIN WAS BUFFED. The buffs were originally meant to give Swain more healing power against tanks. They turned out to be too strong for him at all stages of game, but they were meant to be buffs nonetheless. I simply ask that Riot remembers that the intention of the changes was to make him stronger, not to later neuter him into the ground. Please, for all the loyal Swain players out there, I beg that you do not alienate us and the champion we love. Please consider these thoughts before you go through with the changes on the PBE. **TL;DR** Nerfs gut his laning post-6, force him to play defensive, makes him un-fun to play and destroys his core identity. Revert his ult change instead of upping the cooldown for more balanced champion. "

107,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Sterak's Gage is bad on Pantheon,2,48q1wh,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/48q1wh/steraks_gage_is_bad_on_pantheon/,2016-03-03 14:07:57,"It has become an extremely common trend to build a Steraks Gage as a second item on pantheon. As a Pantheon main, this is extremely disturbing to me, because Steraks Gage gives BASE AD, and Pantheon's Q and E, his main damage sources scale with BONUS AD. That means that any attack damage granted by Steraks Gage or Steraks Fury will not affect the damage done with pantheon's abilites. The item, however, still has a high win-rate on pantheon, and seems to be strong on him. This is simply because Pantheon works well with health in general, and most of pantheon's weaknesses involve his short range and his vulnerability to burst. The defensive stats from Steraks are great to sure up that weakness, but the offensive stats go to waste. Let's look at what Steraks actually gives pantheon in terms of effective health. This is assuming Pantheon has only Steraks as a defensive item. Level 9 Pantheon has 1363 health With Steraks that becomes 1763 Steraks fury provides a shield of 529 effective health when pantheon takes 580 damage in 5 seconds Total effective health: 929 Gold value: 2477g Level 13 Pantheon has 1711 health With Steraks that becomes 2111 Steraks fury provides a shield of 633 effective health when pantheon takes 580 damage in 5 seconds Total effective health: 1033 Gold value: 2753g These are only valid when Steraks is on cooldown, and don't take shield decay into account. The health that Sterak's gives pantheon is admittadly good, and is the reason that the item works at all on pantheon, but the damage the item gives pantheon is subpar. Assume pantheon does a standard rotation. Pantheon uses Q + W + AA + E + AA + Q + AA. Pantheon's damage is equal to his (Base Damages) + (300 * Total AD) + (460 * Bonus AD) A level 9 Pantheon maxing Q with no items will have 82 Base AD. This means his damage dealt from the above combo(ignoring resistances) would be 815. A level 9 Pantheon maxing Q with Steraks Gage will have 82 Base AD and gain 20 from Steraks. This means his damage dealt from the above combo(ignoring resistances) would be 875, an increase of 60. A level 9 Pantheon maxing Q with a Long Sword will have 82 Base AD and gain 15 Bonus AD. This means his damage dealt from the above combo(ignoring resistances) would be 929 an increase of 114. Even with Steraks fury, Steraks Gage provides pantheon with around the same offensive stats as a Long Sword. It's also important to remember that Steraks adds NO damage to pantheon's main method of poke, using his spear. Tl;Dr: Sterak's Gage feels good on Pantheon, but is essentially a dedicated tank item with more drawbacks. Edit: Formatting"
108,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,The Issue I'm Noticing About Jhin,0,44e6ik,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/44e6ik/the_issue_im_noticing_about_jhin/,2016-02-06 13:12:18,"At first glance, Jhin looked like one of the most amazing champs I had ever seen riot put out, and I still think so. His kit is super interesting, I love the e-w synergy, and he has a nice ability for use in lane with his q. Not to mention how spectacularly cool his ult is. But there is one issue I have with him at the moment in regards to his passive, and I wonder what other people think about this. To start, I hope that we can agree that in terms of damage output, crit is the best scaling stat in the game. It's the reason adcs typically have the highest late game damage output out of any champ, because once they crit on 60%-100% of their autos with a solid amount of ad, they pack a punch. This is what makes me think there is a problem with how Jhin's passive functions. I think it's a cool idea, being more focused on sneaking in the occasional high power auto rather than trying to constantly smack down people at the cost of having to reload occasionally. It definitely feels more like a sniper to me. However, I think it seems to be a bit too much, and I think it is hard to find a way around this being the case. Given how incredibly well crit scales, Jhin's ability to gain a solid amount of ad with all of his offensive items makes his late game damage output incredibly high. Think of it like this: Crit damage used to be limited by the fact that if you wanted to have high crit chance, usually anything above ~70%, you had to sacrifice having as much ad in your build. This made each crit significantly weaker, but you would crit more often (both in terms of procing and how often you auto). This idea is one of the things that I believe makes the new essence reaver so strong: We got another major ad item that also grants a significant amount of crit chance (not to mention that juicy cdr). Even though infinity edge was nerfed, ever since the items release, I feel like my autos as adc hit even harder than ever, and now I can also realistically get 100% crit chance alongside a solid amount of ad. When I look at Jhin's kit, I see this taken to a whole other level. Alongside his 100% crit chance, Jhin can realistically be seen with upwards of [900 ad](URL and from what I've seen of him so far, it seems to be a bit overtuned. Anyways, I was hoping to just see what everyone else thought of this. Maybe I'm underestimating his vulnerability when reloading, maybe it just takes having more lifesteal than what I generally build, maybe its just a matter of staying dedicated to an all in if you take one and consistently auto attacking will overcome it or at least stay on par. I don't think he's been out long enough to know for sure what the best approach to him is, but for now I'm curious what people's initial reactions are. Tl;dr I think Jhin's passive makes him scale too hard into the lategame, and I'm curious as to what people think of this."

110,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Opinion on the current state of Rumble,0,3uxkky,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3uxkky/opinion_on_the_current_state_of_rumble/,2015-12-01 11:58:27,"Before I begin, I will state loud and clear that I'm not an amazing player I'm Plat and going to play for diamond next season, but I just had to let my thoughts out on my favorite champion when I saw the 'buff' riot is thinking about giving him. So here it goes: Rumble has always been my favorite champion, even with his high skill requirement I always found him fun and rewarding to play. But one of the main reasons I played him was that fact that I though he was very balanced. I could have played Riven, who was OP the time I started to play a lot of ranked (thank god they nerfed the shield duration), or a simple tank like Malphite. But I loved the fact that playing Rumble matched my play style, skills as a player, and gave me accurate feedback upon reflecting on a loss. I always thought that my strengths in a game were my teamfighting mechanics rather than my ability to stomp a lane. This sometimes didn't work in the silver-gold elo, but I climbed to plat, so it has some merit to it. But then, for the first time in my time playing, he got nerfed. I experienced change in Rumble before, but the only major change they ever did was adjusting his ult to only deal D.O.T. rather than having impact damage. I always knew he was a good pick in competitive play, the reason he got nerfed in the first place, and that's one of my arguments against the Rumble nerfs. The nerf was a 15 second increase on The Equalizer at all levels. Most players brush this off as a minor change, unworthy of much notice. But it is HUGE and is easily noticed in game. At level 1, the ult has a 2 minute long cool-down, which in comparison is 20 second shorter than Gangplanks', a popular top laner, ult which is GLOBAL and does a crap ton more damage at that stage of the game. The most popular solution for this problem that people say is get cdr through items and runes to lower the ult cool-down. This is nonviable in many ways, the biggest is that Rumble can not get cdr items effectively. Standard AP cdr items like Athenes and Morellonomicon are largely mana regen items, a stat Rumble lacks. Sacrificing defence runes for cdr on a melee, squishy and relatively immobile champ is not really the best choice, and the cdr either is too little for the sacrifice, or kicks in too late to make a difference (Thank the new death timers for that). The AP item nerfs were brutal on Rumble, as all his core ( Liandry, Hourglass, Void) were nerfed HARD, with their costs going up, and many of the items loosing value. The masteries were a bit of a nerf, as he doesn't have a good keystone to use. The Ferocity tree has great things for Rumble, with 7% penetration taking the spotlight, but he doesn't have a great keystone as he can't use anything but DFT. Rumble is all about AOE buring, so he rarely can apply the DFT's full damage unlike a Brand or a Malz. He isn't a good user of Thunderlords, and the cunning tree doesn't offer a lot for Rumble. He can use the first 2-4 levels of the Resolve tree, but can't benefit much from the keystones. Final argument; I hate that he was nerfed purely for Competitive reasons. True, Rumble never was played that much, always at the bottom of the play rate category in sights like Champon.gg but as the nerfs began to hit, his win rate plummeted from a respectable 51% to a cringing 45%. Some pro's like SKT Marin managed to pull him off, but he's from SKT and one of the best players in the world, so he doesn't really count (Too good). Players stopped playing Rumble for good reasons; the nerfs to him, his items, and the top lane meta shifting to 1v1 chapions that can pull Rumble away from winning teamfights to defend towers like Jax, Tyrne, and Yasuo. Now to the part that REALLY got me ticked off; the new change. Riot is thinking about giving Rumble's Q full damage of Monsters in the Jungle. Rumble in the Jungle new meta BOYZS? WRONG!!! This solves nothing, in my opinion a useless change. Rumble's low level Q only does 75(+100%) AP damage. He will also need his other 2 abilities to get himself into the Danger Zone. So his clears will be horrendous and slow, with little sustain and INSANE vulnerability to invades and counter jungleing. His ganks are sub-optimal, with only his e for cc, low damage from the jungle. When he hits 6, it gets better with long range heavy cc. But it is easily flash able, and with such a long cool-down, he won't be able to camp a lane after flash has been blown. Don't even get me started on itemization, he has none, especially with the removal of Ranger's Trailblazer and Magnus. Some argue skip enchanting your smite item and got for real items! THEN the AP item nerfed hit your face like a truck. And yes, I have done Rumble Jungle before, and with horrific results. So thats the end of it. Am I right? Wrong? Misguided? A whiny little bitch that should suck it up and play Renekton to carry myself to Challenger? Pls let me know Thanks for enduring this."
111,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Let's talk about Jax,0,3xs2li,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3xs2li/lets_talk_about_jax/,2015-12-22 12:47:31,"IMHO, Jax's kit makes Jax a toxic champion to play against. Here is a list of the problems that I see with Jax's kit, coming from an opponent's perspective: 1. His kit has little-to-no tradeoffs. He has a gap closer, a stun, an insane dodge, an AoE lampost wave, and very little cooldowns between spell rotations. There isn't much Jax has to forsake in order to leverage the amount of power he has. This segues into the second point. 2. Impractical windows of counter play. His cooldowns are so low between dodges that opponents dueling him have difficulty finding meaningful windows of vulnerability to do enough damage to avoid being gibbed by the time Jax hits his 2nd spell rotation. I'm not saying Jax shouldn't have a dodge or shouldn't have a stun or gap closer. I'm just saying he shouldn't be able to do so much damage WHILST ignoring so much damage, as frequently as allowed by his cooldowns. It's a combination of all these things that can be chained together so frequently that make him so frustrating to play against. Jax's sparse windows of counterplay make him a toxic champion to play against, as there are very little windows of opportunity for players to outplay him. One little misstep during a duel is a sure loss against Jax due to his low, mid/late-game cooldowns and overall utility. At the risk of being repetitive, Jax gets to do tons of damage whilst ignoring tons of damage, too frequently. I don't think he should get the Olaf treatment, by any means. But I think he just gets way too much for free in the live build, and his kit lends a League game to being more frustrating than fun for opponents, since there is so little opponents can do to counter him. I'd like to hear the communities thoughts on this."

Whilst I know that it's hard to see ""your"" champion reworked into something different, you've got to look at the bigger picture. Let's take Quinn, as I've played around 500 Quinn games: - is she currently strong? No, not at high level play. She has obvious weaknesses that can be abused (easily gankable pre-6, weak self-peel, poor teamfighting) which leave her in a bad position when it comes to competitive play. - is she currently fun to play against? No, laning against her is hell and blind is not a fun mechanic, with low counterplay. - does she have a clear niche? Kinda, she's a weird hybrid of assassin and ADC that WANTS to fill a niche but simply can't act it out in the current state of the game. Her vulnerability compared to other assassins and her iffy itemsation options means she's basically a Rengar with less reliability and slightly better splitpushing. Basically, she's not great for the game, EVEN IF YOU LOVE HER. I love playing Quinn and I'm super excited to play the reworked version. Same with Corki, Graves, Kog... Riot don't just rework for no reason. It's very obvious why these changes are being made, so accept them and I guarantee you'll have fun."

I've recently had some time to catch up on portfolio work, and decided to design a champion as well as a new release idea. Over the summer, Unity Technologies released most of the art assets that they used to produce their Unity 5 GDC video [""The Blacksmith""](URL so I decided to make something out of them. --- - **Suggestion** - I didn't want to create a standard *Champion Spotlight*, instead opting for an interactive lore event that sheds some light on Volund's story while showing applications of his abilities. The Burning Tides event, an awesome story based around Gangplank's champion rework, showed me the effectiveness that a compelling story has on a champion and character. I think that any champion (hero or villain) that has a vibrant depth to them, further than a short blurb about their origins, truly makes them more engaging and entertaining to play. I think it would be really cool to the League of Legends universe to have mini scenarios in which we experience different parts of Runeterra, and the champions and stories within (imagine a playable Burning Tides event!). As a player, you have a greater understanding of why their abilities, their mannerisms, their vocal expressions, and even their movement are the way that they are. This leads to both a finer appreciation for the champion and an overall more enjoyable experience. --- [Gameplay Video](URL --- --- - **Lore** - On the onset of creation, at the time when the Giants still reined, the sons of Bor created an inland stronghold to safely usher in the First Era of Man. They named it Midgard, and from its core sprouted the ninth root of Yggdrasill, the cosmic tree that connects all worlds. The ore and earth were strong and pure in Midgard, and from them Odin created the demi-god Volund. Odin bestowed upon him a mastery in the art of blacksmithing. Volunds work was renowned across the world, and soon attracted a powerful sorceress, Olrun. Upon meeting her, Volund forged the most beautiful golden ring as a sign of his proposal. Together they lived happily for nine years until she mysteriously vanished with no clue about her whereabouts or if she would return. The only thing she left behind was the golden ring that Volund had forged. In Olruns absence and with no sign of her return, Volund drifted into madness. His sorrow corrupted his power, causing him to lash out against the citizens of Midgard and slaughter all that he could. The sons of Bor ushered the survivors to their new fortress in Asgard. Fearing the vulnerability of Midgards connection to Yggdrasill, Odin crippled Volund and bound him to forever guard the root of the cosmic tree. For centuries Volund has wandered aimlessly through the ruins of Midgard, convinced that Olrun will return. He creates replica after replica of Olruns ring and infuses them with the life-force of those who try to claim them as treasures. Hearing of Midgard through legends, Prince Niohad, the great-grandson of the Goddess Grior, traveled to Midgard to claim Volunds power --- - **Abilities** - **Passive:** *Power in Memory* When he kills enemies he absorbs their life-force through one of his replicated rings. Different enemies drop different ring values. Additionally, he generates one ring every 10 seconds. * Champion kills and assists give 15. * Epic monsters and large jungle creeps give 10. * Cannon and super minions give 4. * Minions give 2. When he reaches certain ring thresholds, he gains life-steal and spell-vamp. Additionally he permanently has +5% of each. * 100 Rings 5 + (5)% * 250 Rings 5 + (15)% * 500 Rings 5 + (25)% His passive works directly with his ultimate attack (R) in that it costs rings to use. The higher the range of the ult, the more expensive the cost is. The Ring threshold bonuses are not permanent and can be lost. **Q:** *Lumbering Swings* Volund slowly sweeps his mace around twice while walking forward a short distance. It deals physical damage to any enemies hit. The second swing deals twice as much damage as the first. **W:** *Frenzied Smash* Volund musters his strength, dashing forward a short distance, leaping, and smashing his mace into the ground. Enemies hit take physical damage and are stunned for a brief time. **E:** *Get Back!* Volund kicks enemies that are a short distance away from him. Hit enemies take physical damage, their actions are briefly interrupted, and they are slowed for a short duration. **R:** *Return to Me!* Volund fuses all of the power-infused rings he has collected and unleashes them into Orlun's, dealing magic damage and stunning enemies for a brief amount of time. Instead of mana, this ability costs Volund some of his collected rings. The cost is proportionate to the distance at which he attempts to cast it. After casting, the ring cost is deducted from his total, and any threshold bonuses he had received from his passive are lost if he is reduced below a specific threshold. If this ability is off cooldown but Volund does not have the minimum required rings, it cannot be cast. --- - **Conclusion** - I hope you guys enjoyed the video and the champion, I'd love to hear your feedback.

114,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Corollary of RiotGhostcrawler's Treatise,1,3mxbgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3mxbgf/corollary_of_riotghostcrawlers_treatise/,2015-09-30 14:11:21,"Hi! I'm a hoping to become a game designer, and I'd like to demonstrate my thought process through discussing Ghostcrawler's points. I'd like to use this thread to generate concrete examples of beneficial mechanics or changes to current aspects of playing a Marksman that would be intuitive, feel visceral, and ultimately be enjoyable to watch and satisfying to play. ______________________________________ &gt; 1 Being auto-attack focused can easily lead to lack of differentiation among all the other champs that are also auto-attack focused. Fire rate and impact can be expanded. Modifiers (like urgot's corrosive charge), multiple shots (several applications of damage from Jinx's minigun), and proximity based splash damage and additional AOE attacks (graves's shotgun?? riot plz ;D) Longer range at the cost of a much longer reload (Caitlyn) I would think that a Marksman always would have at least some ranged capability, even if completely out of ammo. As well, application of autoattacking while moving could very well be applied to more champions in an appropriate fashion (Kennen, Ezreal, Quinn) Others, like Lucian I'd see as much more likely to benefit aesthetically and thematically to incorporate more acrobatic akimbo pistol shooting, as if his movement pattern was broken-up in smaller dashes more frequently, and he fired more shots (MOAR). &gt; 2 The need for Marksmen to take towers makes it really hard to evaluate whether they are too weak or not. Assassins just disappear when they aren't viable. Marksmen will likely never disappear. They just limp along if weak. The total power potential of a Marksman is higher than the absolute burst damage output that they have. Range advantage: which necessitates the expenditure of cooldowns and resources to close the gap, thus requiring higher damage outputs and effective health for the shorter ranged agent. This creates a risk averse dichotomy, where a series of trades are made for positioning and resources. The game state and tempo are dictated by the expression of power by either team's deadliest and greatest destructor. By the virtue of having a larger zone of control through auto attacks, Marksmen are ~~essential~~ very useful to controlling minions while minimizing resource expenditure, but could the general gameplay be improved by adding appropriate ammunition to manage? Would supply lines and different weapons and hardware/magic/biological weapons etc. specific(Hi Hex core!) items for each champion be appropriate? Could the resupplying of ammo be used as a fallback mechanic? (2nd tier turrets op) &gt;3 The player vision for ""carry"" can carry (ahem) some unrealistic expectations. We get some amount of ""I'm not getting pentas, so I must be weak."" When some of the most reliable and effective means of dispensing raw damage over time cannot take over a game is both good and bad. Say for example: Around the 2:30 mark in a game, and Shaco comes in from behind, through your own red buff with a friendly murder stick in hand. This is a decision made by their jungler, supported by their team, which requires a certain amount of coordination and game sense to even be aware of as a player. As a player's view is often restricted to their minimap and their screen, the visual cues within the lane are mostly limited to enemy champion behavior/tendencies, game time, and one's own knowledge of when power spikes occur for each champion(requiring a particular set of game plans, compositionally dependent). So if placed into a lane bully matchup as the favored aggressor, to play defensive due to lack of information is frustrating, and when the **only** means to gain this information to successfully push for an advantage... is through teammates(riot plz add scouting minions), then there is reliance on the behavior of the team, which comes into conflict with any jungler pathing that attempts to be anywhere but near the bot lane, and introduces complications when the instance of teleport's existence produces unreliability for where the enemy top laner can be at the start of the match. For the success of the lane, a Marksman must ward (which can be dangerous, and doesn't cover all angles of attack), be mindful of flash + gapcloser from brush distance from multiple champions as an incredibly flimsy agent, and can just get absolutely wrecked if positioning and damage output fluctuates for a fraction of a second. Several factors are wildly out of the Marksman's control, and this uncertainty and high risk creates a huge amount of tension, but after a single death the lane may be compromised to where trades will simply not be favorable unless the enemy makes a critical error, or the team can give the Marksman the right opportunity to look good and recover. The delicate balance between the four bottom laners is thrown wildly off when carry toplaners and deadly jungle gankers show up, an this accelerates the pace of the game, but often deprives the Marksman of gold.(can't get kills unless they're cleaned up, so the losing Marksman might not get anything as they need to GTFO) &gt;4 The entire power curve of weak early, strong late can make counterplay hard to solve. It's not counterplay to say ""You shoulda stopped me 20 minutes ago, bro."" The total brutal power of a late game Marksman is unmatched in indiscriminate damage output when given optimal conditions to thrive, due to the total range and movement speed options available combined with the raw consistent damage. The total gameplay mechanical control is centered around providing the right circumstances to not die for as long as possible and pump out damage against the enemies' primary tools. This essentially makes the Marksman one of, if not the most important targets to kill, but if any repositions or assassins closes the distance to combo cooldowns without spending a componant of the lethality in the combo the Marksman instantly lose. Additionally, the mages almost always have more range or instant burst once the first and second core items come into play. Why can't Marksman make a longer ranged shot, at a penalty to hit, and/or less damage, or with some way to respond to an oncoming threat outside their zone?(Jinx's traps and zap work quite well to establish a boundary, but are entirely anticipatory. Graves' smokescreen is actually a great example of a strong close ranged reactionary action) Why wouldn't a champion like Graves naturally do more damage up close? Where's the agency to adjust the positioning of an enemy? (covering fire! Destructible terrain? ) &gt; 5 Lack of interesting item choices. I believe that Marksman specific weapon upgrades could nicely adjust the power curve so it has a more stepped nature, rather than parabolic. Perhaps the right adjustment to make so that the Marksman can survive fights more easily while still pumping out damage, is to change how target acquisition can interact with item choices. Supporting fire(ranged only active on dorans?), selected zone to auto attack instead of a single target (pow-pow, shoot that bush!) &gt; 6 Overreliance on the RNG of crit. Marksman need a damage multiplier of some kind, and every single one already has damage or speed modifiers per basic attack passively, or upon using a steroid. If every champion had theirs scale a little better, or have different utilities or have different range and penetration characteristics, then their pure reliance on critical hits to be impactful would evaporate. &gt; 7 Can't effectively play different roles or lanes but has a monopoly on bot lane In a true 1v1 lane, Marksmen do very well. Caitlyn was an exemplary example of a strong 1v1 champion, as she is lane dominant. The reason why Marksman fare rather poorly in a 1v1 lane, is their role demands a degree of vulnerability that is heavily punished from a gank. Additionally, the loss of the only optional summoner spell for a teleport (if going top lane) renders utter reliance on outplaying the enemy with map pressure and coordination, while denying and surpressing the shorter ranged enemy top laner. If the enemy laner gets meaningful assistance, the marksman is under severe threat of death. In the mid lane, Marksman generally lack AOE waveclear, and the wave is generally kept near the middle of the lane, where the flanking side bushes into the river are incredibly dangerous. So despite needing little resources to last hit if they can walk up to the wave, in this dynamic they are heavily punished by wrap-around ganks behind the side bush, and CS can be forced to be lost by assassination threat. Conversely, in the bottom lane, there's a lot more effective health to chew through, many more healers reside here, and the minion waves can build up much larger than those in the mid lane. (Large top lane waves are suicidal to build up as a Marksman in a 1v1 unless an even or better fight is guaranteed) Mages must spend resources to clear the wave, which renders their tower vulnerable to basic attacks, and their champion to a predictable farming pattern, leaving them vulnerable to harrass. (I'll continue the rest of the points in a few hours if there's any interest in this post! Please dissect any of my suggestions, and add your own!) "

Short movement speed boosts while in combat would also allow Zyra players to kite more easily, something which is currently quite difficult to manage mainly because Zyra's damage is zone specific. She only does damage in a certain area, similar to Azir. This is a passive change which will benefit Mid Zyra players, but will not have as much of an effect on the support counterpart as it is not a buff in crowd control or damage. It's a small buff to Zyra's survivability! The movement speed bonus doesn't have to be huge. But I guess anything is better than her current passive!"

This has allowed him to be taken early, in part due to his power, but also due to his use as a pre-emptive suppression pick against potential carry top laners (especially on blue side). 2) At the same time he has significant weaknesses such as a lack of mobility and vulnerability to poke which require teams to play in a certain way to make the most of his presence. 3) Strategically, Darius warps how the game is played forcing both teams to play disengage focused compositions, and increasing the importance of ADC at the expense of top laners. 4) The reason Darius has looked weak is mainly due to individual misplays and teams failing to play to Darius' strengths/weaknesses properly. His main strengths are influencing strategic planning and carry suppression. These are strengths which do not easily show in post game statistics. 5) This article is a direct response to [Crumbz's video criticising Darius' use at worlds] (URL as well as [this reddit thread questioning why teams were continuing to use Darius despite mixed results] (URL -**Important Disclaimer**- I like Crumbz's personality on the analyst desk, and think that a lot of his videos, [for instance this video on reading enemy jungle] (URL have made important contributions to the community understanding of how to play League of Legends and I would encourage you to [check out his youtube channel] (URL That said, I feel that [his video on Darius posted yesterday and upvoted to the front page] (URL as well as [this reddit thread from last week] (URL are based on a fundamental misunderstanding of Darius' role in the metagame at worlds. In this article, I will attempt to explain why Darius is (correctly) currently seeing heavy play, why results with the champion have been mixed, and address some of the critiques that Crumbz and others have made about the champion. #Quick Summary ###Darius's Strengths 1. Strong damage output even when built tank 2. The ability to flat out win a team fight if ignored or kited incorrectly 3. A very strong zoning champion, especially when played with long range adcs 4. A powerful suppression pick which can be taken early in the draft due to a lack of hard counter matchups top lane (except possibly Renekton which has its own issues with scaling) ###Darius's Weaknesses 1. Poor mobility 2. Very weak to ranged poke, especially from long range adcs 3. Forces a team to be to some extent built around Darius to compensate for his weaknesses Darius is essentially the archetypal Juggernaught as Riot have been pushing over the past few patches. Very strong base damages throughout the game, but with poor mobility due to lack of gap closer and poor movement speed. These are weaknesses which are punished much more harshly in competitive (through team cohesion and cooperation) rather than solo queue (where Darius has an 80%+ ban rate coming into worlds on EUW). #The role Darius plays in the current metagame ###Zone Darius is a very strong zoning tool in team fights due to his high base damages, and survivability when built tanky with 1 offensive item. At the same time his lack of mobility and gap closers means that teams picking Darius are generally going to lack engage potential from top lane. This means that teams looking to force team fights are going to either be pigeon-holed into a smaller pool of jungle and support picks or be primarily focused on kiting and disengage. Although it is certainly possible to use champions such as Sivir (or even better, Ashe) to help Darius engage on enemy teams, his lack of mobility makes it almost impossible for Darius to get through front line peel and his main form of initiation (flash + apprehend) is telegraphed and reasonably short range. However, as a disengage tool Darius is arguably the single best top laner in the game right now. It is generally suicidal to engage onto a Darius unless your team is very far ahead or the Darius is very far behind. As a result, he creates a very large defensive zone, which allows late game long range hyper carries such as Tristana, Jinx and Azir (or poke champions such as Nidalee and Varus) to fight safely from the back line. [Yoe Flash Wolves did this very effectively with poke in their game against Koo Tigers] (URL and [Cloud 9 also used Darius effectively against FNC] (URL in team fights by taking advantage of this zoning potential. This is the most popular argument used in favour of Darius seeing play (besides the claims that his dueling potential makes him a very strong split pusher). However, the problem with focusing primarily on the disengage/zoning argument is that it only partially covers the importance of Darius is in the metagame. If Darius was only good as a disengage tool then picking him early is essentially restricting strategic options and forcing teams to play disengage + scaling late game team compositions. This creates problems because giving up team strategy early in a draft allows teams to counter-draft. Furthermore, although Darius is a good defensive tool, he lacks escapes himself which means that the Darius player has to be careful not to be caught out. It is telling that C9 and Yoe both used Morgana as an additional disengage tool with Black Shield to help prevent Darius getting caught out (for this reason Thresh is another good champion to play with Darius). However, whilst it is certainly true that some teams are over-prioritising Darius (for instance in the [TSM vs OG game] (URL TSM prioritised Darius over Lulu, a lane counter and a solid disengage tool which can provide supplementary poke which Darius is weak against), the main reason why Darius will continue to see heavy play is not just because of his impact in game, but rather the implications that a Darius pick has on pre-game strategic posturing. ###Suppression and the importance of blue side Darius In his video, Crumbz laments the lack of skilled Fiora play against what he perceives as a Darius pick which requires no skill to play. However, the popularity of the two picks are closely linked. The reason that melee carry top laners such as Yasuo and Fiora have not been heavily played at this world championships is because they are poor picks into Darius. This is not simply down to micro lane mechanics. Although Yasuo and Fiora are disadvantaged vs Darius in lane, this is something which jungle pressure can alleviate. The main advantage Darius has over these champions is his ability as a suppression pick. Fiora and Yasuo want to split push aggressively throughout the mid-late game, and are particularly strong duelists against typical top lane tanks who would normally take tp such as Maokai. They also tend to need to snowball early to get going, and without managing to do so, will generally be a team weakness in team fights around 10-25 mins whilst they farm up to fulfil this split pushing role (especially in lane swaps). Darius is excellent at countering both sides of this strategy, firstly by delaying the top lane pressure due to his advantageous lane matchup, and then by offering some amount of dueling potential to defend against the split push whilst still offering tankiness to the team. This matters because, as discussed before, Darius is at his best in teams which want to disengage and utilise late game scaling hyper carries. Thus Darius helps buy time for teams to scale into the late game by suppressing carry top laners, whilst also maintaining usefullness as the game progresses (unlike other suppression top lane picks such as Renekton). In fact, it is the strength of Fiora/Yasuo on this patch which makes Darius such an important pick. Darius is particularly important as a blue side pre-emptive counter pick to these two carry top laners, as the risk of not having a suitable answer in lane to a last pick red side Fiora (or Yasuo vs Gnar) is significant. This does not mean that an early pick Darius is guaranteed to win lane, Gnar and Lulu are both solid counters in lane to Darius, but it does offer strategic security. If you spend an early pick on Darius, you don't have to worry about this particular strategy from the opponent, so although you restrict your options, you are also restricting your opponents'. Teams which don't respect the implications of the Darius pick when deciding on their top lane should expect to be punished by it as the game progresses (consider the weakness of Huni's Yasuo into Darius as the game between C9 and FNC progressed). ###(Aside on Darius as an offensive split push champion) One misconception about Darius is that people tend to overplay his strength as a split push option. Whilst it is certainly true that Darius is a strong 1 v 1 duelist in lane, his lack of mobility and gap closers is a significant liability when it comes to applying pressure with late game split pushing: Because Darius cannot easily gap close, opposing top laners are free to push lanes aggressively whilst Darius is walking to lane, lengthening the time it takes to be in a position to apply turret pressure (and making it difficult to force fights if the enemy top laner cedes ground in lane and wave clears under tower); because Darius lacks mobility he is particularly susceptible to ganks if overextended in ways that Fiora, and even champions like Gnar are not. His counter-split pushing is more important that his aggressive split pushing capability. ###Knock-on effects outside top lane Finally, and most importantly, Darius will continue to see play because his presence in the game as a disengage tool can help prolong games for teams which want to play around their AD Carry, exploit weaknesses in enemy AD Carries or play particular types of composition such as poke comps which can benefit greatly from strong defensive zones. He is good at suppressing enemy attempts to snowball out of top lane, and this is particularly important against teams which have strong top lane carries and like to focus early game attention on top lane (Koo, KT, FNC, iG). Not only does Darius allow less mechanically skilled players to match up well playing a champion which is less mechanically intensive, but it is also a champion which in the hands of a carry top laner is limited in how much it can be used to push an advantage due to Darius' weakness at offensive split pushing and engaging team fights. This means that by leaving the champion unbanned the existence of Darius in the game reduces the importance of top lane to the advantage of AD Carry, and there are many teams which are more comfortable playing around their bot lanes than top lanes so should favour this situation. Because of this, Darius will continue to see play even if unbanned, and as a result we should expect to see more Tristana and Jinx as the tournament progresses, champions which are very good with AND against Darius due to their long range and ability to kite. This also means that we should not be surprised to see more Darius bans, especially on Red Side, as the tournament progresses. #Why Crumbz is wrong about Darius I'm going to ignore Crumbz's comments about playskill required to play champions as this is the world championship and even if certain champions are easy to play but OP (e.g. Ryze top season 4) it is still a team's responsibility to exploit these picks to win games. However, in addition to the points addressed above Crumbz made 2 further points which I feel need to be addressed separately: Darius as a crutch pick. It is certainly true that many of the supposedly weaker top laners at this world championships have been playing Darius. However, Crumbz draws completely the wrong conclusion from this. The fact that many players are playing Darius incorrectly does not mean that Darius is itself a weak pick. There have been several instances of missed apprehends into Gnar jumps which could easily have swung top lane matchups for instance. Teams are not picking Darius because of his potential wombo-combo, they are picking him specifically as a suppression/zoning tool. This means that we cannot say that we have only seen the true power of Darius in one game (the Balls pentakill game), simply the strategic warping effect that Darius has on the game is important, and something which Crumbz is too quick to discount. The second point is that because Crumbz is focused on the offensive capabilities of Darius rather than the strategic/suppression (defensive) implications of the pick he highlights the C9 vs FNC Balls pentakill as the [main example of demonstrating how Darius is supposed to be played] (URL Actually, this is the wrong conclusion to draw. [In the fight in question] (URL FNC hard engaged onto C9 without kiting Darius properly and failing to take account of his influence in the game, both in pick/bans by taking Yasuo into him, and then in the specific team fight by ignoring him, letting him get to 5 stacks and killing everyone. This was not about using Darius correctly, but about FNC failing to play around the champion appropriately and being punished. #Conclusion Darius is a strong pick, and will continue to be a strong pick throughout this world championship. As a champion Darius has certain key weaknesses which can be exploited. However, at the same time, he has a warping impact on the game which forces teams to play in a certain way, both with and against him, and so we should not be surprised to continue to see him being picked aggressively and early as the tournament progresses. Furthermore, if teams begin to lean too much on Darius as a crutch to make their disengage focused team compositions work, it should not be a surprise to see Darius banned much more aggressively than it has been already, especially on red side (although red side bans are quite overloaded) or in teams that want to carry from top lane. EDIT: After reading comments I added Lulu as a counter to the tldr. Although I discussed Lulu in the body of the article itself I wouldn't want people to only get to point 2 on the tldr and then decide they didn't want to read the rest of the article :)"
117,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Tahm Kench (and specifically Devour) is Poorly Designed and Needs to be Reworked,0,3pflik,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3pflik/tahm_kench_and_specifically_devour_is_poorly/,2015-10-20 12:37:38,"**TL;DR:** Tahm Kench encourages reactive rather than proactive play from both his allies and his opponents. This is one of the most serious hallmarks of bad game design. In addition, Devour is the perfect counterplay to almost everything without itself having any meaningful counterplay. This is another hallmark of bad design. I end the post with a slightly reworked kit to demonstrate how to fix these problems. Tahm Kench is a lot like Soraka: his low-cooldown, low-cost abilities allow him to largely neutralize the effects of his opponents' aggression. As a result, the obvious strategy to defeat Tahm Kench would be to attack him first before going after his allies; however, unlike Soraka, Tahm Kench's immense, built-in tankiness makes him impossible to easily focus down. As a result, **Tahm Kench encourages both teams to play defensively since he is at his strongest when on the defensive** (i.e. his team wants him at his strongest while his opponents want him at his weakest). This is different than Soraka who is able to bolster either an attack or a defense and is susceptible to focus fire. Encouraging defensive play from one team is not necessarily a bad thing as long as the other team has a compelling reason to be aggressive. Zyra is a great example of this. She has to use her spells (which would otherwise be powerful tools of aggression) to create her plants (which make her dangerous to attack). In other words, both Zyra and her opponent's have a decision to make: attack/defend while she has access to her snare and burst damage or attack/defend while her plants are active. This makes for interesting and diverse gameplay which naturally involves one side attacking while the other defends. The alternative (where neither team is encouraged to attack) is a major problem because it implies that the best way to win the game is to do nothing. And doing nothing is the anti-thesis of playing a game. Tahm Kench is different from Zyra. He is a tanky, peeling support and his biggest strength is his ability to remove one of his allies from danger. However, that ability is also tied to his greatest aggressive tool (i.e. if he eats an enemy he cannot eat an ally and vice versa) which means that he is encouraged not to eat enemies in most circumstances since his role within the team will almost always be better served by eating an ally to preserve them from harm. As a result, his enemies are encouraged not to attack and rather to try to bait out an aggressive use of his Devour so that it leaves his teammate susceptible to damage, but Tahm Kench knows this and is thus encouraged not to use his Devour aggressively so that he can always protect his teammate. **Devour has another issue: it is modular and has a low cooldown.** Many of the effects that Devour can completely nullify (e.g. big, single target ultimates) have a much longer cooldown than Devour which means that Devour will almost always be available to counteract them. This would not normally be a problem. Take for example Fizz's Playful/Trickster or Fiora's Riposte. Both of these skills can have much the same effect as Devour but they are not modular (i.e. they can only be used by one character). Non-modular skills are much easier to balance since vulnerabilities (like making them fragile) can be added to characters to compensate for strengths that they have elsewhere; additionally, Fiora's or Fizz's opponents can always target another character with their abilities so that even if they aren't getting to attack their first choice of target, at least they are getting to use their skills. **Tahm Kench doesn't have these weaknesses:** whichever of his allies you choose to attack will be the one he chooses to save and of course it would be preposterous to add vulnerabilities to the kits of every character in the game to compensate for the fact that Tahm Kench can always make them invulnerable on a 10 second cooldown. **The final major issue with Devour is that it has no counterplay.** At least with Morgana's Black Shield you can still deal physical damage or even break the shield if you are strong enough, and with Playful/Trickster you can just wait for Fizz to come down and then kill him. But Tahm Kench is super tanky and converts the damage he takes into a shield so attacking him is kind of pointless, and you can't just wait for his ally to pop out again because the invulnerability lasts 6 seconds and Kench gets a speed boost so that he can run away from you faster than you can chase him. If Devour were given some counterplay and its aggressive component was separated from its defensive component, then the ability as a whole would be better designed. I think that the best ways to add counterplay to the ability is to give Kench a limited window in which he can use the ability so that **its use is telegraphed and his opponents have time to respond**. Also, **by increasing the cooldown of the ability**, we make the decision to use it more meaningful and create inherent counterplay by opening up a large window of vulnerability. Below is a suggested rework of Tahm Kench's kit. Obviously, I don't know for certain how well-balanced this new kit is, but I think that this new kit is better designed and would merely require the tweaking of numbers to achieve balance rather than a true rework. There are a few additional changes in here related to mana costs and cooldowns that I haven't talked about much. I will breifly describe the reasons for all of the changes at the end of the post. **Tahm Kench's Reworked Kit** **Stats:** Unchanged. **Passive - An Acquired Taste:** Add the effect that Tahm Kench's basic attacks and damaging abilities deal an additional 5/10/15/20 (+2%/4%/6%/8% bonus health) as magic damage at levels 1/6/11/16. Otherwise Unchanged. **Q - Tongue Lash:** Increase mana cost from 50 mana at all ranks to 55/60/65/70/75 mana. Otherwise Unchanged. **W - Devour:** Remove the ally-cast component of the spell. Increase cooldown from 14/13/12/11/10 seconds to 16/15/14/13/12 seconds. Otherwise Unchanged. **E - Thick Skin:** Change cooldown from 16/15/14/13/12 seconds to 18/16/14/12/10 seconds. Change shield duration from 6 seconds at all ranks to 4/4.75/5.5/6.25/7 seconds. Otherwise Unchanged. **R - Abyssal Voyage:** Remove the Passive component of this ability. Mana cost remains unchanged. Change the name of ability to ""Infernal Contract/Abyssal Voyage."" Decrease cooldown from 120/110/100 seconds to 100/90/80 seconds. This ability's effects are changed as follows: Upon first activation of the ability Tahm Kench begins to glow and a 450-range indicator circle (visible to all players) appears around him for 8 seconds. During this time, any allied champion within 450 range may click on Tahm Kench to become invulnerable and be sucked into his stomach. (If no champion clicks on Tahm Kench during this time, this ability goes on a 30 second cooldown.) While an allied champion is in his stomach, Tahm Kench gets 25%/35%/45% bonus movement speed. For 5 seconds after swallowing an allied champion, the swallowed champion gains the ability to be spat out anywhere around Tahm Kench (up to a maximum range of 450) by clicking the ground at their desired location. In addition, during this time, Tahm Kench gains the ability to cast Abyssal Voyage. The effect of Abyssal Voyage is the same as it is now except that the channel time is increased from 1 second to 1.5 seconds at all ranks. If neither Tahm Kench activates Abyssal Voyage within 5 seconds nor the swallowed champion clicks the ground to be spat out within 5 seconds, then the swallowed champion is regurgitated immediately in front of Tahm Kench (like the enemy-cast version of his W). **Reasons for the suggested changes:** 1) Stats are just numbers, and as I mentioned before, numbers are not my biggest concern in this post. 2) Adding the passive from Abyssal Journey to Kench's innate passive smooths out his early game experience while leaving his late game damage unchanged. However, the astute will notice that it is a very small mid-game nerf. This makes him a little stronger in lane, while de-emphasizing his damage during mid-game team fights. 3) Tongue Lash is a wonderfully elegant and evocative ability, and doesn't need to be changed much. I gave it a scaling mana cost to enourage players to put points in his other abilities - again de-emphasizing his damage output and requiring players who put him in a solo lane to manage his mana somewhat better. 4) By removing the ally-cast component we no longer encourage players to save the ability for defensive purposes. To compensate for the fact that we split up the two uses of this ability we increased its cooldown. Overall, Devour will actually be available for offensive purposes much more often than it was before. 5) Thick Skin was a One-Point Wonder, which is a problem when it is also a linchpin ability for a champion. By buffing the ability when at max ranks and nerfing it when at one point, we encourage players to put more points into this skill early. Again, we are indirectly downplaying his damage output and emphasizing his tankiness. 6) His new ultimate finally feels like a genuine ultimate. It is more satisfying to use than his old ultimate because it now has combat applications and it also gives Tahm Kench's signature skill the counterplay it deserves. Please let me know what you think whether you agree or disagree with my assessment. I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments. **TL;DR:** The tl;dr is at the very top of the post."

Landing a 5 man sigil and combination with an empowered q and you essentially cripple the enemy team momentarily as well as allowing her to focus down one or 2 targets after the initial engage. Use of the sigil in lane can used to trade but not spammed in lane due to the higher mana cost. The longer cooldown is the compensate for the potential effects of the ability and make use of it punishing if used incorrectly. The cooldown also allows for counter play without her ability to trade without her ultimate which has a massive cooldown she is very oblivious and can be easily GANKED. Mark of blood moon is arguably the most useful of the abilities and can be exploited in lane to out trade and sustain in lane and used as an executioner effect. Although you cannot choose when you use this effect its ability to trade is very useful in lane. Mark of fading snow is something im still not 100% sure on. The ability allows for quick burst of trade before kiting and repositioning without much counter play. the idea of this is to be able to out trade your opponent in lane in a sort burst as appose to a longer and more sustained trade as well as general disruption, The limitation on the ability lies in its effect to only be applied once a second which allows counter play if you press into her instead of running away, Mark of cherry is for team-fighting and attempting and del with champions in which its dangerous to get in range.

120,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Was Zed so rampant and unenjoyable to play against that you had to make him almost unplayable in higher level of play?,0,3i3i8w,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3i3i8w/was_zed_so_rampant_and_unenjoyable_to_play/,2015-08-24 03:12:01,"Currently, Zed's strengths lie in very strong early game, while his weaknesses are apparent in late-mid to late game teamfights, which he can barely participate in with the help of flash, much less without flash. Even with the ""buff"" to his ultimate, he still faces the same problem that he had with the full second delay compared to the 0.5 second delay. Zed's position and frame of vulnerability are reliably telegraphed by the animation of the death mark and the fact that he always lands behind his target when he uses his ultimate. This reliability, peel-oriented supports, and zhonyas and qss, all give counterplay when playing against Zed. Zed isn't a mage who scales super hard into the late game and hypercarry's like Azir or Viktor. He is an assassin and is not meant to be dominant in the late game , but he still should have access to some sort of ability to teamfight, which his ultimate gave him, but now does not. He is now completely useless as even when he does well, he can not do his job , which is to kill the carry, without sacrificing himself, and even when you play well as a Zed and land all of your skills, you do not get results when the other team's carries purchase qss and zhonyas. Tl;Dr: The Zed buffs don't work because they don't solve the underlying problem of his inability to be of any use in teamfights without willingly killing yourself for what is not even a potential kill late game unless the other team is playing super poorly and is uncoordinated. As a result, this makes for incredibly unsatisfying gameplay, as even when you play well, your reward is abysmally minimal. EDIT: Since everybody is giving me shit about how they think that I want Zed to be broken god tier/completely broken, let me just say that I do not want Zed to be broken. I love playing Zed and he is one of my favorite champions, so I may be a bit biased. HOWEVER, I sincerely hate playing against a good Zed just as much as the next guy, but he does have counterplay which many people don't seem to understand and the I have to say that from both points of view Zed is in a very bad spot. That being said, if Riot thinks that Zed needs a nerf, then so be it. But what they have done to his ultimate is most certainly not the way they should have gone about doing things. Just my two cents."

I suggest reducing the cast time on her condemn (E). This would allow Vayne to make more efficient trades in lane and keep her a little safer in teamfights. Currently, when you cast Vayne's E you have to stand still for a significant amount of time which allows the rest of the enemy team to catch up to you. Also the E could be used better to cancel enemy's abilities such as Vi's Q. This would increase Vayne's survivability. What do you guys think about this buff?"
125,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,The real problem with Ekko (An in-depth look at Chronobreak),10,38ze64,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/38ze64/the_real_problem_with_ekko_an_indepth_look_at/,2015-06-08 13:07:05,"*I'd like to preface this by saying this is my first post on Reddit and I hope you all enjoy!* It's no secret that people are pretty salty about Ekko considering the amount of threads complaining about him, so I thought I'd give you guys a break from the aimless QQing with some actual analysis. I think the main problem with Ekko (and arguably his signature trait) is his ultimate, Chronobreak. Chronobreak is a powerful and versatile ability, and though it leads to some pretty fun and flashy plays, it's incredibly frustrating to play against because of limited counterplay. As there are many moving parts to this ability let's take a look at it piece by piece. This is gonna be a long one, folks. **Repositioning** If a duel versus his lane opponent goes south, Ekko almost always has the ability to escape to safety. I was initially very excited when I learned his E could only be used to it's full extent while going in. Unfortunately, with some forethought Ekko can push up very aggressively in lane due to the safety net Chronobreak provides. **Damage** Okay, let's be honest, you already know what's wrong here. Chronobreak has a base damage of 200/350/500 + 130% AP. The 130% scaling is higher than almost every ability in the game, and the relatively high base damage leads to 1100+ damage AoE burst before full build. These numbers would be forgivable if the ability didn't already offer so much. **Healing** Ekko heals for 100 / 150 / 200 (+ 20 / 25 / 30% [+ 3.33% per 100 AP] of damage taken in the last 4 seconds). If Ekko is not immediately killed in a pick attempt, Chronobreak will heal him for between 20%-50% of the damage he took depending on the stage of the game. This makes him very difficult to shut down once he gets ahead. **Invulnerability/Untargetability** A lot of people don't even take advantage of this or even really notice. When Ekko's animating to his previous location he become invulnerable and untargetable. I actually really like this about the ability. Dodging a Caitlyn or Fizz ult with a well timed Chronobreak just feels really awesome. **Counterplay** Ryze. Only kidding, though Ryze probably needs a nerf more than Ekko right now. Holy perma-root, Batman! Anyways, There are definitely counterplay opportunities against Ekko; most notably Chaining CC on him until he's dead. I never really liked this logic though since you can say that about ANY squishy target. If they're good at positioning, they usually won't be in a place where this can happen in the first place. Chronobreak is considered a movement ability, so a well timed root or stun is incredibly important to deny him casting it. Most of your counterplay to Ekko is going to be in champ select. Playing champions with roots/stuns or simply champions that harass him with little trading opportunities (Azir, Leblanc, Chogath) are the way to go. That way his ult won't be as effective, or you can just force him to use it to stay alive and attempt a kill before it's up again. Coordinating with your jungler to focus him before he hits 6 is also a great method. **EDIT:** I forgot to mention the most obvious counterplay to Chronobreak being that you can see where Ekko will appear after ulting. When Ekko gets ahead, his ult frees him up to always attempt to further his lead while leaving little room to shut him down. This gives him crazy snowball potential, and in this situation seeing where he will appear is not necessarily relevant. ***What This Means - Revival*** I don't expect you all to agree with me here, but just level with me for a second; All of these factors together make Chronobreak very similar to a revive ability. Ekko has a reliable way to have a second chance at life in almost all instances with a pretty significant heal and positional reset. However, unlike other revive abilities (Anivia, Zac, Aatrox, Zilean), there are virtually no downsides to Ekko's. All others become immobile aside from Zilean's target who has a very clear indicator as to when you can start killing him again. Chronobreak on the other hand gets a massive damage burst on top of it's revive-esque nature, making it incredibly powerful in any situation. **Clarity** Let me clarify here; I know it sort of sounds like I'm saying any heal is like a revival ability, but that's not what I'm getting at. Those abilities exist in champions where it's appropriate and they aren't ever combined with a blink. **The problem isn't that it exists in the game, it's the fact that it's built into an assassin's kit.** Chronobreak existing in Ekko's kit gives him that power when he's isolated from his team. This makes him an assassin with little vulnerability when caught out; Something that's supposed to be a downside of playing an assassin. The cooldown is also very low, especially compared to the abilities I mentioned before. Champions are supposed to have something OP about them though, otherwise why would you play them? I personally think Ekko is an awesome addition to the League, but he lacks significant weaknesses. I know I just talked about his ult in this post, but there's more that needs tuning. Chronobreak is what makes Ekko what he is, and as frustrating as it is to play against, there ARE ways to play against it. I think removing some of his excess power could make him just as fun to play as while being more fun to play against. **Suggested Balancing** ***Q*** and ***E*** are probably fine as they are. ***Passive*** *- Z-Drive Resonance* - decrease the slow and movement speed to 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 / 50% for 2 seconds. ***W*** *- Parallel Convergence* - Active : **EDIT:** After a bit of deliberating I think the proper nerf for W would be to reduce it to a 1.75 second stun at all ranks and remove the vision granted when cast. ***R*** *- Chronobreak* - reduce the damage to 200 / 300 / 400 (+80% AP). Considering everything else it bring to the table, the damage on chronobreak needs to take a huge hit. Get rid of the base heal (100 / 150 / 200) so that it's only based off of the damage taken. This lowers Chronobreak's excess power, while still rewarding Ekko for negating damage properly. If necessary, make successfully recalling reset Ekko's hologram. This will only be necessary if we find using Chronobreak to return to lane can create huge advantages. I think we'll have a better idea of whether this is the case or not once the pros begin playing him, but I suspect it won't be. If we find the numbers aren't the problem (See Kassadin), reverting the nerfs to the burst and heal and adding a 0.5s channel before the ability takes effect would be a great alternative. Chronobreak would still take you back to 4 seconds from the initial casting time in this situation. (I realize things get very complicated with the heal in this scenario.) I worry that this method would be too big of a hit to the ability. **You did it!** Well that's my in-depth look at Chronobreak, I hope any of you that actually read that massive wall of text enjoyed it! What are your thoughts on possible balancing for Ekko/Chronobreak? Do you think he's fine the way he is? Do you hope no one ever realizes how good Cleanse would be on him? Let me know!"
126,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Hi, I'm both a Dota 2 and LoL player, and I'd like to explain to you why League has this ""FotM"" meta while Dota 2 doesn't, and what Riot can do to increase the diversity of viable picks.",0,39pe17,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/39pe17/hi_im_both_a_dota_2_and_lol_player_and_id_like_to/,2015-06-13 23:31:22,"**TL;DR at the bottom!** Riot tries to make every champion ""average"" and take away unique strengths, instead of making the weaknesses of a champion easier to exploit. A recent example would be Zed: They nerfed his splitpushing some time ago. Then they buffed him a few patches ago (his ult places him behind the target and he ignores unit collision during his ult), and instead of reverting the buff and seeing what happens, they got rid of the feature that made many of his mid lane matchups skill based: Taking away the ability to use swap back to his ult shadow before 1 second has passed. Now, there is almost no reason to take Zed over any other ""meta"" assassin anymore, because you can almost guarantee that a similar skilled opponent will be able to outplay you, in lane, in teamfights, and in duels if the opponent has any kind of CC. I'm not saying Zed should be buffed, I'll just take him as an example of how Riot approaches balancing. You might ask ""What's wrong with that?"" but let me elaborate and take Dota 2 for comparison, to see how balancing can be made more interesting, without taking away the strengths of a champion and trying to make the entire kit ""just average"". ____ In Dota 2, if your favourite hero is getting nerfed, it will almost always still be completely viable in pubs and in most cases keep it's competitiveness at the top level. Well how does [Icefrog](URL (the guy mainly responsible for balancing Dota 2) do this? Icefrog tends to adjust an ""OP"" hero without taking away its unique role on a team. The example most people point to is Batrider. Batrider's [Flaming Lasso](URL is an amazing initiation skill once he gets [Blink Dagger](URL (an item that allows you to blink a medium distance over the map, kind of like the old Kassadin Riftwalk, but with a longer cooldown). Instead of nerfing his ulti (something Riot would do), he nerfed Batrider's base damage so he has a harder time in lane. He still has his iconic ultimate, but now he has a vulnerability: shut him down in lane and you can push Blink Dagger timing back 3-5 minutes. ____ Another example is the also iconic [CK](URL + [Wisp](URL combo. The pre-6.79 Wisp can instantly Relocate himself and 1 allied hero anywhere on the map for 12 seconds and [tether stun](URL anyone between him and his buddy. CK can instantly move behind an enemy hero, giving easy tether stuns. What does Icefrog do? Instead of nerfing Relocate into the ground, Wisp's tether now does a hefty slow instead of a stun. Wisp can still be a huge benefit to a coordinated team, but getting kills with Relocate ganks is no longer a guarantee. ____ Since these nerfs have happened, have these heroes just completely disappeared from the meta? No, but they're nowhere near as dominant as they used to be previously, where Batrider and Io were almost 100% pick/ban rate. This lateral balancing allows for more situational picks and more specialized team compositions compared to League. Dota is a game balanced around team synergy and reactions more than anything. You can choose the 5 best and most contested heroes in the game, and you will lose to a team that has a clear cut goal with their draft ([the old Singaporean team Zenith famously beat the International 2 Champions Invictus Gaming without banning a single hero, baiting iG into picking the most contested heroes and abusing the lack of synergy](URL Dota heroes are specific tools. If you want to bake a cake, you're picking the whisk and the bowl, not the saw and the hammer. IMO, this philosophy is much more interesting than Riot's style of game balance. Not only has Riot blatantly enforced the 1-1-2 and jungler meta, but all the champs feel like there isn't anything to make certain champs stand out, because instead of having strengths and weaknesses, they're just trying to make them average in all areas (Zed splitpushing nerf for example). When a slight buff or nerf comes out, the community just ditches the champ that was previously the best in that role and moves on to the next one. If a champion in League of Legends is good at a thing, Riot will nerf what they're good at through number tweaks. This results in a flavor-of-the-month style balancing where you have the same general roles being filled in every single team, just with different champions based off of whichever one happens to be most effective at the given time in the patch. Icefrog balances laterally. If he sees that a hero is really good at something, he doesn't nerf what they're already good at. He keeps them being good at what they're good at, but nerfs them in something else that's inconsequential. ____ **TL;DR: League champions are swiss-army knives, and Riot sharpens and dulls them as they see fit. This fits well with their monetization policy as it incentivizes you to always buy the sharpest knife and then replace it when yours dulls, but it does not help Riot with achieving their goal (diverse meta) at all.**"

Main Damage Nuke turned into a skillshot. 2). Core Gameplay uptime/downtime more exposed. Number 1 is self explanatory. Number 2 isn't, I'll try and explain it. Before ryze had his passive that was always on, constantly available and you never quite had opportunities to do much to him unless you picked a champion to specifically counter him, or he runs out of mana. And because of the nature of his abilities, his damage was all but certain, and could do it through minion waves. He was a massive lane bully, and it was not good gameplay. Annie and Katarina suffer the same problems. Annies stun is pretty much always up, and Katarina's passive isn't so useful in the laning phase except in a tower dive to shunpo out of its range once you get the kill under the turret. It's not good gameplay, these champions all have the same problems as ryze had. Katarina and Annie need periods of vulnerability and overwhelming power due to the nature of their abilities. They also need skillshots as part of their main damage ability rotations. There's not enough room for error OR improvement in the basic way these champions operate. The community so far likes to joke about turning champion abilities from targeted to skillshot's such as Ryze and Veigar, but is it really such a bad thing? So far it's been working well, and I've always felt having a kit of targeted abilities without significant draw-backs just isn't good for the game. "

The Flow mechanic is nice with the shield but adds very little to Yasuo's gameplay other than a free shield once in a while and during ult. Then the other part of the passive feels like ""oh and double crit chance btw"". These two passives have been a **big reason of his numerous nerfs**, specifically because of his free double crit chance which grants him **both huge burst and dps**, which is inherently a **poor design decision**. My idea is to create **windows of strength for both Yasuo and his opponent**, while linking the two passives together and removing excess power: **make Yasuo only have double crit chance while the shield is ready and active** (both when full Flow and 1,5 seconds after being hit). This would create some meaningful gameplay options for Yasuo and his opponent. Yasuo would be weaker when not having full Flow and stronger after filling the bar whether by walking or ulting. Yes, this would strictly be a nerf to his **free stats**, however his play pattern would remain the same both in lane and in teamfights but with **clearer windows of strength/vulnerability**. Ult all-ins would still have double-crits and a laning Yasuo would know (and should know by now) to trade when having max Flow. After this change, Riot could **start undoing some of the nerfs he got** (like making his E restore Flow again) and **tweaking his numbers up until he got to a healthy spot**, like they are doing with other reworks like Ryze and Veigar. __*TL;DR: Have Yasuo only get double crit chance when full Flow so that some buffs may come, like the recharge mechanic on his E.*__ What do you think, Reddit/Riot?"

In the first short part here I will be discussing her base stats and what they mean for Riven. I'll start with the basics, Riven is a melee champion with moderate base stats (HP, armor, MR) for a melee champion while having one of the lowest melee movespeeds for fighters at 340 while most fighter peers are 345-350 meaning she will be heavily reliant on in-built mobility. Rivens HP Regen is amongst the lowest of all champions in the game falling below Rengar who has a heal and barely above Gnar who has Mega-Gnar anyways who conversely has the highest HP/5 while in Mega-Gnar for fighters which means Riven must itemize at some point for sustain otherwise she will be left behind by other fighters. This leaves her attack range which is on the low at at 125 meaning Riven has below average base stats overall for a melee champion, however her kit covers a few of these weakness as ill explain rounding her out. In the second part I will be discussing her abilities, what they do, how they can be used, and the choices she makes each time she uses these abilities. Lets start with her passive ""Runic Blade"", each time Riven uses a basic ability she gains a charge of Runic Blade which enhances her next auto attack(s) to deal bonus physical damage this is a great way to encourage combo styled play with Riven as it gives a way to increase her maximum DPS for experienced Riven players who know how to masterfully use her passive to its full potential, the downside to her passive is it has no actual passive use the entire passive only ever benefits her in combat as such its more of an active passive than a real 'passive' passive so to speak so if Riven isnt actively using her passive she essentially has no passive adding depth to her kit that separates good and great Riven players. Next up I will discuss Rivens Q ability, Broken Wings. Broken Wings is a 3 part ability that consists of 2 regular short ranged dashes dealing a small to moderate amount of AoE damage with the 3rd part doing a small-moderate amount of damage with a small knockback. This ability is Rivens outplay bread and butter as masterful use of this ability makes or breaks Riven. Using this ability offensively increases Rivens damage output tremendously when combined with perfect passive usage however to do this usually requires closing the distance using the very same ability meaning to get full use of Broken Wings you need to outplay your opponents positioning which can be hard as the ability is on a 13 second cooldown which means you cannot use it for this purpose early game before you begin to build CDR as it leaves you vulnerable to ganks so a Riven must make proper choices on when to engage or disengage with this spell. Her W, Ki Burst. Ki Burst is a short ranged short duration stun with a moderately long cooldown early with a low base damage, this ability is best used to keep an opponent locked within a Broken Wings combo to prevent yourself from being kited. Ki Burst is one of Rivens 2 CC abilities that must be used appropriately depending on situation. This gives Riven versatility of choice in a fight and light utility outside of her damage which is a trademark of the Fighter design. Expert usage of Ki Strike will reward great Riven players with favorable trades 9/10 times as it allows her to easily trade back or disengage a bad fight while her cooldowns are down. Onto her E, Valor. Valor is another mobility spell of Rivens except instead of offensive oriented like Broken Wings it is an defensive focused mobility spell as it grants Riven a short duration shield with a moderate base value further enhanced by her attack damage. This ability will make or break a Rivens early game due to bad health regen and team fight as it is her only defensive ability against targetted spells (her Q and E mobility can be considered decent defense against skillshot oriented enemies). Her only real defensive ability being tied to her mobility is also an incredible drawback aswell as it forces her to use it to close the gap/escape and not get value from the shield, or to save to shield lowering her overall mobility to use when she actually needs it to absorb an ability giving Riven players a hard choice to make. Another well designed part of her E is the fact it scales on her offensive capability since Rivens entire kit is focused on building a strong plethora of AD only itemization with little to no room for defense items but this allows her to do so with less punishment creating a more well rounded kit. Rivens R, Blade of the Exile. BotE is a steroid plain and simple, it enhances her AD by 20% and gives her more attack range (200 from 125 fixing her low range issue temporarily) while also giving her access to her real Ultimate Wind Slash. Wind Slash is a large frontal cone AoE that does low damage on base values but greatly amplified the lower an enemies health becomes. This forces Rivens to use her ultimate before an engage to maximum her damage however if she misses her melee oriented skillshotdash damage her ultimate does nearly no damage meaning once her ult is up she has to commit to the fight to get the most out of it. Expert usage of this ability can win great Rivens most duels and even team fights but if misused or misfired it'll have little effect for the Riven. Many people will consider Windslash to be too strong for her to have but I have to point out that ADCs such as Jinx also have AoE executes that scale off missing health damage and are also AoE except hers is GLOBAL instead of 900~ range so before you think its too strong please consider its similar rivals. Now that I've given the Rundown on all of her abilities I will briefly list her strengths and weaknesses on why Riven is a benchmark for champion design. * Clear design as a combo based all-in champion that lacks influence outside her auto attack range barring her long cooldown Ultimate * Lack of passive sustain giving her windows of vulnerability where she must itemize to cover this forcing her to pool gold somewhere * Hard choices to make with offensive and defensive capabilities being tied to her mobility so she cannot have the best of both worlds * Weak against teamfight oriented team comps giving counterplay room against her glass high damage build style * Extremely High Skillcap for Extremely High Reward since her entire kit revolves around being squishy with high mobility and damage These 5 facts show some essential things that were considered when designing her champion identity as they show she has both strong points and weak points at all stages of the game making her one of the most well designed champions within League of Legends to date.

I am writing about the explotiation of labor in America over time. I plan to write about the slavery of Native Americans, African Americans, working conditions during industrial revolution, and working conditions in present day foreign sweat shops working for American industries (Walmart, Nike, etc). I have my thesis and a good portion of my first assertion done : Cheap labor has always been prevalent in history since Christopher Columbus settled on the newly found Americas. He stated on arrival They would make fine servants.... With fifty men we could subjugate them all and make them do whatever we want... This view of finding the most efficient form of labor without any regard to human rights has been shared throughout history by new world settlers, plantation owners, and big name capitalist industries. As time went on, the demand for cheap and efficient labor resulted in humans fulfilling these demands by working with little or no pay with terrible working conditions. The time periods of the discovery of America, industrial revolution, and present day give prime examples of this phenomenon. Native Americans were prime targets for labor for the Spaniards who landed on the Americas. Their vulnerability made it easy for them to become enslaved to work in huge estates known as encomiendas for the spaniards. The work was so too demanding for a large portion of the Natives resulting in the estimated death of thousands each year. Injuries were not uncommon for the workers. The work the Natives were subjected to ranged from back breaking work carrying stones and having their back arched washing gold to digging and creating thousands of hills for cassava plants. I would appreciate any help this wonderful league of legends community can offer. The sooner I finish, the faster I can get on the rift."

All of my reasoning and decision making is on the original post, as I'm sure most of you don't want to read a long, rambling post. Essentially, I believe that Shen is in need of an updated kit. His E is *too* powerful, with too much of his kit focused on him hitting a 5 man taunt. It is high risk yet low reward, as it throws him into a position of massive vulnerability yet leaves him high and dry after only a few seconds of cc. By distributing power into the rest of his kit I believe Shen becomes a healthier pick in general. Currently, his Q is extremely linear and non-interactive, his W is a boring and unrewarding spell, and his R is almost impossible to balance due to its ability to create perpetual global pressure. In order to give his R buffs, its global nature must be removed (its range is still massive). Without further ado, here is my interpretation of what I think Shen's kit should look like. **Ki Strike (CD 9 sec) (CD decreases by 0.25 seconds with every level, with the CD becoming 4.5 seconds at level 18)** * Shen's next basic attack deals bonus magic damage equal to 4 + (4  Shen's level) (+ 10% of bonus health) (+ 5% of target's max hp) and restores 30 Energy. When struck by Ki Strike, targets are marked with Mark of Twilight for 8 seconds. Marked targets heal Shen for (5 * level) (+ 1.5% max hp) each time they auto attack him or he auto attacks them. Every basic attack reduces the cooldown of Ki Strike by 1 second, up to 2 seconds while Feint holds. **Vorpal Blade (RANGE: ~225 (front only) | COST: 60 ENERGY | COOLDOWN: 6 / 5.5 / 5 / 4.5 / 4)** * ACTIVE: Shen uses his twin Ninjato to strike all targets directly in front of him with two quick, sweeping slashes, dealing 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 50% AP) (+ 100% AD) physical damage. If a marked unit is struck, they are stunned for 1 second, Shen restores 40 energy, and he is healed for 60 / 70 / 80 / 90 / 100 (+ 1.5% max hp). Any minions or monsters killed with this move heal Shen for 2 / 3 / 5 / 6 / 7 (+ 0.5% max hp). A target marked with Mark of Twilight can only be stunned by Vorpal Blade once every 5 seconds. **Feint (COST: 60 ENERGY | COOLDOWN: 12 / 10.5 / 9 / 7.5 / 6)** * ACTIVE: Shen gains a shield that absorbs 60 / 100 / 140 / 180 / 220 (+ 40% AP) (+ 8% max hp) damage. The shield dissipates after 3 seconds if not already destroyed. Nearby allies receive half the effect of Shen's shield. While the shield persists, Shen's basic attacks reduce the cooldown of Ki Strike by an additional 1 second (2 seconds total). **Shadow Dash (RANGE: 600 | COST: 80 ENERGY | COOLDOWN: 11 / 10 / 9 / 8 / 7)** * ACTIVE: Shen dashes along target line, dealing 50 / 85 / 120 / 155 / 190 (+ 30% AP) magic damage to enemy champions he contacts and taunting them for 1.5 seconds. While taunted, enemies are forced to attack Shen and their basic attacks deal half damage. Shen gains 20 ENERGY for each enemy champion he contacts. **Stand United (RANGE: 5000/6000/7000 | COOLDOWN: 140 / 120 / 100)** * ACTIVE: Target allied champion gains a shield that absorbs 250 / 550 / 850 (+ 100% AP) (+ 3.5% max hp) damage. The shield dissipates after 5 seconds if not already destroyed. After 1.5 seconds of channeling, Shen teleports to the allied champion, gaining 80% movement speed for 3 seconds and 50% of the remaining shield, if it is still intact. Shen prioritizes the most wounded allied champion in his range if no allied champions are targeted on cast. EDIT: fixed some wording"
134,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Would adding a toggle target champion only keybinding change the game too much?,0,336o86,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/336o86/would_adding_a_toggle_target_champion_only/,2015-04-20 11:18:21,"As an ADC I love the target champion only keybinding, but late game it can be a nuisance incorporating that specific keybinding with others, so i was wondering. What do you guys think about including a toggle target champion only keybinding. Yes it would change teamfights around minions but not as much as you would think, because attack move click does not work with toggle target champion only. If you miss clicked you'd still walk into vulnerability by getting closer to the enemy team by mistake, this is just an idea but I can't really see adding this keybinding as a complete game changer to leagues play style so I'm wondering why it camp be implemented. If you can prove me wrong do so because I'm curious!"

I've never had an issue with pain in my hand until now, even after unfortunately large amounts of consecutive games. Has anyone else found this issue with the new Ryze? I have a few theories as to why it is harder on the hands even than the old Ryze. - I end up Q-ing more often to stack tear (since it's now a skillshot), and also to build up stacks of the passive to be ready for fights. - Same requirement for hitting lots of buttons rapidly as the old Ryze had, except I think my hand is more tense because while pressing all your buttons you simultaneously have to manage the Q being a skillshot and the timing/length of your passive. Added stress/tension = more vulnerability to hand pain If this isn't just me in some isolated incident of maybe being more tense than usual or some such, I think it's a rather big deal. Pain in the hand from playing is a serious issue, and I have no interest in playing a champion that provokes this issue, no matter how interesting or fun a champion is."
136,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,AD Caster Varus ( la Jayce) mid with his Q cooldown buff on the PBE.,13,2xuogd,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2xuogd/ad_caster_varus_à_la_jayce_mid_with_his_q/,2015-03-04 11:42:35,"I just tried this on the PBE. You wouldn't believe how fun and strong it is (and how potentially unfun it maybe for the other laner, but I digress). Varus' Q range at max charge is 1625 range - that is a lot of sniping with the build I played with. At 40% CDR and level 9, you have your Q up most of the time. If you charge a Q up to the max amount of time allowed, you can release it and charge another one up immediately within 1-2 seconds. If you land 2 in a row in that time, it is GUARANTEED to kill any squishy laner below 50% health. This makes him VERY strong in poke/waveclear/siege compositions. Of course, you will run into mana problems if you don't build a Tear/Manamune. Anyway, I NEVER want to play ADC Varus ever again if this buff goes live. AD Caster/sniper Varus is much too fun. Thank you Riot for the immense buff. This might be the only buff Varus ever needs to be fun and viable without being overbearing (vulnerability to all-ins, lack of mobility)."

It makes the ability feel clunky and also lessens the utility of it's speed. It's hard to use it to escape when there's a small period of vulnerability. That being said, the cooldown buff should help Galio's late game a bit more, but I feel this buff would make Galio feel more fluid and give more meaning to the current utility of that."
138,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,The Best Champs to Play in Order to Improve Various Mechanics (And Why),8,2z8xdd,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2z8xdd/the_best_champs_to_play_in_order_to_improve/,2015-03-17 03:44:01,"**Context:** I am a high elo one trick pony player and I have been working to improve my all around gameplay recently. In doing so I have found a few champions in particular that yield faster results than others. While you can get better at more or less any mechanic with any champion, there are some champions that will help you improve faster due to their particular skill set. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and some of them seem quite obvious, but I hope it is helpful. There is no *Sandbox* mode in league, so making the most out of your playtime to improve is in your hands. Hope this list helps! Please feel free to disagree with me, or suggest alternative mechanics / champions. 1. **Kiting: Kalista**  This one is obvious as it is built into her kit. But as an ADC you will need to get good at attacking your opponents while repositioning. Playing a lot of Kalista will force you to move after attacks and will enforce good habits. 2. **Map Awareness / Teleporting: Shen**  One of the hardest things about playing top is learning how / when / where to use your teleport. Players new to the role, myself included, will often TP too late to a fight that has already been lost  or TP to a fight too early and just get blown up / disengaged before anything can even happen. Additionally, knowing where to TP in can be tough since you dont want to be too far away, but you also dont want to be right in the middle, especially if you are not a mega tank. Playing as Shen will make this decision easier by taking the where out of the TP decision. With Shens ult, all you have to do is decide when to TP in, since the target is obvious (the champ who might die). Once you have mastered Shens ult you will be adept at the when aspect of TP, and be trained to watching your team / map. Then learning the second part of TP decision making will be easier! 3. **Harassing / Trading: Draven**  Most ADC have two things on their mind: getting CS and trading effectively. However, Draven has a third thing in the form of his mini game of axe catching. When any ADC goes to last hit a minion, they are going to be vulnerable to attacks from the enemy team since he/she will have his/her autoattack on CD, and will most likely be a bit farther up on the wave; therefore generally the best time to go for a trade / harass on the enemy ADC is when is going for that last hit. However, Draven is especially vulnerable as he has to move to a specific location AFTER his AA is over. Playing Draven will really help you recognize this vulnerability. 4. **Counter Engaging / Counter Ganking: Fiddlesticks**  Fiddle has the worlds best counter engage ult. He wont be able to immediately jump to a high priority enemy like Vi or WW can, but his ult does huge damage. Because it has a large cast time, fiddle ults have to come from out of enemy vision and come to a place where the enemy is already engaging on your team. Playing fiddle will force you to try and predict enemy engages / ganks as that is where you will be most useful. *Fiddle is also a great way to practice your vision control  you have to make sure the enemy doesnt have vision of you when you charge up* 5. **Smart-Casting: Ryze**  Even though he is no longer in the meta, Ryze is probably the best example of someone who needs to use smart cast. Quick use of his combo is essential, and doesnt allow you to click on the opponent every time to use a spell. Since all of his spells are nukes (not skill shots), it will allow you to get used to the mechanic without having to worry about missing! 6. **Roaming (support): Bard**  This is another obvious one, so I wont go into much detail. Bards skills make him a good training wheels champ to learn roaming on, since failed roams wont be punished as hard due to his chimes. 7. **Roaming (mid): Twisted Fate**  Roaming bot as a mid laner can be game changing: Im sure we have all had a game where as a bot lane you are stomping the enemy, but the other teams Katarina comes down and double kills you ruining your lane. A lot of factors go into the effectiveness of a roam, but to start off many mid laners just need to learn TO DO IT at all. Playing TF will force you to look for opportunities to head to the bot lane  and his ult is like having the training wheels to get you there. Once you have perfected ganking bot as TF, you will have the intuition of when to roam down pat. 8. **Peeling: Braum**  There are some games in which your teams win condition comes down to making sure your 10-1-3 Jinx does not get instantly murdered by the enemy midlaner who is 11-0. However, as a support sometimes it might be hard to resist the urge to use your spell-reel on a great engage or pick (think about playing annie and not always using flash tibbers to engage). Braum is a champ who is designed to peel. Although his ult can be used to engage or disengage, his E and W are designed around putting himself between a high priority team mate and certain death. Once you have played a few games as Braum, you will have some habit of using your spells to protect the important person on your team. 9. **Assassination: Katarina** - Although there are a few assassins with resets, I choose Kat because I think she is fairly simple. An assassin is meant to infiltrate the enemy teams backline, take out a priority squishy target, and then make their escape. A good assassin waits for the enemy team to be preoccupied (with say a tank initiation), or to be split up (an ADC wandering the woods alone) before she makes her entrance. A good assassin does not walk straight up to the enemy team, she approaches from stealth. Katarina if played incorrectly will end up doing nothing  if the enemy team sees her coming and lands proper CC, she is useless. Additionally, playing kat will force you to prioritize low/squishy targets, since getting resets is incredibly important. Hope this helps, and good luck on the rift!"
139,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Dear Riot, the PBE changes to Aatrox's ultimate are nice, but it won't be nearly enough to help him. His Blood Well and resource mechanic need to be addressed.",7,2znnek,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2znnek/dear_riot_the_pbe_changes_to_aatroxs_ultimate_are/,2015-03-20 13:12:57,"I was fortunate enough to have an interview with QA Rioters (for the Playtest position they posted about in February) and they asked me who I thought was the worst designed champion: I quickly responded with Aatrox. Although he's a really fun and interesting champion to play, at the moment he's just so outclassed by other champions that he's no longer enjoyable to play. While he does suffer from a variety of design issues (e.g., poor base stats, ultimate lacks cohesion, and so on), I think his main problem is his Blood Well and his abilities' interaction with it. I've thought about his Blood Well a great deal, frequently changing my mind about how it can be fixed. In the end, I've come to the conclusion that they should: **1)** *Remove his ability health costs altogether* **2)** *Allow his Blood Well to generate from dealing and taking damage* **This will remedy most of his issues, allow me to explain:** *Current issues in lane*: Of all the champions who use health to cast abilities (Aatrox, Mundo, Vlad, and Zac) he has the hardest time regaining the health he spends. When it comes to the current meta of top and jungle, sustain is of utmost importance, and Aatrox struggles tremendously with this since his abilities cost so much health to cast and he has to auto attack 3 times just for a small heal. In lane, he takes more damage from harass and casting his moves than he will heal for. *Current issues in the jungle*: In the jungle (especially in Season 5), he's typically hovering around 50% HP because he can't heal past that amount due to how much damage he takes, how much health he spends on abilities, and his lack of reliable sustain. This makes him vulnerable to invades and it makes his ganks more risky as the opposing laner/jungler can easily burst him down. It's not until roughly 3 core items (e.g., fully upgraded jungle item, Randuin's, and Spirit Visage) into his build that he finally can do a healthy jungle clear, while most strong junglers now start *healing* from the jungle with far less items. Moreover, when you're already at low health in the jungle and your passive isn't built up, then it's extremely difficult to generate your Blood Well because all your abilities build it based of % current health (this issues applies to all aspects of the game). This further increases his vulnerability to early game set backs, such as invades or damage taken during ganks. It should also be noted that his knockup from Q doesn't reduce the scuttle crab's resistances when everyone else's stuns/knockups do. *Current issues in team fights*: Since Aatrox uses his own health to generate his passive, he a) enters the fight with 15% missing health (since it's costs 10% to Q in, then 5% to use your E) and b) has a difficult time generating his passive in team fights because he's always CC'd and kited. As a result, depending on your build, Aatrox either is a poor tank with mediocre CC and no damage or a squishy fighter who gets burst down rather quickly, only to revive with little health and no attack speed from his Blood Well. **With my proposed Blood Well changes we should see the following remedies:** *Remedies in lane*: If he didn't have to use health to cast abilities, then that would help his issues in lane immensely. To start, these changes would obviously require reducing the life steal from W since he won't be expending so much health casting abilities. However, consider that his W is perhaps his most problematic aspect when it comes to balancing, I don't see many people having an issue with that. Without losing health from casting, it allows Aatrox to harass, CS, and sustain in lane more effectively as he doesn't have to sacrifice 5-15% of his health just to use his moves. *Remedies in the jungle*: Without having to expend health to cast abilities this will enable Aatrox to use his abilities throughout the jungle and the map without having to sacrifice so much health. Again, this will greatly improve his sustain issues in the jungle as well as his clearing speed since he can use his Q more frequently since it won't use any health. By being able to generate his passive from both dealing and taking damage then it will allow Aatrox to more reliably access the attack speed from his passive since it won't require % current health to generate it (again, it is currently very difficult to regenerate your passive once you are low health). *Remedies in team fights*: If Aatrox were able to build his passive from taking damage, then he wouldn't be as vulnerable to CC and being kited in team fights. As it stands now, he seldom gets to life steal in team fights as he's perpetually CC'd and kited. This would allow him to access the full potential of the attack speed from his Blood Well so he can perform in team fights. In addition, this change will add more versatility to his item builds because he will benefit more from tankier items since his passive builds from taking damage. As a result, this will greatly help his survivability and overall performance in team fights. In conclusion (**TL;DR**), these core changes to his Blood Well and resource mechanic will add more cohesion and reliability to his kit. In addition, they will allow him more versatility in his builds so that he can be more of a threat in all aspects of the game. While changes such as base stats, ability scaling, ability functions could help, I think they would only be a band-aid for the multitiude of Aatrox's problems in lane, the jungle, and team fights. His primary issue is his Blood Well. If they clean up his Blood Well with the changes I suggested (or something similar), then he would be in a much healthier position. "
140,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"With old champions more and more oftenly reworked in order to put them in line with what the game is like today, I think it's about time we discuss Anivias current status.",0,2zsx8l,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2zsx8l/with_old_champions_more_and_more_oftenly_reworked/,2015-03-22 00:21:41,"INTRODUCTION: After having been picked frequently for some time during season 2, Anivia's popularity both at a competitive and amateur level has dramatically dropped to one of the lowest levels ever, never to recover again. Metagame issues which would make her underpowered (such as assassins' overwhelming domination of mid lane during season 3) seem to have mostly been solved now, and small buffs every now and then have contributed to improving Anivia's performance; one thing yet remains clear: these efforts failed to draw more players towards her, as while I'm writing this post Anivia is only picked 1,87% of the time (which makes her the 10th less picked champion) in spite of having a 52,85% win rate. Below follows my personal analysis of what factors probably cause this weird gap the most, as well as possible suggestions for a rework which I hope may at least fuel some debate on this issue. I'm also encouraging any Anivia main out there to speak out his own opinion in order to contribute to this discussion. My whole point as an Anivia main myself is that while not being underpowered at all, I think Anivia often feels terribly outdated and unrewarding to play, up to a point I'm hoping to see her reworked into a healthier champion as fast as possible and want to do everything I can to accelerate the process or at least start a debate about it. WHY SHE FEELS OUTDATED/UNREWARDING: Features that make Anivia feel outdated/unrewarding range across a wide spectrum but ultimately share one big problem: they are not something the Anivia player can most of the time control/exploit. By that I mean that a champion's strong/weak points are usually designed to punish poor gameplay and reward skillful plays, whereas Anivia's kit is full of flaws that will affect the Anivia player regardless of his performance. These flaws are on the other hand equally counterbalanced by strenght points that will turn the tide in favor to the Anivia player but are usually not the natural consequence of his good plays either. This would ultimately also explain why her win rate is so high in spite of people not wanting to play her. * The most remarkable example has to be her passive. Even though it fits well her being a phoenix, it rewards the Anivia player for dying. It will affect her ability to win lane skirmishes, team fights and ultimately her win rate, but not in a healthy way as rewarding correct positioning: it actually does the opposite by limiting the effect of poor gameplay instead. The other two champions who feature a reviving passive (Aatrox, Zac) have a reason to include it in their kits as they are designed to dive the enemy formation and draw in as much fire as possible to themselves. Considering that Anivia is a mage/glass cannon and not a fighter/bruiser, there should actually be nearly no situations in which the Anivia player would want to expose himself to draw fire, which ultimately relegates the use of her passive to exclusively limiting the consequences of mistakes rather than rewarding skillful gameplay (in a nutshell this means it reduces the gap between good Anivia players and bad Anivia players as the latter benefit more than the former from the passive's bonus). Moreover, I believe Anivia's passive is also the reason she currently has one of the lowest HP pools of the game (resulting to be the most squishy champion at level 1 and 2nd most squishy at level 18). I imagine game designers thought that giving Anivia more HP, combining it with her passive, would have made her too hard to kill. While this is true on paper, reducing her HP pool means limiting her ability to expose herself to trade/poke without dying and ultimately leaves the Anivia players less initiative/room to start plays (once again, a thing good Anivia players would exploit much more than bad Anivia players). * Mana issues are another frustrating feature Anivia players usually cant deal with. Let alone mana regen items used to be stronger in the past (I'm looking specifically at tear/chalice, as they received multiple nerfs across seasons), the mana cost on her R are so high they can easily force Anivia players to invest the early part of their itemization into solving mana issues alone (up to 2 items are usually required to do so). This limits the champion's flexibility, makes it less fun to play and affects the snowballing and laning process in a negative way as well: champions with more forgiving mana costs will basically gain access to increased damage after killing an opponent in lane. Anivia on the other hand has to basically purchase the possibility to stay in lane in the very first place as she will otherwise be forced to constantly base for mana since both her ability to farm/push and her ability to trade are strongly dependent on her R. On the other hand, her insane base damage and AP scalings will mean she will still pack a punch in spite of only buying mana/mana regen during early game. This makes her laning and scaling really weird and usually painful because in even scenarios champions with more forgiving mana costs can usually stay in lane for longer times (unless forced to back due to the opponents outplaying them), whereas Anivia will be forced to back repeatedly regardless during early-mid game. The unrewarding aspect of Anivia's high mana costs is the fact she was ""balanced"" by being granted a move whose pushing power is insane and hard to break; game designers decided to deny her the possibility of abusing it by periodically forcing Anivia off lane due to outsustainment. Since, as I already said, both Anivia's ability to trade and push/farm require her not to be out of mana, this once again affects the gap between good Anivia players and bad Anivia players in the wrong way because the limitation tends to penalize good players harder whereas the benefits tend to aid bad players more (since the wave-clearing process is pretty much autopilot and doesn't require any skill). Moreover, I would also like to note that many champions are able to wave-clear almost just as safely but aren't limited by the same mana costs (yes, I'm looking at you, Malzahar). * Another issue I find pivotal is the one regarding Anivia's kit: along with the way the champion pool of LoL evolved, it feels unfit for a mage as incorporating some features that would actually make more sense on a champion whose role was different, with 3 points being the key factors: Anivia lacks mobility, Anivia lacks range (compared to other static mages such as Lux, Ziggs, Xerath, Velkoz at least) and Anivia has too much CC for a mage. The contraddiction connected to the combination of these factors resides in the fact that in order to fully exploit her kit, Anivia has to get extremely close to the enemy so that she can effectively use her CC to disrupt, which combined with her low mobility, skillshot reliance and squishyness/vulnerability to focus (one single hard CC can turn off her R/stop her Q proc) means the room for mistake is most of the time so little it can easily force the Anivia player to wait for a mistake on the enemy part or a set-up from a member of his team, ultimately shutting down his initiative entirely: while it's true that LoL is a team game whose outcome can't depend on individual skills alone, most champions usually have equal possibilities to both follow teammates plays or start them first-hand. If you consider the synergy between Thresh and Ahri for example, Ahri's E can easily set up a Thresh hook and Thresh's hook can easily set up Ahri's E. In Anivias case, since her Q is extremely slow (possibly the slowest skillshot left over from the old days) it is usually extremely hard to set up a Thresh hook using it, but the damage she on the other hand provides if the opponents do a mistake or a successful set-up occurs, is catastrophic. To cut to the point, I feel Anivia is a champion that has to be carried but is extremely easy to carry at the same time (once again, this is a limitation that penalizes strong payers). I believe a few more words on Anivia's kit are worth spending because I feel other mid lane champions are far more manageable due to their role being defined better: they have either less CC but more mobility (which makes them assassins such as ahri/lb), less CC but more range (which makes them long range pokers such as xerath), or have less CC but insane damage and a more reliable way to set it up themselves (usually without leaving the opponent the room to react, I'm thinking in this case about annie/cassiopeia). As you can see, what seems to be out of line is the fact Anivia has maybe too much CC for a mage. Given the fact that damage sources are usually glass cannons, I personally think CC is something that tanks/engagers/supports rather than mages should be mostly in charge of: staying in the front line to split the enemy team's formation with a well placed wall fits a lot more the support role rather than a mage, for example. CONCLUSION AND POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS: The analysis I conducted so far considers the biggest problem behind Anivia's low pick rate, in my opinion, to be a design in which her ""balance"" is obtained through excessive and unhealthy strenghts and weaknesses. In other words, Anivia has too much black and white and not enough grey. This, along with the fact her kit dates back to an era in which the game was radically different and at the same time makes unclear what her role as a mage should be, brings me to think further buffs will fail making her healthier/more fun to play/more picked. I therefore advocate a full rework to put her back in line. At the moment I'm actually working on some ideas I plan to eventually share with the community as a suggestion of how I would like to see her reworked. For now, I think the best possible way to rework her would be turning her into a long range mage, as that seems also the choice most in line with her lore/concept. Aspects the rework should include, but not be limited to, are: * Increasing her range * Reducing her CC * Reducing her mana costs * Making her less dependent on her R to trade/waveclear * Changing her passive * Reducing her damage * Slightly increasing her HP * Possibly changing her autoattack animation to smooth it out, even at the price of reducing the attack range (not quite as mandatory but would be nice to have) Once again these are just my personal thoughts and the main reason I opened this thread is in the very first place to hear out the community's opinion on the subject. DISCUSS! **TL;DR: Anivia's progressive buffs during season 4 have increased her win rate but have not improved her pick rate. Further buffs will not change this scenario as they will not affect those very aspects of her kit that make her feel outdated and unrewarding to play. She is ""balanced"", but in the wrong way. She therefore needs a full rework that can put her in line with the current pace of the game and better define her role. Also, we want her new splash art. I mean come on! You've been teasing us since worlds and in the current one she looks like her wings were made of papier-mache!**"
141,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"[Champion Relaunch] Quinn &amp; Valor, The Goodies Delivery Team",1,30a6lc,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/30a6lc/champion_relaunch_quinn_valor_the_goodies/,2015-03-26 05:53:27,"Greetings, gentlemen and fine ladies. After seeing the patch notes for [](/quinn) Quinn, I thought it was the right time to present to you my personal idea - aimed at putting the  &amp; Valor  in  Quinn &amp; Valor . Currently, Quinn enjoys a fine defined role (A lane bully that absolutely wrecks melee champions and then transitions to some kind of ranged assassin.) ; however she lacks a real identity. Most of her  Valor capabilities  are loosely included in her spells - Valor marks enemies, Quinn throws Valor, Valor reveals the area, but it barely cuts it : it feels like Quinn is alone doing the job and Valor a mere scribble on parchement. The only time the couple shines is when Tag Team emerges out of its gigantic cooldown, and only for a short time, Valor being merely an executionner. I have given it a bit of a thought : how could Quinn and Valor interact with more gusto ? What if Valor was a controllable unit - a familiar ? [](/annie) Annie will progressively tend to become the ^^Definitely ^^Not ^^A Bear Master, with a different role indeed, therefore let us think of another way to employ Valor. In her lore, Quinn is a scout, with Valor high above. She was pictured in [](/lissandra) Lissandra's sneak peak, in a cold, harsh ^^^^dark ^^^^secret environment. Could Valor have helped her finding both her target and supplies ? *Heightened Senses* depicts the first action. How about the second ? Can we finally add the little Valor touch Quinn deserves while maintaining her role as a lane bully ? Of course we can. My proposal would push her even more in the  brutal lane bully  role, while providing huge windows of vulnerability and equally epic moments of utter domination. I'll describe each feature one by one, explaining my choices and what they could lead to. Keep in mind that Quinn &amp; Valor's abilities are exactly the same (bar number tuning), including the *Harrier* passive. **Abstract. -** While keeping Quinn's current kit, is it possible to make it so Valor feels less like an excuse for poor jokes and more like an actual ally ? *** **Step 1. The Idea.** *** * **Passive :** Quinn can order Valor to go fetch items at the shop in her stead. This passive has some sort of cooldown. For DotA afficionados : * **Passive :** We're reintroducing the concept of Couriers in the game. Just pick Quinn. _Note :_ In the rest of this article, I will refer to the  Valor shops in your stead  action as a  **transaction** . Put simply, Quinn's got a portable shop with her so she can theorically stay in lane forever while she's being stuffed with Trinity and Blade of the Ruined Kings and wards and potions. Technically, Valor flies to the shop and back to Quinn, at which point Quinn's inventory is updated. If Quinn dies before Valor returns, the transaction is cancelled (it wouldn't be of any use anyway). &gt; That sounds horribly broken. It probably is, *but it's what I'm trying to do*. I want Quinn to be the ultimate lane bully, able to permanently leech experience while receiving goods on a regular basis. She'll be the most oppressive (top) laner in the game, period - making pre-nerf Rumble wan in fear. The enemy shall *not* be notified of Valor being away, it's up to them to decipher Quinn's moves and deduce his presence - or lack thereof. *However.* This passive is all but free stuff. So we should add some drawbacks too... right ? *** **Step 2. Dual Destinies.** *** * *Blinding Assault* and *Heightened Senses* are performed at Valor's current location, and *Tag Team* is unavailable until Valor comes back. *Vault* is still available. * Applying *Harrier* on an enemy champion reduces *Vault*'s cooldown. * Clarification : *Harrier* no longer states that  Valor marks enemies as vulnerable . It still works but Valor's out of this. We should even change the name altogether. Of course. Quinn is a formidable opponent... but she needs Valor. If she asks Valor to go fetch her ~~fix~~ fifth *Doran's Blade*, she's alone. No more *GOUGE'EM VALOR*. She's a frail girl in a harsh place. She has to wait for him to return to get her full kit available again. This means the enemy has time to catch up... or set up a gank. Quinn can only rely on *Vault* to get out of a predicament - no more *Heightened Sense* to see [](/vi) Vi coming to *disassemble* you or *Blinding Assault* to save your feathers from [](/trundle) Trundle's jaw. Glorious moments await, of course. Your foes want to smack your butt and Valor's only a few yards away ? Hold'em, you can do it ! Just a couple seconds... and here Valor comes ! *Valor, to me ! Skwaaaak* A funny addition, that concurs with those rules, is to execute *Heightened Senses* at the edge of  missile Valor  when Quinn casts *Blinding Assault*. This is fine. However... I feel like the Scout could share its power with her allies. Oh yes, that's what I'm hinting at. *** **Step 3. The Hollistic Bird.** *** * Quinn's allies can also request a transaction from Valor. This is huge. In fact, it completely change the way the game is played. Quinn &amp; Valor suddenly have toplane pour resources on other lanes without the need of *Teleport* + *Unstoppable Force*. Your midlane [](/cassiopeia) Cassiopeia is having trouble against [](/zed) Zed ? Send her an early *Catalyst* while she ramps up to level 6. Or... your want your friendly Zed to snowball out of control against that poor Cassiopeia ? Alright alright ! Here's your *Brutalizer* - don't leave your lane, just smash the snake. From what I've stated just before, this special case is equivalent to **move toplane pressure around the map**. Remember that while Valor's away, Quinn is weak - out of 4 spells only 1 (*Vault*) still works, and it's mainly a defensive move. So your enemies will have to adapt by pressuring toplane, for instance. Technically, Valor will go to the shop, then fly to the recipient, and finally back to Quinn. Is it unfair ? Of course not, because... *** **Step 4. Counterplay.** *** * Enemies can kill Valor midway to reset the transaction, further increasing the passive cooldown. * When  killed , Valor turns invulnerable and immediately flies back to Quinn. To be able to shutdown Valor midway is a good incentive to counter jungle. If you shutdown Valor, not only you delay the next delivery (which may be crucial to help weak laners) but you also wrong their plan (i.e. they had planned not to go shopping 'then' thanks to Valor, but they are now forced to go themselves, leaving the lane exposed). Counter picks also arise. Did the enemy pick Quinn ? Go ahead, pick [](/nunu) Nunu and *Consume* Valor. I am yet to work out all the kinks, but ideally there should be enough openings in Valor's moves to shut him down. *** **Summary** *** While this idea may seem farfetched to a few, I believe this whole new passive achieves what Riot has strived to perform with all recent champions (well at least since [](/draven)[](/draven)[](/draven)) - open new possibilities and actual uniqueness. Quinn may look fine to-day from a balance point of view but that does not make her any special. With *Pizza Delivery Valor*, you will have to watch out for Quinn &amp; Valor during picks &amp; bans, especially after slow start champions, as they can completely turn the chessboard around. Essentially, Quinn &amp; Valor keep their current top lane bully identity that fall off late game while providing massive map pressure and encouraging enemy map awareness. This passive also gives Quinn &amp; Valor options to share their success in lane with the rest of her team. They can decide to deliver goods for themselves, and as such put an even stronger pressure on their lane (bypassing the necessity to teleport back to keep draining experience) ; but they can also keep the role of standard toplaners and just hold the lane and use Valor to help her allies catch up after a hard start - or have your friendly midlane Zed get a free Pickaxe at level 6 - at the expense of having an otherwise subpar toplaner (similar to the old Renekton : win lane but not much else). &gt;  Most soldiers only rely on their weapons. Few truly rely on each other.  [](/quinn) ~ Quinn Time to get to work, girl. *** **Final notes** *** I have mainly insisted on the laning phase as Quinn &amp; Valor *should* be laning phase Goddess &amp; God, and it's a basic concept anyway, however the passive would be extremely beneficial during sieges for instance, or to help your jungler. How this would look in-game in another subject ; I thought of a simple little button near Quinn &amp; Valor's portrait which would allow one to submit a transaction using the standard Shop window. Quinn &amp; Valor will then decide whether to honor a submitted transaction or not through a little summary panel (current inventory &gt; new inventory, with highlights around advanced tier items). It's a job to keep track of orders so let's make it easy ! I believe some number tuning is also needed - I'm looking at you, *Tag Team*. I have trouble trusting a team that can only work together every 140 seconds at rank 1... Reducing *Tag Team* cooldown would not be so harsh, as Quinn &amp; Valor are mana gated - so, you could buy stuff like *Frozen Heart* and spend more time as Valor in the middle of the fight. Just a few thoughts. *** That'll be all ! I hope you enjoyed reading this little essay. Have a nice day~! PS : What ? Yeah Quinn needs a VU too, just leaving this here. **Edit :** Some stuff. + No longer any donger faces. :-("

143,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,The recent nerfs to Ahri on PBE are NOT the way to balance her. They do not address the core problem.,1739,2ul5us,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2ul5us/the_recent_nerfs_to_ahri_on_pbe_are_not_the_way/,2015-02-03 12:49:20,"I've been a long time Ahri main (playing her since s3 and maining since early s4) and while I agree that Ahri incredibly strong right now the direction that riot is taking in balancing her is not the right way. At the moment the things pushing Ahri over the top are the insane movement speed buff she gets on Q and the very high burst damage on Foxfire. Implementing heavy mana gating and reducing the range on Foxfire will ruin her build diversity and will not solve the problem. Traditionally Ahri's biggest weakness has been her vulnerability to ganks pre-6, her lack of mobility while her ultimate is on cooldown and her lack of tanky stats. The problem right now is that her mobility weakness has been removed throughout the entire game with the movement speed her Q gives. Increasing the mana cost on Q will not solve the problem of her ridiculously safe early game. Instead it will simply make playing her frustrating for both the player and her opponents. Riot needs to give Ahri back her old weaknesses, so that her opponents have windows of opportunity to shut her down. Namely, make her more vulnerable to ganks pre-6 and while her ultimate is on cooldown. For the reasons above I suggest the following: Tie the movement speed boost on Q to her ultimate rank. At rank 0 it gives exactly 0 movement speed. This makes Ahri almost exactly the same early game as she was in 5.1. She will be very vulnerable to ganks and easy to shut down. Additionally she will no longer be able to use the movement speed boost to be a strong lane bully. At rank 1 ultimate allow Q to have 1/3 of the movement speed boost it gives now, rank 2 have 2/3 and rank 3 to have the full movement speed boost it has in 5.2. This makes Ahri's mobility scale with the duration of the game and ensures she still has her utility lategame. This solves the problem of Ahri being impossible to shut down early game. Now make it so the movement speed boost her Q gives is cut in half if her ultimate is on cooldown. This makes Ahri much more vulnerable if her ultimate is down which is exactly one of her biggest weaknesses in 5.1. It also has the side effect of including decision making into the usage of her ultimate. Do you use your ultimate and lose out on half your mobility or save it to kite around better? On to the topic of her insane burst now. Riot has a good idea in lowering the damage of Foxfire back to 5.1 levels while decreasing the cooldown by 1 second. However decreasing the range by 150(!) is insane and will make the cooldown buff essentially useless. Keep in mind that Foxfire does not go on cooldown until all the bolts have fired. Additionally individual Foxfires have their own range. At 600 range the furthest Foxfire will only fire if Ahri is within 350 range of her target. Irelia's stun has 425 range. This change literally makes Foxfire have a lower effective range than Equilibrium strike. It also has the side effect of making the skill essentially useless aside from procing Rylai's. I would gladly take the damage reversion and have Foxfire stay at 5 second cooldown max over having it's range reduced to useless levels. In fact a range reduction of 50 might even be fine, but 150 is complete overkill. Aside from that, if the Rylai's interaction is still too strong, change Foxfire to apply the AoE slow instead of the single target slow. In addition to all of this, kite mages are supposed to die if caught. A solution could be found in making Ahri squishier so she is punished harder for getting hit (with her insane mobility she really should not be) and makes her lategame much more fragile. Whatever you do, do not go through with the current changes on PBE. While they might not ""Olaf"" her, they will definitely make playing her a pain for the player as well as doing nothing to address the problems of the players playing against her. TL;DR: Riot's balancing approach does not solve the core problems. Make Ahri vulnerable early game by tying her Q mobility to her ultimate rank and cut the mobility in half if the ultimate is on cooldown to make her vulnerable during key windows. Do not reduce the range on Foxfire, it will have lower effective range than Irelia's stun which is ridiculous. Change the Rylai's interaction to AoE to reduce the slow and lower the damage as the burst is too high. The cooldown can stay at 5. Make her squishier lategame to punish her if she gets hit since she is a kite mage. Edit: Also please change the movement speed boost particles to match each skin. They are so ugly on Firefox Ahri. Edit2: I have now responded to Phreak's arguments and ideas to further explain and clarify my points. (Warning my response is 10000 characters long and there is no TL;DR) Edit3: Thanks for the gold stranger!"
144,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Comparing Warmogs + Frozen Heart v Randuins + Sunfire Cape,2,2upa31,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2upa31/comparing_warmogs_frozen_heart_v_randuins_sunfire/,2015-02-04 11:55:59,"I was interested in finding out if buying an item that specializes in one attribute offers better gold value than buying items that offer two attributes - so I wanted to check if buying health then buying armour is better than buying two items that have both armour and health. So, Frozen Heart + Warmogs gives you the following: 800 Health, 100 Armour, 20% CDR, 400 Mana, Attack speed aura of 15% of 700 range and the Warmogs healing passive which regenerates 1-3% of your maximun health per seconds depending on damage taken (similar to Garen's passive). Sunfire + Randuins gives you: 950 Health, 115 Armour, Sunfire magic damage of ~37 per second (Before MR), an attack speed passive that reduces the attack speed of any attacker by 15% and also a ~40% slow for 2 seconds every minute. Comparing the two sets of items the following jump out: Sunfire + Randuins gives you 150 more health, 15 more armour, a slow and magic damage per second over a Warmogs + FH. Warmogs + Frozen heart gives you 20% CDR, increased healing on maximum health and 400 mana. Looking at the total costs, Warmogs + FH = 4950 while Sunfire + Randuins = 5450, so one is 500g more expensive than the other. Therefore, the question is whether the following is better: That is, 400 mana + 20% CDR + Healing buff + 500g = 40% slow + 150 health + 15 armour + 37~ magic damage per second (assuming 0 MR). However, the attack speed components on both items (Frozen Heart and Randuins) and not identical either - Frozen Heart's is better as it applies to all enemies in a 700 range radius, whereas Randuins only applies to those who auto attack you. Therefore, because the auto attack range is (rarely) not over 700 (only exclusions of the top of my head is Twitch and KogMaw) Frozen heart's aura is better. Looking at the gold efficiency values of each stat, the following comes out: 20% CDR = 733 gold 400 Mana = 800 gold Health buff from Warmogs = Considered to be worth at least 208g, more effective later the game goes + 500 gold = 500 + 800 + 208 + 733 = 2241. Looking at the benefits from Sunfire + Randuins: 150 Health = 400 15 Armour = 300 Sunfire Damage = ? Randuins Slow = ? So, comparing the two stats of items, the gold value of Warmogs + Frozen Heart is 2241 (assuming that Warmogs Passive gold efficient value is only at the lowest value - is worth more than 208g late game) and Sunfire + Randuins is worth 700g + the magic damage + the slow. Therefore, 2241 - 700 - 1541 gold. The question therefore is whether or not the Sunfire magic damage and the Randuins slow is worth 1541 gold. Of course, there are a few other factors to consider. Most champions who you buy these items on are ""tanks"" - and a few don't use Mana - such as Mundo, Shyvanna, Shen etc. Therefore, the 400 Mana can be considered useless, wasting 800g worth of efficiency. Also, if you build Warmogs first, you don't gain any armour for a long period of time. This is the benefit to Sunfire + randuins as you gain a tiny bit of both, not just a lot of one, which could be more efficient. Lastly, that little bit of magic damage might be how your tank wave clears (for example full tank Renekton - i.e. no Hydra). Summing up, I consider that if your champion is a tank who uses mana and can ""easily"" wave clear, Warmogs might be a more efficient gold use with Frozen Heart over the more traditional Sunfire + Randuins by comparing the stats. That is however if you deem the sunfire magic damage + the randuins slow to be worth more than 1500 gold, and your champions doesn't gain much from having CDR / Mana etc. Finally, looking at the ""traditional full defense tanks in top lane"" - we have Mundo, Malphite, Maokai and Garen. We can exclude Maokai as he should buy a RoA first -&gt; armour as he gains health from RoA. Garen and Mundo have no mana, meaning Frozen Heart isn't a good buy on them. Leaving us with Malphite - who gains a lot of health from his passive (shield) and who needs to buy a lot of armour to increase his damage from his abilities, meaning a straight Warmogs isn't good on him compared to straight armour. Therefore, even though Warmogs + Frozen Heart is in my opinion the better two item combination over Randuins + Sunfire cape, it is fairly limited in use. This is only good if your champion gains a lot of armour / health from another source in his build path as if he straight buys Health it will be less effective than buying both health and armour. tl:dr In my opinion, Frozen Hearth and Warmogs is more gold efficient and a better buy than Sunfire + Randuins if your ""tank"" has mana and gets use out of CDR. However, even though it is better, the build path and the vulnerability to having one defense source isn't good. Also, even though I think it is better, there isn't really anyone who can get the best use out of it due to their kit / being non-mana sourced. "

I have played some games with her since season 3 and what made me look for other assassins was their escape power(Fizz,Zed,Ahri...) that while playing Diana I didn't have. Really easy to camp her too after she wastes flash, not much she can do pre-6 if the enemy is already ahead by ganks. I believe the only thing she needs is some movement speed while casting Q or W (something something ahri). About her power to assassinate is actually fine mid/late game where you can assassinate squishys really easily if you land your combo correctly. Plus pulling all their team to you and pressing zhonyas gives your team a chance to do stuff. But well.. what do you think about it?"
146,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Why ""Building Upon the Situation"" Is A Lie",0,2wywje,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2wywje/why_building_upon_the_situation_is_a_lie/,2015-02-24 18:50:30," So I believe many people walk around with the belief that all item choices in a game aside from the champion's core are based upon the situation - as in how fed are the enemies or trying to fill the holes in your team composition. What I have to say about that is that it's unrealistic to expect that you can shift your entire build path/playstyle in a game while still holding retaining the same ""itemization efficiency"" from what was intended at champion select. In layman's terms, when you ""build upon the situation"" and just pick items that work best in the moment, you're going to lose power. The reason as to why I say this is because although you can decide inside a game everything you want to build and when, you can't change your RUNES and MASTERIES. This is important because runes and masteries synergize with your items and give them more value; taking health percentage quints makes stacking health even more valuable and taking attack speed marks makes building ad even more beneficial. Sure, you can take armor quints and armor pen marks that may mimic the same benefits but that's beside the point. What everyone should take from this is that every champion which possess benefits from runes and masteries going into a game possess even more ""potential"" benefits from building certain items in a game. In this case scenario, let's consider an Irelia with attack speed marks and an Irelia with hybrid penetration marks ceteris paribus. If you would build Blade of the Ruined King on as Irelia, she would benefit from the item much more than h/pen Irelia because her additional attack speed lets her take advantage of the attack damage and lifesteal even more; the h/pen Irelia would only make use of the item passive which AS Irelia enjoys too but to a smaller extent. Therefore, we can conclude that if you INTEND to build a Blade of the Ruined King on Irelia, you would want to take AS marks over h/pen marks. However, consider a game where an AP champion on the enemy team gets fed. Say a Fiddlesticks just picked up a triple at 8 minutes and he's been running around causing scarecrow havoc all over the map. At this point our AS Irelia is thinking about ditching Blade of the Ruined King and taking Wit's End as the AS item after Triforce; she would save 600 gold, have 10% more attack speed and have up to 55 more magic resistance through mr steal. In all honesty, Irelia can choose to take that path and she might even win the game by picking that item but she lost power in her runes as she switched from Blade to Wit because the attack speed marks don't synergize as well with Wit's End than it did with Blade. Wit's End would give her no lifesteal and no attack damage to carry out the sustain physical damage and she would see her damage output transition to mostly magical damage which opens up a vulnerability to counter-play. However, if this were the h/pen Irelia in question, not only would she have a higher dps through an increased amount of resistance-shredding, but her damage output from her auto-attacks would be split almost evenly by physical and magical damage (and true damage when you count her w). Even though she would lose the 15% attack speed from the AS marks, Wit's End reduces the attack speed gap by 10 because it has 10% more attack speed than blade and the reduced attack damage will be compensated through the extra 8.1 armor penetration. In reality, this rune set-up and item choice will yield a slightly lower physical damage output if no other ad items have been built before it but less risk of counter-play. (And yes, we made sure that Fiddles got shut down &gt;:D ). The point is you can't just have one rune page set-up for a champion or one mastery page set-up for a champion (which is more common) just because it works ""in general"". I think we could be much more critical and analytical players if we can evaluate both team's compositions, decide on a build-path and then pick the runes and masteries which complement those decisions. And if anyone a situation arises in which you need to stray from your build-path, then make sure you only change the ORDER of those items because come late game almost everyone's equal in power and it just comes down to decision-making. Readers of this thread might think these numbers are too insignificant to matter but I'm sure I'm not the only person who let an enemy get away with 40, 25, 15 or even 1 hp. TL;DR runes and masteries matter yo "
147,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,A Comprehensive Jungle Revamp (because Live is abysmal) +2 new items,1,2x9f61,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2x9f61/a_comprehensive_jungle_revamp_because_live_is/,2015-02-27 05:57:16,"I'm fed up with the current state of the jungle. I originally believed we could be seeing a golden age of jungler diversity when the season changes were originally introduced. Subsequent nerfs, however, have killed the jungler selection to an all-time low. So low that you can ban out every S and A tier jungler completely. Since there are no B tier junglers, that leaves you with a cess pool of low health failure and abysmal clear times. --- First, let's analyze the problems and the goals. My observations on Tank junglers: * Slow clear times * Increased damage taken due to longer time in combat * Jungler items provide baseline sustain only, tanks have awful sustain itemization outside of 3000g+ purchases (e.g. no useful access to lifesteal) * Mana intensive due to clear times (need to use abilities to clear faster to stay healthy) * Mana intensive due to mitigation skills that must be used to stay healthy (Skarner W, Nautilus W), only in some cases * Worst tower pushing Now observations on AP junglers: * Moderate to slow clear times, excluding outliers (Nidalee) * AP champions have the least access to sustain itemization in the game (spellvamp sucks, especially against Krugs/Gromp/Red/Blue) * AP champions have lower health regen on average than any other character class excluding outliers (Evelynn, Heimerdinger) * AP ratios have poor uptime (5-8s cooldowns) and require resources to use (mana), unlike 100% AD ratio uptime * Mana regen is too low as squishy AP cannot conserve resources during clears * Most expensive itemization patterns (435g Amplifying Tome x1-3, 385g Fiendish Codex x1, 860g Blasting Wand x1) Lastly, some observations on AD junglers: * Fast clear times * Access to lifesteal, the best sustain mechanism * Can go full damage as damage translates into both sustain and clear time * Cheapest itemization patterns (360g Long Sword x2-4, 440g Vampiric Scepter x1, 450g Dagger x1-3, all on common recipes) * Best tower pushing **Now let's go over the goals for a successful jungle revamp:** * Improve tank jungler clear time by a moderate amount * Compensate tank junglers with additional sustain to account for lack of lifesteal and higher time in combat * Improve AP jungler clear time by a substantial amount, however... * Account for special cases where resourceless and high DPS AP junglers don't get out of control (Nidalee and Evelynn, looking at you, as well as potential from Cass and Karthus post-improvements) * Keep AD champions in roughly the same place as the trade-off mechanism between squishy damage vs. offensive bruiser is very healthy as-is * Slight buffs to player resilience in the jungle to improve diversity even among AD champions. --- Now for the big moment, the changes! * Smite upgrade items now cost 100g to exchange (down from 225g), and cause you to lose your existing charges of Smite and restart the cooldown &gt; The cost of exchanging was overnerfed in patch 5.4. This makes the tradeoff more about losing your Smite for a minute, and less about paying a tax in gold. * Increase Smite range from 500 to 750. * Health recovered from killing a monster camp increased 20% from live &gt; This small buff increases sustain while still giving vulnerability windows for counterjungling and ambushes. * Juggernaut enchant now gives the unique bonuses of Spiked Shell (below) * Magus enchant now gives the unique bonuses of Wriggle's Lantern (below) &gt; New items, below. :) * Bladed Armor mastery (tier 2 defense) now provides additional damage equal to 1% of the player's bonus health over 2 seconds. &gt; An early-game improvement to tank junglers that invest in health early. Sightstone, Spiked Shell, masteries and runes. --- And now on to the item updates! **Hunter's Machete** +15 Gold on Large Monster Kill UNIQUE - JUNGLER: Deals 30 **(+20% AP)** magic damage to monsters on hit over 2 seconds and gain 7 Health Regen and ~~3~~ **5** Mana Regen per second in combat with monsters. &gt; Adding an AP ratio increases damage for AP junglers as well as AP off-tanks. Slightly better mana regen that promotes blue buff independence. &amp;nbsp; **Poacher's Knife** 400g +30 Gold on Large Monster Kill UNIQUE: Upgrades Smite to Scavenging Smite. If Scavenging Smite is used on a large monster in the enemy's jungle, the recharge timer is halved. Upon killing the affected monster, you gain 20 bonus gold and 175% bonus movement speed that decays over 2 seconds, **and leaving behind a visible ward (1 health) that lasts 30 seconds.** UNIQUE - JUNGLER: Deals 45 **(+30% AP)** magic damage to monsters on hit over 2 seconds and gain 10 Health Regen and ~~5~~ **8** Mana Regen per second in combat with monsters. &gt; Adding the ward gives a tangible team benefit to counterjungling - knowing the position of the enemy jungler for a snapshot of time. Also gives the poaching jungler a great sense of satisfaction watching his opponent suffer and clear the tiny minion/ward. &gt; Increased AP ratio and mana regen on all upgraded jungler items. &amp;nbsp; **Ranger's Trailblazer** 400g +30 Gold on Large Monster Kill UNIQUE: Upgrades Smite to Blasting Smite. Blasting Smite deals 50% splash damage to all surrounding minions and monsters and stuns all damaged units for 1.5 seconds. If cast on a monster, you will also restore 15% of your missing health and mana. UNIQUE - JUNGLER: Deals 45 **(+30% AP)** magic damage to monsters on hit over 2 seconds and gain ~~10~~ **14** Health Regen and ~~5~~ **11** Mana Regen per second in combat with monsters. &gt; This is the sustain choice, as such it should have a clear identity. This makes it much more powerful for keeping healthy in clears/farming, even later into the game. &amp;nbsp; **Skirmisher's Sabre** 400g +30 Gold on Large Monster Kill UNIQUE: Upgrades Smite to Challenging Smite. Challenging Smite can target enemy champions, marking them for 6 seconds. Marked enemies are revealed (does not reveal stealth), **and have 3 charges of Exposed. Your basic attacks consume a charge of Exposed and deal (20 + 3.5  level) true damage. Exposed targets deal 20% less damage to you.** ~~take (54 + 6  level) true damage over 3 seconds from your basic attacks and deal 20% reduced damage to you.~~ UNIQUE - JUNGLER: Deals 45 (+30% AP) magic damage to monsters on hit over 2 seconds and gain 10 Health Regen and ~~5~~ **8** Mana Regen per second in combat with monsters. &gt; Overnerfed after 4.20 and the dominance of Weedwick, this shifts the power from being an abysmal true damage over time, to promoting fast triple-hit combos for strong burst. Also bakes in interesting counterplay where the enemy champion can counterattack after the Exposed stacks are consumed, when they are no longer debuffed. &amp;nbsp; **Stalker's Blade** 400g +30 Gold on Large Monster Kill UNIQUE: Upgrades Smite to Chilling Smite. Chilling Smite can be cast on enemy champions, ~~dealing true damage and~~ stealing 20% of their movement speed for 2 seconds. ~~Chilling Smite has 500 range.~~ UNIQUE - JUNGLER: Deals 45 **(+30% AP)** magic damage to monsters on hit over 2 seconds and gain 10 Health Regen and ~~5~~ **8** Mana Regen per second in combat with monsters. &gt; With burst ranged true damage, this clearly outclasses Skirmisher's on almost every champion. Remove the damage and make this purely a crowd-control option. --- **Spiked Shell** (replaces Kindlegem in Juggernaut recipe, built from Ruby Crystal) 925g +200 health +10% cooldown reduction UNIQUE - SPIKED DEFENSE: On being hit by basic attacks from a Monster, return 15 + (3% bonus health) physical damage to the attacker. UNIQUE: Whenever a Monster dies near you, you heal for 2% of its maximum health over 5 seconds. &gt; This is the tank item that has been long overdue. At a reasonably low price point this improves tank clear speed substantially even at lower bonus health. With a miniature Trundle passive, it also improves the sustain mechanism for tanks in a late-game scaling way, but doesn't provide immediate burst healing that would negatively impact ambushing the tank in their own jungle. &amp;nbsp; **Wriggle's Lantern** (replaces Fiendish Codex in Magus recipe, built from Amplifying Tome) 925g +50 AP UNIQUE: Dealing magic damage against Monsters causes them to burn for an additional 40% of that damage over 3 seconds, this damage starts lower and ramps up over time. This effect does not stack on the same monster. &gt; Bringing back a classic with a revamped purpose, Wriggle's Lantern gives AP champions a significant boost in damage output, but with some interesting conditions. Because the damage is over 3 seconds, as well as non-stacking, this promotes using abilities **less** while still receiving significant boosts in damage. For higher CD APs like Diana this will have little effect - she can use her lower ranked abilities (W) first, then end with Q and let it burn. For lower CD APs like Nidalee and Evelynn, this prevents their already potent burst from getting out-of-control with a 40% increase in damage. &gt; In addition, because spell spamming is less effective with this item, it lowers the mana that AP junglers need to expend to effectively dispatch camps - leaving additional mana for ganks and ambush retaliation. --- I believe that this gamut of changes, while a bit pie-in-the-sky, is a major step in improving the jungle situation for all junglers. Promoting a new level of diversity that we haven't seen to date, while also improving some of Riot's initial concepts in the variance of jungler items and enchants. To summarize the full set of changes: * New tank jungler item that scales damage/clear speed based on the tank's defensive stats * New AP jungler item that scales damage/clear speed for the AP, while promoting a less mana-intensive clear * Nerfs to Chilling Smite to dethrone it as the de facto standard for late game * Buffs to Scavenging Smite to improve its benefit to the entire team, not just a negative for the enemy jungler * Buffs to Challenging Smite to improve up-front burst and make it the more clear-cut option for damage and duelist junglers * Increase overall sustain in the jungle, a little bit more health, quite a bit more mana "
148,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,"Suggestion for a way to (at least somewhat) balance Vi: The tanky, bursty, sustained damage, cc-heavy, mobile 1 girl wrecking crew",0,2xljgt,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2xljgt/suggestion_for_a_way_to_at_least_somewhat_balance/,2015-03-02 08:16:19,"**Context** Vi seems like an oppressively strong jungler right now, let's have a look at her strengths: * Naturally tanky via passive and her standard builds add to this further * Can build bruiser and still deal as much damage as some assassins * Burst damage with Q E and R * Sustained damage due to being AD and W * Long range hard CC * 2 Gap closers * % Health shred to melt tanks * Enough scaling on Q E and R to be able to perform 1 shot combos on squishies later in the game ...You get the idea **Analysis** The problem with Vi is that **there is no situation in which she is a bad or risky pick**. Her jungle clear is fast, her damage is reliable and she has fairly easy to land cc (Q) **and** guaranteed CC (R). Vi has the best of both worlds in other words. She is effective against tanks and squishies, AP or AD it doesn't matter. Her kit also offers very reliable engage and some good disengage. **Potential Solutions** I think everyone knows that Vi is due a nerf, the question is: how can some of her oppressive strength be tamed without completely gutting her kit? My Suggestions (Could be just one of these or a selection) **Disable Vi's passive for X seconds after using her ultimate** This would make her think twice about how she engages and make it easier for her to be bursted down if she ults into a bad position or onto a champion who can escape (haha like anyone can escape Vi right now). I like this one because she retains her strength, but has to take on some vulnerability as well. **Nerf E** Vi's E currently deals bonus damage equal to 5-65(+1.15 Total AD)(0.7AP). If this was changed from total AD to bonus AD scaling, it could be balanced so that damage builds would do the same or more damage but tankier builds would have reduced damage overall. To me this makes sense because building tank items should take away some burst power from the champion in exchange for survivability. **Nerf her Passive** A flat decrease in the % scaling (it's currently 10% max hp shield every 18-8 seconds) OR make it scale with level rather than her max HP (like Yasuo's passive shield) **Add a punishment for missing Q** This would be a nerf to her utility rather than her damage. Vi could suffer an increased cooldown on her Q if she failed to hit any targets. This reduces her disengage potential while at the same time making Vi players think more carefully about how they use their Q to engage and during teamfights. (This is the same as how Thresh's hook now operates) **Let's wrap this up** So there you have it, I've highlighted my concerns about Vi, and some potential solutions. I'd love to hear if anyone else has ideas on how she could be balanced better. I formed these opinions not just by looking at her champion.gg winrate but by actually playing vs her. P.S This is my first ever Reddit post - I've lurked for quite a long time now and love the community so be nice to me if my suggestions are bad! Peace"

I hope this gets popular so we can discuss the balance issues :) . Lotnex is a assassin/fighter who is probably best as a jungler or top laner. He is the master of the escape so his abilities will give him an easy way to escape an unfavourable situation. Lotnex is also a good ganker due to his stealth abilities and can be a good chaser as well. His weaknesses are pink wards and vulnerability in teamfights. He is supposed to be simple to play and I feel like his abilities are very simple to use yet can potentially be difficult to master and also involve some decision making. Passive: Flee To Safety Lotnex gains 60% movement speed for 2 seconds whenever his HP drops below 20%. This can occur once every 120 seconds. Q - Sleight Of Hand - Cooldown: 18/17/16/15/14 seconds Cost: 50/60/65/70/75 mana Lotnex instantly becomes invisible for the next 3/4/5/6/7 seconds or until he attacks or uses a spell. Lotnex gains maximum attack speed for 2/2.5/3/3.5/4 seconds after coming out of stealth. W - Elusive - Cooldown: 15/15/15/15/15 seconds Cost: 50/50/50/50/50 mana Passive: Lotnex gains permament 5/7.5/10/12.5/15% bonus movement speed. Active: Lotnex gains 40% movement speed for 4 seconds. His next basic attack blinds the target for 1.5 seconds and applies a debuff. The debuff lasts for 3 seconds and amplifies all damage that Lotnex deals to the target by 10/12.5/15/17.5/20%. Lotnex loses the passive movement speed from Elusive while this abillity is on cooldown. E - Trick Or Treat - Cooldown: 17/15/13/11/9 seconds Cost: 80/90/100/110/120 mana Lotnex leaves an invisible dummy at the same location he's standing at that lasts for 45 seconds or until activated. Enemies that walk within 200 units of the dummy activate the dummy and recieve 90/140/190/235/285 (+ 0.9 bonus AD) (+120% AP) magic damage while remaining rooted in place for 1 second. R - Track/Nimble Feet - Cooldown: 60/50/40 seconds cost: 100/100/100 mana Track - cast on enemy: Lotnex tracks the movement of an enemy champion for the next 5/6/7 seconds gaining true sight and slowing their movement speed by 15/30/45% for the duration. Nimble Feet - cast on self: Lotnex turns invisible, gains 15/30/45% movement speed and 20/30/40 HP regen per second for the next 5/6/7 seconds. Cast Range: 1000 P.S the CD on the ult is probably too short lol."
150,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Veigar on the Deathfire Grasp removal,0,2sg0ui,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2sg0ui/veigar_on_the_deathfire_grasp_removal/,2015-01-15 08:35:55,"First of all, I think Veigar will heavily suffer from the removal of DFG. All of veigar's burst depends on the DFG early game to effectively kill the opponent. Failure to do so results in almost no mana and a massive phase of vulnerability before regaining mana again. Since they already officially said DFG is going to be removed, I think all the champs that heavily rely on DFG should gain some sort of compensation. I think removing the item though is a mistake to be honest as it removes item diversity from the game on champs with not that many scaling abilities. It also throws the meta into a set position of champs that don't require DFG. **TL;DR: removal of DFG messes up veigar's early to mid game and also throws mid lane into a meta of champs that dont rely on Deathfire Grasp.**"
151,vulnerability,leagueoflegends,Response to Tentative Katarina Changes,1500,2t0e77,http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2t0e77/response_to_tentative_katarina_changes/,2015-01-20 14:09:34,"[Tentative changes are posted here](URL Hello there, I'm a Katarina main who's played her for 5 years and have ended every ranked season as one of the top 200 players in North America. I've been watching Katarina for a while and have agreed with most of the changes Riot has made. In the past Riot has asked Scarra and me for our inputs regarding the pre and post rework of Katarina. I've even had a hand in some of the recent changes to Katarina. I have no idea why they don't ask for some input now especially with another rework in mind. Unless of course if they know Katarina better than we do then they're free to do as they please. My main issue with these changes is that it provides absolutely no theme for Katarina. She isn't an AOE mage, she isn't an assassin, she isn't a viable melee DPS either. Here is my input on each change. *** **General Changes (Increasing Auto Attack Responsiveness)** *** Providing extra attack speed for a champion that doesn't even benefit off auto attacks. Katarina must build AD if she wants to have reliable auto attacks. Even with these changes AP is still a better buy over AD on Katarina. Assuming that Katarina gets half her ult off (It's never good to assume that you get a full ult on Katarina) Katarina has a 2.2 AP Ratio (2.6 if she has gunblade) and a 3.75 AD ratio (assuming W is already maxed out). I can spend 1600 on 80 AP or 1550 on 50 AD, in terms of overall damage I get 208 AP damage vs 187.5 AD. Keep this in mind, the old Katarina had a 5.0 AD ratio ultimate and a .8 AD ratio Bouncing blades. According to Phreak post rework 3 years ago (I have decent memory): ***AD Katarina plays no differently from AP Katarina. One's just mathematically going to be stronger.*** I did some digging and found the post, feel free to go through the Riot posts which agreed that AP &gt; AD in the past. [Click here for Phreak's Response](URL *** **Q - Bouncing Blades Changes** *** They ""buffed"" bouncing blades by decreasing damage on the initial Q and buffing the Q proc. This might seem like a decent change, of which it is for mid/late game. But it is a nerf to the already weak lane phase that Katarina has. She has very limited exchange power against nearly every single match up mid for two reasons: her cooldowns are longer and her damage is lower. Her only advantage is a manaless Q ranged spam of which is becoming even weaker with these changes. W - Sinister Steel Changes This is a buff to anyone building AD on Katarina and a nerf to anyone building AP on Katarina. Refer to the aforementioned AP &gt; AD. *** **E - Shunpo Changes** *** No more damage, which means even less assassination potential for receiving resets. 15 Second cooldown but 80% CDR against certain champions, this is still a 3 second cooldown, giving you 1.5 seconds of vulnerability. But this is a complete nerf to shunpo warding or hopping onto minions for escapes. More damage reduction, of which is still only 1.5 seconds, which is helpful if you're playing Katarina as an assassin and only need 1.5 seconds OR have another champion to jump to after the 1.5 second cooldown. Auto attack is reset, this is only useful again if Katarina goes an AD build. *** Here is the issue with all of this, there are no items Katarina can buy that would work well. Gunblade is ""hybrid"" but it's active scales off AP, if you get AP then your Sinister Steel and auto attacks becomes weaker. Rageblade doesn't work with Katarina channeling her ultimate, and Lichbane is in the same boat as Gunblade since it doesn't scale with AD. This is the type of Katarina that I think the designer is aiming for. A melee DPS Katarina, reliant on spamming W's alongside auto attacks for damage and shunpo for mobility once her Ultimate is on cooldown. With such a ""low cd"" shunpo and a ""reliable"" damage source from Sinister Steel and auto attacks, Katarina doesn't have to rely on resets as much. She'll be ""even easier"" to play than before. Here's the kicker; does the designer honestly think that she'll be able to function on the same level as Jax, Irelia, Xin Zhao, Lee Sin, Wukong, Yasuo, Akali etc? This new Katarina is seems like the less fortunate cousin of Akali, who does literally everything better aside from AOE and actually has items she can buy. The only single thing that I see Katarina has over other champions is higher mobility, which is kind of pointless if you don't even hit hard. *** **TL;DR** These changes turn Katarina into a weak Melee DPS that is worse than every other viable Melee DPS. She also has absolutely no items that work well with her kit now. I understand that these are tentative changes and there's probably a lot more going on that I don't know about. But this is my tentative response to these tentative changes."

153,cybersecurity,leagueoflegends,"[Analysis] Riot's concerns about the game before season 6, and why dynamic queue wasn't the solution.",1254,4m0jtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/4m0jtl/analysis_riots_concerns_about_the_game_before/,2016-06-01 20:18:49,"I'm Charlie, engineer in cybersecurity, quantum physics enthusiast and gamer before all that. In game I'm MadWard, avid support and ranked team player on EuW, diamond since season 4. I stopped playing 2 months ago due to the absence of Ranked Team, because it was the only true competitive queue for me (and, to be honest, the matches were quite thrilling there). I'm here to talk about the (valid) problems League was facing before the start of season 6, and why dynamic queue was nowhere near being the solution to them. If you agree/disagree or simply have anything else to say about the following, please feel free to comment. &amp;nbsp; **Before season 6: Riot's concerns about the game and their answer to them.** &amp;nbsp; **Concern #1:** League is a team game, and we should do something to emphasize this aspect in our client. This is actually accurate: while League is a team-oriented game, it only feels so in championships (CS, LCS, IEM and worlds). While playing solo/duo ranked, the game feels way different. The assumption that we should **encourage** (and not **force**, the wording is important :')) people to play as a team makes sense. **Concern #2:** People are telling us they want to play competitively with their friends, but never succeed gathering 5 people together for team ranked. Again, very true. As a ranked team player, I can tell that even with a somewhat stable team, getting everyone online at the same hour to play some team rankeds was a pain in the arse, and we often ended up not playing at all, or going in ARAM/normal game. &amp;nbsp; **Riot's solution: let's simply allow people to queue in ranked with however many people they want. This way, the game feels more team-oriented and people can play with their friends.** &amp;nbsp; Sad thing is: this solution doesn't solve either of the above concerns. **About the first one**:  matching a 3-man premade with 2 solo players against two 2-man premades and one solo player, for example, doesn't feel any more team-oriented at all. Groups have a tendency to play with their entourage instead of going out of their way to reach solo players, so this system actually raises more barriers between players. **About the second one**:  The ranking has lost every meaning it had: you can't rank solo players in the same ladder as 5-man-team players and expect it to have any meaning whatsoever. League is a COMPLETELY **different game** whether you play it alone or as a team, and you wouldn't rank people playing different games in the same ladder now, would you? &amp;nbsp; **What could/should have been.** &amp;nbsp; What the game needed was a better team ranked system with an **in-game team search feature**. ""3 friends looking for adc and support to build a competitive ranked team""-&gt;invite, and let's go. The wonderful thing about that is that the adc and support, who might be solo players, will be **willing to** play with the 3-man premade. They create a team/join an existing one, and we're off on an adventure ! If it doesn't work, we say goodbye to each other and find another two players. If it does, we continue playing team rankeds in order to improve as 5, and may be participate in online tournaments/LANs. Along with a better matchmaking, this could have been the competitive team game people (Riot, I, and many others) were longing for, a game where you improve as a team against people who want the same thing. At the same time, people who wanted to improve alone could freely go in solo queue. &amp;nbsp; **Why an inadequate system came to light.** &amp;nbsp; When analyzing a problem, you always want to get to the **root cause** of the problem, otherwise you just end up duct-tapeing it instead of fixing it for good. This is what happened with dynamic queue: instead of realizing the problem was in the team ranked system itself, Riot fixed the ""can't get people to play team ranked with"" problem with ""let's just allow people to go ranked as 2-3-4-5, yolo"". To me, this is mainly because Riot has lost a lot of its communication with the players, as if they were stranded on an island of algorithms without playing the game. Obviously, this isn't totally true, but the ""company basing its decisions on player feedback"" is definitely a thing of the past, and doesnt seem to be coming back any time soon. &amp;nbsp; **Conclusion** &amp;nbsp; I sincerely think that the **team ranked system** was supposed to be the competitive mode, but instead of being improved, it got deleted for a weird melting pot which fully satisfies no one. There was something truly motivating in getting 5 people together to improve as a team, and I'm sure anyone who really tried team ranked will agree with me. As of today, we all know Riot won't reconsider their decision, as it would be admitting their cherished system was a mistake, but I sure hope this game will come back stronger someday, because I actually had fun when I was playing this (especially ranked teams). This was to give a little insight about my views on what happened, and your comments on this are very welcome !"
