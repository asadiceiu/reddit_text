Employees avoid confrontation and instead move companies. The negative impact a bad manager can have on an employee, both with productivity and emotionally. Organizations with the best employee video communication in the world still lose valuable workers and mid-level managers due to terrible bosses. Here are four archetypes of bad bosses that send talented employees running for the hills and torpedo the best employee retention efforts. **Here are the 5 types of bad bosses that make employees want to quit companies:** **1) Narcissist:** These managers care about self-promotion more than the staff. They take all the credit for an accomplishment and point the finger when things go wrong. These boss will take credit for many things you work hard on, but others will eventually realize your boss is not doing the heavy lifting. If you are happy with your current role and want to stay at the company, humour this type of boss. To satisfy these bosses, keep them informed on all communication you have with their boss and your clients. Thank them constantly for their help and advice. **2) Superman:** &gt;""Leaders who don't listen will eventually be surrounded by people who have nothing to say."" ~Andy Stanley This breed of manager thinks the organisation revolves around them. This trap includes making all of the decisions solos, ignoring feedback you don't like and taking the credit. Letting your ego get ahead of you and think you know it all is a sure path to failure. Showing some vulnerability allows you to strengthen relations with your team. Admit what you dont know. **3) The Iron Fist:** Arrive at 8:01 instead of 8:00? This boss is already writing a report. Take three bathroom breaks instead of two in a day? The Iron Fist is rewriting the rules to prevent that as we speak. When the Iron Fist is in charge, employees will work exactly as the boss prefers whether or not its reasonable or practical. A little flexibility and trust in an employee go a long way. Conversely, telling employees that you trust them so little they cant be five minutes late once in a while is a great way to turn your office into a breeding ground of resentment. Very few bosses show empathy towards their team members and this helps improve overall morale and performance. **4) Ghost:** These bosses say they care about employee development but are never there for coaching and support. They aren't responsive via phone, and emails from them are brief and sporadic. They don't give frequent feedback and are rarely around to answer questions. Lack of direction can be frustrating, but its a chance for you to excel. You have the autonomy to prove you can execute on well-thought-out decisions without micromanagement. Be resourceful and find different ways to get the information and answers. If you get no responses from one boss, find someone else to greenlight your decision. As a result, you can build relationships with people outside of your immediate teams. **5) King Kong:** These type of managers possess a superiority complex and like to draw the distinction between management and staff. When some managers reach the top, they immediately forget where they came from. Its dreadful to work under a manager whos more worried about pushing their weight around. Great leaders dont talk down to their employees or make them feel inferior. They respect everyone and make everyone feel important. A bad boss creates fear and makes work drudgery. Studies show having a bad boss increases a workers chance of having a heart attack by as much as 60 percent due to the stress and anxiety caused by unfeasible targets, lack of support, unfair practices and threats of punishment. The world is littered with managers but there are very few leaders. Employees long for bosses who are leaders. "

[Smartphone OS Market Share, 2015 Q2](URL With 80% of the world's smartphone users now on the [Android](URL platform, this makes adopting and understanding a [security policy](URL more important than it has ever been. &gt; Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work. There are just too many cooks in the kitchen: Google releases Android to OEMs (Samsung, LG, HTC, etc), OEMs can change things and release code to carriers (ATT, Verizon, etc), carriers can change things and release code to consumers. It's been broken for years. What this means is if you have an Android device made by Samsung running on Verizon's network, you will need to wait for Google to fix a vulnerability, and then Samsung to implement the fix on your specific device, and then Verizon to implement and send out the fix to you. This can take up to several months, and in many cases will never get fixed at all. Compare this to when a security vulnerability is detected on Apple's iOS, which can be fixed and sent to your device within hours. Let's look at one of the [dozens of security vulnerabilities](URL that has [hit Android](URL just this year. Three of the biggest ones have been found just [in the last 30 days](URL One of these is called ***[Stagefright](URL [Percent of Android Users Who Might Get an Update](URL The reaction the Stagefright, a vulnerability that affects **95% of Android devices** and can allow a remote arbitrary code execution **just by receiving a malicious MMS**, is an example of how terrible things are with Android and security. Google, Samsung, and LG have all pledged to ""Take Security Seriously"" and issue a fix as soon as possible. The problem is that their fix will be to patch **2.6% of all active Android devices**. That doesn't guarantee that those 2.6% of users lucky enough to get updates will take the time to install that update, or for that matter even be lucky enough to have their carrier make it available to them. That 2.6% is a best case scenario. That's the percentage of Android devices that are running Android 5.1 today, nearly five months after the OS was released. This is an obvious problem for offices that allow employees to bring their own devices to use on the company's network. So what can you do to ensure your office environment is safe? Ensure you have a security policy, and make sure your employees understand it. Make sure you understand the [attack vectors](URL in the hardware you and your employees are using. Consider investing in equipment secured by things like[virus protection on a hardware level](URL [full disk encryption](URL and [image overwrite](URL [IPsec](URL [802.1x encryption](URL etc. With Android making up such a huge percentage of the mobile marketplace, and many of your employees bringing their smartphones into the office, make sure you consider some of these basic measures to ensure your office remains secure."

Cybercrime ended up costing $3 trillion dollars to the commercial sector in 2015. This number is expected to cross $6 trillion by 2021. More to the fact that cybercrimes are the fastest growing crimes in the US; in that, fraudsters are increasingly enhancing and advancing ways to compromise a businesss cybersecurity measures. All these figures and the gravity of the situation requires enterprises and governments to take a more proactive than reactive approach to avert frauds and cyber attacks. The rise of ID verification systems, in particular, can play an important role in having a productive economic impact for businesses by not just helping to curb fraud but also reducing expenditures. &amp;#x200B; URL However, fraud prevention is not the only plus side of having an identity verification system. An online identification system can help reduce costs, ultimately increasing revenues for a business. It also enables businesses to meet their compliance and regulatory requirement, which they are bound to fulfil by law. Thus, identification systems can potentially save trillions of dollars for the online marketplace. ## A Decrease in Transactional and Admin Costs Both the financial services sector, as well as commercial businesses, have generally relied on outdated manual or legacy systems for transactions and payment systems. Such methods are costly and, not to mention, unsafe considering the current fraud landscape. Compared with digital identity systems, in-person identity verification can also be costly for the business as well as the consumer. For instance, if a person wishing to open a bank account needs to present a certain set of identity documents for the bank to ensure that the person has legitimate and verifiable credentials. Having to verify their identity in-person has both time and monetary costs for a consumer, not to mention that each visit costs the financial institute $4.25. Compared to this, a digital identification system allows a person to authenticate their document and other credentials electronically, thus saving them both time and money Not to mention the fact that a single mobile transaction costs only $0.10. Thus, the customer onboarding process can be made more efficient through an automated ID verification service. Eliminating the need for paper-based verification procedures for each individual client, it can greatly reduce the time for onboarding a new customer. ## Preventing Fraud Through ID Verification As discussed above, online frauds are the bane of an online enterprise or a financial institutions existence. The sort of losses they incur to businesses can be detrimental. The costs of identity theft alone were reaching $221 billion worldwide. The financial sector or the online market cannot afford such losses. A sound online identification system, being fast and effective, can allow a business to detect fraud while it takes place, thus preventing any chargebacks or fines. A bank or financial institute can verify their clients during the onboarding process and make sure they have legitimate documents and other credentials. For an online business, an [identity verification system](URL allows merchants to identify fraudsters who are using fake or stolen credit cards or identity documents. &amp;#x200B; URL Another major fraud risk is synthetic identity fraud, wherein the criminal generally uses someones social security number to build an identity for him/herself. An effective ID verification software can also alleviate synthetic identity fraud. Also, by increasing cooperation between national databases and the private sector can help eliminate the use of fake credentials and identities altogether. ## Reducing Compliance Costs Sectors that are closely regulated including the financial services sector, online payment systems and the healthcare industry. In an effort to develop a framework that meets their regulatory obligations, they have to invest in ample resources. However, with slow and ineffective ID verification systems, their compliance costs are only susceptible to increase. Such businesses are not only in need of preventing fraud and reducing transactional and onboarding costs, but they are also legally bound to fulfil certain compliance requirements. Governments and regulatory authorities issue guidelines for businesses to implement in order to curb financial crimes like money laundering. Such obligations need to be fulfilled by businesses efficiently. &amp;#x200B; The financial services sector spends greatly on building effective compliance structures. However, manual procedures for verification have proven to be ineffective and slow. Implementing an automated system for customer due diligence and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance can not only reduce costs for businesses but also effectively reduce financial crimes. It is also prudent to mention that companies that fail to implement adequate KYC and AML procedures have to face hefty fines from regulatory bodies, both national and international. Thus, implementing an effective online ID verification system can avoid these costs for a business as well."

One of the largest issues with modern small to medium sized businesses are their neglect of information security. My passion is to help businesses grow aware of major threats to their employees and to present solutions to meet their security needs. Here are 3 basic practices I recommend you start with to begin protecting your business. 1. **Never Directly Click on Email Links or Download Unknown Documents** Let's say your coworker sends you an email with a random invoice for an order you don't remember. He is requesting you take a look at it to see if all of the details are correct on your order. Naturally curious, you would likely open the document and unknowingly download some type of malware onto your system. This is called a phishing attempt. This happens when a hacker pretends to be someone else in order to get you to give your information or download something so they can take it themselves. The best thing you can do to prevent this is to always be paranoid. If you didn't directly request the document, contact the sender and confirm they were the one who sent it. If they sent you a link, copy and paste the link location directly into your browser to confirm it is directing you to the right destination. Lastly, if everything else checks out, look at the email address to see if it looks right (eg. TSullivam@(company).com.ru probably isn't someone you want to get email from). 2. **Get a Password Manager and Use Complex Passwords** A little over a month ago, Mark Zuckerberg's twitter account got hacked. It wasn't because someone directly hacked into his account, but instead it was because he used the same, easy password (dadada) on a less secure site. But, he is not alone. In a recent survey, LastPass showed that 59% of Americans users re-use the same passwords for multiple sites. This security gap can be easily prevented creating different passwords for each site and using a password manager to store them all. Nowadays, security professionals recommend 10 characters minimum with upper, lower, digits, and special characters. While this may seem daunting, most password managers are designed to not only securely store your passwords but generate them for you. Some also fill in the passwords for you, making the process all the more easy. 3. **Avoid Using Public Wi-Fi** Public Wi-Fi is the bane of security. Information sent and relieved over public Wi-Fi is completely unecrypted, readily available for anyone one on the network to see. This means that when you are at that favorite coffee shop of yours, all of the banking , social media, and business information you access while on their public Wi-Fi is readily available to be read and captured. Some websites are beginning to implement HTTPS, thereby countering the attacks hackers are doing on the network, but most are not, leaving you open to attack. One solution is to simply avoid using public Wi-Fi hotspots. Instead, use cellular data and encrpyted Wi-Fi connections (the ones that require a password). If you must use public Wi-Fi, get a VPN, specifically one the uses SSL as its main protocol.
