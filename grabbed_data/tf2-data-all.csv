I joined a server, and soon there's six mics blasting some noisy shit, including my own. Then I get kicked off the server with an error stating ""Net overflow"". I've heard that TF2 has had problems before with Remote Code Execution attacks, meaning there's a vulnerability allowing the server host to do what ever they want with the players' computers. Was this that type of attack? Or something else? If indeed he enabled my microphone, that's pretty serious."
1,vulnerability,tf2,My personal suggestion for weapon changes (It is a very long list),1,ibbvb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/ibbvb5/my_personal_suggestion_for_weapon_changes_it_is_a/,2020-08-17 20:48:42,"Info : HU stands for Hammer units, the default measuring system in Source games Scout * Baby Faces Blaster * Increased damage requirement for full boost from 100 to 150 (2 damage per % to 3 damage per %) * Increased damage requirement to remove full boost from 25 to 100 (1 damage for 4% to 1 damage per %) * Decreased Multi-Jump penalty from -75% boost to -50% boost per multi-jump * These changes aim to make the BFB a more reliable weapon by giving players more boost to escape from dangerous situations at the cost of doing more damage * Flying Guillotine * Added stat : * Crits on Bleeding players * The Guillotine thrives as being a combo weapon. This addition allows it to combo with another Scout weapon; the Wrap Assassin * The Sandman * Weapon rework: * Baseball now makes any enemy it hits Mark-For-Dead for 1 - 7 seconds (depending on the range of which the baseball was thrown) * Marking another player removes it on any other player it was previously marked on * Baseball regenerates after 10 seconds * \-15 health on wearer * This change will allow players to pick targets from a distance and allow them to close in on their target quick enough to deal extra damage for a short period of time * The Fan O War * Weapon rework: * While weapon is active: * Weapon holsters 100% slower * Weapon deploys 50% slower * The rework done to the Sandman was done so that you didnt need to get close to a target to Mark-For-Dead. As such, the change to this weapon aims to make it act like a shield for the player. The holstering and deploying penalties make sure that the player cant have resistances at ease, making them vulnerable when switching to the attack Soldier * Righteous Bison: * Increased base damage from 20 to 28 (+40%) * After the changes in Jungle Inferno, the Bison was reverted to its previous stats. However, due to some complications with the new particle and hitbox mechanics release during the same update, its damage was drastically reduced compared to its Meet Your Match counterpart. This increase in damage aims to offset the changes and make it more viable * Concheror * Increased Rage requirement from 480 to 500 * Rage can now be gained from simply regenerating health at a rate of 1 unit per health point * This change to the Conch aims to give it a way to be passively filled, so when using it on other playstyles where the primary weapon is not the main source of damage, the meter can still be charged up. If the soldier were to solely charge it up passively, it would take approximately 2  minutes to fill up * Mantreads * 75% less fall damage on wearer * The Mantreads were only really paired with the Rocket Jumper since it dealt no damage. This change aims to make the Mantreads more versatile when paired with other rocket launchers Pyro * Gas Passer * Recharge duration decreased from 60 seconds to 45 seconds (-25%) * Recharge damage decreased from 750 to 600 (-20%) * Gas cloud duration increased from 5 seconds to 8 seconds (+63%) * Coated enemies are now considered wet * The changes done here are to allow the gas passer to be used as a more reliable short-term area denial tool, as previously it was not very effective. Additionally, it can now be combined with the Neon Annihilator * Third Degree * Damage reduced from 65 to 46 (-30%) * 20% slower firing speed * Deals Critical hits to overhealed targets * The Third Degree was a very difficult weapon to use as, even if you did manage to get in range and hit a Medic and his healing target, your 65 damage would not be enough to kill them. This change allows you deal a lot of damage on recently healed patients while also giving you a chance to take out a Medic just by hitting his patient Demoman Heavy * Buffalo Steak Sandvich * Removed 20% damage vulnerability * Restores 100 health * Cannot be dropped to other players * Cannot be replenished by health packs * The changes done to this weapon are done with the aim of promoting a new type of playstyle for heavy players, allowing them to rush in and rush out of danger quickly at the cost of not being able to support their team with health packs Engineer * Wrangler * Removed shield resistances and repairs penalty * Reduced Sentry disable time from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds (-50%) * When weapon is active: * \+66% resistance to all damage types on wearer if they have an active sentry gun * \+10% resistance to all damage types on wearer if they do not have an active sentry gun * \-100% self damage from sentry * The changes done to the wrangler are so that it becomes less annoying to fight against. The fact that all an engineer needed to do was to draw this weapon to effectively triple their sentry guns health was simply too powerful. The changes here are to give the engineer more survivability options when playing with their sentry gun will also give them a way out should things not work out for him. (Also : UnCLe DaNe sAiD WRanGLeR wAs tOo poWerFuLL) Medic * All syringe guns: * \+10% projectile speed (990 HU/s to 1080 HU/s) * Projectiles travel slightly slower than a normal Soldier rocket (1100 HU/s) * \+20% firing speed (from 0.1 to 0.08) * 100 DPS to 125 DPS * \-25% clip size (from 40 to 30) * 20% slower switch speed * Weapon reloads automatically if holstered * Medics had very little to choose between in the primary weapon department. These changes to the other syringe guns aim to make them slightly better at last resort damage when a Medic is left vulnerable * Overdose * Speed boost is now passive * To make this weapon a more admirable choice, making the speed boost passive would allow it to be used in conjunction with the Vita Saw as a way to get to the front lines faster. * Solemn Vow * Weapon rework * While active: * Weapon holsters 50% slower Sniper * All sniper rifles: * Quickscopes, or quick scoped headshots, done within 20% of charge on the snipers rifle deal only 110 damage * For reference, here are some numbers: Spy * Ambassador * Headshots between 0 - 1200 HU (0 - 22.86m) deal 102 damage * Headshots between 1200 - 2000 HU (22.86 - 38.1m) deal 101-54 damage * Headshots beyond 2000 HU deals 52 damage * The Ambassador was changed due to the belief that the weapon had made Spy a diet Sniper. The changes made to the weapon aims to reward a spy for being able to hit a shot at long range, rewarding spies for hitting headshots at longer ranges without turning him into a sniper. * Enforcer * Damage now pierces through sapper armour * \+33% damage vs buildings * The Enforcers new upside aim to make it a building buster gun, allowing a Spy to take down a sentry gun and other buildings by themselves more efficiently * Diamondback * Cannot use crits when firing from being disguised * Comparing this weapon to the other Free Crits weapon the Frontier Justice, you could never see the Critical Hit coming, and you would be caught unprepared. This change aims to make it a little more easier to fight against by making sure you see the crit coming * Red Tape Recorder * Weapon rework: * \-50% damage to buildings * Once applied to a building: * The Red Tape recorder was a very underwhelming weapon to use over the other sapper. This change aims to make it a beacon so that teammates know where a sentry is currently located and how fortified it is."

After a bit of brainstorming, this is what I came up with: Pros: \+ 150% dispenser range \+ 25% dispenser healing rate for allies (20 hp/s at Level 3 -&gt; 25 hp/s at Level 3) ((Medigun has 72 hp/s for reference)) \+ 100% dispenser build rate (20 Seconds Without Wrench Boost -&gt; 10 Seconds Without Wrench Boost) \+ 50% dispenser health \- 25% upgrade cost for dispensers and teleporters \- 50% dispenser replace time &amp;#x200B; Neutral: \- Some sort of indicator that the dispenser is a Southern Hospitality dispenser like a new model or something that makes it clear to the team that it's &amp;#x200B; Cons: \- Sentry gun is locked at level 2 \+ 30% sentry build time \+ 25% dispenser build cost \- 25% damage \- 10% swing speed \- 50% damage to sappers \- 20% fire vulnerability on wearer And finally, to make sure this weapon is PERFECTLY balanced.. - No random critical hits \*chef's kiss\* &amp;#x200B; This whole concept came to mind because of how much it felt like my dispenser very rarely was able to help my team mates regardless of how I placed it, and on the rare occasion it did, it would just get bombed. I really wanted a better way to assist my allies with my dispenser to assume a more supportive role as the Texan rodeo mechanic. Any feedback would be appreciated. TL;DR The Southern Hospitality locks your sentry at level 2, makes your wrench do crappy damage, allows you to get dispenser and teleporters up faster, and your dispenser is significantly better at supporting your team mates and not just you."

20,vulnerability,tf2,Here have another Custom Weapon because Im bored,1,fxn7re,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/fxn7re/here_have_another_custom_weapon_because_im_bored/,2020-04-09 16:21:41,"This was a comment I made on YouTube originally. Weapon Idea: *Russian Retaliator* (Heavy Secondary) (NOTE: Based on Stock Shotgun) (+) 30% More bullets per shot (+) 25% Faster reload (+) 50% More damage per shot (+) 25% More damage when overhealed (+) 50% damage resistance when below 50% health and weapon is active (+) 100% More ammo (+) 50% Faster firing speed (-) This weapon holsters 75% slower (-) This weapon draws 100% slower (-) 33% Less rounds per clip (-) Large bullet spread (fast damage fall off) (-) No random critical hits (-) 50% Melee vulnerability (-) 30% Slower movement speed when weapon is active (-) 15% Slower movement speed when weapon is holstered (-) 50% Less ammo from ammopacks and dispensers while active (-) 10% Less health from Medics and dispensers while active The idea is that this shotgun would be big and heavy, and itd pack a serious punch, and because its so large, it could be used to block damage. Plus, it would reload and shoot very fast to make up for the slow movement speed. And it would be effective when paired with a Medic, which is why I threw in 25% More damage when overhealed. Itd be super powerful, but weak once somebody got a little far away. Also, I added the 50% Melee vulnerability because it kind of makes sense that, if somebody were to somehow manage to land a melee hit in before being annihilated by this shotgun, it would deal more damage. Lastly, in order to balance the overheal stat, I added the 10% Less health from Medics and dispensers stat. Now, obviously this weapon is weak at longer ranges, so the user would have to use either the Tomislav, or this weapon that could come with this shotgun: Weapon Idea: *Bolshevik Beater* (Heavy Primary) (+) 50% smaller bullet spread (stronger at long range) (+) This weapon has a silent spin sound (+) 10% Faster movement speed while spun up (+) 25% Faster movement speed while holstered (+) 10% Faster movement speed while weapon is active (+) 25% Faster draw speed (+) 25% Faster holster speed (+) 50% Extra ammo (-) 30% Damage penalty (-) 15% Slower firing speed The idea of this minigun is that itd be very similar to the Tomislav, but itd be very light and effective at long range, making up for the *Russian Retaliators* weakness at long range. However, in order to balance the long range damage, the weapon would a deal much less damage, acting more as a pressure weapon rather than an actual threat. Also, this weapon would have 300 ammo instead of 200 so that the Heavy could keep on shooting for a good while before having to run back to a dispenser or ammopack. I really like to discuss weapon concepts if you couldnt already tell. Also, if you think anything could be changed about by idea, feel free to reply with your own idea!"

34,vulnerability,tf2,Red Tape Recorder buff idea,1,eljaml,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/eljaml/red_tape_recorder_buff_idea/,2020-01-08 09:53:15,"The red tape recorder is an awful, useless, and outright downgrade to stock in every single way, except in maybe one niche case. If there is a 3-4 player 2fort-style engie nest, then running in and spamming the tape will, in theory, make the sentries slightly easier to kill for your teammates. But what if we went all in on that, making it a more push-based sapper. One simple addition could be having it gain double the health, meaning that it takes 4 wrenches, 2 homewreckers, and 6 jags. This (probably, haven't done the math) would usually assure a loss of one level guaranteed. Now, this certainly ain't perfect, as this could allow a spy to place the sapper and kill the engie before the sapper can be removed. This could be fixed by giving the spy some sort of vulnerability while a sapper has been placed, further enforcing the idea of having a teammate on your side to go and take out the engie/sentry before you die. Another problem could be how hard this could defeat newbie engies, as spamming this on a sentry with an engie who doesn't think to shoot you means that you can do the aforementioned sap and shoot method. Now, I am in no way sure if this is even something to be worried about, as it would teach a great lesson, but it might be a bit too harsh. Dunno, take it or leave it. Maybe add a some sort of cool down per sentry, so that you can't just spam it like the stock sapper. I'm not a game designer, so maybe this is stupid and awful, but I think it could be a good buff for a underused niche downgrade. TL;DR: Make more push focused, double it's health, maybe add bullet vulnerability to spy while sapper is active to prevent solo pushes and encourage a team based strategy"

Each stat increases by one percent for every 5 damage done to a building. When one of you buildings is being sapped, gain mini-crits. Drone Device Right click and press 1 to use 75 metal and drop a box. After 2 seconds, the box opens and a small drone comes out. This drone has 50 health and shoots 3 rounds for 8 damage a round every second. They have half the range of a sentry. These drones hover around the engineer and shoot at enemies that come close. If the engineer dies, the drone flies towards the nearest enemy and explodes on them for 50 damage. The drones can still be killed at this point. This can also be triggered by the engineer selecting an enemy with left click. These drones fly at the speed of a scout. Three drones can be out at once. Right click and press 2 to use 200 metal and drop a large box. After 5 seconds, a mech finishes building. The mech is basically a mobile level 1 sentry with 300 health. It will shoot with 75% the range of a regular sentry. It can also be directed by the left click selector to shoot at enemies. Right clicking with the drone device and pressing 3 causes all drones to kamikaze. Right clicking and pressing 4 causes the mech to explode and deal no damage. Or Ammo pouch No secondary. +150% max metal The Lightning Rod -15% swing speed -25% healing from all sources Dealing shotgun damage increases Shock meter.

Invincible while shock taunting Quantity over Quality PDA You can build two of each building, but they can only be level one. This means that teleports are now labeled with A and B to keep them separate, and the destruction pda now requires a number 1-8 or L.A.Z.O.R New pda that changes what buildings you get. Sentry:A Sentry that has half the range of a normal sentry at level 1, 3/4 range of a normal sentry at level 2, and full range of a sentry at level 3. Shoots 1.5x damage short circuit beams at enemies within range (not cloaked or disguised spies). No aiming necessary. Has 200 health at level 1, 300 health at level 2, and 400 health at level 3.

Dispenser:Shoots crusaders crossbow bolts at teammates within range and within sight. Range is 3x normal dispenser range. Shoots 40 health bolts at level 1, 50 health bolts at level 2, and 60 health bolts at level 3. Shoots at teammates after they are in range for 1 second. Shoots again once every 5 seconds. Dispenser health is the same as a stock dispenser. Spawns a small ammo kit in front of it once every 5 seconds. Teleporter Entrance: Create a Speed Pad that grants someone who stands on it for the regular amount of time receives +25% movement speed for 8 seconds at level one, 12 seconds at level 2, and 16 seconds at level 3. Health is the same as other teleporters. Recharge rate is the same as other teleporters. 10 seconds to recharge at level 1, 5 seconds to recharge at level 2, and 3 seconds to recharge at level 3. Teleporter Exit:Create a Speed Pad that grants someone who stands on it for the regular amount of time a 50% movement speed bonus for 5 seconds at level 1, 6.5 seconds at level 2, and 8 seconds at level 3. Recharge rate is the same as other teleporters. 10 seconds to recharge at level 1, 5 seconds to recharge at level 2, and 3 seconds to recharge at level 3. Remote Detonator -10% build time for buildings When destruction is ordered, the building creates noises that escalate in speed for 3 seconds before exploding and dealing damage to enemies and buildings near it. The damage is equivalent to that of 2 stickibombs on top of each other. If other buildings built by the engineer are destroyed by the explosion, then they create a damaging explosion as well. Medic: (I dont know, something German) -75% clip size +40% reload speed +20% damage Increased firing speed from 100% to 150% depending on user health. At 1 hp, fire 150% faster. The Buffer No overheal -20% heal rate Gives +10% movement speed, +15% damage resist, and +25% damage when healing someone. Stock Uber build rate. Uber-Charge:Give +40% movement speed, 60% damage resist, and +100% damage. Syringe -15 max health on wearer -15% damage No random crits All damage dealt with Syringe heals and grants overheal to medic. Equal to half the damage dealt. Sniper: The Tracer Gun -20% charge rate -25% reload speed Upon hitting an enemy with the rifle, they are Tagged All enemies that are tagged can be seen through walls by the sniper that shot them. They are outlined in the same way teammates are when you respawn. They are tagged for the amount of seconds as 1/10th the damage done to them. For example:150 damage headshot, tagged for 15 seconds. Enemies do know when they are tagged by a occasional beep. The Outback SMG that builds sniper rifle charge with damage. 100 damage needed to fully charge rifle. -20% clip size -10% damage +50% holster speed Thats Not a Knife +150% knock back on hit -25% swing speed +30% melee vulnerability Slows enemy on hit Spy: Right Behind You -50% clip size -20% firing speed When firing revolver while unseen by an enemy, you do not lose your disguise. or The Tranquilizer Gun -50% damage Shooting an enemy slows them down by 15% per shot for a maximum of -60% movement speed. After 3 shots, they get marked for death until they regain default movement speed. Each bullet takes 3 seconds to wear off, with one bullet wearing off at a time. Or Your Eternal Reward 2:Electric Boogaloo Killing an enemy with this gun disguised you as them, makes their body disappear, and shows no kill in the kill feed. Disguising takes all of your cloak meter. You can not disguise manually at all is you also have the Your Eternal Reward knife. The Silent Sapper Silent Sapper that deals no damage to a building. It appears perfectly functional, and the Engineer receives no pop up when a building is sapped. Requires 1 hit to remove, 2 hits with the Jag. While sapper is on a Sentry:The sentry pretends to see and target enemies. It then creates muzzle flares, but no bullets or rockets come out. Dispenser:Dispenser creates healing beam between it and a player, but no healing or ammo refilling is done. Teleporter:Teleporter spins like usual, but no players can pass through it. or Borrowed Bomb When placed, requires 5 seconds to be armed. Then can be remotely detonated by the spy. The engineer does not receive a pop up when a bomb is attached. Only one bomb can be placed every 10 seconds. or The Converter Sapper that causes the building to become neutral, and shoot anyone, heal anyone, or teleport anyone after being applied for 5 seconds. This does not include the engineer that built the building or any spy disguised as the engineer. Standard building being sapped visuals are applied. There is no notification upon this happening, and the engineer can destroy the building remotely while it is neutral, but not while it is becoming neutral. Standard amount of hits to remove sapper. or The Trailer Hold Left Click:Throw sapper. Just like in the trailer. When sapper is on a building, you cant use your knife. Machine gun knife -50% damage +30% firing speed -25% cloak duration or Triple Knife No Backstabs On hit, gain 20% movement speed and -50% firing delay. On third hit on a single target, insta-kill enemies. Ghost Watch When active, user is not invisible and can pass through enemies. For the first second of being active, user is invulnerable. After deactivating, no attacks can be done for 1 second. You can not decloak inside enemies, and will take 10 damage a second if cloak runs out and you are inside an enemy. (Note:None of the disguise kits are that good, so I wasnt satisfied and kept coming up with more) The Speed Disguiser Disguise as a random character based on walking speed. 1 Medic or someone of equivalent speed, 2 for demo knight or someone of equivalent speed, all the way to 9, which is spun up heavy. You disguise instantly, with no transition. You appear as different things to different people (which is why the walking speed if what you categorizes what you can be seen as.) or The Randomizer Prim-Fire, disguise as a random cosmetic set with a random username as a random class. Alt-Fire:Perform a usually impossible action for a spy. Ex, spin up mini-Gun as heavy, Scope as sniper, switch masks as spy, etc. or The Confusing Case Only classes currently played by the enemy are choosable by 1-9. When a class is chosen, a random enemy of that class will begin to see everyone as themselves, including teammates as well as enemies. You are the only player who does not disguise. Or The Prop Kit Disguise as a barrel, crate, tree, tuft of grass, or any prop. You can not move when disguised, and you need to left click a prop in melee range to disguise as it. 1 second undisguise time. Or The faker When you right click on a dead body, it will no longer despawn and you will disguise as it. You can be walked through at this time. It takes 1 second to undisguise. Think of this weapon as the boxtrot, but you can be passed through and it can only be done on a corpse. Prim-Fire lets you disguise as a corpse anywhere. Class and team selection is the same. You cant be walked through when you do this kind of disguise."
36,vulnerability,tf2,Some balance ideas for underwhelming classes and weapons,1,er6ho2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/er6ho2/some_balance_ideas_for_underwhelming_classes_and/,2020-01-20 13:22:39,"Hi everyone. Here is a list of some things I would like to see changed in tf2. Constructive feedback would be appreciated. I may edit the post and add a note next to one of my proposed changes if a comment introduces to me something I had not thought about before or if someone changes my mind. Regardless, I'm not trying to balance everything; just some things I find are very useless. # Balance Suggestions: **Scout:** * The Baby Face's Blaster: Change all attributes to the following: clip size of 4, 90% movement speed, +5% movement speed for each kill (additive), up to 5 kills Below each weapon, I will try to explain a little bit about why I am suggesting these changes. Currently, the Baby Face's Blaster can boost the Scout's default speed by +30%. This means the Scout can run at 130% of his normal speed (400 hu/s --&gt; 520 hu/s). What I am suggesting would make Scout's max speed boosted by +15% (400 hu/s --&gt; 460 hu/s). For comparison, the Eyelander boosts the Demoman's speed by +8% per head, up to 4 times. The main benefit is that the Boost will be easier to maintain while not being so powerful. The goal for all of these balances is to make the weapon better, but not better than stock. * The Back Scatter: 120% bullets per shot (aka +20% more bullets, aka 12 bullets instead of 10), 30% less accurate (instead of 20%) The purpose of this change is to make meatshots more rewarding while not directly nullifying the accuracy penalty. I don't know how accuracy is calculated (by multiplying the area by 1.2 or by multiplying the length and width by 1.2), but regardless, this should be a buff because Scout would gain +20% more bullets per shot and only receive -10% accuracy per shot (+20% &gt; -10%). * The Shortstop: Damage 105% (+5%) By keeping what makes this weapon unique and buffing just its significance in battle (aka damage), it will be better. I don't know if +10% is too much, so I'm being conservative. * Crit-a-Cola: Reduce Marked-for-Death duration after attacking from 5 seconds to 4 seconds I would say reduce it to 3 seconds, but again I'm trying to be conservative. It's a pretty bad weapon anyways, so this change shouldn't be too far-fetched. * BONK! Atomic Punch: When under the effects of BONK, take 75% knockback from all attacks (instead of 100%), 115% movement speed (+15%), 85% duration (-15%), and change after-effects: absorbing over 100 damage reduces movement speed to 80% for 4 seconds, and 200 or more damage reduces it to 70% for 5 seconds instead. So there are a lot of stat changes, but let me sum it up for you: drinking BONK gives a small speed boost that is equivalent to the reduction in duration. You will take a little less knockback from things and you will also get slowed down less by damage. Most notable is that taking 100 damage or less will not result in any movement speed reduction; one of my pet peeves is when I take 5 damage and get slowed down a ton for no reason. * The Sandman: Increase slowdown effect and duration for longer-ranged hits only, and make movement speed reduction a percentage (such as -10% at close range and -30% at longer range) The Sandman is very bad. This should make it more significant and useful. Currently, it just caps all classes' speeds at 226 hu/s. Heavy's speed goes from 230 hu/s to 226. Scout's goes from 400 to 226. This is unfair for all the classes. Making it a multiplier will make it more balanced. Close range hits will slow for 1 second. Mid-range for 3, long range for 8. * The Wrap Assassin: Damage penalty -65% --&gt; -45% instead. Damage per hit goes from 12 to 19. Yay. * The Atomizer: Deploy time penalty from +50% time to +40% This thing takes so long to pull out, and the benefit isn't available until it is fully out and ready to swing. This should help it a bit. **Soldier:** * The Direct Hit: 80% less splash --&gt; 75% less instead Make this a bit more forgiving. I would like 70%, but I prefer baby steps. * The Air Strike: Make the blast radius while blast jumping a little bigger and slightly more forgiving Being far away and up in the air makes it harder to hit targets, especially with a smaller blast size when rocket jumping. I would've added some projectile speed instead, but it would be too many differences from stock in my opinion. Idk. * The Righteous Bison: Projectiles seek out targets, but can only turn at a very slow rate. This would allow the slow projectiles to lean towards a target over long distances. I think this could be a lot of fun. **Pyro:** * The Flamethrower, Degreaser, Phlogistinator, and Backburner: +5% Damage and increase damage at close range What I want to do is give Pyro 175% damage ramp up and close range and 50% damage fall off at long range. The problem is that flame damage is calculated so weirdly that this wouldn't work. But basically, I just want the Pyro to do more damage if he is able to shove the flamethrower in someone's unaware face. Then, at long range, he could do less damage to balance. Or not. This change is probably the most controversial, and it's not as obvious as the others; obvious as in, this weapon is broken and needs a buff like the gas passer. These weapons are fine as they are, so they aren't really in need of anything. But this is just an idea of mine. * The Dragon's Fury: Reduce compression blast (airblast) cooldown by 10%) This will let Pyro airblast a little more frequently, which would help. I like single-fire weapons. * The Thermal Thruster: Hold down the spacebar while in the air to be launched. This turns the jetpack into a passive secondary. Holding the spacebar down for the full duration will use up all fuel. Holding it down for a shorter period of time will result in a shorter boost, but will not consume all the fuel. This weapon is fun, but not too practical. Sacrificing a damaging secondary is just not worth it. All this change does is remove the tedious time it takes to deploy and holster the Thermal Thruster. In return, the jetpack will have a single charge, but this charge can be controlled by the duration of the jump. With that said, since it will only have one charge and it recharges at the same rate, it will only have a total flight distance equal to half of the current Thermal Thruster. The advantage is that it will be more flexible and versatile. * The Gas Passer: Afterburn damage 200% (+100%, aka 4 damage twice each second --&gt; 8 damage twice each second) The Gas Passer is basically useless. This would at least help a little. If this sounds overpowered, just remember that it takes 750 damage or 60 seconds, or a combination of both, just to be able to use this thing (at least the meter is saved between lives). The Scorch Shot can reapply burn better than the Gas Passer. So yeah. * The Scorch Shot: Knockback reduced by 30% The knockback is impossible to counter for slow classes like the Heavy. It just pushes him back indefinitely when revved. Also, it's annoying. This would make it have 70% of its current knockback. * The Hot Hand: Damage penalty reduced from 20% to just 10% instead A small buff. It is a meme weapon; this will make it less memey and more useful. * The Sharpened Volcano Fragment: Burns the target for 8 damage per tick instead of 4 It'll still be useless. **Demoman:** * The Ullapool Caber: Increase explosive damage by 10% and decrease swing cooldown by 10% (currently, it is 20% slower; this would make it 10% slower instead). Recharges by itself after 60 seconds Lets it one shot 125 hp classes on the first hit. **Heavy:** * All primaries: Remove damage and accuracy ramp-up. The Heavy is weak enough as it is. The Soldier, Demoman, and Scout are usually better than the Heavy because of mobility. I just wanted to buff all of the Heavy's primaries, and this was the easiest thing to change. Just remove this small thing that makes his damage inconsistent and complicated. * The Sandvich: Reduce consumption time to exactly 4 seconds For reasons that will soon be clear. * The Second Banana: Reduce consumption time to exactly 3 seconds And you can see where this is going... * The Dalokohs Bar: Reduce consumption time to exactly 2 seconds By reducing the time it takes for the Heavy to eat his food relative to the amount of health is typically heals, the chocolate bar will be buffed, and the banana as well. Even the Sandvich will be easier to swallow. All of these will increase the Heavy's average mobility throughout a game and increase the time he gets to spend actually shooting players instead of just smacking his lips and yelling about his sandvich lol. * The Buffalo Steak Sandvich: +50 hp on cosumption Lacking the utility of healing the Heavy, this buff should make it more helpful in a fight. The speed boost however is very good, so forcing the Heavy to deploy his melee is kind of necessary, unless you want to change the weapon entirely. Until I come up with a better rework or solution, this is the best I've got. * The Gloves of Running Urgently: -14 max hp per 2 seconds when deployed, -15 max hp on deploy This will reduce the max hp the Heavy loses when switching to the Gloves of Running Urgently and it will reduce the max hp drain while holding them out as well: -20 --&gt; -10, and -10 hp/s --&gt; -7.5 hp/s. I liked the mini crits better, but I also understand that Heavy isn't supposed to be fast. On the other hand, he is very very slow, so yeah. -10 hp/s is a ton. This buff should help a lot. He will still regain 10 max hp per second however. * The Eviction Notice: Max hp drain and loss by deploy -25% Same buff as the Gloves of Running Urgently. Instead of losing 20 max hp instantly when deploying the Eviction Notice, the Heavy will now lose only 10 max hp. Instead of -5 max hp per second over time, the Heavy will lose 4 hp per second instead. He will still gain 5 max hp per second however. * The Warrior's Spirit: Remove the damage vulnerability and replace it with a 5% slower movement speed when deployed and a 10% slower swing speed Similar to the Crit-a-Cola, the Warrior's Spirit makes the Heavy too weak. This would probably be an upgrade to stock, but that's just because stock Fists are so bad. **Engineer:** * The Widowmaker: Allow the Engineer to gain metal from shooting disguised Enemy Spies Currently, dealing with the Spy is difficult because you don't get any metal back from hitting disguised Spies. This would fix that. * The Pomson 6000: Add a slight homing effect similar to the Righteous Bison This would make the weapon more consistent and fun. * The Short Circuit: Primary fire has double the range Makes the Short Circuit primary fire slightly more useful. **Medic:** * All Primaries except for the Crusader's Crossbow: 150% projectile speed (+50%) This would make the Medic's syringes travel straighter over similar distances relative to their speeds. * That's all for the Medic! **Sniper:** * ~~All attacks do 0% damage against the Heavy~~ But seriously; I don't believe there is any other matchup more polarizing than the Heavy vs. the Sniper. What polarizing means, in this case, is that no other class vs class matchup is as unfavorable for one class than any other matchup. Scout vs Engineer? Not really. Pyro vs Spy? Probably the second-closest one, but nope. Spy's gun can outrange Pyro's primaries. Plus, Spy can outrun the Pyro. But the Pyro is perfect for spychecking. So they are not so polarizing. Scout loses to sentries, but Scout's mobility allows him to do things to beat the Engineer sometimes. But Heavy vs. Sniper? What will Heavy do? Peek? Nope; ded. Fists of Steel and look 60 degrees up and 15 degrees to the right? Maybe. But then you'll die to the other team. Flank? No; Sniper is faster than Heavy. There is nothing the Heavy can do against an equally competent Sniper. Anyways, enough complaining from me lol (yes im a heavy main, so what). * The Classic: 150% scoped movement speed while scoped (+50% scoped speed while scoped) The Classic pales in comparison to the Sniper Rifle, but at least we can give him some movement speed. The Classic is for a specific type of player, so I don't want to change it too much from its original design. I just like mobility, and this would help. * The Cleaner's Carbine: Remove the ""-20% clip size"" attribute The Cleaner's Carbine already fires 25% slower (at 75% the speed of the SMG), so I don't think it needs 5 fewer bullets in its clip on top of that. * The Bushwaka: 15% damage vulnerability instead of 20% This would effectively give the Sniper 5 more health than before. 20% is a bit too much if you ask me. **Spy:** * All Secondary weapons (guns) are more accurate This would improve Spy's gun game and make aiming more rewarding. I often find myself missing shots that would've hit if the gun wasn't so inaccurate. Spy usually dies if he is too close anyways, so this would help a lot hopefully. * The Your Eternal Reward: Backstabs make corpses disappear instantly instead of fading away slightly, and disguses cost 3/4 of a cloak meter This would make it harder to catch the Spy because often times, the fading corpses just give him away. I know it's not the main issue, but it is *an* issue, so yeah. Secondly, if disguises only costed half a meter, the Spy would not have to forfeit his dead ringer for a disguise. If you dead ring, and then instantly decloak, you are left with half a cloak meter. With the remaining cloak, you would be able to disguise again after waiting a little bit. This weapon would still be pretty bad, but it wouldn't be as bad as before. * The Cloak and Dagger: Cloak drain rate reduced by 10% The Cloak and Dagger drains just a little too fast and often requires the L'Etranger. This buff would make it drain slightly slower so you can move a little bit more each second. * The Red Tape Recorder: If a leveled building is sapped by the Red Tape Recorder and the Red Tape Recorder is removed before the building begins to fold back into the box, then the building is disabled for 0.5 seconds upon removal of the Red Tape Recorder. If the building went from a level to level 0 (construction), then the building is not disabled upon removal of the sapper. This would make the Red Tape Recorder disable a building for a short period of time after removing it. A small buff. I don't have any other ideas. Let me know if you have a better idea :). FINALLY I am done!! Please let me know what you think; I put tons of effort into this. I dunno if this is the part where I say that my opinions and ideas are valid because I have a bunch of hours in the video game lol but I think we should just take ideas for what they are and not be influenced so much by how many hours someone has. Anyways, I'm tired. Constructive feedback is much appreciated. Thank you so much for reading this far unless u just skipped all the way to the end, but regardless, let me know if you want me to change anything, if u have any ideas, or if I forgot to mention something, and I will try to respond as soon as possible. I love tf2 so much lol thank you to everyone :)))"

It chews ammo, but is deadlier if you prefer fastpaced fights. 2) Soldier - a new pistol. A replacement for shotgun - it fires instantly even at long range, but is slow to holster, reload. 3) Pyro - hand-claws. Replacement for shotgun, allows pyro to become Spider-Man and climb the walls. Adds billet vulnerability as a counter. Makes perfect for ambushing. 4) Demoman - a new sticky-launcher, The stickies trigger automatically upon enemy detection nearby. Perfect for lazy, inattentive people 5) Heavy - rocketboots (lol). Replaces 2ndary weapon, allows the wearer to double jump. 6) Engineer - an invulnerability station - Replaces Sentry. Provides uber to those standing nearby on regular intervals - every 60 seconds. Perfect for defending. A weapon-dispenser - every time you get to that dispenser you're able to swap weapons (comes with min. ammo). Teleporters are replaced with 1 speed boost pad. 7) Medic - a medic backpack, that replaces Medi Gun. Even when not active it heals players nearby, but doesn't have uber. Great for attacking medics. 8) Sniper - a Sydney sleeper kind of rifle, that marks enemies to be seen through the walls for short time. No headshots, minimum damage. 9) Spy - sleight of hand - replaces knife. Allows Spy to imitate any melee attack animation, when disguised. Does 0 damage. Great for fooling enemy, to get behind their lines at the cost of damage. What do you think and what are your ideas?"

46,vulnerability,tf2,The Great Weapon Balance Unfuckening: The Scout,5,dkpt88,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/dkpt88/the_great_weapon_balance_unfuckening_the_scout/,2019-10-21 08:02:15,"Alright so over the years the TF2 dev team have made some pretty good changes to a lot of weapons, but they've also made some really bad ones and left some in the same trashy states for years now. So My thoughts are to say what my ideas are for how to fix them and see what everyone else thinks. I started playing in December 2011, currently I'm at 2525 hours played, I play all classes except Engineer, and I am a Medic main. \----- Name: Shortstop &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ +20% bonus healing while deployed. Bonus healing doesn't stack with other heal bonuses. &amp;#x200B; This change brings back the shortstop's unique effect without the problem of it being too strong with the quick-fix. The alt fire is useless so I see no reason to remove it to bring this back. \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Baby Face's Blaster &amp;#x200B; Changes: \- -20% damage penalty &amp;#x200B; \+ Damage required to reach maximum boost 100 -&gt; 80 \+ Boost lost per point of damage taken 4% -&gt; 2% \+ Boost lost on air jump 75% -&gt; 50% \+ +20% more accurate &amp;#x200B; We all hated fighting this damn thing back when it was broken, but it's been a long time now since gun mettle came and neutered it and personally I feel like leaving it in the nigh unusable state it's in is pretty lame. So, I figured I'd try to find a way to balance it out with a touch of its original stats mixed in. Personally I really liked the original stats this gun had and felt like valve made it really fucking boring after the two cities update. Reducing the damage required to hit max boost will allow you to still gain full boost from one good meatshot but it also makes building boost with your secondary faster than before. Reducing boost lost on damage taken was to make it so you can't be clipped by a stray max range pistol shot and instantly lose a 3rd of your speed. Now it would take 40 damage to lose all boost rather than 25, so you can still lose it all to the splash of a rocket or any other decent sources of damage. Boost lost on double jump was reduced because losing 75% on one jump feels a bit too punishing, but just 25% was too little as we all know. The damage and accuracy changes were to make it a bit easier to use while going at high speeds but also to reduce its damage potential so you can't die in two shots as a light class unless the scout actually lands them cleanly at very close range. \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Back Scatter &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ -34% clip size -&gt; -17% clip size &amp;#x200B; The Back Scatter feels a bit weak as is, but playing with the accuracy downside felt a bit too risky. One extra shell before reloading would allow a scout using it to finish off a target they botched the ambush on slightly more often. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Winger &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ -60% clip size -&gt; -50% clip size &amp;#x200B; It has always bugged me how this damn thing's idiotic clip size ends up with its last clip not even being full. Just increase it by one to make it even, its kill power isn't even good anyway. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Flying Guillotine &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ Crits players that are slowed &amp;#x200B; The only part of the Guillotine + Sandman combo that could have been considered broken was the stun effect and that was removed in the same update. As it is now this is just a shitty sidegrade to the pistol with no reason to ever use it. I don't feel the long range minicrits is necessary since you almost never landed it for that effect anyway and it felt a bit wonky to lose 112 health to a lucky cleaver shot since I recall the bleed dealing minicrits too. The combo should return, the long range power should not. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Candy Cane &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ 25% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer -&gt; 20% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer &amp;#x200B; I have never once in my 2500+ hours seen this thing used by someone other than a butthol memer. The downside of being instagibbed by soldiers and demos is way too punishing to justify using it, so my thoughts are to reduce that downside just enough that a full health scout can't be killed in a single shot... Well, actually soldier can still do it at point blank anyway but at least the instant death range is shortened a little bit and a single demo pill doesn't turn you into meaty bits."
47,vulnerability,tf2,The Great Weapon Balance Unfuckening: The Demoman,0,dlbul5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/dlbul5/the_great_weapon_balance_unfuckening_the_demoman/,2019-10-22 14:16:12,"The fourth thread in the series of my suggestions to fix broken weapons and make shitty ones more viable, this time for the demoman. Personal experience info: I started playing in December 2011, currently I'm at 2528 hours played, I play all classes except Engineer, and I am a Medic main. \----- Name: Loch-n-Load &amp;#x200B; Changes: \- Removed: +20% damage vs buildings \- Removed: +25% projectile speed \- -25% clip size -&gt; -50% clip size \+ +25% damage bonus &amp;#x200B; So many arguments against the original design of this weapon are bullshit it's unreal, so as someone that actually used this thing a lot before it got nerfed into oblivion allow me to explain why the double barrel launcher shouldn't have a 3rd fucking pill. &amp;#x200B; 1.) ""It used to be able to kill a scout in one shot if you hit them in the head!"" Actually that's wrong. You had to hit light classes right in the chest around where the lungs would be to hit for enough damage to kill them. It's irrelevant since damage spread was removed and grenades always deal the same damage no matter where they hit now but I have seen so many people say this and not get corrected it just kinda bugs me. &amp;#x200B; 2.) ""It could kill a scout in one shot that's not fair!"" Yep. It sure could. And all you had to trade for that is half your clip size, any potential damage from rollers, and taking a massive amount of self-inflicted blast damage if you shot someone too close to you (used to have 25% increased self damage). It gave a massive disadvantage against heavies and if you missed either shot on a soldier or enemy demo that wasn't also using the loch you may as well hit your kill bind right there cause you're fucked my man. I never really understood why exactly so many people complained about this weapon killing light classes in one shot when the Direct Hit can do the same thing to this day while also being even better against heavies, having a mechanic built into the thing that can often let you instantly kill an enemy soldier that rocket jumps, and killing sentries in two shots just like the loch. My best guess was the projectile speed which I've always felt wasn't necessary. &amp;#x200B; 3.) ""The faster projectile speed made it too easy to hit people it was such a cheap weapon!"" If you look at the stats up there you'll see I removed that as I completely agree the projectile speed is just a crutch. The loss of it paired with its smaller explosion radius compared to the original version of the weapon should be enough of a trade off for its old damage buff to return. &amp;#x200B; 4.) ""But how will I hit my pipes if they remove the projectile speed bonus?!"" git gud. \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Ali Baba's Wee Booties/Bootlegger &amp;#x200B; Changes: \* +10% faster move speed on wearer (shield required) -&gt; +10% faster move speed on wearer while melee weapon is active \+ 200% increase in turning control while charging -&gt; +500% increase in turning control while charging &amp;#x200B; The 10% move speed was pretty good back when it worked with stickies too but now since it only works when all you have is a melee weapon anyway the speed change would only act as a minor buff. As for the turning control buff, the main issues with demoknight are that it is very difficult to line up a charge to hit with a crit and that people have difficulty actually finishing off a demoknight after they've gotten a few heads. The turning control bonus the booties currently have does almost nothing to fix the first issue as it only widens the radius at which you can land a crit swing to maybe 50 degrees, which is kinda pitiful considering you're sacrificing all ranged options for it and can't do diddly dick to sentries or pyros that aren't using the phlog. +500% would end up at double the effect it currently has which would make it a bit easier for a demoknight to score kills against people that are actually paying attention to them. As for the second issue, the difficulty of killing a demoknight is caused by two things: The charge allowing them to escape your range/make it difficult to snipe and the extra health + move speed granted by the eyelander's head mechanic. The only instance in which the turn control change affects these is if they manage to turn enough to get behind a wall that breaks line of sight, but due to the way charges allow you to slide along walls while still turning your aim to force you past them faster once you pass the corner this still isn't really affected. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Splendid Screen &amp;#x200B; Changes: Nothing &amp;#x200B; Why am I mentioning a weapon without any changes listed? Well, there's something weird with its stats that almost no one knows about it: It's charge recharge buff doesn't make sense. What I mean is that mathematically speaking the stat is inaccurate to the bonus it actually provides. The base charge recharge time for shields is 12 seconds, so the ""50% increase in charge recharge rate"" should work off the logic of a 100% increase making it recharge twice as fast which would be 6 seconds. But it doesn't. The Screen's charge recharges in 8 seconds. That doesn't make any goddamn sense so I am suggesting that either the text be changed to ""66% increase in charge recharge rate"" since that's what it actually is or the recharge time be changed to 9 seconds to match what it currently says. Imo if the stat of a weapon doesn't do what someone is lead to believe it does either the weapon or description should change to avoid confusion. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Tide Turner &amp;#x200B; Changes: \- Removed: +15% fire damage resistance on wearer \- Removed: +15% explosive damage resistance on wearer \- Melee kills refill 75% of your charge meter. -&gt; Melee kills refill 55% of your charge meter. \+ Can give crits again \- Critical swing window is 40% shorter &amp;#x200B; The Tide Turner was always meant to be the high mobility high offense shield option, so how about instead of crippling it and tossing it in the trash like valve did we just remove some of its survivability and make it a little harder to use. No resistances limits its survivability uses to just running away and dropping its charge refill on melee kill will give a minimum 5.4 second delay between its charges (2.4 seconds with the Claidheamh Mor or Booties, or 0 with claid + Booties) as opposed to the old 3 second delay. This will give more time for nearby players to react and paired with removing the resistances will make it significantly easier for players to kill the demo. As for the critical swing window change, it will reduce the time a player has to land the crit from the last 0.8 seconds (1 sec with Claid) of the charge to the last 0.48 seconds (0.6 with claid). If you don't know exactly how tight that timing is, it's 9.5% shorter than the delay for firing the Dragon's Fury if you hit a player. Pretty fucking short. It also forces the demo to charge slightly longer before getting a crit which makes it more punishing for them to take damage during the charge as it could easily throw off their timing or bypass the entire crit window (25 damage can bypass the entire crit window if dealt the moment before the demo enters it, 31 with the claid). tl;dr, these changes make it significantly easier for you to punish a demo using this weapon while also making it much harder to use effectively and fixing the problem of instant charge chain kills while still using a grenade launcher that made people demand a nerf in the first place. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Ullapool Caber &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ This weapon deploys 100% slower -&gt; This weapon deploys 60% slower \+ The explosion is now generated from the core of the target struck rather than what the game thinks was the point of impact \+ explosion damage 75 -&gt; 77 &amp;#x200B; This fixes the inconsistency where sometimes 125 health classes will live on 1-3 health or so by forcing them to always take the full damage of a fresh caber and also removing the slight chance the explosion damage will mess up and let them live. This doesn't really make it any better in practice it just makes it so it won't blue ball you when you're trying to mess with snipers that aren't paying attention. The deploy speed bonus however does make it better. I understand why they gave it the downside because demos would often pull out the caber to finish a fight they weren't winning otherwise to force a draw, but the swing speed penalty and deploy speed penalty paired together make it pretty much impossible to use for anything other than trolling gibus snipers. This buff would make it take 1 full second to deploy rather than 1.3, so it's not much a change but a lot can happen in .3 seconds. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Claidheamh Mor &amp;#x200B; Changes: \- -15 Max health \+ Removed: 15% damage vulnerability on wearer &amp;#x200B; 15% damage vulnerability is equal to -23 max health (-30 max health with Booties), so it wasn't fully reverted and it's still worse than it was before the tough break update turned it into a shittier half-zatoichi. Would be nice if they fixed this last little bit. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Persian Persuader &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ -80% max primary ammo on wearer -&gt; -75% max primary ammo on wearer \+ Removed: -80% max secondary ammo on wearer &amp;#x200B; This sword used to be a problem but now it's just stupid. The primary ammo reduction it currently has doesn't even give you a full clip to reload with and is just very clunky to work with in general. It's the same deal as my suggested Winger change except this is far less impactful. As for the secondary ammo... well, that doesn't make any sense. Why is it there? What sense does it make for the sword that only has upsides if you use a shield to also punish you even further for not using one? The only thing removing that downside does is allow you to run the loadout of bootlegger/booties + stickies + Persuader which is already outclassed by just using the Half-Zatoichi, Claidheamh Mor, or Scotsman's Skullcutter instead."

Personal experience info: I started playing in December 2011, currently I'm at 2531 hours played, I play all classes except Engineer, and I am a Medic main. \----- Name: Natascha &amp;#x200B; Changes: \- Removed: -20% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up \+ +25% max primary ammo on wearer &amp;#x200B; The resistance is wierd in that some players claim it's too strong and others like myself have a hard time finding any value in it whatsoever. It was too good when it was at all times when spun up so I think it should just be scrapped as a whole and we should go back to the old version where it had more max ammo, but to a slightly lesser extent so you can't just go on forever. I know the slow is kind of the real issue with it but I can't think of any way to fix that without scrapping it entirely and at that point we're basically turning it into a completely different gun. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Brass Beast &amp;#x200B; Changes: \- Removed: -20% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up \- -30% max primary ammo on wearer \+ 50% slower spin up time -&gt; 25% slower spin up time \+ -60% slower move speed while deployed -&gt; -25% slower move speed while deployed &amp;#x200B; Same deal as the Natascha, the damage res is fuckin weird. The Brass beast is in a weird place where we can't do too much to it without breaking it, but it's pretty much unusable as it is right now. A large part of that unusability is that it's too slow to deploy to catch anyone by jumping and deploying around a corner and too slow moving that you can't deploy and then walk around the corner. Also paints a ""Snipe Me!"" sign onto your face since you can't possibly dodge even the shittiest of gibus snipers. These changes aim to help with both issues while replacing them with a more mundane though still punishing max ammo penalty. Input appreciated. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Dalokohs Bar/Fishcake &amp;#x200B; Changes V1: \* +66% faster recharge time \+ Eat to gain up to 100 health. -&gt; Eat to gain up to 120 health. \+ Adds +50 max health for 30 seconds -&gt; Adds +50 max health for 60 seconds \* Added Text: Extra max health does not increase maximum overheal &amp;#x200B; The faster recharge compared to the sandvich is currently an unlisted effect that may lead newer players to believe the bar is worse than it actually is. It's pretty shit even without that which is why I feel it should heal very slightly more health and have a longer duration on its effect. Along with that I think it should state that it doesn't allow you to get extra overheal since many heavies assume it does until they try it and see that it doesn't work for some reason. &amp;#x200B; \----- &amp;#x200B; Changes V2: \*66% faster recharge time \+ Extra max health now increases maximum overheal to 525 &amp;#x200B; I feel like this would make little difference in casual play but this would probably get banned in competitive leagues within a day. There's plenty of things that will never be allowed in comp leagues since their design is inherently broken in them (Mad Milk for example) so I don't see much of a problem with that. In any case let me know whether you think V1 or V2 is a better route to go with this. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Buffalo Steak Sandvich &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ Eat to regain up to 100 health \+ +33% faster recharge time &amp;#x200B; Only item heavy can eat that doesn't heal. As for the recharge rate buff, it allows heavy to use it as a better Sandvich if you're solely giving it to other players. It would also allow heavies using it for the meme of melee heavy to have the buff active much more often and to be able to top off their health without needing to visit a million health packs. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Second Banana &amp;#x200B; Changes: ? +??? faster recharge time \* Removed text: -33% healing effect \* Eat to gain health -&gt; Eat to gain up to 200 health &amp;#x200B; If you've been following these threads you may know that in the Demoman thread I pointed out that the Splendid Screen's ""50% increased charge recharge rate"" text didn't really make sense and wasn't obvious in how it actually worked. Someone corrected me and explained how the math was supposed to be done and it made some sense after that, however, the Second Banana has that very same line of text in it's description yet if we follow that very same math here it should recharge in 20 seconds right? NAH, IT RECHARGES IN 11 SECONDS. That would make the actual charge recharge rate roughly fuckin +175%! Either TF2's spaghetti code is back at it again and this item is absolutely not working as intended or the item description is lying to us and making us think this item is drastically worse than it actually is. I strongly believe that it's the item description deceiving us since this is also the only food item with a healing effect that doesn't list how much health it restores in the grey part of the description and instead lists it as a ""-33% healing effect"" in red text. Something is definitely very broken about this thing description wise but I don't know exactly what so I can't really say what its recharge time should say. As an actual weapon the Banana is fine as it and the sandvich both outperform each other depending on circumstance. No mechanical changes needed here, just clarification on what the fuck exactly its recharge speed is supposed to be since it's total nonsense right now. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Gloves of Running Urgently/Bread Bite &amp;#x200B; Changes: \- -20% damage penalty \+ Maximum health drained is recovered 50% faster \+ Maximum health drain is capped at 150 \+ Maximum health drain on deployment 20 -&gt; 15 &amp;#x200B; These went from the meta pick for all heavies to utter trash in one change. It doesn't matter if you get there faster as heavy if you die in one rocket once you're finally there. This change is to make it less punishing for you to actually use these as a means to get to the fight. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Eviction Notice &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ Maximum health drained is recovered 40% faster \+ Maximum health drain is capped at 175 \+ Maximum health drain on deployment 20 -&gt; 10 &amp;#x200B; To keep in line with the GRU. &amp;#x200B; \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- &amp;#x200B; Name: Warrior's Spirit &amp;#x200B; Changes: \+ 30% damage vulnerability on wearer -&gt; 15% damage vulnerability on wearer &amp;#x200B; Its kind of ridiculous that a heavy needs to force themselves to take over 50% more damage if they want to run around and punch people for damage that still doesn't one shot light classes instead of using the highest DPS gun in the fucking game."
49,vulnerability,tf2,New sapper idea,2,dmn8cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/dmn8cu/new_sapper_idea/,2019-10-25 08:35:56,"Betrayal sapper idea. No name yet. Pros: You hack into the sentry with your sapper and take control of it, allowing you to gun down the engineer and any other enemy nearby. Can sap the sentry while invisible. You can choose when to start controlling the sentry by pressing R. Left click to shoot and right click to fire rockets if available. Sapping dispensers will make them hurt the enemy players and drain their ammo/metal. The damage and ammo/metal draining scales with the level of the dispenser. Sapping teleporters will switch their team until fully sapped or until the sapper is removed, it'll also switch the exit with the entrance. Engis are not fully alerted by the dispenser or teleporter being sapped. The beeping sound will only play if the engi is close enough to the building. (30 foot radius and the ""building being sapped"" icon will still appear in the top left regardless of distance) Sapped teles and dispensers take 4 wrench hits to remove the sappers. Cons: Can only sap ONE sentry at a time. While controlling a sentry, the sentry has a 25% damage vulnerability. No auto-lock on like with the wrangler. \-35% sapping speed. Can only control a sentry for 8 seconds. Sapper has a 25 second cooldown when used on a sentry. Cannot sap the same sentry to regain control of it if it's still being sapped by the first sapper. Sentry bullets and rockets are 20% weaker. Deals almost no knockback from sentry bullets or rockets. You're completely revealed once controlling a sentry. You can only activate control over a sentry in a 25 foot radius around the sentry. Sapper can be removed in a single wrench hit and also be removed with one (maybe 2) rescue ranger shot. (Only when on a sentry) Shows an icon above the controlled sentry to alert the enemy team that this sentry is being controlled. Suggestions for changes or names are welcome. Oh yeah and no random crits."

Natascha The slowdown now begins at 5% and every shot hit increases the effect by 5% up to 60% +Added 50% increased ammo on wearer +Removed 30% slower spin up time -Removed 20% damage resistance when revved and below 50% health Final stats +On hit would slow down enemy Effect increases the more the target is hit +50% ammo on wearer -25% less damage Reasoning: The Natascha can be very annoying to fight, and also it has stats that seem slapped on, to fix this, the slow down should build up over time, meaning good tracking would be required to make the weapon more effective. And the extra ammo to slightly counteract the less damage while also getting rid of some of the out of place stats. Brass Beast -Removed 20% damage resistance when revved and 50% health +Added 20% damage resist while revved +Added 30% Crit resistance is while revved Final stats +20% more damage +20% damage resist while revved +30% crit resistance while revved -50% slower rev -60% slower movement speed while revved Reasoning: The beast was unfairly nerfed in meet your match, so adding back the 20% damage resist seemed just natural, but the reason for the beast crit resistance is to help against the beast biggest weakness, snipers. One charged headshot from an unexpected angle make this weapon basically worthless if theres a decent sniper. So to balanced this the crit resistance should allow you to survive a fully charged headshot with around 60-50. This should allow the beast to remain defensive while still being countered by focus fire much like a sentry. Huo long heater Complete rework: -Remove all stats +Add fires fireworks that create afterburn for 2 seconds (fireworks would deal roughly 40-45 damage and would fly slightly faster than a rocket and a have an area of effect of a pill from Demo) -Added fireworks use 5 ammo per shot(same 200 ammo capacity as stock allowing for 40 shots total) -3 Fireworks per second Final stats Shoots fireworks instead of bullets -5 ammo cost increase per shot -3 fireworks fired per second Reasoning: the current Huo long is boring and bad, so to make more interesting, fun and unique, this weapon would become basically a semi fast firing rocket launcher for heavy making it great of area denial and mid range area of effect harassing, not to mention you theoretically could perform small jumps with it much like the detonator for pyro. (Alternative stats) +Removed -10% damage penalty Reasoning: If we have to stay with the current Huo long might as well make it better, still not as cool the rework in my opinion Dalokohs bar +Added when eaten increases healing rate from medics and dispensers by 30% when eaten (if being healed by a quick fix the quick fix will take priority over the bar instead of stacking to avoid a god heavy) +Added increased health from health packs by 40% when consumed -Increased charge time from 10 to 20 seconds Final stats (All effects last 30 seconds) On consumption, users gains +50 health +increases healing rate from medics and dispensers by 30% while under its effects +Increased health from health packs by 40% while under its effects Charges in 20 seconds Reasoning: The dalakhos bar will in general be eaten before going into battle, so to aid this, the dalakhos bar will allow the heavy to survive more and possibly be more independent. As the current +50 health isnt that great on its own, and the increase in charge time is to still allow the banana to compete as I dont want either of these weapons to overshadow the other due to the fact they share a very similar role of the lone heavy lunchbox item. Buffalo steak +Added 25% damage resist +Added on hit gain speed boost (think disciplinary action) -Removed damage vulnerability -Removed passive speed boost Final stats (All effects lasts 30 seconds) +When eaten gain mini-crits +25% damage resist when consumed +When consumed, on hit will give speed boost -Locks user into melee Reasoning: do I need a reason to buff this piece a shit? But the reason I made the speed boost on hit, is to stop heavy to mid problem in competitive. Family business +Added 40 health on kill Final stats +33% clip size +15% faster fire rate +40 health on kill -15% less damage Reasoning: The main issue with fat scout beside not healing your team is the inability to heal yourself, this would help alleviate part of that issue, its more a small buff, because I have no idea how to make shotguns on heavy as good as lunchbox items. Gloves of running urgently +reduced health drain to the same as current eviction notice (health return remains the same rate as it is now) Final stats +while active 30% speed boost -while active, health drain Reasoning: make the gru better, but not OP Eviction notice -Removed speed boost -Removed health drain +Added on hit 25+ health (it does overheal) +Added medics connected to you gain the health and overheal as well Final stats +50% faster firing speed +On hit, +25 health +Medics connected to user will gain the same health as user as well -50% less damage Reasoning: As it stands now, the eviction notice is just a diet gru, which is just lame, so for the sake of making it its own actual weapon and also better I thought these stats would provide heavy with a unique dynamic wether alone or with a medic Warriors spirit +Removed damage vulnerability -Added Bear spirit (Think the honor-bound effect from the half zatoichi, but instead of -50 health, it would be -100 health) Final stats +30% Damage +50 health on kill -Bear spirit, if the user sheaths the weapon before killing an enemy the user will loose 100 health, if the Player is at or below 100 health the weapon can not be sheathed until health is gained or an enemy is killed. Reasoning: The Warriors spirit are clearly supposed to be the combat melee weapons for heavy, so why not make them better for straight up melee combat. Sure they dont hit as hard as the KGB can, and they dont provide the same utility as other melees but it does give you consistent high melee damage with good sustain at the cost of locking you into melee if you cant get a pick, making them a risky, but powerful choice."
51,vulnerability,tf2,Some balancing ideas (effort post),0,d4srj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/d4srj6/some_balancing_ideas_effort_post/,2019-09-16 09:57:56,"Just a post to bring some balancing ideas to weapons that I personally think need to be changed. The following weapons Im discussing are: the Ubersaw, Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol, Disciplinary Action, and the Diamondback. Ill provide some background on why I suggest the weapons needs balance. Ubersaw: The Ubersaw was the go to medic melee on release and still is to this day. 25% on hit for Uber is extremely valuable, even getting one hit makes this weapon extremely valuable. The hit speed is for sure a downside, but its negligible for what the Ubersaw provides. So I suggest the following balances to make the other melees stand out: + On hit: Gain 20% Uber - 20% slower attack speed - 25% damage penalty - 20% damage vulnerability while deployed - 1 less HP per second on wearer I honestly feel even with these heavy needs, the Ubersaw will still be a top tier medic melee, but hopefully other melee weapons will look more attractive as well. Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol: The PBPP pretty much acts as a direct upgrade to the stock Pistol. With faster firing speed, the DPS can easily be compared to the stock pistol and 3 health on hit is just icing on the cake. It can be said, that because the firing speed is faster, its harder to get all your hits off, but that just requires practice. I suggest these new stats for the PBPP: + On hit: Gain up to +3 health + Wearer takes no fall damage while weapon is deployed - 25% smaller clip size - 15% slower firing speed - 15% slower holstering speed I personally liked the no fall damage aspect from the original release and the life steal of the newer version so I decided to combine the two. With these 2 upsides, the pistol keeps a small clip and has a slower firing speed. The slower holster speed is ensure the player uses the weapon cautiously. Its intended as a flee weapon used as a last resort. Disciplinary Action: The Disciplinary Action has a lot going for it. It provides as a great melee weapon for the second slowest class as it has the longest melee range of any weapon. And as a supporting weapon it provides a 2 second to speed boost that stacks to both the soldier and teammate. Needless to say its a pretty strong melee choice for Soldier. Balances suggestions: + On hit teammate: Boosts both players speed for several seconds (2 secs) - 25% damage penalty - 25% slower attack speed (1 second attack speed) - Melee range reduced to sword range - Longer deploy and holster like other swords Just like the my Ubersaw suggestions, I dont think these nerfs are quite enough in dialing down the power of the DA but it is a start. The slower attack speed ensures your attacks matter for both offense and support. 1v1 melee battles will seem more fair since the range is shortened to the Eyelander and the deploy and holster time is lengthened to match Demos swords. The idea is instead of making the DA good as a support and combat weapon, its utility is being weakened so its main focus is support. Diamondback: The Diamondback has always been a good choice for Spy. Its upsides are too easy to take advantage of as it rewards the player for basically playing Spy. Now nothing is wrong with playing a class correctly, but this weapon enables the Spy to easily get Crits which are extremely strong and game changing. Its also unfun to play against critical hits you dont know are coming. At least with the Frontier Justice, theres a visual queue so opposing players no that Engie is dangerous. I suggest the following balance changes to make the Diamondback more balanced: + Gives one guaranteed MINI-CRIT for each building destroyed with your sapper attached or backstab kill. - 15% slower attack speed - No random critical hits - Mini-Crit boost only available while undisguised (if youre disguised, your first shot disguised is a normal shot) The idea is to keep the Diamondbacks main gimmick, while also not making it unfun to against. Mini-crits are still strong and are still a forced to be reckoned with, especially coming from stock revolver damage. The slower attack speed is to make sure your shots matter while also lowering the DPS overall when your in a situation with no Crits. Thanks for reading guys, Im always down for criticism and feedback as well as other ideas for not just the ones listed, but any weapons! I know I didnt get all weapons that need balancing, but these were at least ones that I had actual stats and reasoning to back up my suggestions. Other suggestions that I think need some Baal cling are: Son in a Stick, Baby Faces Blaster, Soda Popper, Natascha, Buffalo Steak Sandvich, Gas Passer, Jarate, Mad Milk. These are only ones at the top of my head, but theres plenty more."

Demoman- Loch and Load Teachs you how to aim direct shots, and it is my go-to grenade launcher for killing sentries. Heavy- Buffalo Steak Sandvich I absolutely love using this becasue of how fun it is, and its a neat concept. Its a pitty that it's currently underpowered. Hopefully, it will get a good buff in the near future, like replacing the damage vulnerability with damage resistence. Engineer- Short Circuit Its very unique and it had a long history of stat changes. Currently it replicates Megaman's arm canon. Medic- Overdose As bad as this weapon is, I find the utility in it to be very useful. Sniper- Classic Getting noscopes are amazing.

53,vulnerability,tf2,Had an idea for a Southern Hospitality rework,2,db7pyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/db7pyl/had_an_idea_for_a_southern_hospitality_rework/,2019-09-30 16:51:56,"\+100% crit rate on cloaked targets \+30% movement speed while equipped \-No random critical hits \-20% swing speed \-30% explosive vulnerability while equipped &amp;#x200B; An expansion on the whole concept of an anti-Spy wrench. While the current Southern Hospitality has a niche in the realm of tracking down cloaked Spies, it's just that; a niche. You only really use it if the enemy team has an annoying Spy that constantly harasses your sentries. Instead, this new version would make it such that how effective it is against Spies comes down to how well your team coordinates and how well you yourself can read the Spy's movements. A decently well-coordinated team already has a number of ways to mark a cloaked Spy; Scout's milk, Sniper's Jarate, Pyro's flamethrower, etc, so if you get someone else to mark the cloaked Spy, not only can you already see him, but you can respond to him that much faster and put him down in a second. Alternatively, if you can't see him, you can still predict his movements, and if you're right, it's an instant respawn timer for him. On the Spy's end of things, this doesn't change the strategy much: don't get caught when trying to sap an Engineer's buildings. If you *do* happen to get caught, don't be stupid about how you try to get away. Baiting an Engie around a corner, away from his Sentry, presents itself as a good escape opportunity; the speed boost means he's in a better position to follow you, and therefore more likely to do just that (and promptly get matador'd), while if he doesn't follow you, you've basically gotten away, since you now have the benefit of being visually obscured and having cover from any potential attacks. &amp;#x200B; Secondarily, this wrench has utility value in expanding the Engineer's operational area. When paired with the Rescue Ranger, he's basically a Scout that can fix any building he can see, which gives him the ability to cover a lot of ground. On the flip side of things, this wrench on its own suffers in that it makes any given nest less sustainable and not quite so easy to set up; the reduced swing speed also translates to a reduced repair and upgrade rate. Plus, Engineer's *other* counter classes (Demomen) can disable him easily just by making sure he's in the blast radius of their stickybombs prior to detonating them. &amp;#x200B; That's just my take/idea, though. Thoughts from the crowd?"

Preemting buthurt non-unboxer responces: &gt;""Why not delete them!"" I'll give you one thing; a while ago people figured out the exact method to craft golden wrenches 100% of the time when that event was going off, and Valve responded but deleting the wrenches and banning the people who exploited the event. *But* the golden wrenches were crafted using in game items, as apposed to bought with real money. Once money gets involved there are legal protections that prevent valve from taking those items away. &gt;""They cheated to get them!"" It's not cheating. That seems like semantical argument at surface level, but still pretty important distinction. It was exploiting an unintended use of ingame mechanics, it's an exploit. People don't like being lumped in with hackers and the likes, so for the sake of the conversation, don't call people cheaters for unboxing... 'cuz they're not. 2. Give out CL to people who didnt exsploit the situation. ""B-b-but it's not cheating!"" "" I want to feel special for getting the same hat back in 2009, and new people getting the hat will make me feel bad!"" Yeah yeah. Call it ""Exploiters Lament"" instead or whatever, the principle behind it is the same; reward people for not taking advantage of a vulnerability in the economy. Preemting buthurt unboxer responces: &gt;""But you were asleep!!!!! You would of done the same!!!1!"" No, time zones exist. I was awake and playing TF2 for pretty much the whole time the crates were available, and I didn't exploit the economy for my own gain. To qoute the hat it's self; [""Though some would stop at nothing to achieve hats, you remained resolute and incorruptible in your quest for head decorations. For that, you have been rewarded.""](URL Seems quite fitting to this situation, does it not? &gt;""It's unfair!! Why punish players for Valves own mistake!!"" If you think that giving out a hat to people is somehow a punishment to the people who don't get the hat, it's not. Positive feedback for one group of people isn't inherently negative feedback for the other. If you want something out of this fiasco, look at your unusual. &gt;""You lament beggers are sooooo eletist! what give you the right to look down on me!"" If you that I'm only bringing this up for some ""holier than thou"" talking point, no, the point is to incentivize people not to exploit the economy. Now that the two most controvercial points are out of the way, lets continue. 3. Give the unboxed hats a specal prefix Personaly I'd prefer a ""communist"" prefix. It fits in with the cold war theme of the game. But the prefix it's self doesn't matter, what does if that they are disiguishable to regular unusuals. 4. (Not necessarily needed but people seem to like this idea) Change the effect so the unusual is more destinct for legit unusuals. Personally I'm against the notion of completely changing the effect, It would probably upset some people who prefer their old effect and kind feels like a reward for the people who want an uber exclusive item out of this. I think maybe the effect could not play it's animation, or could have a holographic overlay. It just needs to be a tell that the hat is different from normal unusuals while not making the item inherently more desirable than regular unusuals. So why did I make this post if I'm just going repeat ideas already talked about? I don't know, just felt compelled to make this. It probably too late anyway, it's already Monday where I am, so valve most likely already has a plan on what to do."

People who acquired the unusuals from bugged crates didn't go through some complex and cryptic method to get them, no software failure or vulnerability was taken advantage by these people. Buying some keys and opening some crates, or simply buying stuff on the SCM, isnt exploiting the game in any way. Imagine if a company responsible for making collectible cards made a lot of booster packs that, by mistake, only contained rare and special cards. Would people who bought and opened these booster packs be exploiting anything? Should the cards they got be taken from them because of a manufacture error? Are the consumers who didn't buy the booster packs deserving of compensation, if they didn't spend not lost anything? People need to stop being salty about not participating in the unboxing spree that took place last week. Btw, I didn't unbox and I don't think I should be getting anything because of that."

Got that? Alright, let's dive into the trash heap of annoying weapons.** &amp;#x200B; Scout: Force-a-Nature. This weapon is regarded as a nuisance for many obvious reasons. The knock back on the first shot is what gives this weapon the title of ""I can't be bothered to use this weapon as intended, so I must use cheap gimmicks to bounce people off of ledges, where they will die. I will then proceed to use the Schadenfreude Taunt and tell my enemies how much they are supposedly bad at the game."" If you really think that this Stereotype is still a thing, you may be right, but this is not 2016. The Force a Nature's intended use is to flank and get picks on classes with important roles. The 2 shot clip is not only an a e s t h e t i c choice but a game intended one, as the 2 shot reload is the perfect time for the enemy to kill you. But what's that? Faster Firing Speed?

dealing crits to burning players on a class with literally no way to ignite his enemies ? a solution to this is adding a way for this weapon to deal crits to players, maybe like the sandman and assassin, it could have a projectile the deal after burn for 5 seconds Changes : * Added : Alt fire : launches a tiny sun that ignites players on contact for 5 seconds, the sun bounces of walls and ground 3 times before disappearing if it doesn't hit anything, can hit wearer and damage him * Added : wearer never takes after burn while holding this weapon * Removed the fire resistance &amp;#x200B; **2 - Soldier :** \- **The black box** This thing encourages the most unfun way of playing soldier, the coward, passive E spamming soldier which is not fun at all, this is due to the fact that you gain a good number of health for hitting a target, a nice change i see will fix this is adding a health ramp up, basically if you hit a target, you gain say 15 hp, however hitting the same target again gives you 20 instead and killing the target (or just shooting them a third time) gives you the full 30, this reduces the health gained to 65 health per clip instead of 75 but promotes a more aggressive playstyle as you will have to target a player in order to get the full benefit Changes : * Removed : 25 health on kill * Added : Health restored from hitting a target ramps up when hitting the same target multiple times, (15 - 20 - 30), this is reduced to (10 - 15 - 25) if the player is using the concheror as well \- **The gun boats** While the gunboats are currently useful, they aren't as helpful as other rocket jumping based secondaries, the base jumper switches up your air velocity, the mannreads switches up your air control but the gunboats only reduces damage taken from rocket jumping which can be easily avoided by using liberty launcher, air strike, and the rocket jumper, it just doesn't compete well Changes : * Added : -50% fall damage when equiped * Added : +20% distance from a rocket jump \- **The righteous bison** I watch soundsmith Changes : * Increased the frequency of the damage dealt in order to deal the full pre meet your match damage &amp;#x200B; **3 - Pyro :** \- **Manmelter** This weapon is alright with the phlog but that is about it, its secondary fire is pointless on pyros with the ability to airblast, a good suggestion i heared is to reduce the cooldown on the secondary fire and increase its range so it is always more beneficial to use this alt fire rather than the airblast Changes : * Increased the range of the alt fire * Reduced the cooldown between each alt fire * Visual change : the liquid in the tube now disappears after shooting once and refills, illustrating the time for when it is ready to be fired again \- **The gas passer** This is useless.....like seriously it is so useless, i have no idea what this weapon was designed for, i think it needs a rework, and i think the mvm version of it might work well New states : * Lingers on the ground and releases a cloud of gas * if the pyro ignites this gas with his flame thrower it an explosion occurs dealing 150 damage to all people inside it * progress of recharged saved after death * dealing damage recharges the passer faster * 50% holster and deployment time penalty \- **Sharpened volcano fragment** This thing is funny, like seriously why the bonk would you use this on pyro ? a good way of buffing this thing is making it a demoknight like weapon, you know, open a new sub class for pyro Changes : * Added : On hit, build ""Eruption"" * Alt fire : activate eruption : mini crits on melee, +25 max health and a speed boost for 10 seconds, however you are only limited to your melee &amp;#x200B; **4 - Demoman :** \- **Ullapoor caber** This weapon was too powerful back when suicide demo was a thing, but now it is really ineffective, increasing the damage to 125 instead of 75 would be good imo, and allowing it to recharge instead of needing to go to the spawn will make this weapon really fun again Changes : * increased damage to 125 * added : ullapool caber has a 20 second recharge instead of needing to go to spawn \- **Claidheamh mor** A simple change, remove the damage vulnerability, it won't quite bring bing-bong demo back because of the new tide turner state, but it would still help Change""s"" : * Removed the damage vulnerability \- **Scotman's skullcutter** \*clears throat\* REMOVE . RANDOM . CRITS . FROM . IT ...... SERIOUSLY !!! Change : * Added : no random crits &amp;#x200B; **5 - Heavy :** \- **The brass beast** This weapon is obviously meant for defense, but because of its powerful downsides, it is almost impossible to get a benefit from the 20% more damage Changes : * Reduced the movement speed penalty from 60% to 30% * Added : knockback (including airblast) immunity when spinning the barrel * Added : -75% damage from all critical hits when spinning the barrel \- **The huo-long heater** This weapon's states trades powerful damage output for ambushing enemies and teamwork, however, due to heavy's limited mobility and almost no communication in pubs, this weapon isn't helpful for the heavy in any way Changes : * Removed the damage penalty * Enemy players jumping over the rings (spies) will still be pushed away when a new ring forms \- **The steak sandvich** Well, this might be the memest weapon tf2 has (even more so than the pan, random crits, baby), the damage vulnerability, the hidden downside of not healing anything when consumed, the death trap that is ""being limited to your melee for SIXTEEN seconds"", it is just a big mess, however if this weapon heals heavy when consumed and not make him more vulnerable to damage, it would open new possibilities for heavy sub-classes which is really REALLY needed right now Changes : * removed the damage vulnerability * Added : heals 200 hp when consumed \- **Warrior's spirit** bring back the old ones from pre meet your match....plz... - a former heavy main \- **The eviction notice** The health drain mechanic is a good balance for the gloves of running urgency, because the 30% movement speed makes you run real fast for a heavy and the marked for death gimmick wasn't important as you can just run into the battlefield and take them off before starting to fire, but now you will have to be more careful, that being said the same thing can't be said to TEN, this weapon is used only for jojo memes and just being a fun weapon, thats it, GORU is a much better weapon for heavies who want to play the game right but TEN is for heavies who just wanna have fun, the health drain is not good for TEN Changes : * Removed the health drain * Added : 20% damage vulnerability if not speed boosted (so it goes away when you hit someone until you lose your boost) &amp;#x200B; **6 - Engineer :** \-**The frontier justice** this weapon + gunslinger is a fun police if i have ever seen one, because of how disposable minis are and how easy it is to get crits with them because of their easy assists and unexpected placement leading to easy kills, this weapon becomes a greifing weapon and un-fun to fight against Changes * mini-sentry assists no longer grants crits, mini-sentry kills only grant 1 crit \- **The pomson 6000** This weapon is bad....like really it is so freaking bad, the uber drain and cloak drain are unfair and not effective and it is just a big mess, a rework is nice imo, engie doesn't have an anti spy weapon sooooo.... Changes : * Removed the uber/cloak drain mechanic * Added : shooting a friendly sapped sentry will disable the sapper for 3 seconds while also removing the 33% damage resistance to revolvers for that duration * Saving a building (I.e destroying the sapper and healing the building) grants you a crit, crits are stored in a secondary chamber and only fire them with M2 \- **The panic attack** This weapon is the best example of ""something that only works as a secondary and is useless as a primary"", currently the panic attack is a good secondary but a terrible primary, i say the old stats should be brought back but only on engie, not heavy, pyro and soldier \- **The wrangler** I watch uncle dane, although i disagree on the part where he said that the shield should be removed completely, this weapon is only annoying and op due to the ""disabled sentry still has the shield"" thing that allows skilled engies to tank a freaking uber push Changes : * Reduced the damage resistance from 66% to 40% * Disabled sentries no longer has the shield on them &amp;#x200B; **7 - Medic :** \- **The overdose** with only 3 unlockable primaries, you would think that they all have a good use, nope. this thing is so pointless, due to the speed buff needing 100% uber and having your primary out Changes : * Made the speed buff passive * Reduced the required uber to gain the speed buff from 100% to 60% * Added : this weapon deals 100% more damage at 100% uber \- **The uber saw** This is a good weapon, but it is without a doubt op compared to other melees, see, this weapon almost has no downsides, rewards medic REALLY well for one swing and also has 100% crit rate, even if the gained uber on swing was nerfed, this weapon would still top as the best weapon for medic Changes : * Reduced uber gain from 25% to 20% * Added : no random crits * Added : +15 damage on swing * Added : -40% less uber built from fully healed players \- **Solemn vow** Look, you can scream all day about how this is a good weapon, it isn't, seeing your enemies health is only helpful on spy, not on medic (who btw shouldn't even be near enemies to begin with) Changes : * Added : when holding the weapon, medic can see enemies health, ammo in clip, enemy med's uber percentage and enemy engie's metal count * Removed the slower swing speed * Added : can't hit anyone with this weapon, so you basically have no melee (for both balance and the fact that IT LITERALLY SAYS DON'T HARM, WTF WOULD YOU SWING IT AT PEOPLE ""mostly for balance tho"") &amp;#x200B; **8 - Sniper** **- Sniper rifle, bazaar bargin, machina and hitman's heatmaker** Sniper is one of the strongest tf2 classes, in one shot you can kill anyone at any range with little skill needed (yeah yeah aiming and positing are skills, but when compared to other classes like soldier ""requiring skills in rocket jumping, comboing, controlling rockets, good retreating etc"" and spy and scout, sniper isn't really that skill based) a good nerf that will raise the skill needed to play sniper is by nerfing quick scooping, forcing the sniper to position himself well and time their unscoops Changes : * Non charged headshots deal 110 instead of 150 * fully charged headshots deal 400 instead of 450 &amp;#x200B; **9 - Spy** (side note, i was planning on proposing a diamondback nerf, then i watched mr P's video on the subject and it convinced me enough, recommend watching it if you hate TDM and want it to get nerfed) \- **The ambassador** Damn this thing, a powerful revolver that is currently useless and if buffed can trash all other revolvers, i had no idea how this should be buffed then i watched Soundsmith's video and his suggestion was great Changes : * Removed hte max headshot range, however the falloff still applies (watch soundsmith's heavy wishlist video for more details \-**The Enforcer** rework....just a big rework this thing is shit New stats : * \+25% damage against buildings * \-34% clip size * no random crits * \-10% damage against players \- **The big earner** this weapon is okay, however i think this change will increase its effectevness because -25 health is still too harsh (can you tell that i am getting tired ?) Changes : * Added : for the duration of the speed boost, the swing speed is increased by 50% \- **The red tape recorder** This weapon is interesting yet really useless, i am kinda tired so i will just cut into the cheese, spy hasn't any support weapons Changes : * This sapper now requires an additional swing to remove * this sapper can be applied to friendly buildings, rewind the progress of any enemy sapper on it (so for example, if a friendly sentry is sapped, apply this to heal it back, it won't destroy the sapper until the engie removes it and the rewind doesn't beat the damage, so this means it will eventually get destroyed) &amp;#x200B; well, thanks for reading this post that i spent 4 hours on and am pretty sure no one would read to the end, please tell me what you think."

Change : * Added : no random crits &amp;#x200B; **5 - Heavy :** \- **The brass beast** This weapon is obviously meant for defense, but because of its powerful downsides, it is almost impossible to get a benefit from the 20% more damage Changes : * Reduced the movement speed penalty from 60% to 30% * Added : knockback (including airblast) immunity when spinning the barrel * Added : -75% damage from all critical hits when spinning the barrel \- **The huo-long heater** This weapon's states trades powerful damage output for ambushing enemies and teamwork, however, due to heavy's limited mobility and almost no communication in pubs, this weapon isn't helpful for the heavy in any way Changes : * Removed the damage penalty * Enemy players jumping over the rings (spies) will still be pushed away when a new ring forms \- **The steak sandvich** Well, this might be the memest weapon tf2 has (even more so than the pan, random crits, baby), the damage vulnerability, the hidden downside of not healing anything when consumed, the death trap that is ""being limited to your melee for SIXTEEN seconds"", it is just a big mess, however if this weapon heals heavy when consumed and not make him more vulnerable to damage, it would open new possibilities for heavy sub-classes which is really REALLY needed right now Changes : * removed the damage vulnerability * Added : heals 200 hp when consumed \- **Warrior's spirit** bring back the old ones from pre meet your match....plz... - a former heavy main \- **The eviction notice** The health drain mechanic is a good balance for the gloves of running urgency, because the 30% movement speed makes you run real fast for a heavy and the marked for death gimmick wasn't important as you can just run into the battlefield and take them off before starting to fire, but now you will have to be more careful, that being said the same thing can't be said to TEN, this weapon is used only for jojo memes and just being a fun weapon, thats it, GORU is a much better weapon for heavies who want to play the game right but TEN is for heavies who just wanna have fun, the health drain is not good for TEN Changes : * Removed the health drain * Added : 20% damage vulnerability if not speed boosted (so it goes away when you hit someone until you lose your boost) &amp;#x200B; **6 - Engineer :** \-**The frontier justice** this weapon + gunslinger is a fun police if i have ever seen one, because of how disposable minis are and how easy it is to get crits with them because of their easy assists and unexpected placement leading to easy kills, this weapon becomes a greifing weapon and un-fun to fight against Changes * mini-sentry assists no longer grants crits, mini-sentry kills only grant 1 crit \- **The pomson 6000** This weapon is bad....like really it is so freaking bad, the uber drain and cloak drain are unfair and not effective and it is just a big mess, a rework is nice imo, engie doesn't have an anti spy weapon sooooo.... Changes : * Removed the uber/cloak drain mechanic * Added : shooting a friendly sapped sentry will disable the sapper for 3 seconds while also removing the 33% damage resistance to revolvers for that duration * Saving a building (I.e destroying the sapper and healing the building) grants you a crit, crits are stored in a secondary chamber and only fire them with M2 \- **The panic attack** This weapon is the best example of ""something that only works as a secondary and is useless as a primary"", currently the panic attack is a good secondary but a terrible primary, i say the old stats should be brought back but only on engie, not heavy, pyro and soldier \- **The wrangler** I watch uncle dane, although i disagree on the part where he said that the shield should be removed completely, this weapon is only annoying and op due to the ""disabled sentry still has the shield"" thing that allows skilled engies to tank a freaking uber push Changes : * Reduced the damage resistance from 66% to 40% * Disabled sentries no longer has the shield on them &amp;#x200B; **7 - Medic :** \- **The overdose** with only 3 unlockable primaries, you would think that they all have a good use, nope. this thing is so pointless, due to the speed buff needing 100% uber and having your primary out Changes : * Made the speed buff passive * Reduced the required uber to gain the speed buff from 100% to 60% * Added : this weapon deals 100% more damage at 100% uber \- **The uber saw** This is a good weapon, but it is without a doubt op compared to other melees, see, this weapon almost has no downsides, rewards medic REALLY well for one swing and also has 100% crit rate, even if the gained uber on swing was nerfed, this weapon would still top as the best weapon for medic Changes : * Reduced uber gain from 25% to 20% * Added : no random crits * Added : +15 damage on swing * Added : -40% less uber built from fully healed players \- **Solemn vow** Look, you can scream all day about how this is a good weapon, it isn't, seeing your enemies health is only helpful on spy, not on medic (who btw shouldn't even be near enemies to begin with) Changes : * Added : when holding the weapon, medic can see enemies health, ammo in clip, enemy med's uber percentage and enemy engie's metal count * Removed the slower swing speed * Added : can't hit anyone with this weapon, so you basically have no melee (for both balance and the fact that IT LITERALLY SAYS DON'T HARM, WTF WOULD YOU SWING IT AT PEOPLE ""mostly for balance tho"") &amp;#x200B; **8 - Sniper** **- Sniper rifle, bazaar bargin, machina and hitman's heatmaker** Sniper is one of the strongest tf2 classes, in one shot you can kill anyone at any range with little skill needed (yeah yeah aiming and positing are skills, but when compared to other classes like soldier ""requiring skills in rocket jumping, comboing, controlling rockets, good retreating etc"" and spy and scout, sniper isn't really that skill based) a good nerf that will raise the skill needed to play sniper is by nerfing quick scooping, forcing the sniper to position himself well and time their unscoops Changes : * Non charged headshots deal 110 instead of 150 * fully charged headshots deal 400 instead of 450 &amp;#x200B; **9 - Spy** (side note, i was planning on proposing a diamondback nerf, then i watched mr P's video on the subject and it convinced me enough, recommend watching it if you hate TDM and want it to get nerfed) \- **The ambassador** Damn this thing, a powerful revolver that is currently useless and if buffed can trash all other revolvers, i had no idea how this should be buffed then i watched Soundsmith's video and his suggestion was great Changes : * Removed hte max headshot range, however the falloff still applies (watch soundsmith's heavy wishlist video for more details \-**The Enforcer** rework....just a big rework this thing is shit New stats : * \+25% damage against buildings * \-34% clip size * no random crits * \-10% damage against players \- **The big earner** this weapon is okay, however i think this change will increase its effectevness because -25 health is still too harsh (can you tell that i am getting tired ?) Changes : * Added : for the duration of the speed boost, the swing speed is increased by 50% \- **The red tape recorder** This weapon is interesting yet really useless, i am kinda tired so i will just cut into the cheese, spy hasn't any support weapons Changes : * This sapper now requires an additional swing to remove * this sapper can be applied to friendly buildings, rewind the progress of any enemy sapper on it (so for example, if a friendly sentry is sapped, apply this to heal it back, it won't destroy the sapper until the engie removes it and the rewind doesn't beat the damage, so this means it will eventually get destroyed) &amp;#x200B; well, thanks for reading this post that i spent 4 hours on and am pretty sure no one would read to the end, please tell me what you think."
63,vulnerability,tf2,Possible Pyro Fix,0,bs9ynz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/bs9ynz/possible_pyro_fix/,2019-05-24 09:43:58,"So the main issue as I see it with Pyro is there not being enough to teach players to be strategic as Pyro. Insert W M1 joke here. So instead of changing Pyro as a whole, Pyro as a class should punish these tactics. Here is how I propose it be done. *[Every flamethrower] While continuously dispensing flames, Pyro gains a damage vulnerability of 2% per second after 1 second, capping at 20%. This can be displayed as an ""Overheat"" meter. *Damage vurnability resets after an air blast, firing a different weapon, or touching a resupply. This nerfs the Backburner and the Phlogesinator(probably misspelled that) more heavily due to their higher airblast cost/lack of one. The way I'd hope this would work (I am not a programmer) is that by puffing the flamethrower, it would not build up Overheat, thus not limiting spy checking as much. As an example, a pyro runs at a group of people and starts attacking, they build up Overheat, thus putting them at a disadvantage. Their options could be A. Switch to a different weapon to try to finish them or combo. B. Air blast them away and try to flee or reflank them. C. Move back to the resupply now that they have given a strong distraction to help their team. I'd love to hear thoughts, especially from people who know how the weapons in the game and their stats function."
64,vulnerability,tf2,Heavy's weapons tier list,6,bsbsf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/bsbsf0/heavys_weapons_tier_list/,2019-05-24 12:56:10,"So, I know tier lists are everywhere, but since we are waiting for what we hope is the ~~localization files~~ Heavy Update, I think that trying to see what weapons need to see some adjustments and why, and a tier list is an easy way to visualize it [URL List) So, let's start from bottom to top, but first a little disclaimer: This tier list is based on my experience and opinions as a heavy main, if you see that your favourite weapon is in the low or trash tier, don't see it as a personal attack, I tried to stay objective, but as a human my opinion is biased, but I've tested every weapon in this class' arsenal for an extensive amount of time, I'd just love to see them all become viable one day. So, let's start &amp;nbsp; # Trash Tier This weapons have either no use, or another weapon already fully covers their use cases &amp;nbsp; ## The Warrior's Spirit Ugh, it might be faster to say what's good with this weapon... Nothing, this weapon is good for absolutely nothing, it should be a high risk high reward melee, but let's break down it's stats: **+30% damage bonus** So, a melee weapon with a damage bonus, with 85 base damage and an attack interval of 0.8s, a HUGE 106.25 dps! But at melee range, you know what has a better dps at that range? A minigun! But it allows you to kill non overhealed medics in 2 hits instead of 3 **+50 health restored on kill** This stat is good enough to give it a niche, together with the increased damage it might make it good-ish as a ""last hope"" when you're out of ammo and low on health, if it stopped here it would become a low tier, or even mid tier weapon, but no, being a melee on the slowest class in the game isn't a big enough downside, they needed to make it useless **30% damage vulnerability on wearer** This, this is a useless downside that makes a mediocre weapon useless, you're using a melee weapon, and you're the slowest class in the game, and you take 30% more damage, it's like standing with your mittens in a corner against a team full of lime scouts, you'll end up dead in a couple of seconds, what a nice 50 health bonus I can get with that kill, but I don't like waiting for respawn &amp;nbsp; So, this is supposed to a last ditch kind of weapon, but it's not good at it, and there's 2 more with a similar role, we'll see them later &amp;nbsp; ## The Fists This is a stock weapon, why is it this low? The Holiday Punch exists, it's a direct upgrade, making the fists worse, and as you see in the image I put the mittens in low tier, so this goes in the trash. &amp;nbsp; ## The Brass Beast Let's start by saying, I love this weapon, but it has some huge downsides and negligible upsides, it could go in Low Tier if it wasn't for a shared stat with another weapon, let's break them down: **+20% damage bonus** This upside is useless, miniguns already have the highest dps in the game, this could be removed with little to no change. **-20% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up** Remember when they added this stat, but without the ""below 50% health"" condition? I was so hyped, it made this from a bad weapon to a somewhat usable one, if we need to do something, remove the damage bonus and that condition **50% slower spin up time** **-60% slower move speed while deployed** Grouping these 2 together, it's not the downsides to make this weapon useless, it's the fact that it doesn't really have upsides. &amp;nbsp; So, what can Valve do for it? Make it a 100% defensive option, remove the damage bonus and make the damage resistance always apply when spun up &amp;nbsp; # Low Tier These weapons are either gimmicky or require very specific setups to become viable &amp;nbsp; ## The Buffalo Steak Sandvich This weapon is bad, but it has it's niche, very fast rollouts, this plus a speed increasing melee allows you to reach the game's speed cap, as for stats, they're quite self explainatory. **After consuming, move speed is increased, attacks mini-crit, and the player may only use melee weapons. Lasts 16 seconds.** **Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit)** &amp;nbsp; ## Huo-Long Heater A gimmicky primary, fun to use but not very useful compared to the others (Except the bad beast). **Creates a ring of flames while spun up** This should be used to avoid spies, but they can jump over it, nice gimmick but gets old fast **25% damage bonus vs burning players** This allows for a flank heavy playstyle, if it wasn't for the slow base speed of the class, it destroys enemies in close range, and it's fun to use when you have a pyro in your team **-10% damage penalty** So, as we'll see later with the Tomislav (spoiler!) a lower dps doesn't affect miniguns' viability too much, so we can ignore this **Consumes an additional 4 ammo per second while spun up** And here's the elephant in the room, the Heater is the only weapon I end up running out of ammo with, it forces you to stay close to the cart in payload or a dispenser in any other gamemode, maybe it should be replaced with a less annoying downside, or make the ring of fire more useful. &amp;nbsp; ## The Holiday Punch So, this weapon has the exact same stats as the stock fists, but with a gimmick: **Critical hit forces victim to laugh** **Always critical hit from behind** **On Hit: Force enemies to laugh who are also wearing this item** **Critical hits do no damage** It's the stock, but can be used to deny uber, now, not as useful as it seems, but it still makes the stock worthless in comparison, stock melees are usually bad, so the problem isn't with this one but with melees in general. &amp;nbsp; # Mid Tier All around good weapons, but they're either outclassed by their alternatives, or just not good enough to reach an higher tier &amp;nbsp; ## The KGB Now we start with the balanced weapons, the KGB is a fun gimmicky weapon, I love to use it with the Tomislav, but we are not here for my personal opinions (even though this whole list is based on it). **On Kill: 5 seconds of 100% critical chance** This upside is great if paired with a shotgun or the tomislav, no other minigun can use it due to the rev speed. **-20% slower firing speed** Let's face it, you won't even notice this downside unless you're playing medieval, you'll swing a couple of times then go on a crit killing spree with your shotgun. &amp;nbsp; Overall a good weapon, but there's better stuff &amp;nbsp; ## The Shotguns I'll group them all in one spot, they're all equally viable, and won't break down their stats, but the only reason they're not higher in this list is thanks to the absence of a dedicated lunch box slot (Valve come on, just give it to us) &amp;nbsp; ## The Eviction Notice Before Jungle Inferno this and the GRU would have been swapped... **+40% faster firing speed** Let's face it, this is only useful if you're trying to cosplay as a Jojo character, but it helps to connect your hits more consistently **On Hit: Gain a speed boost** **+15% faster move speed on wearer** So, these make it one of the two ""Last Ditches"" I was talking about with the Warrior's Spirit, useful to run away, but not as useful as the GRU **-60% damage penalty** This just compensates for the faster firing speed, let's ignore it, fists are not used for damage **Maximum health is drained while item is active** So, compared to the GRU, you don't get that much use of the extra speed gained by draining your health, this is why I rate it below them &amp;nbsp; ## The Dalokohs Bar This was the ""I don't have a medic in my team"" lunchbox before the introduction of the Second Banana **Adds +50 max health for 30 seconds** That +50 health allows you to survive one extra rocket, pill or meatshot, quite useful but it's not as reliable as the Sandvich or the Banana **Eat to gain up to 100 health.** **Alt-fire: Share chocolate with a friend (Small Health Kit)** It's a portable small healthkit, nothing more to say, it's a good weapon, but there are better options &amp;nbsp; ## The Natascha You know, when the enemy team has that annoying lime scout, and he keeps going with his kill -&gt; taunt -&gt; lenny bind true combo? Yeah, you probably already picked this weapon just by reading that... **On Hit: 100% chance to slow target** This stat is interesting but quite annoying, having your movement options denied is not fun, but it compensates Heavy's lack of mobility by bringing his enemies on the same level **-20% damage resistance when below 50% health and spun up** This should just be removed, being defensive is the Bad Beast's job and this weapon's viability wouldn't change at all **-25% damage penalty** **30% slower spin up time** The downsides are fair enough for something that counters scouts (and a good scout is seriously hard to track with your minigun), this is a very good weapon that is not in the high tier just because there are 2 better, more reliable and less situational miniguns &amp;nbsp; # High Tier The best weapons in Heavy's arsenal, you're probably going to run 1 or 2 of them at all time unless you're going for a meme loadout &amp;nbsp; ## The Second Banana The joke weapon Heavy got for jungle inferno, but arguably the best thing added in that update **+50% increase in charge recharge rate** 11 seconds, it seems almost instant, this makes it great for when you don't have a medic **-33% healing effect** Barely noticeable, the situation's you'll have to heal for more than 100 health aren't that common and you can still run to a medikit in cases of emergency **Eat to gain health** **Alt-fire: Share banana with a friend (Small Health Kit)** Same as the Dalokohs bar, and the reason that weapon is mid tier and not high tier (but it will stay in the high tier of our hearts) &amp;nbsp; ## The Fists of Steel An overall great utility for nonexistant downsides **-40% damage from ranged sources while active** This allows you to tank fully charged headshots, run away from difficult situations, body block your friendly engineer's sentry from projectile spam, it gives you so much effective health! **+100% damage from melee sources while active** Let's face it, how many times you're in melee range of your target and he's not already dead? (With the exception of scouts) So yeah, we can ignore this **This weapon holsters 100% slower** Did you know that the damage resistance starts applying as soon as you hit the weapon switch key? And that by switching back to your primary right after you can deny this downside? **-40% maximum overheal on wearer** For some reason this still only applies when the weapon is active, so to avoid it you just have to switch out, have your medic stop healing and then start doing it again **-40% health from healers on wearer** This is a big downside, but having a large health pool compensates for it &amp;nbsp; ## The GRU Remember some heavy youtubers were crying because the JI nerf was going to make this useless? Yeah, this is now the Escape Plan on steroids (thanks for the analogy Big Joey), huge speed boost at big downside, but not big enough to hurt this weapon's viability **+30% faster move speed on wearer** You move around the same speed as the ""average speed"" classes, but you have a minigun, they don't **This weapon holsters 50% slower** Another holster speed downside, the same from the FoS applies for this, it's barely noticeable **Maximum health is drained while item is active** This makes it harder to use this weapon for rollouts, but it makes it a great tool for escape tool as you no longer take increased damage &amp;nbsp; ## The Minigun and the Tomislav Going to group these 2 together, as they cover the exact same role in two different ways, the minigun is more destructive, having higher damage at close range but having a harder time hitting with all your bullets at medium range. Meanwhile the tomislav with it's better accuracy is a better tool for medium range combat and long range harassment, and the silent killer stat makes it great for ambushes. These are probably the primaries you're going to run 90% of the time depending on your playstyle &amp;nbsp; # Sandvich Tier Do I have to explain this? &amp;nbsp; ## The Sandvich This is the best weapon for heavy, there's almost no reason not to run it, great utility at no cost, what could move it down a spot? Having a dedicated lunchbox slot! It's the reason shotguns aren't higher in the list, they have the downside of not being the Sandvich, healing 100% of your health or 50% of your medic's health, being able to replace small healthpacks with medium ones, this is the best weapon for this class, if not one of the best in the entire game &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This took longer than i was expecting, if you think something should be moved up or down, or disagree with me on something I'd be happy to have a discussion, so let me know!"

66,vulnerability,tf2,Move the Buffalo Steak to Heavy's primary weapon slot,3,bxfmw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/bxfmw4/move_the_buffalo_steak_to_heavys_primary_weapon/,2019-06-06 21:29:47,"Theres a bunch of suggestions out there on replacements for the Heavys primary weapon that makes him more of a tank. I dont believe giving Heavy a riot shield or equivalent and making him even more durable is a good idea; theres a reason people hate playing against turtling strategies and why a single coordinated medic combo can push in an entire casual server. As such, I also wanted to come up with a replacement for the Minigun that made Heavy more focused on offense or sharing sandwiches, and some TF2 4chan threads helped me realize this. Moving the Steak Sandvich to Heavy's primary weapon slot and removing the ""locked to using melee"" attribute allows him to play as a more aggressive fat scout or as a sandvich fountain for his team, and still lets him run around and go JoJo all over his enemies. Other potential changes to it could be re-adding damage vulnerability on consumption since it would still allow use of a shotgun or boosting sandvich recharge rates to double down on sandvich tossing, but I believe that this is what could give Heavy the extra variety he needs. ^^^and it fixes its comp problem of being better than GRU"

Today, I take on the task of fixing the Baby Face's blaster. **The legend** The Baby Face's blaster is a primary with a unique idea:Making the scoot fastah. It used to slow the Scout down by 50%, but in turn, give him an increased running speed after doing 100 damage. However, if you jumped, you lost all your boost. It was a fun gimmick. *Then, everything changed when the Gaben nation attacked.* Suddenly, you lose boost only when you double jump, and only a bit, not the whole, and the slowdown was only by 10%. But a glich in the matrix happened. You became so fast that you outran your own HITBOX. This meant hitting the scunt was near impossible, and the players knew that. So they let the game dodge bullets for them. *Then, everything changed when the Gaben nation attacked.* *Again.* You lose boost when hit. Your whole boost meter was completely gone a very small amount of damage. How much? *TWENTY. FIVE.* TWO PISTOL SHOTS, WHAT THE FUCK, GABE-*ahem*. This made the weapon unplayable. Anyways, I've rambled on for far too long, so let's get on to the changes. **Stats** (key: *italics* = new stat, ~~strikethrough~~ = old stat being removed) The Baby Face's Blaster: + On Hit: Builds Boost Run speed increased with Boost + *35% extra pellets per shot* - *50% wider spread* - -34% clip size - 10% slower move speed on wearer - *While equipped:* Boost reduced on air jumps ~~- Boost reduced when hit~~ - *20% damage vulnerability when Boost is full* - *This weapon deploys and holsters slower* **Playstyle** These new stats force the Scout to be closer to the target for more damage, which is great with the increased run speed. The boost being reduced on damage is removed because it was too much of a hindrance. The 20% damage vulnerability ensures that, while the Scout is fast, if you can catch him, easy kill. This forces Scouts to be better at dodging. I also made it so that you can double jump without losing boost if you switch to another weapon.This is mostly for convenience. Due to the decreased switch speed, you can't switch weapons in a close quarters match, thus making you forced to use your singular jump."

74,vulnerability,tf2,Terrible Balance Ideas: Pyro,0,aztox8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/aztox8/terrible_balance_ideas_pyro/,2019-03-12 00:52:08,"Oh boy. Trying to balance the Pyro, everyones favorite claaaassss... Please leave your suggestions in the comments because I certainly have no idea what I'm doing. _**Primary**_: **Stock**: (/) Change damage falloff to be based on distance travelled instead of time since fired. (+) All afterburn reduces health and damage resistances by a fixed value of 25% on wearer. (-) Remove ""Afterburn reduces MediGun healing and resist shield effects by 20%"" (-) Increase firing interval from .044 seconds to .08 seconds (Same as ammo consumption interval). (-) Remove the ability for flames to penetrate players and buildings. (-) Remove the ability to extinguish players with airblast. (-) Remove damage ramp-up based on ""density of flames encountered""(I don't know what it means, and I don't think it ever functioned correctly in the first place). (-) Reduce base damage from 13 to 12. (+) Add +33% damage bonus on direct hit (i.e, the flame particles center hitting the players hitbox, similar to the Dragons Furys damage bonus). (+) Increase afterburn duration ramp-up from .4 seconds per hit to .8 seconds per hit. (-) Afterburn duration ramp-up is now only triggered on direct hit. Ok, so that's a lotta changes, but they're all neccesary to make the weapon more consistent, powerful and skill-based. A few of these changes could probably be classified as bug fixes, to be honest. The Flamethrower will now have higher and more consistent dps, but only if the user has good aim. You also can no longer extinguish your teammates, which makes it so that Pyro isn't one of the most effective counters to Pyro. **Degreaser**: (+) Reduce afterburn damage penalty from -66% to -50%. (+) Increase holster speed boost from +30% to +45%. (-) Reduce deploy speed boost from +60% to +45%. (-) Increase airblast cost from +25% to +50%. The Degreaser has 2 massive upsides that turn Pyro into the most efficient combo class in the game, at the costs of a hefty penalty to something unimportant, and a minor penalty to something that is. So when it came time to thinking about how to balance it, I went for the obvious solution. **Backburner**: (-) Add -25% damage penalty when not fired at the targets back. (-) Add No random critical hits. (+) Reduce airblast cost from -150% to -100%. The Backburner is annoying to fight against in a casual setting and has little utility in a competitive setting. These changes are designed to put more focus on the weapon as an ambush tool, with the benefit of an extra airblast. **Phlogistonator**: (/) Mmmph is now activated by pressing Reload instead of alt-fire. (+) Mmmph can now be built using any damage type, instead of just fire damage. (+) Replace no airblast with -150% airblast cost. (-) Mmmph now grants mini-crits instead of crits. (-) Replace 3 seconds of Uber on taunt with 3 seconds of all 3 Vaccinator charges. You are still unable to capture points while taunting. The Phlogistonator is annoying to fight against in a casual setting and has little utility in a competitive sett... waaaiiit, I already said that, didn't I? Anyways, These changes are designed to put more focus on the weapon as an ambush tool, with the benefit of wait I'm repeating myself again what the fuck _**Secondary**_: **Flare Gun**: (+) Add standard flare gun blast radius (110hu). (+) Add ability to destroy enemy stickybombs. (-) Change crits against burning players to mini-crits against burning players. For those who are unaware, the Flare Gun (and also the Mannmelter) currently has a bug that allows you to blast jump with it by firing it at certain angles. Or just crouch-jumping. Instead of fixing this bug, I propose we refine and incorporate this feature into the weapon, and nerf its combo potential to compensate. This makes the flare guns more consistent with each other, and therefore easier to pick up and use for newer players. **Scorch Shot**: (-) Knockback is now affected by the angle at which the flare hits. (-) Afterburn duration now decreases within the blast radius. 7.5 seconds on direct hit, 5 seconds near the centre, and 2.5 seconds at the blasts edge (Note: this change applies to all flare guns). (+) Reduce self damage force penalty from -35% to -25%. Most people find the Scorch annoying to fight against. These changes should make it more tolerable for the other team while not reducing the weapons overall effectiveness. **Mannmelter**: (+) Alt-fire can now remove all visible debuffs instead of just afterburn. (/) Removing a debuff now stores a charge for that debuff instead of a crit. Debuff-charged lasers will apply the selected debuff for 7.5 seconds in a standard flare gun radius (110hu). (/) Press Reload to cycle between debuffs (Afterburn, Bleed, Gas, Milk, Jarate/Marked-for-death, Slowdown). Debuff-charged lasers have particle effects based on which debuff they are firing. (-) Add ""Cannot ignite players without using an afterburn charge"" (-) Add -60% damage penalty vs buildings. The Mannmelters utility as a support weapon would already be increased if all of the other changes in this list were incorporated, but I wanted to make it even more support-focused. **Gas Passer**: (-) Gas can now bursts and spreads gas on walls. (-) Gas-coated Pyros can no longer be ignited. (-) Gas will no longer ignite upon taking self-damage. (+) Gas-coated players now take mini-crits from fire damage weapons. (+) Gas now counts as a wet substance. The ability to gas walls is a quick and dirty fix to a bug that allows the gascan to pass through thin walls. Otherwise, gas now has more combo potential with Pyros other weapons. _**Melee**_: **Powerjack**: (/) Replace -20% damage vulnerability with -5 max health per second while active (minimum of 60 health, health regenerates at a rate of up to 10 health per second while weapon is holstered). (/) Replace +25 health on kill with +50 max health on kill (max of 225 health). The Powerjack should probably follow similar rules to the GRU and Eviction Notice. Gaining max health on kill would make for a rather fun vampire playstyle in casual games. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment**: (+) Add ""Deals critical hit while airborne"" (-) Add ""No random critical hits"" So the Pyro has several aerial mobility tools, but no weapons that benefit from being airborne. He also has a rather useless melee option in the form of the SVF. Why not kill 2 scouts in one crit sticky and give the SVF crits while airborne? **Third degree**: (+) Add +10 health per enemy hit. (-) Add -30% slower holster and deploy. The Third Degree is the only literal straight upgrade weapon in the game, but its a very minor and situational upgrade to a weapon that isn't particularly useful. I've add a new upside that ties into its existing bonus and given it a penalty to compensate. Phew, that was an exhausting process. I'll adjust these suggestions based on feedback, so feel free to leave some. Thanks for reading and sorting by new."

Heavy weapons guy, my absolute favorite class in this game. MY main. With the next update expected to include Heavy balance changes alongside some new weapons when it eventually arrives in late 2037, now is the perfect time to explain what I think should be done to rebalance my favorite Russians arsenal. Of course, all you other Heavy mains (all 12 of you) should leave your ideas and suggestions in the comments. _**Primary**_: **Stock**: (+) Increase move speed while spun up from 37% to 38.33%. A tiny change, I know, but any extra speed while spun up is useful. Besides, this will make your spun-up movement a flat 50% of Heavys standard speed, which sates my OCD. **Natascha**: (/) Change fixed 113hu speed reduction on hit to a -50% speed reduction based on the targets movement speed. Much like the Sandman, the Natascha reduces the targets speed down to a fixed value instead of having it be based on the targets initial speed. With this change, higher mobility classes will be less affected by the speed reduction, making it a slightly less aggravating weapon to fight against. **Brass Beast**: (+) Reduce Spin-up duration from +50% to +40%. (+) Reduce Spun-up move speed penalty from -60% to -50%. The BBs main problem is how severe its downsides are in comparison to it's upside, so I elected to reduce the downsides slightly. In combination with the stock Minigun change, the BB would now allow you to move at a quarter of your base speed while spun up, instead of less than a fifth of it. **Huo-long Heater**: (/) Add caveat ""against non-burning players"" to -10% damage penalty The Heaters current damage penalty conflicts with its damage bonus against burning players, which is unnecessary. The weapon is hyper-niche and often useless as it is, so at least make one of its few upsides better. _**Secondary**_: **Dalokohs Bar**: (+) Increase health restored upon consumption from 100 to 150. Losing the ability to overheal yourself was one of the most crippling nerfs the Bar could've received, but it was a necessary one. Assuming the infinite health glitch can't be fixed, another solution could be to transfer the extra health you could gain from overheal into the Bars main healing pool. **Buffalo Steak Sandvich**: (-) Change the effects speed boost to only apply on hit. (+) Remove 20% damage vulnerability. The Steak is banned in sixes because you can get heavy to the midpoint of a 5cp map much faster, so change the boost to only apply on hit, similar to the Eviction Notice, and remove the damage vulnerability to compensate. Now you'll take less damage if you're just trying to have fun playing melee Heavy. **Family Business**: (/) Replace -15% damage penalty with -20% slower reload speed. The Jizzness is an absolutely pointless weapon. It has near identical DPS and STKs as the stock Shotgun, but the lower damage might reduce the range you can hit those STKs at. It serves the same function as Stock but does it slightly differently. How interesting (/s). Replace a damage penalty with a reload penalty and now you have a shotgun with higher DPS and DPC (damage per clip) that punishes you for blowing away all your shots. _**Melee**_: **Warriors Spirit**: (/) Replace 30% damage vulnerability while active to -20 max health on wearer. The Bearhands current damage vulnerabilty is way more sever than the old health penalty. Change it back. **Eviction Notice**: (-) Remove speed boost on hit. (+) Max health will now regenerate at 10hp per second (Same as GRU). My suggested Steak changes would make the Eviction Notice rather pointless, so how about we ditch the boost and instead improve the weapons utility by allowing you to recover health faster? **Fists of Steel**: (+) Remove 100% Melee damage vulnerability. The FoS already has plenty of more effective downsides. This way, you could use the FoS in a melee Heavy loadout in combination with the Steak. Well, that's it for now.

An optional thing you can select where you can join a server with people who around your level area, it could be sorted by badge rank or being around the specific level number Class Changes: * Heavy: * Warriors spirit: this idea is to make it more useful as a weapon in combination with the steak since they share the same set * Move health given on kills to steak (makes steak more of a choice is play outside of medieval mode) * Steak removes damage intake increase, probably * The damage intake increase only applies to ranged weapons * Steak sandvich: as was said in the warriors spirit, make it more useful in combination * Kills heal player by 50(-) health * Removes damage vulnerability on the Warriors spirit * Huo-long heater: increase its ammo from probably 50%-100% to counteract the fire ring consumption, and maybe make the fire ring * Pyro: * Hot hand: * make both slaps do the full amount of damage * If damage still split, maybe increase speed of the two slaps * Third degree: pretty much an upgrade to stock since it has no downsides but there are rare moments when one would want to melee someone who is being healed, so why not make the weapon unique * Does extra damage to overhealed players and players being healed (eating sandvich could count as being healed (exclusing steak)(50%(+) possible damage) * Does 20%(+/-) less damage overall * Hitting overhealed players heals you for about 15%(+?) of damage dealt * Gas passer: a cool concept but the weapon has not been used very much outside of mvm * make it so people covered in gas count as wet so the Neon Annihalator can be used more outside of being a shark * Fire damage further decreases the recharge rate more quickly, maybe make it apply to all damage * Medic: * Syringe guns: * Have a 15% increased in total accuracy for all syringe guns (that arent the Crossbow) * Blutsauger: Its generally not seem as much anymore in casual play so it is maybe deserving of a buff * Syringes shoot 10%+ faster * Clip size decreased by 25% MVM: * General Changes and ideas: * If another mvm focused update were to release: just some ideas to be implemented into a mvm related update (excluding any weapons outside of reskins, that could be included) * Add community made maps, it can be exclusively community maps if the TF2 team cant create a new map (I dont map) * Add new cosmetics and reskins as rewards for the new MVM campaigns and maps that are added, higher the difficulty the higher chance to unlock higher grade headwear and chance to get unusual or strange on campaign completion * Have a similar contract system to the community canteen crusher event if Tf2 is going to make it another event * Dont make it another robotic boogaloo invasion end of the line update * Rewards system: outside of australiums and killstreak kits, theres no reason to play mvm for its rewards, so the system will need to be improved * Australium weapons able to be earned on more than just the two cities campaign * Ever since the introduction of australium weapons for mvm it gave more reason to play mann up mode MVM but it also made an issue for Mann up Mode in general. The other campaigns, even the one the game ranks as the hardest, do not have australium weapons in their rewards pool and re exclusively available in two cities. So all campaigns (probably excluding easy leveled ones) should have australium weapons as rewards. Class changes: (i do not know how to balance credit prices, so if it seems uneven or unfair I apologize Pyro changes: * All flamethrowers (that have airblast): * $500 airblasted projectiles now crit instead of just minicrit * $150 (can be upgraded 4 times) extreme push force, can push enemies a longer distance backwards * Homewrecker: Is generally a kind of useless tool outside of helping engies when spies arrive, so why not make it also have some offensive capabilities * $250 extra building damage applies to robots (and removes the initial damage penalty) Spy: * Class specific: in terms of most META MVM matches, it is usually better to not have a spy * Spy has a larger credit pickup range, but not as large as scouts and heals less as scout as well * Red tape recorder: generally is not used * $300 can make a small amount of robots start fighting other robots or eachother"
79,vulnerability,tf2,Terrible Balance Ideas: Engineer,6,b239gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/b239gn/terrible_balance_ideas_engineer/,2019-03-17 19:49:48,"Engineer is a class in TF2. This means he has weapons. I'm going to give some ideas on how to balance them. You can leave your own ideas in the comments. _**Primary**_: **Rescue Ranger**: (-) Add ""Cannot regain ammo from supply cabinets"" The Rescue Ranger is banned in sixes because it theoretically allows the Engie to stall out pushes indefinitely by firing it at a sentry from the safety of the spawn room, so I suggest this small nerf to alleviate this concern. **Pomson 6000**: (+) Reduce fire delay from .8 seconds to .625 seconds (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (+) Reduce reload times from .92/.8 to .75/.55 seconds (same as Scattergun). (+) Increase clip size from 4 to 6 (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (+) Increase projectile speed from 1200 to 2400. (+) Reduce damage penalty vs buildings from -80% to -60%. (+) Increase damage ramp-up from 120% to 150% (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (-) Increase damage falloff from 53% to 50% (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (-) Reduce base damage from 60 to 40. (-) Remove ""Projectile cannot be deflected"" (/) Replace -10% Uber/Cloak drained on hit with ""Ignites players for up to 6 seconds on hit"" The Pomson is similar to the Bison, except its also very annoying to fight against as Medic or Spy. I've made similar changes to the P6K, but I've also replaced the uber and cloak drain with 2 to 6 seconds of afterburn based on range. This serves a similar purpose of countering Spies and Medics without draining one of their most important resources and also having an effect on other classes. _**Secondary**_: **Stock**: (+) Reduce reload time from 1.36 seconds to 1.25 seconds (Same as Scout). (-) Reduce reserve ammo from 200 to 180. Back when TF2 first came out, each classes shotguns had slightly different reload times but these were later standardized in an update. However, the same treatment was never given to the pistols. As compensation for this slight buff, I think it would be fair to remove some of Engies unnecessarily enormous ammo reserve just a tad. Now it's an even 5 times as much as scouts reserve. **Wrangler**: (-) Remove shield. (+) Add +60% blast damage reduction while active. Because everybody loves fighting level 3 sentries with 648 health. Uncle Dane recently made a similar suggestion, but I'm not 100% sure taking zero damage from sentry bullet and rocket jumps would be balanced so instead I gave the wrangler the same resistance as the Gunboats. **Short Circuit**: (-) Remove primary fire and rebind electrical orb to primary fire. (/) Remove ability to deal damage multiple times with a single projectile - now deals a consistent 35 damage once per target. (/) Orb will now explode on contact with surfaces, allowing Engineer to perform an Orb jump. (-) Remove stun. (-) Cannot be fired next to a wall (similar to the Flamethrower). (-) Add ""Wearer cannot collect metal from supply cabinets"" (+) Change hidden ""Cannot be crit boosted"" penalty to ""Mini-crits whenever it would normally crit"" (/) Add hidden ""Attacks pierce damage resistance effects and bonuses"" upside to the weapons description (+) Can now damage Scream Fortress bosses. The Short Circuit is banned in sixes for a similar reason as the Rescue Ranger, So I gave it a similar change. It has a useless primary fire and an alt-fire that is useful but prevents you from picking up buildings, so I removed the crappy taser attack and made the orb its primary fire, then made the orb less weird. Several of these changes are just bug fixes, to be honest. _**Melee**_: **Southern Hospitality**: (/) Replace 20% fire damage vulnerability on wearer with 20% damage vulnerbility while active. (+) Add +100% damage bonus vs buildings. The Southern Hospitality is almost a straight upgrade, provided that the enemy team doesnt have a Pyro and the server you're playing on has random crits disabled. It's also a very boring weapon, so I've changed the damage vulnerability to be more noticable and given it a new upside to make it better at its (presumably) intended role, countering Spies. So that's all the Engies changes I can think of. Thanks for reading and sorting by new!"
80,vulnerability,tf2,Terrible Balance Ideas: Medic,5,b3vjnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/b3vjnf/terrible_balance_ideas_medic/,2019-03-22 07:26:43,"The Medic has the smallest arsenal of all the classes in the game, so this post will be rather short. Leave your own ideas down below in the comments. _**Primary**_: **Stock**: (+) Increase projectile speed from 990hu to 1200hu. (+) Remove random projectile deviation. (-) Add ability for syringes to be airblasted. Changes ~~stolen from~~ inspired by my favourite TF2ber After Breakfast. **Blutsauger**: (/) Replace +3 health on hit with Up to 3 seconds of Mad Milk on hit. (-) Replace -2 health regeneration with no health regeneration on wearer (unless from an item that gives health regen, like the Amputator). (-) Add -25% slower firing speed. The Blut is good for keeping you alive in a 1v1 gunfight, which is useful, but not as useful as the ranged chunk damage and healing the Crossbow provides. This change gives the Blut more supportive utility at the cost of making you more reliant on your team to protect you. **Crusaders Crossbow**: (-) Healing from bolts is now affected by critical healing rates (Starts at 25-50 at base rate, increases to the previously standard 75-150 at max rate). The Crossbow is Medics most useful primary thanks to its ranged healing capability, so I think this aspect should be nerfed. Targets will now only be healed for the full 75-150 health if they haven't taken damage in the past 30 seconds. _**Secondary**_: **Quick Fix**: (-) Remove +40% heal rate. (+) Remove -50% max overheal. The Quick Fix is banned in competitive due to its ability to stalemate games. Its massively boosted heal rate is a major contributor to its stalemating power, so remove it and its overheal penalty to compensate. **Kritzkrieg**: (+) Add ability to capture objectives while ubered to the weapons description. Super simple change that I feel is necessary. I'm all about that new player experience, and this simple change not only allows them to figure you can cap with the Kritzkrieg, but also that you can't cap with other mediguns. **Vaccinator**: (-) Reduce uber bubble resistance from 75% to 66%. (-) Reduce uber build rate from +66% to +50%. (-) Remove hidden ability to capture objectives while ubercharged. (+) Increase uber build rate on overhealed patients from -33% to -25%. (+) Increase overheal rate from -66% to -50%. The Vaccinator is also banned in competitive due to its own stalemating power, so I've also changed it to be worse at that, and reduced its downside to compensate. _**Melee**_: **Ubersaw**: (-) Add -30% slower holster and deploy. (/) Replace -20% slower firing speed with -20% damage penalty. (-) Add No random critical hits. These changes are designed to give the Ubersaw a more noticeable downside in comparison to the other saws. **Vita-saw**: (+) Increase max organs from 4 to 6. (/) Replace -10 health penalty with -20% damage vulnerability while active. I don't know how to change the Vitasaw without just making it as diet Ubersaw, so I'll try buffing its upside and making its downside non-passive. **Solemn Vow**: (-) Add ""while active"" to ""Allows you to see enemy health"" (/) Replace -10% slower firing speed with ""Allows enemies to see your health while active"" I've seen a bajillion different ideas for letting enemies see your health with the solemn vow, so I might as well throw mine on the bonfire. **Amputator**: (+) Increase uber built on heal from 1%/49hp to 1%/20%. (-) Uber build rate is now reduced by 50% (down to 1%/40hp) when healing an overhealed player. (/) Replace +3 health regenerated per second while active with +66% health regen rate while active. (/) Replace -20% damage penalty with -20% slower firing speed. These are all very minor changes, I know, but I don't think the Amputato needs a major rework or anything. Anyways, that's it for now. Leave an upvote if you liked these changes, do other things if you didn't, thanks for reading and sorting by new!"
81,vulnerability,tf2,My Proposed Weapon Balance Changes,1,b6aftx,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/b6aftx/my_proposed_weapon_balance_changes/,2019-03-28 08:59:26,"Warning: very long; I stole some of these ideas from other players (After Breakfast is an underrated tf2 content creator for analyzing the history of the game). Feel free to ask what my intentions were with specific weapon changes if youre interested. Although theres not really any point to this because I have no direct line to Valve or the tf2 dev team, Im looking for constructive criticism. Disclaimer: I have no means to playtest these changes. Wide-Scale (Game Mechanics Changes) Remove random bullet spread, or otherwise heavily reduce it to a point where gameplay is relatively unaffected by it except in long-distance combat. Remove random crits. Robin Walker dont interact. Flamethrower Ramp-Up Modifications: Initial flame damage per second decreased to 35%, ramping up to a maximum of 200% from full flame contact after 2 seconds. Afterburn duration by flame density is unchanged. 1 second damage/accuracy ramp-up on Miniguns removed. Sword deploy/holster time reduced from 100% slower to 66%.

(+) The Panic Attack can be kept loaded even when another weapon is deployed by swapping while loaded. If swapped to while loaded, the gun will immediately fire once deployed. (-) If shells are held in the Panic Attack for 3 minutes without being fired, they will autofire. If a different weapon is deployed, the Panic Attack will auto-deploy itself and fire no matter what.

(+-) 75% push-force and airblast resistance merged into 75% knockback resistance. Righteous Bison (+) Reverted to pre-Meet Your Match version. (+) New alt-fire: fires off 2 shots in rapid succession (0.3 seconds between shots, costs all 4 shots). Equalizer (+) Deploy time scales with damage taken, starting at 10% faster deploy and increasing by 20% every 25% of base HP that is lost. At 1 HP, deploy time is 100% faster.

Powerjack (+) Reverted to pre-Gun Mettle version (75 health on kill, overheals). Sharpened Volcano Fragment (+) Volcanic Wrath: striking enemies adds 1 point to the Wrath Meter; killing a player with it adds 2 points.

(+) A shield is no longer required to activate the 10% speed increase. (+) 25% knockback resistance. (+) Negates all fall damage. (+) -30% blast damage from sticky jumps. Scottish Resistance (+) +2 maximum pipebombs deployed at once (14  16). (+-) Crosshair activation radius decreased, allowing for more precise detonations, but within a smaller window. Chargin Targe (+) Explosive resistance increased from 30% to 40%. (+) Afterburn always lasts for only 1 tick of damage. (+) 25% sentry damage resistance (does not stack with explosive resistance) (+) 50% knockback resistance (+) Attacks that strike exclusively the shield do 0 damage. (-) Fire resistance reduced from 50% to 40%. Sticky Jumper (+) 300% more active stickies allowed at once (2  8). Splendid Screen (+-) 20% faster charging speed.

(-) The caber can be shot while deployed, detonating it prematurely. Claidheamh Mor (+) Charge duration increases by 0.5 seconds whether the sword is deployed or not. (+) The user gains a 5 second speed boost upon successfully landing a charge-boosted hit. (+-) 15% damage vulnerability replaced with -15 HP on user.

Clean slate: none of the Brass Beasts original stats apply to this effectively new weapon. (+) On kill: the user moves 15% faster while revved up, capping at 74% (after 6 kills). (+) 15% damage resistance while revved up (300 effective health  345). (-) -25% damage penalty. (-) 15% slower rev-up time. (-) -15% move speed while revved up.

I stole some of these concepts from other tf2 connoisseurs (After Breakfast is an underrated content creator for analyzing the history of the game). Even though there's no real point to this since I don't have a direct line to Valve or the tf2 dev team, I'm looking for constructive criticism on these. Feel free to ask what any of my intentions are behind these changes. &amp;#x200B; Disclaimer: I have no means to playtest these changes. **Wide-Scale (Game Mechanics Changes)** * Remove random bullet spread, or otherwise heavily reduce it to a point where gameplay is relatively unaffected by it except in long-distance combat. * Remove random crits.

(+) The Panic Attack can be kept loaded even when another weapon is deployed by swapping while loaded. If swapped to while loaded, the gun will immediately fire once deployed.

88,vulnerability,tf2,Let's discuss the underpowered weapons of TF2 and how to fix them,12,au7mh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/au7mh9/lets_discuss_the_underpowered_weapons_of_tf2_and/,2019-02-24 23:43:21,"TF2 has a ton of weapons, but many of them never get the spotlight, be it because they are too situational, not useful enough, or simply outclassed by another option. With this (long, long) post I'd like to collect most of my ideas on how some of these can be rebalanced into viable and fun alternatives, discuss them with you and see how we can bring some more spice into this game to last a few more years. Please note that I don't play competetive and am mostly targeting these at casual. If an idea would affect competetive very differently, please voice your concern! I'd rather lowball a buff slightly, as something overpowered is worse than something underpowered. I'll also try to not overcomplicate things and avoid completely reworking weapons panic attack style. I'll occasionally edit this if someone brings up a good point! &amp;#x200B; # Scout **Primary** &amp;#x200B; **Baby Faces Blaster** \+ Reduce Boost meter reduction per point of damage taken from 4% to 2% This change will increase the damage needed to reset the boost meter from 25 to 50, allowing the scout to take some stray bullets without having his boost reset. More impactful hits like melee, explosions or clean shots can still reset it, but with how easily it can be regained and how it's harder to hit a boosted scout, this should make for a solid dynamic to balance out the magazine. **Back Scatter** \+ Remove Clip size penalty \+ Increase valid angle from \~90 to \~120 \- Increase spread penalty from +20% to +35% This should make this weapon much less painful to use, while giving it a penalty that will be less significant if used to suprise enemies and a proper, small tradeoff for its small benefit. Increased angle is mostly quality of life, but might also allow some creative ""trickstab"" possibilities mid-combat. &amp;#x200B; **Secondary** &amp;#x200B; **Winger** \+ Damage bonus: 15% -&gt; 35% This Pistol was supposed to be best at finishing opponents off (I think), but never had the stats to make it good at that - especially after PBPP got its fire rate buff. With this, its 5 shots can deal up to 150 damage at point blank (as opposed to stock's 112 for 5 shots), but it still runs dry after that. With the jump boost, this could be a fun gun! **Flying Guillotine** \+ Mini-crits on slowed targets You know what's up. With the sandman nerfs and it only being a mini-crit, this should be much less infuriating to fight, but still alright to use. Full crits aren't needed anyways, as minicrits can already take it from 90 total damage to 122, should be enough for most things with the sandman's damage. &amp;#x200B; **Melee** &amp;#x200B; **Candy Cane** \+ Explosion vulnerability: +25% -&gt; +20%. This specifically lets you survive a demoman pill. Why was that a thing again? **Fan O'War** \+ +30% switch speed to and from this weapon I think this makes a lot of sense for a combo-orientated weapon. &amp;#x200B; # Soldier **Secondary** &amp;#x200B; **Battalion's Backup** \+ Buff lasts +20% (2 seconds) longer The Buff Banner shortens the enemies life, while the Battalion's Backup extends yours. As it's naturally on a slower burn, I think it's fair to give it a bit more duration. **Mantreads** \+ Reduce Falling damage by 50% \+ Reduce Bullet damage by 10% I don't think the mantreads will be OP any time soon, so I don't see a problem with increasing their value for that other type of rocketjumping. **Righteous Bison** \+ Revert to older, larger hitbox I think Reddit can agree with me on this one. &amp;#x200B; # Pyro **Secondary** &amp;#x200B; **Detonator** \+ Increase Flare Jump force by 20% (something like +40% actual distance) \+ Remove self-damage penalty (should end up being -33% self-damage This would let Pyros use a new, more viable method for quick movement, while still keeping the weapon's offensive power in check. **Manmelter** \+ Mini-crits on burning targets \+ Can also remove Jarate and Mad Milk to convert into crits Fits with the theme and buffs it a bit, even though that may not be enough **Gas Passer** \+ Recharges 50% faster, only needing 500 damage / 40 seconds \+ When the Gas cloud is touched by a friendly Pyro's flames, the cloud ignites into a damaging, firey area instead of its usual effect \+ Causes the Neon-Annihilator to crit on ""gassed"" targets Not sure on the numbers. What do you think? &amp;#x200B; **Melee** &amp;#x200B; **Axtinguser** \+ Increase extinguishing base damage from 85 to 100 A slight buff for a melee weapon that struggles to compete with flamethrowers. With this, it'll at least always get rid of light classes. # Demoman **Primary** &amp;#x200B; **Loose Cannon** Bugfix: Did you know that source calculates air resistance for projectiles like grenades? Well, the Loose Cannon has an extremely low ""weight"" value in these calculations for its size, causing air drag to slow the projectiles down. Thats why the balls look slow even though its speed is supposedly increased. (Technically a buff?) Bugfix: I've only been testing on tr\_walkway, but is it a common thing that a direct hit doesn't always do 50, but can fall as low as 30? If so, thats gotta get a fix. (Technically a buff too?) &amp;#x200B; **Secondary** &amp;#x200B; **Quickiebomb Launcher** \+ Faster arm time: -0.2s -&gt; -0.3s \+ Clip size penalty: -50% -&gt; -35% \- -3 Max stickies out I'm not sure if this weapon was ever underpowered to begin with as I never really used it, but seeing how nobody does as stock just has a way better magazine... This should make it overall slightly stronger, without trading in its unique traits. &amp;#x200B; **Melee** &amp;#x200B; **Ullapool Caber** \+ Explosion doesn't lose damage over distance \+ Melee hits (not explosion) can mini-crit normally The first change will fix the damage being wonky and often falling *just* short of oneshotting light classes. The second change would raise a minicrit-hit to 149 damage. &amp;#x200B; # Heavy Don't have enough experience here to feel confident to throw opinions out, sorry # Engineer **Primary** &amp;#x200B; **Pomson 6000** \+ Remove hidden fire rate penalty \+ Clip size penalty: -33% -&gt; -16% \- Remove ""Victim loses up to 10% Uber"" stat This alone should raise this from meme-tier to a solid sidegrade to the shotgun. &amp;#x200B; **Secondary** &amp;#x200B; **Short Circuit** \+ Reduce Metal cost from 65 to 45 It's a bit weak in my opinion due to the massive metal cost. A slight decrease should help this compete with the wrangler. &amp;#x200B; # Medic **Primary** &amp;#x200B; **Crusader's Crossbow** \- Weapon doesn't reload when not in use anymore I'll probably get a lot of flak for this, but if the syringe guns are to compete this one has to be taken down a notch. This change is simple, but adds a time commitment to using this that's larger than weapon switch time. You won't be able to constantly heal faster than if you had any other weapon equipped here anymore, and you may not have a weapon ready to fire if you didn't manage it's reload well enough. **Overdose** \+ Ubercharge percentage increases movement speed by up to 10% when not selecting this weapon \- Damage penalty: -15% -&gt; -20% A passive, small bonus for an offensive penalty, that's not only for running away. Not entirely sure about this one, might be a bit strong. &amp;#x200B; **Melee** &amp;#x200B; **Ubersaw** \- No random critical hits Same as above. I know everyone likes this weapon, but there should be a proper downside to make the others viable. It's technically a buff too, as you can sometimes get more hits and thus more ubercharge in when killing someone slowly. **Amputator** \+ Holding down alt-fire will continue the medicating melody animation in 2s loops, instead of restarting the taunt's 4s animation everytime. \+ Ubercharge gain multiplied by 4, raising it to be 80% of stock but tripled on crit-heal This will reduce the taunt's unreasonable commitment, while keeping it relatively high. Also, won't waste uber now. # Sniper **Primary** &amp;#x200B; **Hitman's Heatmaker** \+ During Focus: Gain 25% reload speed This is a bit of an anti-synergy with the way focus works, but still a bit of a buff. Focus doesn't work at all as the weapon states, instead it lets you start charging your next shot as soon as you fire. With this speed buff, your next shot will be ready after 1.2s instead of 1.5s. A headshot at this charge level will deal 180 instead of 225 damage, allowing the player the option of more, but less potent shots. **Classic** \+ Movement speed while charging increased by +30% \+ Can mini-crit on not fully charged headshots The classic is bad, but I think it's not as much of a meme-tier weapon as most people think. It'd be interesting to see what'd happen if this was implemented, people would have to get used to it's different playstyle a bit. &amp;#x200B; **Secondary** &amp;#x200B; **Cleaner's Carabiner** \+ Remove fire rate penalty \- Clip size penalty: -20% -&gt; -40% \- Buff duration: 8s -&gt; 6s This should make this weapon feel like a gun that can kill things, while still keeping it limited to compensate for it's buff. The fire rate should make it a lot easier to gain that charge, so I think it's fair to tone down how long it lasts. Means you won't run into someone as often who has just gotten melee crits from fighting someone else, while rarely deciding a 1-on-1 fight. &amp;#x200B; # Spy **Primary** &amp;#x200B; **Enforcer** \+ Now can penetrate the resistance of sapped sentries against revolvers Making it work for the only resistance that really matters to spy. The first, disguised shot against a sapped sentry will do +80%, following shots will do +50% compared to stock. With the fire rate penalty, this should be balanced and give spy more of an option to deal with multiple engineers. Speaking of which... &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Red-Tape Recorder** \+ Will not take twice as long to destroy Dispensers and Teleporters anymore \+ After removal, will disable buildings for 2s instead of normal 0.5s The original idea planned to make this weapon a crutch, damaging the engie more if the spy was defeated but making things harder otherwise. Like this, it's stronger at disabling a given building, but doesn't let you get away easily by shooting it without duking it out with its engie. &amp;#x200B; **Melee** &amp;#x200B; **Your Eternal Reward** \+ Cloak drain rate: +33% -&gt; +10% \- Cannot disguise outside spawn at all A little compromise between old and new. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B;"

Atomic punch New stats: up to 50% damage vulnerability for 5 seconds based on missed damage during bonk effects, +15% speed during effects. Reasoning: bonk is banned because in the right hands it lets a scout get into a situation he's supposed to die in but escape because he pressed 2 then m1 and ran out invincible. Also these stats would fit with the lore because radiation equals super powers and cell destruction. Soldier: Cow mangler 5000 New stats: -15% slower first reload, -5% speed for .5 seconds when you shoot. Reasoning: The first one is to give it an actual upside the second is just to through off rocket jumping by just a hair to nerf its potential in a roamers hands, 5% isn't much and .5 seconds isn't long so its not enough to ruin the weapon. Pyro: N/A Demoman: N/A Heavy: Natashia New stats: +20% knockback on hit, +1 health on hit. Removed stats: slow on hit, 20% damage resitance Reasoning: the slow is annoying and i feel that the ludmilla stat would be nice and fit a utility primary for heavy and might let heavy players use a shotgun instead of a lunchbox. It'll still deny roamers and jumping scouts but it won't be as annoying. Engineer: Wrangler New stats: -100% damage taken from sentries (yes i watch uncle dane too doesn't mean i can't agree with a stat) Removed stats: the fucking annoying ass sheild. Reasoning: go watch uncle Danes video he does a much better job at reasoning then i could ever do. Medic: Solemn vow New stats: you can see enemies ammo count, you can see the enemy medics uber if they have there medi gun out, enemies can see your health and uber. Reasoning: give it an actual downside along with a nice upside, running this weapon though with these changes would make it so the enemy wouldnt have to run it too. Sniper (2 for 1): Sydney sleeper Jarate Sleeper's changed stats: make it so jarate only applies on headshots but can apply on fully charged bodyshots as well. Jarate changed stats: takes 45 seconds to refills but refills faster via headshots (5 to refill it) Spy: N/A"
90,vulnerability,tf2,Terrible Balance ideas: Scout.,3,az1rki,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/az1rki/terrible_balance_ideas_scout/,2019-03-09 20:28:22,"So the chances of us getting a good ol' fashioned summer update this year are fairly shaky at best. Nevertheless, I thought I'd share some ideas I had about balancing unlockable weapons for the classes. I'll start off with Scout, then work my way through the rest of the classes if people are interested. Feel free to critique my suggestions or c your own. _**Primary**_: **Force-a-Nature**: (+) Remove ""Unfired rounds will be lost during reloads"" The FaN is a generally underwhelming weapon. It's not particularly powerful in a competitive setting, and it's rather annoying to fight against in any setting. I can't really think of a way to rebalance the gun without making either brokenly OP or an entirely different gun, so I just thought to remove its wierdest downside instead. The whole shell ejection thing is a weird nod to realism that isn't even consistent with the games other weapons *cough*shortstop*cough*, so just junk it. There you have it, the FaN buff you've all obviously been waiting for. **Soda Popper**: (+) Remove ""Unfired rounds will be lost during reloads"" (-) Add -10% Damage penalty. The Soda Popper is like the FaN, but good. It's also banned in 6v6 competitive, because it allows Scouts to fly around with Soldiers and Meatshot them out of the sky. A 10 percent damage penalty doesn't sound like much, but would prevent Scout from killing Soldiers in 2 shots. You could probably increase that penalty if it's still too powerful, but I'm wary of overnerfing weapons. **Shortstop**: (-) Remove alt-fire shove. (-) Reduce hidden firing speed bonus from -42% to -40% and add it to the weapons description. (+) Remove +20% Increased knock back on wearer. (/) Add hidden -60% pellets per shot penalty and +100% damage bonus to the weapons description. The Shortie has spent the past decade or so being given weird gimmicks that It doesn't need. It should have always just been a fast-firing range focused primary, nothing more, nothing less. **Back Scatter**: (/) Replace -20% less accurate with -20% damage penalty when not fired at the targets back. The BS is an okay enough weapon, but the accuracy penalty makes its upside less effective. **Baby Faces Blaster**: (-) Reduce maximum boost speed from +30% to +25%. (+) Reduce boost lost on damage ratio from 4:1 to 1:1. (+) Reduce boost lost on double jump to -50%. The BFB got nerfed into the floor a few years ago ago for the understandable reason that Max boost broke the Scouts hitbox. When I was thinking about how to balance the weapon, I remembered that Crit-a-Cola used to give you a 25 percent speed boost, yet I never heard any complaints that it let Scout outrun his own hitbox. Granted, it might have, and I just never heard about it, but I'll assume for now that it doesnt. As a trade-off for less Max speed, we can reduce the amount of boost lost from damage and double jumping. _**Secondary**_: **Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol**: (+) Change +3 health on hit to Up to +6 health on hit. (-) Remove +15% faster firing speed. The PBPP went from scouts best pistol, to his worst, then back to his best, and now it's still his best pistol, but by a smaller margin. The faster firerate is what really makes it better than stock or the winger, so junk it, and increase the max health on hit to compensate. The health regained would now scale with damage, Black Box style, so 6 per hit at close range scaling down to just 2 at long range. **Winger**: (-) Remove +20% jump height bonus. (+) Increase damage bonus to +33%. (+) Reduce clip size penalty to -50%. The Wingers jump bonus was made somewhat irrelevant after the Atomizers changes in Jungle Inferno, and it would be even less relevant if my suggestions got implemented, So remove it, and refocus the weapon as a damage-dealing tool like it used to be. **Mad Milk (and also technically Jarate)**: (-) Increase recharge time from 24 seconds to 60 seconds. (-) Milk meter now starts off empty. (+) Add the ability to recharge via damage dealt - 750 damage required. (-) Debuff duration now falls off within the blast radius (like a rocket or grenade). Both Milk and Jarate have been banned in 6v6 for ages. This is because they require very little skill to make effective use out of. Wait for it to recharge, huck it in the general direction of the enemy and shoot the shit out of them. These changes are designed to make them more of a skill based reward and make them less annoying to fight against. **Bonk! Atomic Punch/Crit-a-Cola**: (-) Increase recharge time from 24 seconds to 60 seconds. The colas are in a similar situation to the throwable bodily fluids, so similar changes should suffice. **Flying Guillotine**: (-) Remove time-based recharge. (/) Weapon now recharges by collecting ammo - 1 large pack, 2 medium packs or 5 small packs required for full recharge. The Comp community really hates auto-recharging weapons. Most of the are banned, and Scout has a bunch of them. _**Melee**_: **Stock**: (+) Add alt-fire to reach out and shove someone. It feels a bit of a shame to entirely ditch a stat and not give it to another weapon, so why not add it to the stock bat? This change would also apply to any bat that doesn't have a launchable ball. **Atomizer**: (/) Change triple jump while active to +50% Jump height while active. (+) Remove -15% damage penalty. (-) Add -10 max health on wearer while airborne - down to a minimum of 45, health will regenerate while the weapon is holstered. The Atomizers is banned in 6v6 because it makes scouts movement unpredictable, allowing him to dodge rockets and grenades with no significant cost. These changes maintain the Atomizers overall movement benefits while making his movement easier to track, and giving him a significant penalty for using it. **Sandman**: (/) Change speed reduction effect to be -25% of the targets movement speed instead of a fixed, universal speed cap. (/) Change -15 max health on wearer to -20% damage vulnerability while active. The Sandman's significant nerfs in Jungle Inferno make me think it doesn't need such a harsh downside anymore. The speed reduction effect now fuctions more like you would expect it to as well. **Candy Cane**: (/) Change -25% explosives vulnerability to No double jump. The Candy Canes current down side makes it so that a direct rocket or grenade can kill you in one hit. This downside is less severe but still punishing. **Sun-on-a-Stick**: (+) Add alt-fire launches fireball. (/) Change -25% damage penalty to -30% Slower firing speed. (/) Change +25% fire damage resistance to -25% Debuff duration while active. The Sunstick is arguably scouts worst weapon, mainly because it requires you to combo with a different class. Give it a fireball and you can make better use of the crits. The fireball would deal 15 direct damage, 2 to 8 seconds of afterburn based on range, have a 10 second recharge and couldn't be picked up at all. Well, that's all I can think of for now. Hope you liked my suggestions! "
91,vulnerability,tf2,Terrible Balance Ideas: Soldier.,10,azdwx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/azdwx3/terrible_balance_ideas_soldier/,2019-03-10 19:56:07,"Hello Again! I got some good feedback on my suggestions for Scout balance, so now I'll show you guys my ideas for Soldier balance! Feel free to leave feedback in the comments. _**Primary**_: **Liberty Launcher**: (/) Replace -25% damage penalty with -25% explosion radius. The Liberty Lawnchair can barely outperform the stock shotgun in its current state. Change the damage penalty to a blast radius penalty and now it's more usable. **Air Strike**: (+) Remove -20% explosion radius penalty while airborne. (-) Reduce airborne firing speed bonus from +65% to +50%. I'll be honest, I ripped this suggestion straight from After Breakfast. I couldn't think of a better way to change up the Air Strike. **Cow Mangler 5000**: (-) Add -10% Slower reload speed. (+) Reduce damage penalty vs buildings from -80% to -60%. The CM5000 is banned in sixes because it's essentially a straight upgrade when the other team doesn't have an engineer and your team doesn't have a Kritz Medic. Add back a harsher version of its old reload speed penalty to make it generally worse, and make more effective against engineers to compensate. **Beggars Bazooka**: (+) Remove ""Cannot regain ammo from dispensers while active"" (/) Add +70% faster firing speed and -30% slower reload speed to the weapons description. These are just small quality of life changes for what's probably Soldiers most interesting weapon. _**Secondary**_: **Reserve Shooter**: (-) Remove the ability to mini-crits people whose blast damage was self-inflicted. (-) Increase clip size penalty from -34% to -50%. (+) Add back the ability to mini-crit airblasted targets. (+) Increase hidden holster speed bonus from +15% to +20% and add it to the weapons description. This accursed shotgun should never have had the ability to punish Soldiers and Demos just for trying to utilize one of their most fundamental class mechanics. As a tradeoff, I think it would be fine to give back the ability to mini-crit airblasted targets, since Pyros need to actually aim their airblasts now. **Righteous Bison**: (+) Reduce fire delay from .8 seconds to .625 seconds (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (+) Reduce reload times from .92/.8 to .75/.55 seconds (same as Scattergun). (+) Increase clip size from 4 to 6 (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (+) Increase projectile speed from 1200 to 2400. (+) Increase base damage from 20 to 40. (+) Reduce damage penalty vs buildings from -80% to -60%. (+) Increase damage ramp-up from 120% to 150% (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (-) Increase damage falloff from 53% to 50% (same as Scattergun/Shotgun). (-) Remove ""Projectile cannot be deflected"" (-) Remove that weird glitch where the projectile can damage a target up to 3 times in one hit. Yeah, that's a lotta changes, but the Bison deserves them. These changes are designed to make it more similar to shotguns, since it occupies the shotgun slot (specifically, the damage and projectile speed are based on the rescue rangers) and give it more consistent damage. **B.A.S.E Jumper**: (-) Parachute now takes 1 second to activate, with your airspeed reducing during this second. Hopefully I've described this change in a way that makes sense. Basically, it'll be easier to adjust your aim onto the jumping Soldier as the activate the chute, and you'll be more likely to hit them. **Buff Banner**: (+) Add +10% faster move speed on wearer. (+) Reduce damage required to charge from 600 to 480. The Buff is the only Banner to not grant a passive bonus, and its buff is decent, but arguably not massively superior to the Conchs buff. **Battilions Backup**: (/) Replace extra sentry damage resistance with 35% knockback and push force reduction. The Backups 50% sentry damage reduction is situational by its very nature. A knockback reduction would still make it easier to fight sentries but would also have an effect against other classes. _**Melee**_: **Disciplinary Action**: (+) Add alt-fire: whip your teammates to grant the both of you a speed boost for 3 seconds. 10 second recharge and +70% longer range. (-) Remove speed boost on primary fire. (-) Remove +70% longer range on primary fire. The Whip is banned in sixes because it allows you to boost a Heavy to the front lines, which is bad. This change reduces the viability of this tactic, as the 7 second delays between boosts will make you both show up late to the front. **Equalizer**: (+) Remove initial damage penalty. (-) Reduce damage increase rate - now gains 1 point of damage for every 5 health lost. (/) Replace -90% healing from Medics with ""Wearer cannot be overhealed"" The Equalizer is somewhat doomed from the start, being that it's a damage focused Melee weapon on a class with 2 speed focused utility options. These changes won't make it better for normal gamemodes, but they will make it better in Medieval Mode, and that's all that really matters. **Pain Train**: (/) Replace -10% bullet vulnerability with -15% health from packs on wearer. Having a tiny vulnerability to one specific damage type at all times is a weird downside for a weapon. This downside is more noticable but also not completely crippling. Well, that's it for this one. Thanks for sorting by new!"

93,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon ideas (need advice),1,alkwe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/alkwe6/weapon_ideas_need_advice/,2019-01-31 13:48:53,"So I'm debating making some community items, as Valve probably aren't making any at the moment. I'm not the best at 3D modelling, so before I make them I'd like to know if they're good ideas. Please tell me what you think, I'm open to feedback. **Safety first (Level 5 protectional head gear)** This is a helmet eqippable for all classes (except spy and medic) which protects the user from headshots. Obviously the main con would be losing a secondary slot, but there is also a 10% damage vulnerability on the wearer. While it is equippable for 6 classes, only some would want to use it (like snipers and battle engis). Summarised: \+ protects from headshots \-10% damage vulnerability **The double crosser (Level 10 clone watch)** This weapon would act like a hybrid between the vaccinator and dead ringer. It wouldn't feign death, but it would spawn multiple spy clones which would run around and confuse the enemy. The watch would have an AI which would choose random paths to follow, so an enemy might follow a random one. The clones would run around, laughing for 6 seconds, then they begin glitching, wave and disappear in a cloud of smoke. It is similar to the vaccinator as it has charges- it would have 5 charges which can be individually activated by pressing m2. Spawning 3 or more clones would give a speed boost for 3 seconds. Summarised: \+User can spawn up to 5 clones \+clones will create visual and audio confusion \+3 second 50% speed boost on activation of up to 3 clones \-Clones can be walked through \-Clones only last 6 seconds I feel this weapon needs 1 more downside, so if you could suggest one, that would help. **The texan's kryptonite (Level 30 sapper)** Let's be honest- the spy has a ridiculous shortage of sappers. He has 2 sappers (including ap-sap and snack attack, which are just reskins). The red tape recorder is good for sentry nests and the sapper is good for offense. But these 2 limited styles make spy unable to work with his team, which sucks. And so I suggest a 3rd sapper idea- which doesn't target the sentry, but the engineer. The texan's kryptonite can be placed on sentries, dispensers and teleporters to disable them. The sapper will not damage the building. It takes 3 hits to remove. When the engineer hits the building the first time, it will do 40 damage to the engineer. Second hit, it does 40 as well. Third hit, the sapper is removed and the building is reactivated. However it will give a 2- damage per second bleed effect for 10 seconds. Theoretically, the engineer could survive. However if he is on low health, is it worth sacrificing himself for a building? Other classes cannot remove these sappers. For teleporters and mini sentries, 2 hits are needed. In MVM it would function as a normal sapper. This would allow for a more team based spy gameplay, which could be useful. Summarised: \+Disables buildings \+Does damage to engineers whilst trying to repair \+Can only be removed by engineers \-Damage done to buildings AFTER being sapped is reduced by 70% \-Buildings are immune to crits &amp;#x200B; **The Engi's Toolbox (Level 20 PDA)** This PDA comes with 4 new buildings. Instead of a Sentry, A rocket launcher. Instead of a Dispenser, a buffer. Instead of 2 teleporters, 2 shield poles. The description of the pda weapons took so long I had to make a separate post, so click [here](URL if you're interested. &amp;#x200B; Yeah, so those were my ideas. If people are generally interested I might make them. Thanks for reading!"

97,vulnerability,tf2,Eternal reward re-balance idea,1,a9m0n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/a9m0n9/eternal_reward_rebalance_idea/,2018-12-26 16:50:10,"The eternal reward is one of spies coolest weapons but it is basicly a direct downgrade. The problem with it is its few advantages are not useful enough to outweigh its negatives. Also the big earner does chain-stabs better (one of its few strong suits) making it nearly useless. Most ideas for fixing it I've seen mostly involve removing the drain nerf or giving it another buff, so I want to have a stab at it. &amp;#x200B; Eternal reward Upon a successful backstab, the Spy instantly disguises as the backstab victim. Victims do not make any noise when dying. Victims' bodies disappear after being stabbed. If backstabbed, victims' death will not be shown in the killfeed for other enemies. \+33 cloak drain rate Normal disguises require (and consume) a full cloak meter. Disguises will give a buff(buffs will not when when disguised as a teammate). All disguise effects are kept when cloaked &amp;#x200B; Buffs scout - +8% speed (gives spy a speed of %120) +15% damage vulnerability medic - regenerate health at a rate of 4hp/s +5% damage vulnerability spy - nothing pyro - +30% bullet resistance +10% fire vulnerability engineer - +30% fire resistance +10% bullet vulnerability demo-man - +30% explosive resistance +10% fire vulnerability -50% vision -100% depth perception (jk) soldier - +20% explosive resistance +40% knockback taken heavy - +30% damage resistance &amp;#x200B; Reasoning: Now the eternal reward is more of a utility weapon that requires proper timing of disguises and allows a proper escape if found out after a stab. The scout buff allows faster escapes but gives damage vulnerability. The medic buff allows the spy to recover from taken damage. The pyro buff allows spy to target pybros before engineers and the engineer buff does vice versa. The soldier buff lets spy surf rockets more effectively to make up for the speed nerf. The heavy buff makes up for the massive speed nerf. &amp;#x200B; This would need a lot of playtesting to get right but I'm confident this would make spy funner and more balanced."
98,vulnerability,tf2,A Hypothetical Set-Based Redesign for Scout (Part 1 of a series),1,aa0yo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/aa0yo5/a_hypothetical_setbased_redesign_for_scout_part_1/,2018-12-28 04:07:15,"Hello r/tf2! &amp;#x200B; **TLDR: The rebalances below are aimed at making 6v6 without disrupting casual TF2. I have given follow-up nerfs or buffs in case I've missed the mark. If there's something I haven't noticed that would make something dramatically OP/UP please comment below with your reasoning. Thanks!** I'm a long-time casual fan of TF2 (I recently hit 400 hours yay me), and I'm a ""retired"" amateur Overwatch coach and team captain. Don't worry mods, this isn't a comparison post :P, but something that did strike me was how weapon sets (along with contracts, but that's a different story) could be used to teach new players how to play with different play-styles. This started as a fun little project to pull the sets together turned into a big re-balance project. The objective isn't just to make the weapons balanced, but to make them a positive addition to 6v6. I've been using compwiki, Woolen Sleevelet and the tf2 wiki as sources, since I'm not an expert on the TF2 competitive scene. Personally, I advocate for a 6v6 prolander format. Overwatch also uses a 6v6 format with single hero locking, and it honestly did a lot of good for the competitive scene. Before class limits were introduced, 2 Winston, 2 Tracer, 2 Lucio was dominant. The TF2 meta of 2 scout, 2 soldier, demo and medic reminds me a lot of this time period, and that's why I think single class limits would be good for variety &amp;#x200B; HOWEVER: we have to give the 6v6 community their due, and there's a reason why the meta chosen is how it is: it works. It's fun. Countless variations have been tried, so effort must be made that it's just as fun and interesting to fight Heavies, Engineers, and Snipers as it is to fight Scouts and Soldiers. On to the Rebalances! In my opinion, Scout should not be a hardcore fragger. Scouts role is harassment and cleanup. Why do I think this? * In Team Fortress Classic, his role was a flag runner and thats it. The [TFwiki](URL even suggests that trying to frag as Classic Scout would be a humiliation. * His Scattergun is very threatening at close range (marginally more powerful than a standard shotgun) but his low health prevents him from having effective sustained DPS. If he had zero threat then he wouldnt be an effective harasser (too easy to ignore) but he can only be able to punish a medic or whatever if ignored * The Pistol is a poor midrange weapon that cant really get kills on its own, but is very good at harassment and finishing low health targets I think most people would agree that Scout is a little too strong in 6v6 and bringing him down a peg would help class variety. However, Im not going to neuter him entirely since he is a lot of fun to play, and class variety is only worthwhile if it its still fun. If you think Ive over or under nerfed him, say so! ## Stock Set ### Scattergun * The Scattergun is a slight upgrade to the Shotgun, in that it has a maximum damage ramp-up of 175% (150% on the Shotgun). It also has slightly different reload timings * Id like to slightly nerf this by reducing the ramp up to 150%, making it identical to the shotgun * In other words, nerfing the max damage from 105 to 90, which means its impossible to 2 shot Soldiers, for example * I want to nerf him more but Im naturally quite hesitant to nerf an entire class into the ground. * Follow up nerf would be reducing ramp up to 133%, or 80 damage maximum, but I would rather see how the demoman changes go first. * A more radical suggestion would be to increase the firing speed but reduce damage on the scattergun. Specifically, Dropping max damage down to 60 (base of 40) and upping the firing speed to 0.41 seconds, which is faster than the stock bat, for reference. This would be significant because while the DPS would be the same, it changes ttk: * 120 damage = 2 shots = 0.82 seconds (currently 1.25) * 150 damage (Medic health) = 3 shots = 1.23 seconds (currently 1.25) * 200 damage (Soldier health) = 4 shots = 1.64 seconds (currently 1.25) * This change makes him much more effective at killing weak or damaged targets, at the cost of hurting his performance against full health soldiers. I wouldnt want this to affect the FaN or Soda popper, since their clip size changes things a lot. ### Pistol * The Scout mostly uses the pistol to harass and finish off targets from outside his scattergun range * No problems here, so no changes ### Bat * The bat has a slightly lower damage and higher swing speed, evening out to roughly the same DPS. * No problems here, except the Gunslinger 3-hit-crit change, which might make this actually somewhat useful, since a 3-hit-crit would be 175 damage in 1.5 seconds. ## The Special Delivery Role: Mid-range sustained harassment (as opposed to close range-hit and run) Pro: More sustain Con: less pick potential So the idea here is that scout trades damage for sustainability and range. Not that complicated. ### Shortstop * The shortstop has a faster firing speed, less pellets that do more damage, and a clip based reload * Basically makes the Pistol your primary weapon * Does anyone like the new push mechanic? Like, if you want to bully people and push them around just use the FaN, and who cares about taking more knockback from airblast? * I get that the idea is that scout can better control the range at which he fights, but hes already the fastest class. Why does he need CC to get distance with his target? * The problem with the previous shortstop is that it was basically a straight upgrade, with a marginal damage nerf in exchange for better healing and better range. * So heres the idea: * \+100% firing speed * \-50% pellets per shot * \+ tighter spread * \+ clip reload * \-shares ammo with the pistol * \+66% bonus self heal * This basically only affects mad milk and health packs * What this means is that the getting 120 max base damage is easier but thats it, then you have to reload. Your clip size is effectively halved in exchange for the range and healing buff. * Youll notice that means that base damage isnt enough to kill almost anyone in one clip, especially if you stay at range. Getting closer gives you a max of 180 damage a clip. * Follow up: * Nerf: reduce healing bonus * Buff: Reload speed Mad Milk * Mad Milk is a rechargeable secondary throwing item * Right now, the issue with Mad Milk is that hitting enough players with it in 6es is like a mini- quickfix uber or banner effect. Hitting a whole team would be pretty difficult in casual but is too easy in 6es * So what do we do about that? * Reduce the aoe by \~35% (to 140 units, about the same as a stock rocket. The current radius isn't known but is around 200) * Reduce healing given from 60% to 40% * Its worth referencing my changes to Pyro here * Pyros airblast could be used to remove most debuffs, not just flames, including Jarate, Mad Milk, Water, and Gas Passers clinging effect (but not the cloud itself). * Follow up: * Nerf: Reduce duration * Buff: Increase healing given ### Holy Mackerel * Same stats as the stock bat, with each hit being logged in the killfeed * Meme weapon, no changes needed ## The #1 Fan Role: Close range hit and run Pro: more doding and better burst damage Con: weaker sustained and long range damage ### Soda Popper * The Soda Popper has 66% less shots per clip (2 shots) but a 50% faster firing speed and 25% faster reload * To fire 6 shots and reload takes 4.365 seconds * The stock takes 7.31, for an effective overall firing speed increase of 40% * Overall DPS is * Dealing damage builds hype, which in turn gives the user the ability to perform extra jumps midair while active * The original stats gave the user minicrits, and hype was built by running instead of dealing damage * This stat was dumb so Im dismissing it. This new one is better. * The problem with the Soda Popper is that it makes an already strong class kinda obnoxiously hard to kill, with the Hype acting as a kind of Dead Ringer-style get out of jail free card. (not quite but you get the idea) * Ive nerfed the Scout already, but the only additional penalty needed for this would be a DPS reduction so theres an actual penalty, because right now its a sidegrade, with hype added on top. * In short, remove the reload speed buff. Reloading should take as much time as reloading 2 shells on stock (which is 1.36 seconds, as opposed to the current 1.23s) or possibly a penalty to reload speed. * I suggest changing the animation if you do this, so that it doesn't look silly. Just have Scout load the shells one at a time or something * This makes winning as a Soda Popper scout about staying alive long enough to unload your shots into the target * Also please change the model to have Bonk! Atomic Punch on it and not Crit-a-Cola, that would make much more sense. ### Winger * The winger used to be a very boring + 15% damage -66% clipsize sidegrade * Has since then been buffed to have +25% jump height when active * Unfortunately this clashes with the Atomizer that basically does the same thing * Proposed stats: * \+25% jump height (not just while active) * \- 66% clipsize * (Removed damage buff) * New stats encourage getting closer and using that double jump in exchange for a weaker pistol. 25% isnt a lot so its a small deal * If I were redesigning this from scratch, I would remove the pistol and have it be like the BASE jumper or something. Whatever. * Follow up * Nerf: +15% jump height * Buff: -50% clip size ### Atomic Punch (New) * The Bonk has a few uses. Tanking for your team, negating sentries, and reaching otherwise secure flanks, with plenty of overlap between the three. Sentry avoidance is the main use. * As I understand it, the AP is banned because acts kind of like the dead ringer as a get-out-of-jail-free card, and letting Scout tank for his team. * So I would want to reduce how able the scout is to absorb damage for anyone other then himself. * First off, instead of simply being invincible, the scout should have a hitbox of zero. * In other words, bullets and projectiles simply pass through the scout instead of disappearing. * Id like for the flamethrower to still do damage however. Its a small thing since any good Scout can avoid the Pyro, but at least theres some way to punish a Scout whos being brainless with the weapon. More outplay option is always nice. * Its a minor change they only really affects team coordination. Also, it does let you kill careless engineers with their own sentries, which would be funny if nothing else * Follow up: * Buff: increase duration to 8sec from 6sec * Nerf: damage dodged reduces duration * I would suggest buffing the base duration as well ### Crit-a-Cola (New) * The Crit-a-Cola gives the scout minicrits, but marks the scout for death (receives minicrits) when he fires. * Historically, the CaC also gave a speed boost, but thats been nerfed away. * Problem is, that Minicrit on max ramp up scout does 141 damage, enough to almost 1-shot a medic. If the medic has taken any damage at all, then hell just die. * For reference, the pistol has a base damage of 15 * Extra bullshit when combined with the FaN or Soda Popper * However, we have nerfed scouts maximum damage to 90, or 121 with minicrits. This leaves the medic on 29 health, which might be enough * Follow up: * Nerf: -10% speed (to 120%, the current baby-face starting speed) * Buff: Speed bost while active ### Atomizer * The Atomizer was originally traded a damage nerf for the ability to sacrifice 10 health for a triple jump * Problem is, in 6v6, Scout can trade 10 health to dodge a rocket. No brainer. * Even after its nerf, its still banned. * Ideally, the atomizer should make the Soldier vs Scout duel more interesting, so heres my suggestion * Triple jumps are free but drop you vertically straight down, making you easier to hit. This means good timing is necessary to use it correctly, and it can be baited by the rival soldier * Drop minicrits while airborne and have a -50% damage on this thing instead * New stats: * \+While active, can triple jump * \-50% damage * ! Triple jumping ends all horizontal momentum. You will fall straight down. * Follow up * Nerf: Marked for death while mid air after a triple jump * Alt Nerf: +100% switch-away time * Buff: useable when not active ## The Public Enemy Role: Hit-and-run Pro: Increased speed Con: If you get hit, even once, youre fucked. Also, no jumping. ### Baby-faces Blaster * The Baby-faces Blaster gives a 13% speed reduction (133% &gt;120%) to the scout, and takes 2 shots from the clip in exchange for a boost meter that increases speed (to a maximum of 173%) but decreases when you take damage or double jump * Unfortunately the devil is in the details here. You have to do 100 damage to max out the boost meter, but only need to take 25 damage to empty it, and a double jump empties it 75% * The Baby-face nerf was seriously disappointing to me because the issue was clearly a bug and not just being overpowered. As I understand it, the issue was with the hitbox not being able to keep up to Scouts speed * Now, I have some sympathy with the TF team because I recognise that TF2 is decades-old mess of spaghetti code and theyre short on manpower. But at the end of they day, if Valve cant or wont take care of TF2 then they should outsource it like they did with CSGO * The original Baby-face had increased accuracy, lower damage, and the same boost mechanic. However, any jump reduced the boost to zero and the starting speed was much lower (87%, slower than a demoman) * This is an extremely interesting and fun weapon and it honestly breaks my heart that its so bad at the moment * Proposed new stats * \+30% accuracy * \-15% damage * Max speed is now 160% (480 units/second) * Minimum speed is now 110% (Slightly faster than a Medic) * Each point of damage dealt is +0.5% speed (or 1% boost) * Slightly less than current * Each point of damage received is -0.5% speed (or -1% boost) * About one quarter of current * Air jumps reduce boost to zero * Follow up * Buff: stock damage * Nerf: stock accuracy ### Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol * The Pocket Pistol currently gives a +15% firing speed bonus, gives 3 health on kill but has a 25% clip size penalty (12&gt;9) * This gives an effective DPS of 52.9, to the stocks 54.7 * Originally, the Pocket Pistol had the following stats: * \+15% max health on wearer * Wearer never takes falling damage * \-25% slower firing speed * 50% fire damage vulnerability on wearer *(150% damage taken)* * Gaining health, increasing max health are all pointless for this strat. In our version, the pistol slot has two possible utilities: building boost from a safe distance or as a utility. Well be taking the utility route (The cleaver and the wrap assassin are both fine for that kind of damage build) * The never takes falling damage was a really useful stat. Since you cant double jump, you cant just walk off a ledge, as youd take falling damage. I see no reason not to simply have the following stats: * Wearer takes no fall damage while active * \-25% clip size * Simple but effective * Follow up: * Nerf: -50% clip size * Buff: Not really necessary. Would have to be reworked if its too weak to be used ### Sandman (New) * Ive added this to this set because the reduced health downside means nothing (since taking more than 100 damage means death anyway), the stun can help early on, and it fits aesthetically. * The Sandman has been banned on and off essentially for being annoying. Nobody likes slowdown mechanics. * Since the strat is about not getting shot, Id like to focus more on that. * Historically, the hit prevented the victim from firing but putting them into a third person fleeing state (the same as caused by ghosts on halloween maps) * But, remove the slowdown effects. The Baby face is all about running fast, so its not really useful to us, and it kinda sucks to get hit by anyway * Currently, the duration ranges from 1 to 7 seconds depending on distance. Id like to raise this to 3 to 9 seconds, which might be controversial. I would like for the ball to have some effect at close range, but preferably without being too braindead * There would have to be a minimum range to prevent abuse, along with a weapon holster penalty, to force scouts to use it as an opening move to run up and not just as a melee stun. * Also I liked the moonshot stun mechanic. Id like to tweak it slightly to a 10 second stun if the victim is 2,000 units or more away. * Why? Because thats just about enough time for scout to run up and use the Home Run taunt. Its not something you could do in really do in competitive, so its a fun little thing Id like to bring back. * Follow up: * Nerf: Give victim 50% bullet damage reduction * Buff: Increase duration or reduce minimum range. ## Setless ### Force-A-Nature Role: CQC and utility Pro: improved burst and knockback Con: knockback, small range and clip size * The Force-A-Nature has a 50% faster firing speed (twice as fast), a 2 shot magazine (as opposed to the per-bullet reload of stock), 20% more pellets but 10% less damage per pellet (for a total change of +8% damage) and gives knockback to the shooter and target. * Note that reloading loses you 2 bullets even if you only fire one shot * The knockback is known to be unreliable which obviously I would want to fix * The FaN seems to be annoying but not overpowered. * Id also like change how the (fixed) bullet spread works. With 12 pellets thats a 3 by 4 grid. Currently thats not quite how that works, so Id propose the following pattern: **** * In other words, Id like to make the fact that its a double barrel shotgun an actual mechanic. * Your first shot would have to be aimed slightly to the right (since the pellets are from the left barrel) and the second slightly to the left (since theyre from the right barrel) * This was inspired by hearing that top tier scouts would compensate for the wonky spread by aiming slightly to the right of the target * New stats: * \+50% faster firing speed * ! Knockback on the target and shooter * \+20% bullets per shot * \-10% damage penalty * \-66% clip size * ! Shots fired will be off-center. First shot to the right, second shot to the left * Follow up: * Nerf: Its already a bit of a nerf give it a break. Nerf the firing speed or something * Buff : Give original (175% ) damage ramp-up ### Back Scatter Role: Flank Pro: More damage from behind Con: Less damage from the front * The Back Scatter gives minicrits from behind at distances of less than 500 hammer units * For this rather small gain, it costs 2 shots from the clip and +20% bullet spread. You have to get really close to make use of this benefit, and that kills it. * Increase minimum distance to 750 hu * Normal bullet spread * \-10% pellets (1 less pellet per shot, specifically the perfectly accurate first pellet) * \-33% shots per clip * Follow up: * Nerf: Reduce max distance to 600hu * Buff: normal pellet numbers ### Flying Guillotine &amp; Wrap Assassin Role: Target finish Pro: long range bleed projectile Con: Sacrifice bat/pistol * Ive put these two together because they are the same weapon. Trade your bat or pistol for a long range bleed causing projectile. However, one of them is banned and one is not. * They both bleed for 40 damage total, but the WA does 15 burst damage and the FG does 50 * The WA has a 7.5 second recharge time, while the FG has 6 seconds, or 4.5 if you hit your target * We have two choices here: either literally make them the same weapon or give each of them a slightly separate gimmick * Either way, the Guillotine is getting its recharge time nerfed to 7.5 seconds, since that seems to be the primary issue with it * If we make them the same weapon we would then up the WA impact damage to 50, but lets not do that * Guillotine is fully restored if its the final blow (that is, theyre either killed by the impact or bleed) * Wrap assassin has an AOE glass shards effect that causes bleed to anyone who steps on it. I would suggest 150 hammer units, or about the same radius as a single sticky bomb or rocket. Bleed duration is tied to how long you spend moving inside the radius * Follow up: * Nerf FG: Guillotine has to pulled from the corpse (similar to Sandman ball) * Buff FG: * Nerf WA: remove AOE gimmick * Buff WA: increase AOE damage or add slowdown ### Boston Basher Role: Medic synergy Pro: Can help Medic build ber faster Con: Not much good otherwise * The above stats are based on 6v6 competitive usage. In pubs, its more of a risk/reward weapon * I actually dont have a problem with this at all. If you really wanted to push me to nerf it, then Id reduce the self damage, or limit the bleed stacking or something. * Honestly, Im more than happy for the best weapons to encourage teamwork and synergy, especially with a Medic. * Im kinda on the fence about bleed-jumping with this, though. I dont like it, but its not a big deal so I wont touch it. ### Sun-on-a-stick Role: ???? Pro: Crits burning players Con: Reduced damage * What a pointless weapon. * Version 1 new stats: * On hit: afterburn for 5 seconds * On miss: hit yourself. Idiot. * Yes, this is statistically identical to the Basher, but with fire instead of bleed. * Version 2 stats: * Axtinguisher stats (but with bat base damage and speed) * Can throw a low-damage fireball that causes afterburn (either a flaming sandman ball or a dragons breath projectile) * More interesting but less practical, I think. I prefer it because we do already have the Boston Basher * Either way, the Sun-on-a-stick is kind of a pointless weapon, and needs to be reworked. ### Fan OWar Role: Marking targets Pro: marks victim for death Con: essentially zero damage * I have no idea how to fix this. Im fine with it just being used in MvM, personally, and have no idea how to resolve the fundamental issue with the weapon * The problem is that if youre in melee range with Scout you can probably just kill the target * My proposed scattergun changes at least makes it more useful against tougher targets like heavies and soldiers, so we could add to that: * On hit, target is marked for death, * On hit, gain a speed boost and bullet resistance for 2 seconds * (as if hit by disciplinary action, with a 25% bullet resistance) * Idea being, the scout can use this to hit and then make a run for it * Probably still not viable, but thats all I have.

99,vulnerability,tf2,[Guide] How to effectively use the Huntsman,1,9ovigi,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/9ovigi/guide_how_to_effectively_use_the_huntsman/,2018-10-17 15:50:40,"First, let's cover the loadout. Using any old loadout with a Huntsman will make you pretty much a downgraded sniper. However, if you take into account the medium/close-ranged combat you'll have to deal with you can take advantage of certain items become more effective than a Sniper in some situations. Let's start with (obviously) the Secondary since there isn't any other option to the Huntsman except for its reskin. Hopefully Valve will add more bows for the Sniper soon. Secondary: The Huntsman is a close/medium range weapon for the Sniper. Sound familiar, eh? That's right, the Huntsman can be compared to the SMG, in fact it effectively is a projectile-based, DPS-decreased SMG that can headshot. Since you have to go closer to the enemies to even use it (although you can spam it into a crowd of enemies from far away), you'll want your secondary to make you a tank/assist you with surviving. This rules out the Jarate and SMGs. The SMG should be obvious since the Huntsman does its job but the Jarate, although works better with the Huntsman than rifle, pretty much limits your choice of secondary to the Bushwacka which while active has a damage vulnerability, 2 thorns in our plan to become a tank. The Razorback is pretty mediocre since Spy...has a gun he can shoot you with, but if you don't plan on using the Tribalman's Shiv no one's stopping you. It's not a direct downgrade. So that leaves the Darwin's Danger Shield and the Cozy Camper. Let's get it out of the way, the health regen is a huge upside and that itself lessens the effects of afterburn quite a bit. I'm actually not sure if the less knockback and no flinching works with the Huntsman but even if they didn't it's still a far superior option to the Shield. Melee: Basically you have the stock and the Tribalman's Shiv. Since you wont be needing the Jarate or Carbine the Bushwacka is out of the picture and the Shahanshah is just...no. I prefer the Tribalman's Shiv because it can easily ward off people from chasing you if they get up close and you can track Spies with the bleed effect since you (probably) won't be needing the Razorback. Strategy: What's there to say? Instead of going really far away, get more up close but still be at a distance to where if a Soldier fires a rocket you can safely dodge it. Randomly fire around corners, just spam into a crowd, ect. The Huntsman isn't just a meme weapon that you can only get kills with if you're lucky! Use the right equipment and you'll be the most annoying little Aussie shit the enemy team has ever encountered. tl;dr you'll be closer to the enemy, use secondary to help you survive, use melee to deal high damage in desperate situations or use it as a tool to track spies"
100,vulnerability,tf2,"I've spent some time thinking of ways to balance the Engineer, and I think I've come up with something.",1,9oz1iq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/9oz1iq/ive_spent_some_time_thinking_of_ways_to_balance/,2018-10-18 01:16:06,"Long post: So, through personal experience, and the feedback of teammates in casual, one huge gripe with the Engineer playstyle is that turtling is exponentially more effective the more Engineers there are. Reason being that they can pool resources to build, upgrade, and heal each others buildings. Another oversight that I detected was how useless the Southern Hospitality is. Sure, the bleed effect is cool and supposedly it helps with tracking spies but, as many before me have gone into much greater detail about, it's simply not practical; especially considering it can't crit and the odds of running into a random enemy Pyro as you're tracking down Spy jose.gonzales.2004 are ridiculously high enough to make you worry about that fire vulnerability. Considering all of this, this is what I propose: Engineer Changes: Engineers can no longer heal friendly Engineer's buildings, whacking a friendly building will only remove sappers and/or refill its ammo. Southern Hospitality Changes: Whacking friendly buildings heals them On hit: target bleeds for 5 seconds This weapon cannot random crit -33% swing speed -OR- -50% build speed to friendly buildings The propsed Southern Hospitality changes would address the issue of 6 Engineers healing the same sentry constantly. With this, we keep the bleed effect the SH is known for, but also emphasize the Hospitality part of its namesake. I'm certain people before me have proposed removing the Engineers capability to interact with friendly buildings all together, but I feel that's a little unreasonable, the game is *Team* Fortress after all. TL;DR: Take away healing friendly buildings, make it unique to the Southern Hospitality."
101,vulnerability,tf2,My Personal Wishes for the Heavy Update,1,9tdvg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/9tdvg4/my_personal_wishes_for_the_heavy_update/,2018-11-02 08:47:53,"With the heavy update coming... eventually (I hope) I've put some thought into just what I'd like to see given to the big lug. -A new primary I'll start with the big one. A lot of people have wanted the Heavy to have a primary that increases his movespeed or health to pair with the shotgun heavy playstyle. Personally I've had a better idea for a playstyle-altering primary weapon: A rail gun. The idea I have for this is simple. A hitscan weapon that fires a single shot similar to the sniper rifle. Obviously it cannot charge or headshot, but would have a much more powerful punch to it and a faster firing rate. I feel like it should not require reloading and should feel pretty similar to Quake's rail gun, both to play similarly to the Quake rail gun and to keep up with the trend of heavy primaries not requiring reloading. Now the big takeaway from this would be that it would NOT require reving up or reving down. This would be a big increase in mobility over the minigun; although the heavy would still be less mobile than ever other class in the game (even less mobile than a solider that doesn't rocket jump) but it would still be a significant advantage over a minigun. Thus I believe the weapon should have 2 downsides to counteract this increase in mobility: Less damage output than any of Heavy's miniguns (though still high enough to be a danger to anyone that gets close to Heavy and high enough to be worthy of being a ""Heavy"" weapon) and a reduced max healthpool (around 50 less putting him still beefier than soldier but not as beefy as a normal Heavy seems alright) should counterbalance the advantages. I feel as if this will give Heavy a single-shot primary that players may find funner that will still feel like it belongs on Heavy and isn't too strong or too weak. - Huo Long Heater Pretty simple, either remove the ammo consumption from the ring of fire or give it more max ammo. The ammo consumption was needed before to keep the minigun from being a straight upgrade to stock, but is unneeded after the minigun's rework and just keeps it from being used even in situations it should preform strong in. - Brass Beast Revert the nerfs to this gun. It needs something else as well, but reverting the nerfs its damage resistance got would really help. Maybe reduce the movespeed negative from 60% to 50%. - Natasha I have no idea how to balance this gun without changing the slow down mechanic into something else. - Buffalo Steak Sandvich Remove the damage vulnerability. I know it's there to make up for the increased mobility, but being restricted to melee-only already is a big enough downside. Also perhaps give it a small 100 health heal. It still wouldn't be good, but it would be much more usable. - Dalokohs Bar Since it only restores 100 health give it a reduced eating timer. This would allow the chocolate to be a smaller heal that doesn't leave the Heavy open to being ambushed while eating quite as much as his other options and would help him take a small chocolate snack more often. - GRU and Eviction Notice Just please unfuck these weapons and make the Eviction Notice not GruLite. I don't really have an idea for what to do but, it'd be really appreciated. Thanks. - Warrior's Spirit Crazy idea that might not even be possible, but what if you removed the damage vulnerability on them and gave them an increased switch speed BUT having the Warrior's Spirit equip would disallow using your primary weapon. Ideally making the Warrior's Spirit a great option for punching and shotgunning (or even using the steak) but unable to use Heavy's minigun so you had to rely on your melee and secondary only. It's a crazy idea but hey, it sounded fun in my mind. - Finale And there you have it, my personal Smissmas Wish List for the Heavy Update. Did you agree with any of my changes? Do you think I'm terrible at balancing things and the community should spend every waking moment thankful that I have no say in TF2's balance? Feel free to let me know your thoughts. "

Here are the stats so far: When weapon is active: +On hit: Bleed for 5 seconds +Sappers are destroyed in a single hit -10% damage vulnerability on wearer -Sapper deals 10% more damage Note: I think that this could give the Engineer more versatility in a duel against the Spy, while also having to play smarter. I'm also removing the fire vulnerability debuff because it seemed too situational and irrelevant, so I'm replacing it with vulnerability to general damage. How are the changes so far?

Max. 12dmg/s for 15 seconds) \-Weapon is disabled for 10 seconds if wielder jumps into water/gets covered in mad milk or jarate. **Back Scatter:** \+60% Bullets per shot \+Mini-crits when fired at enemy's back from close range \-25% less accurate \-No random crits \-51% clip size (only 3 rounds per clip) \+25% faster firing speed **Baby Face's Blaster:** \+On Hit: Builds boost. Run speed increased with boost. \-10% move speed on wearer \-34% clip size \-Speed boost decreases after 10 seconds of not attacking enemies. Boost decrease reset on hit. Added boost depends on how much damage did attack dealt. Double jumps take away 25% of max boost. **Sandman:** Bring back the old sandman. That's it. **The Equalizer**: \+Damage increases depending on how much damage wearer took without dying (up to 200%) \-30% Damage \-40% less healing from medkits \-90% less healing from Medics/dispensers **The Gas Passer** \+Gas meter builds with damage done and/or time (but this time 30% faster) \+Doused Enemies take +50% more damage from Pyro Flamethrowers,Flareguns and afterburn from the same sources. \+Doused enemies are set on fire by any **Shot** (Not melee hits. Even enemy Pyros are set on fire) \-Gas meter starts empty \-Spawning and resupply doesn't affect the Gas meter. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment:** Okay... This one I have to describe in regular words and not stats. So basically: On hit You set target on fire,but if they were already burning the Volcano Fragment ""Absorbs"" the flames and the next attack on a not burning target will deal 25% more damage,but If the flames were created by the Volcano Fragment itself it won't absorb them (Must be any other source like flamethrower). You can extinguish multiple targets,stacking up the Absorptions up to 4 (100% more damage on next hit VS not burning target). **The pain train** \+On hit: Make target bleed for 5 seconds \+15% more damage dealt \+1 Capture rate on wearer \-20% more (overall) damage vulnerability on wearer \-No random crits. **The Ullapol Caber:** \-50% slower deploy speed \-15% slower swing speed \+200% damage on first (explosive) hit \+100% damage dealt VS self \-No random crits **Huo-Long Heater:** \+On hit: Sets target on fire for 6 seconds \+10% faster firing speed \+50% more ammo on wearer \+Creates a ring of flames while spun up (appears every 0.25 seconds) \-20% damage penalty \-Consumes additional 2 ammo per second while spun up. **Eviction Notice** \+50% Faster firing speed \+15% Faster move speed on wearer \-50% Damage penalty **The Overdose:** \+20% More movement speed on wearer \-15% Damage penalty \+On hit: Target is slowed by 20% for 1 second **The Classic:** \+Charge and fire shots independent from zoom \+25% faster charge rate \+35% more movement speed while charging (Same speed while zoomed in,faster while charging outside of zoom) \-No headshots when not fully charged \-30% less damage on bodyshots. \+30% more damage on headshots **The Cleaner's Carabine:** \-20% clip size \-20% slower firing speed \+15% bonus damage \+10% more accurate \-No random crits \+Secondary fire when charged grants mini crits for 10 seconds. \+Dealing (only with the carabine) damage fills charge meter **The Enforcer:** \+20% Damage bonus \-20% slower firing speed \+Attacks pierce damage resistance effects and bonuses \-No random crits \-15% less accurate I consider rest of the weapons at least a little viable. If you don't like my ideas - I respect that. And please don't go to comments hating on me if your favourite weapon is here. It's unnecessary and you're probably alone with that one,buddy."

109,vulnerability,tf2,The tenth class: A concept with a full guide to the weaponry and stats of the all new class,0,9chxs9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/9chxs9/the_tenth_class_a_concept_with_a_full_guide_to/,2018-09-03 13:07:13,"ATTENTION! THIS IS ONLY A SEMI SERIOUS CONCEPT. I TRIED MY BEST TO MAKE THIS BALANCED, BUT I UNDERSTAND IF THIS CLASS IS NOT BALANCED AT ALL. HAVE A LOOK, AND THANK YOU! So...To begin, there are nine classes in Team Fortress 2. Each have unique roles to play in their teams and represent a mercenary that was hired to kill stuff. Scout-Flank and take down vulnerable targets. Cap points when the other team is not suspecting it. Pyro-Flank the team and burst down targets. Direct combat is also effective too. Soldier-Charge the frontlines, taking down multiple targets and taking the brunt of the impact. Heavy-The tankiest, gunniest, slowest class. A tanking heavy can help the team effectively cap a point, while a flanking heavy can demolish other classes. Demoman-Lay down sticky traps and demolish engineer buildings. Face-to-Face combat is also a specialty of this class with the Demoknight subclass. Engineer-Defend objectives with his sentry guns, provide support with dispensers, and get allies to the frontlines faster with teleporters. Sniper-Take out the tankiest classes with a single shot. Being one of the most effective classes in managing chokepoints and taking down unsuspecting targets. Spy-Supports the team by taking out isolated targets, destroying nests of aimbotting sentries, and generally just killing classes with one stab. Medic-Heals people and keeps then in the fight, and with a finely timed ubercharge, the tides can be swiftly and effectively turned in a matter of seconds. All of these classes have unique jobs in their team. But what do none of them have? Take a moment and think it over. No class in Team Fortress 2 has the ability to oversee the playing field, controlling troops, and throwing orders around, yet still be able to support the team with extra firepower and buffs. Introducing Mrs. Pauline, the administrative assistant. She has a wide variety of firepower, but her real strengths lie in her ability to survey the entire map with her Radar Tracker. The Radar is in the PDA slot of her loadout and displays a minimap view of the entire map. More on that later. Lets talk about her stats and weaponry first. Stats: Mrs. Pauline has a base movement speed of 115% movement speed, which, compared to the medics 105% and the scouts 133%, is fairly decent. Mrs. Pauline also has 150 base health. So flanking might be a bit of a specialty of hers although staying back and supporting teammates can also be an aspect. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Primary: The dart gun Nothing too flashy, but this gun packs a punch when used in the right situations. Fires a small, electronic dart every 0.4 seconds that travels at 5,000 hammer units per second, (roughly five times faster than a grenade from a demomans grenade launcher). Each dart starts falling at 50 meters and deals 24 damage at medium range, with a 24 damage ramp-up and 10 damage falloff. So, you can see that this gun is best used in close quarters. Each clip holds 8 darts ,and the gun reloads the entire clip in 1.6 seconds. Its not just some plain old gun though, the dart gun implants a tracker on anyone it deals 60 damage to. Trackers last for 45 seconds before running out of battery and falling onto the ground. Marking the target on your HUD. Mrs. Pauline can then pull up her radar tracker and ping the enemy's location for the rest of the team to see. A pinged enemy is revealed(basically a red outline) to all your teammates and is also marked-for-death for 10 seconds. Pinged enemies will also reveal all other enemies around them and be indicated with a radar icon above their heads to both enemies and allies. If a teammate is pinged by an enemy, you can hit them with your melee weapon to remove the ping. Hitting Alt-Fire on your dart gun fires a special dart that consumes 4 ammo instead of 1 and reveals allies only to you as a wallhack and on your radar tracker for 10 seconds. Pinged allies reveal anyone in a 20 meter radius onto your radar tracker. This can help you keep track of where youre allies are and how you can notify them about impending danger. MVM upgrades: -10 damage needed to track targets($250,up to 4 upgrades) +15% firing speed($200 up to 5 upgrades) +35% damage($400, up to 4 upgrades) +25% ping duration($300, up to 3 upgrades) +25% clip size($400, up to 2 upgrades) +15% reload speed($250, up to 4 upgrades) +10% speed boost on tracked allies($500, up to 1 upgrade) +25 health on kill($200, up to 4 upgrades) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Secondary: The tracer pistol This gun was used by Mrs. Pauline in the official SFM short Expiration date. Its a two shot pistol that fires tracer rounds at enemies. Reveals each enemy hit for 5 seconds at point blank range, 3 seconds at medium range, and 2 seconds at long range. Stacking up to 6 seconds maximum for each enemy. Revealed enemies are seen as a red outline to allies and move 10% slower for the first 1 second of being shot. Each clip holds 2 shots, reloads one bullet every 0.7 seconds, and the gun fires a 50 damage bullet every 0.7 seconds. There is a +10 damage ramp-up and only a 5 damage falloff, although reveal time is decreased based on distance. Bullets are hitscan. This gun is perfect for poking enemies from long range, but can also be used to help allies chase down enemies that have wandered into the wrong neighborhood. MVM upgrades: +15% firing speed($200, up to 2 upgrades) +15% reload speed($250, up to 4 upgrades) +25% clip size($400, up to 4 upgrades, also increases reveal stack time) +50% damage to bomb carrier($350, up to 3 upgrades) -35% movement speed on revealed targets($250, up to 1 upgrade, cannot stack) +15% damage vulnerability on revealed targets($400, up to 2 upgrades) +25 health on kill($200, up to 4 upgrades) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Melee: The taser staff A small, hand-held taser with two electrical prongs. A small burst of electricity sparks up between the prongs every time mrs. pauline stabs it forward. The weapon swings slightly faster than the any normal melee weapon(excluding scouts) and deals 50 damage(compared to the normal 65) to anyone that comes in melee range of it. Unlike other melees the weapon has a battery meter that depletes every time you SWING the weapon. The battery meter depletes in 5 swings and recharges over time. Picking up ammo boxes does not give battery to the taser. MVM upgrades: +15% swing speed($200, up to 5 upgrades) +25% max charge($200, up to 4 upgrades) Melee swings sap targets for 5 seconds($500, up to 1 upgrades) +25 health on kill($100, up to 4 upgrades) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PDA: The radar tracker A device similar to a contracker that Mrs. Pauline can pull up on her screen when necessary. Once activate, if fills about 90% of the screen while Mrs. Pauline can still look around using the mouse. The contracker displays an overhead display of the entire map revealed/tracked allies and enemies as blue/red dots with the players class listed above it. The radar tracker also shows all ammo and health kits currently on the map. INCLUDING AMMO BOXES DROPPED ON DEATH AND HEALTH KITS DROPPED BY THE CANDY CANE. Tracked enemies are shown on the bottom of the radar tracker with the player name and headshot of their class. You can track up to 5 enemies and pressing each of their corresponding numbers, you ping them. Alt-Fire while your radar tracker is active to make Mrs. Pauline pull out an electronic pen, disabling you from looking around, but giving you a pointer on the minimap of the radar tracker so that you can select parts of the map or even allies/enemies to relay information to your allies. Selecting one of the four types of markers listed at the bottom of the tracker: Safe, Help, Danger, and Go here. Left mouse button on anywhere on the map will ping the location or player with the corresponding marker. Indicating safety in one area, starting pushes, pleading for help for other teammates, and telling if an area is safe. Markers have a 4 second cooldown to prevent spam and balance the weapon. The radar tracker also displays enemies and allies ONLY TO YOU in all of these situations: -Enemies in line of sight of any other allies -All allies at full health -All enemies revealed with tracer pistol -All pinged enemies MVM upgrades: +25% damage resistance while deployed($400, up to 1 upgrade) "

I would mainly use it as an offensive weapon whenever I am in close quarters with low ammo on my weapons as a final stand. But now that it's nerfed with the same health draining mechanic like the GRU (Expected because EN has a speed boost when active), I can't use it at all as an offensive weapon. Honestly; I would prefer it if they removed the speed bonus(The reason why it got a health draining mechanic) and health draining altogether and just add a 20% damage vulnerability while active(And still keep the speed on hit). But that's just my opinion."

113,vulnerability,tf2,My personal Pyro loadouts.,1,8zj19y,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8zj19y/my_personal_pyro_loadouts/,2018-07-17 17:16:19,"Go-to Loadout: Stock, Scorch Shot, Backscratcher, The Stock Flamethrower is just really good overall. It has the most airblasts, meaning you can consistently take on Soldiers and Demos and extinguish your teammates, and it has good damage output to boot. There isn't much to say, other than it's the most reliable of all the flamethrowers. The Scorch Shot is to ignite those targets that are way out of my reach, such as Snipers, or distant enemies down chokepoints. The mini-hop is good for getting up small ledges, but I have a better loadout for mobility. The Backscratcher is, I'd argue, the best melee for Pyro. Atleast for me. The increased damage is a lovely perk, and getting more health back from packs is an incredible asset if I know where to find them. I don't need the Axtinguisher crits when I have a damage bonus on-demand. I don't need the Powerjack's healing on-kill when I can just bolt to the nearest medium health pack and be back over 150HP. Combining the reliability of the Stock Flamethrower, the range of the Scorch Shot, and the survivability of the Backscratcher makes for one of the best loadouts for an independent Pyro. Also, you're free Uber for Medics, so that's a plus. Flank Pyro Loadout: Backburner, Detonator, Powerjack, The Backburner is the go-to flamethrower for a flank-heavy playstyle, dealing full crits from behind. This makes taking out Heavies and Soldiers much easier, and you can take out the Medic before anyone knows what happened. That is, if you play your cards right. You need to actually get behind the enemy first for this weapon to be effective, which is where the next two weapons are useful. The Detonator is almost solely for utility here. But it does have its moments in the heat of battle. If there's a large group of enemies, just fire into them and detonate the flare. But what you'll mainly be using it for is flare jumping. You can use the detonator to go roughly half as high as a Soldier's rocket jump, letting you reach high ledges and cross large horizontal gaps. This is to help you take shortcuts and give you full control over the map, while still giving you a secondary weapon. And this pairs great with the next weapon. The Powerjack is the pinnacle of mobility for Pyro. Yes, you take more damage while it's out, so you've gotta be careful. But the point here is not to be seen. So if you're out of sight and out of the fight, the damage vulnerability isn't going to effect you that much. Combine the increased running speed with the Detonator's flare jumping and you're good to go. Then once you're behind the enemy, out comes the Backburner. I should probably mention the downside of the Backburner's increased airblast cost, but since you're trying to flank the opponents and not be seen, only having four airblasts is the least of your concern. It's basically just a better alternative to the Phlogistinator. Pyroland Loadout: Rainblower, Scorch Shot, Lollichop, (+Pyrovision Goggles) There isn't really much for me to say about this one. It's just two Stock reskins with the Scorch Shot and Pyrovision Goggles. This is the loadout I pick just to have a good time with. It's not about how many kills I get or whether I'm playing the objective, it's just about dicking around in happyland and hitting people with a lollipop. And that's the definition of happiness. PyBro Loadout: Stock Flamethrower, Stock Shotgun, Homewrecker, The Stock Flamethrower and Shotgun are just the most reliable close and close-to-medium range weapons in a fight for Pyro. Especially when fighting other Pyros. The large amount of airblasting you can do is good for extinguishing your teammates, as mentioned before, and your team will thank you for that. The Homewrecker is the go-to PyBro melee for the simple fact you can delete Sappers in one hit. You can take the sapper off the building when the Spy places it, and then immediately go after him. The Spy has two options, reapply the sapper, or run. If he shoots you, he's going to get shot by the sentry nine times out of ten. If he backstabs you, great, you're dead, but so is he unless he's right by the Sentry and takes out his sapper immediately. And half the Spies I meet don't have MrPaladin levels of reaction time. These three weapons are essential for helping out your friendly neighborhood Engineers, and the rest of your team aswell. This loadout lets you become the ultimate team player. Terror From Above Loadout: Dragon's Fury, Thermal Thruster, Axtinguisher, This is another one of those loadouts I pick just to screw around. You can fly in over the enemy's heads or up to a high ledge, and then drop down on them and three-shot them with the Dragon's Fury before they even know what happened. Or if your aim is shit, just use the Axtinguisher after you ignite them the first time. Then thermal thrust the hell out of there. Please let me know your personal Pyro loadouts in the comments below. inb4 people complaining about the Scorch Shot and Pyro in general"

Revere Gauntlets: (Scout Primary) Upside: \+15% more damage resistance \+50% faster recharge for rechargables When Damaged: +10% Speed Boost for 2 seconds \+50% faster switch speed Downside: \-No primary Ideas: This unlock trades offence and picking for deffence and support, I mainly made this for MvM Cludder Chucker: (Scout Primary, Midevil Usable) Upside: \+233% more damage Downside: \-83% less clip size \-70% Pellets Neutral: \*Pellets are arching projectiles Idea: This weapon has the same damage per shot but less Dps, I just made this so scout can have a MvM primary Three Kick Mule: (Scout/Engineer Secondary) Upside: \+300% more damage Downside: \-75% slower firerate \-75% less clip size \-75% less ammo \-10% slower movement speed when active \-User takes 5 damage per shot \-Crits turn into mini-crits Idea: This weapon has the same Dps but less sustained Dps so you are trading sustained fire and survivability for better burst damage (Base: 60) and the mini-crit downside is so you can't have a Kritzkrieg medic and wreck the enemy team. Mann Annihilating Davy: (Soldier Primary) Upside: \+33% damage bonus (Base can't one shot a scout) \+33% bigger explosion radius Downside: \-75% smaller clip \-80% ammo \-50 less max health \-117% longer reload \-when active: User is marked for death \-no random crits \-crits turn into mini-crits (can't one shot a heavy, demoman or, heavy) Neutral: \*Projectile archs Idea: This weapon trades longer term use and survivability for short term croud control.

Final Reserve: (Soldier Melee) Upside: \+5% faster when active \+Enemies when killed with this weapon will now drop large ammo pickups intead of medium ammo pickups Downside: \-50% less damage \-25% swing speed \-Marked for death when active (+3 seconds after) Idea: This weapon is only usfull when both of your weapon's clips are empty and the enemy is at 33 health or lower, so you are trading other utility unlocks for extra ammo when finishing people off. Spark Stash: (Pyro Secondary) Upside: \+50% more primary ammo Press ""reload"" with primary: Spends 60 ammo and you drop a small ammo pickup Downside: No secondary Idea: This weapon trades a backup shotgun (or a long range shotgun) for a longer lasting primary and allows you to give 20% of your ammo to a team-mate Party Suprise: (Pyro Secondary) Replaces secondary with a recharable grenade: \*30 second recharge time \*Explosion radius and knockback simular to rocket launcher (Can't explosion-jump with it) \*Deals 15 damage \*Team-mates in explosion get a small medkit and small ammo pickup \*Takes 5 seconds to explode Idea: This weapon allows you to give your team a small pick-me-up and wards off any close-range agressers. Suzie's Teddy: (Pyro Melee) (It's a child's teady and her skull on a board with spikes) Upsides: On hit: target bleeds for 10 seconds When enemies die to your bleed, you gain a ""friend"" (max: 3), each friend gives you a +5% speed boost (for a max of 15%) Downside: \-90% less damage \+200% more bleed vulnerability Idea: It's a sadistic eyelander for pyro Recouped Rival: (Demoman Primary) Upside: \+25% more self damage force \-10% less self damage Downside: No primary \-50% less air control \+10% more fall damage Idea: This gives demoman a item simular to soldier's gunboats but it has its own unique twist Mob Mitigater: (Demo Primary) Upside: \+33% more splash range \+50% less clip size Downside: \-50% less damage \+15% more self damage Launched bombs shatter on surfaces Idea: This weapon allows for better group combat but worse 1v1 combat, this weapon can't be used to compinsate for bad aim, you have to hit a target. Nobber Camper: (Demo Secondary) Upside: \+50% more primary ammo (16 to 24) \+1 primary ammo every 2 seconds Downside: No secondary Idea: You are trading defence and backup weapon (that is basically a second primary) for sustainable use for your primary Starchy Heart: (Demoman Secondary) Replaces secondary with consumable: \*30 second recharge \*apon consumption: \+20% more damage reduction (10 seconds) \+10 more max health (10 seconds) \+20% health recoverd \*can't give to overs Idea: This is an alternative to a shield so you trade long term small protection for a short term boost. Mechanical Destruction: (Heavy Primary) Upside: Ignores minigun resistance (Lvl.2 Sentry has 15%, Lvl.3 has 20%, MvM tank has 75%) \+10% more damage Downside: \-50% less ammo \-25% less ammo from pickups \-90% less ammo from dispencers Idea: This weapon is mainly for MvM but you can't full auto 24/7 with a Lvl.3 dispencer, so besides MvM, this weapon is for short term use where you need to get rid of a sentry or two. Reliable Endurable Deffence (Heavy Secondary) Replaces secondary with rechargable deployable shield: \*45 second recharge time \*shield has 300 health \*Only one shield can be deployed at a time \*shield as wide as heavy and half as tall Idea: This item allows you to give you or your team-mates some cover Genghis Brawn: (Heavy Secondary) Upside: \+25% more damage On Hit: +10% speed boost for 2 seconds Downside: \-50% less clip size \-75% less ammo \-50% slower reload Idea: This weapon is designed for you to charge twards a target then retreat to reload, this weapon is mainly for fat-scout heavys Electro Manipulated Pulse (Engineer Primary, Pyro Secondary) Upside: Does not reqire ammo Halves sappers effect when hit with projectile Spy's cloak drains 10% faster for 3 seconds when hit with projectile Enemy building's functions slow by 10% when hit with projectile Downside: \-75% less damage \-66% clip size \-50% slower firerate \-25% slower reload Cannot damage enemy buildings Idea: I've seen a lot of engineer weapon ideas where a long range weapon removes sappers, I think this idea is a bit more fair where you can slow the sapper so you have more time to deal with the spy before saving your buildings, pyros can also use this as a pybro. Ranged Replenisher: (Engineer Secondary) Upside: When alt-fire is held down: primary fire uses 11 metal and if team sentry is hit, the sentry gets 10 metal twards its ammo Downside: \-33% less damage \+100% more ammo uses per shot Idea: This pistol allows you to slowly replenish a sentry's ammo at range but not as efficient as a wrench (83% as efficient) Ruckzinisch (Medic Primary) Upside: \+10% more health from all sources Downside: No Primary Neutral: Ammo sources fill ""overcharge"" meter, when healing the overcharge meter will drain by 10%/s and medi-guns healrate will increase by 10% but, ubercharge rate is decreased by 10% Idea: Your trading defence and/or long range healing for more health when you have overcharge Schleppen (Medic Secondary) Upside: \+10% more jumpheight \+2% more movement speed Downside: Mark for death when active and 3 seconds after \-70% less damage No random crits Idea: This weapon allows you to escape more quickly but you will take more damage and you miss out on a close range weapon (and it's near unlimited crits) Novmann (Sniper Primary) Upside: \+20% more damage (50 to 60) \+50% more firerate (0.66Rps to 1Rps) Downside: Crits turn into mini-crits No charge when scoped Neutral: \*Scope replaced with 1.1x Zoom Iron Sights Idea: This weapon trades the ability to pick off anyone for a medium range weapon. Also it will hopfully draw some bad snipers away from the machina. Last Mann Alive: (Sniper Secondary) Upside: \+33% faster firerate \-25% less switch too speed Downside: \-25% less damage \-50% longer reload \+25% longer switch from speed Idea: Same Dps, trades sustained fire for imergency defence Empercial Cane: (Sniper Melee) Upside: \+50% more kockback Downside: \-50% less damage Marked for death when equiped and 3 seconds after Idea: Only usable for knocking back agressers to escape Batraite: (Spy Revolver) Upside: On hit: +6% movement speed for 2 seconds Downside: \-75% less damage \-100% slower switch from speed Idea: This weapon is for escaping and not agressing Overcloak: (Spy Watch) Upside: \+50% faster recharge Downside: \-50% faster drain Idea: Small cloaks, fast recharge Sudtle Bug Upside: Sapper cannot be removed Sapped buildings take 100% more metal from engineers Sapped buildings function 10% slower Downside: Sapper lasts 10 seconds Sapper doesn't damage buildings Sapper doesn't stop building functions"
115,vulnerability,tf2,Pyro Melee Rebalance Ideas.,3,932qkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/932qkk/pyro_melee_rebalance_ideas/,2018-07-30 19:50:18,"Out of all of the classes aside from engie/spy pyro is one of the few classes where he has a much wider range of great melee weapon choices that can end up being put to use quite often with only one of the options (Powerjack) being just a tad better than another in almost every situation here are some ideas I have personally had about pyro melees. **Axtinguisher** While the current Axtinguisher is much better than the other iteration of it post Tough Break it still leaves much to be desired. It is currently still very weak as a combo option since it's damage scales with afterburn in mind. My proposal is to make it able to compete with the likes of the Powerjack once again and become a viable option in a competitive setting to increase diversity. The whole ""Sketchek's Bequest"" attribute is quite neat in concept and doesn't seem right removing completely since it is honoring a late member of the TF2 community I suggest moving the ""Sketchek's Bequest"" attribute to the Postal Pummeler with some tweaking onto it, or leaving it on the Axtinguisher and giving the suggested stats for the Axtinguisher to the Postal Pummeler. *Stats* + Axtinguisher does mini-crit damage from the front and full crit damage from behind to burning targets and extinguishes the target on hit. - 33% Less damage V.S. Non-burning players - No Random Crits **Postal Pummeler** I've explained my general idea of what the TFTeam should do with the Postal Pummeler and ""Sketchek's Bequest"" in my little paragraph about the Axtinguisher, although my main goal with the balances I'm suggesting for the Postal Pummeler is to make a more rewarding version of the Axtinguisher that trades off some of the raw killing power in exchange for a buff on kill. *stats* + Mini-crits burning targets and extinguishes them. + Damage increases based on remaining duration of afterburn. + Sketchek's Bequest: Killing blows on burning players grant a speed boost. - 33% Damage Penalty - No random crits **Homewrecker** This is a bit of a niche weapon that is underappreciated quite often since it is a weapon designed specifically for supporting your friendly engineers, but is overshadowed by other more appealing choices. While it is criminally underused I don't think that's a reason for it to receive any changes since it's fine the way it currently is. *stats* No change. **Powerjack** Oh boy, this is going to be a fun one to tackle since I have two possible ideas for this item you guys can have a bit of fun by telling me I am stupid for coming up with the joke that is the 2nd idea I have for this item. My idea around the first balance idea is keeping the idea of health on kill while reducing the speed boost given by the item slightly and the second balance idea is trying to keep the whole original concept of the Gas Jocky set... Going fast while becoming much weaker in terms of primary damage, and health. *stats (idea 1)* + 75 health gained on kill (can overheal) + 10% faster move speed on wearer when active. - Raises damage vulnerability by 25% when active. *stats (idea 2)* +10% faster move speed on wearer. - 25 health on wearer. **Backscratcher** While rarely used in competitive play due to it having very situational outside of uber building with the Detonator in spawn with your medic while your team is doing a suicide wave on a koth map. This is a weapon that sees a lot of pub/casual use because it allows pyro to take a more aggressive role and make him a lot more self sustaining. My only gripes with this item is it's inconsistencies. If they maybe just made it's downside of healing from dispeners/medics include crossbow arrows similar to the Escape Plan I would be fine with it. *stats* No change. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** This weapon is so bad/useless I don't even really know of a way to salvage it in it's current state, like there would have to be a complete redesign of what this weapon does to make it remotely useful. *stats* Complete rework. **Third Degree** The last genuine straight upgrade from stock that remains in the game to this day, the idea of this weapon is great allowing pyro to play into a anti-medic role. If balanced correctly I believe this could be a great weapon to just mess with a pub-stomping player with a pocket medic or maybe even as a surprise pick tool in a competitive scenario. My idea of the rebalance is to solidify it's role as a anti-medic weapon, of course this one that I believe would require a lot of testing ingame to make sure everything is fine tuned and doesn't feel too unfair or too weak. *stats* + Damage transfers to all players connected by medic beams. + 15% Less damage received by players connect by medic beams while active + 25% More damage V.S. Players connected by medic beams. - 33% Less damage V.S. Players not connected by medic beams. - 20% slower swing speed - Cannot be crit boosted **Neon Annihilator** Believe it or not I find this to be a underused weapon it has a lot of team play potential since enemies with Mad Milk, Jarate, and even Gas on them are effected by the crits vs wet players stat. It also even has the ability to remove Sappers just like the Homewrecker, although this item requires 2 hits instead of just one. It's a quite balanced weapon all pyroshark memes aside. *stats* No change. **Hot Hand** The Hot Hand is a weapon made as a joke, at least so it looks even though it still proves quite difficult to use when trying to use it in pubs/casual. I think making it's damage and swing speed similar to the scout's Holy Mackerel would make it a lot more fun to use maybe give it a bit more of a bigger downside alongside it. I'm not going to into great detail about what could be done with this weapon. All I know is that it should be made into a bit better of a joke item that you can have fun with in casual play. If you have taken your time to read through all my good or terrible ideas thank you. Comment what you think about certain ideas and be sure to suggest your own ideas for balances for pyro melee weapons."

Also, a quick side note, if random crits ARE removed from TF2, should the holiday punch still have them? **brass beast** reduce the rev up by 10-15% and make the resistance have immunity for crits. **warriors spirit** make it not suck with a 20% damage bonus (while active) and 20% damage vulnerability, and make kills give you 10 health. Just tone down the current stats. **dalokohs** fix the infinite overheal exploit and bring back the 50 overheal (thanks delfy) **eviction notice** remove the -5 health downside and keep it on the GRU. This was Winters rushed Heavy balance ideas, thank you and go away."

118,vulnerability,tf2,So how my suggested medic weapons will work,0,96ihzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/96ihzl/so_how_my_suggested_medic_weapons_will_work/,2018-08-12 03:59:57,"Primary - Kartoffelwerfer/Currywurst Kartoffelwerfer: \+ Hold fire to load up to three potatoes \+ Potatoes deal similar damage as shots from the CC \- 50% increased damaged vulnerability \- all successful enemy hits on you are critical \- -2 health per second on wearer \- minus 20 max health on wearer \- no random crits \- no crits Currywurst: \+ When eaten, increases Uber duration to 10 seconds \+ 30% increase in movement speed \- No offensive primary weapon (Unless equipped with the Vampir) \- Melee weapon does no crits. KW Scenario (positive) \- A medic is pocketing someone and said someone gets gibbed by a sticky trap or a rocket on full crit. Medic player quickly presses Q to switch to the Kartoffelwerfer and fires off three shots at the enemy Soldier/Demo. Assuming he's good at hit-scanning, he kills the Demo/Soldier (RIP) and retreats quickly. KW Scenario (Negative) \- A medic is pocketing someone who's quickscoping. Pocket gets killed. Medic unable to respond in time and suffers the same fate too. \- A medic does not react fast enough to a backstabbing spy. \- Pyro reflects potatoes back to Medic :/ \- Demoman charges Medic :/ \- Enemy medic + pocket is on Uber :/ \- Medieval Mode :/ \- Engineer vs Medic mode :/ CW Scenario (Positive) \- Hearing the sound of sentries, Medic eats a currywurst and with the increased uber, can kill everyone else with his pocket. \- Same with democampers \- Sniper nests \- Pyrocampers \- Spycampers \- Friendly scout or spy needs health. M2. CW becomes health kit. CW Scenario (Negative) \- YOU CAN'T ATTACK ANYONE AT RANGE \- A scout catches up to you and Bonks! you to death. \- Market Gardened/Eyelandered \- You press Q slower than the Spy presses M2. Secondary - Vampir The Vampir (Medigun): \+ sucks the health off enemy players (10 damage at Uber range) \+ +10% increased Ubertime \- cannot Uber without sucking health off enemy players. Basically its like the Gas Passer of Mediguns. You need to deal damage to be able to heal damage. \- 50% increased damage vulnerability. When paired with the KW, the Vampir becomes a BM's new best friend. Considering that this medic doesnt give af about healing his mates, he just wants the healing factor of the medic with increased DPS. Probably needs a nerf. Melee - Clinical Insanity \+ On hit, bleed for 10 seconds. \+ 10% increased movement speed when equipped. \- On miss, instakill yourself, you idiot. For someone who's really into BM and who's really good at Hitscanning, this loadout would really suit him lmao. This BM can unload a full load of 3 potatoes into the enemy using the KW and finish him off with the Vampir. Or he could start off with the CI and finish with the KW. I think this set needs to be nerfed. "

121,vulnerability,tf2,Some rebalancing suggestions,2,8nldz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8nldz1/some_rebalancing_suggestions/,2018-06-01 05:39:12,"***Those are just suggestions. Don't take them too seriously if they're bad, and suggest a better rebalance.* They are balance suggestions only around weapons that have a ban in 6v6 / 4v4 / Highlander, and two extra weapons.** ^^^^inb4 ^^^^downvotes ^^^^/ ^^^^complaints **Scout** Soda Popper: Add the same reload speed penalty as the Force-a-Nature. Bonk! Atomic Punch: Fixed speed reduction from the moment you drink it, reducing your max speed to 300 hu/s, and base health reduction to 100 from the moment you drink it. Debuffs last for 10s, and the speed reduction after drinking it doesn't apply anymore. Crit-a-Cola: Speed reduction from the moment you drink it, reducing your max speed to 375 hu/s, marked for death ONLY after firing your primary / secondary if someone tries the Crit-a-Cola to Pistol exploit, so using it with your melee weapon isn't as punishing to people just trying to have some fun with Snipers. Flying Guillotine: Damage fall-off calculated similarly to the Crusader's Crossbow; base damage set to 15, and bleeding time to 2s. At old moonshot range, damage set to 75 and bleeding time to 10s. Recharge speed set to 10s; crits players stunned by **your own Sandmann ball, or by a taunt-related stun**. Mad Milk: Recharge time set to 60s, and health regenerated is 25% of the damage dealt. Can be recharged by dealing damage, 5 damage = 1% of the charge. Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol: Stock firing speed. Atomizer: 25% damage vulnerability to bullets and explosives while active, you can't switch weapons back if the weapon isn't drawn out completely. Sandman: Stuns reduce the movement speed by 25% of the user's current speed cap, so Scouts will be moving at 300 hu/s, and Snipers at 225 hu/s. **Soldier** Cow Mangler 5000: 10% slower firing speed, 20% smaller splash radius on primary-fire, afterburn affected by splash radius (10s on a direct hit, varying from 6s to 0.5s depending on how distant you are to the middle). Black Box: Reduces self-healing effects from other weapons by 50% while active (Mad Milk, Concheror), 25 health on direct hits, 15 to 1 on splash damage, depending on how distant you are to the middle. B.A.S.E. Jumper: Reduces your mid-air speed linearly (100 hu/s reduction at every second) if you're over the Soldier's ground speed cap (speed cap affected by Disciplinary Action / ally Concherors), does NOT instantly reduce the Soldier's air speed to a halt. Disciplinary Action: Ally's speed boost lasts for 3s, user's speed boost lasts for 5s, 25% slower draw / holster speed. **Pyro** All weapons have been discussed (Reserve Shooter) / have glitches related to them (Gas Passer) / are waiting for a whitelist revamp to be used (Dragon's Fury). **Demoman** The only banned weapon was already discussed (B.A.S.E. Jumper). **Heavy** Natascha: Speed reduction affected by damage dealt (1% base speed reduction on 2 damage), no knockback from shots themselves. Buffalo Steak Sandvich: For some reason this is banned because of a combination with the Fists of Steel, which are also banned. So, yeah, good job 6s community lol But, still. Resistances / vulnerabilities / speed boosts from Heavy's melee weapons don't apply during this weapon's effect. Fists of Steel: For some reason, this is also banned. I'd just reduce the damage resistance to 30% if the weapon is still banned because of stats, and not because of the missing whitelist revision. **Engineer** Rescue Ranger: You can't get metal through resupply cabinets if one of your buildings was healed in the last 10s, and you can't heal your buildings near the spawn room's doors / shutters (you'd be only able to heal buildings once the shutter closes with you outside of it.). Health healed after the sentry takes damage also has a ""crit heal"" mechanic: 40 if it has been damaged recently (10s), between 40 and 80 if it has been damaged fairly recently (+10s to -20s), 80 if it hasn't been damaged recently (+20s). Short Circuit: I think that it's only banned because the whitelist revision didn't happen yet, so, we'll skip that one. Wrangler: Shield resistance reduced from 200% to 50%, or 100%, with the shield only protecting the front 180 degrees of the sentry, leaving it's back exposed. **Medic** Quick-Fix: Blast jump mirroring makes the Medic mirror the patient's horizontal / vertical speed **without being affected by the Medic walking forward or jumping**, so you won't rollout faster than your patient just by healing him and jumping forward. Overhealing speed reduced by 25%. Vaccinator: Vaccinator bubbles can't change resistances once they're activated, resistances can only be changed with a 10s delay (to skip useless resistances, once you press the Reload key with the Vaccinator out, a menu appears where you can choose resistances by pressing from 1 to 3), bubbles only block 50% crit damage. Solemn Vow: Your health / ber percentage is also shown to enemies, swing speed is brought back to stock, +25% damage and user suffers 10 damage every time he attacks with the weapon, and this damage can't be healed through the Medic's regeneration for 5s (stat could be named Do No Harm) **Sniper** Machina: Penetration shots have a 20% damage reduction per player penetrated, damage buff can be only applied on headshots. Jarate: Time affected by the Jarate's debuff alters depending on how far you are to the middle of the splash radius, varying from 10s to 0.5s **Spy** There are literally no weapons banned (besides the RTR, even though it's pretty bad) but, here are 2 personal weapons that I think should get rebalances Ambassador: Revert the nerf, but add more stats to it. Mini-crits on long range (beyond 2000 hu), headshots even if the weapon's spread hasn't recovered (headshots deal mini-crit damage) Diamondback: Critical damage affected by falloff, 30% slower firing speed And, if someone asks about the RTR, simple. Level downgrades take 5s, damages level 1 buildings with 20 damage per second."

Get this, the rocket jumper is NOT the worst soldier primary. (that title goes to the liberty launcher) and the fact that some people don't realize why people like myself and soundsmith use the rocket jumper is hilarious to me. Now the reason, it may seem obvious... it's because of the mantreads. quoting the stats -75% reduction in push force taken from damage Deals 3x falling damage to the player you land on -75% reduction in airblast vulnerability 200% increased air control when blast jumping. not the first part doesn't matter. the good part is ""Deals 3x falling damage to the player you land on -75% reduction in airblast vulnerability 200% increased air control when blast jumping."" that lets you land on people and kill them, for those failed market gardens. and its easier to control the rocket jumps. and since we use rocket jumper not stock we don't need gunboats. i hope you liked this little presentation if you did leave a comment with your thoughts or upvote it. -lunar"

Demoman is a drunken Scottish. The only bottles he has are for taunts or his regular melee.

125,vulnerability,tf2,Some weapon balance ideas,9,8d3i3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8d3i3w/some_weapon_balance_ideas/,2018-04-18 16:16:01,"Hey, I have ideas for weapon balances that I think are pretty cool. Feel free to argue or share your own! * Baby Face's Blaster - Honestly, who likes having every weapon you fight against work like the natascha? The natascha is bad enough on it's own. Having a stray bullet completely negate boost is too much. How do you balance this? - **Change Boost Reduced on hit to 25% damage vulnerability**. This effectively allows the scout to be encouraged to strafe more (the whole point of increased speed) but is more punishing for mess ups/just can't survive as much. * The Sandman - As a scout main, I'm slightly devastated as to what happened to this weapon. But stun mechanics are annoying, so I can agree that changing it is overall a fair decision. But making the ball do a slow effect? Really? You're a scout, you outrun every class why in god's name do you need to slow down an enemy like really. - **Change the slow mechanic to a knockback effect**. This still wouldn't make the weapon quite as good as it used to be, but it would still be more useful and at the very least just be kind of fun and jokey. * The Equalizer - I realize no one really cares about this weapon, but I had an idea for it. Since it seems like it's kind of supposed to be the yin to the escape plan's yang, why not give it some sort of survival mechanic too? - **Add Increased damage resistance the lower your hp is**. This will allow the soldier to tank some extra damage while trying to escape and maybe even be able to run towards the enemy and get a quick hit in. If this is too powerful it could also just be specifically bullet or explosive damage. I realize the escape plan will still be preferred a lot, but the idea of having resistance AND damage might make it more intriguing to some people. These were just some ideas I had that I was really confident would work and better change the game. There are a lot of other weapons that need buffs (gas passer mainly), nerfs (diamondback), and some weapons that have no clear use and need reworks (liberty launcher and shortstop) but I don't have clear ideas on what needs to be changed for these weapons."
126,vulnerability,tf2,Weapons that suck to use,0,8e4iah,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8e4iah/weapons_that_suck_to_use/,2018-04-23 02:56:25,"Title. * The Baby Face's Blaster: While not as bad as the others, this weapon can be fun to use at times, but when compared to the stock scattergun, this weapon has far too many elements which restrict what you can do as scout, making it an obstacle you *have* to work around. Pair this with the fact that your boost practically evaporates when you get hurt or jump, you have to play immensely careful if you want to maintain your speed. * The Back Scatter: Although it's not as inherently bad as the other weapons, the poor accuracy and tiny clip size makes this weapon so incredibly situational, only scouts that are constantly flanking can make any use of the upsides. Pair this with the lack of random crits, and you're better off with any other scout primary. * The Bonk! Atomic Punch: While this weapon used to be the drink of choice for getting past traps or ambushes, the new Bonk is a waste of a secondary slot. The slowing effect caused after taking damage means that unless you can completely avoid damage sources (what the Bonk is supposed to let you run into), you're a sitting duck after it wears off. I would argue that the lack of a pistol or other utility was enough of a downside to warrant using the bonk before the nerf, but now? It's not really worth bothering with. * The Sandman: Used to be a fun weapon to use in pubs, especially with the guillotine, now, this weapon is a joke, doing next to nothing to your opponent, and all at the cost of being able to be practically one-shot by a demo or soldier. * The Wrap Assassin: This is the sandman for players who actually want to do some damage, and yet it's even worse. the melee portion of the weapon is a joke, since -65% damage means you'll be swinging for a long time before you can deal anything leathal, and the bleeding effect from the ornaments lasts only as long as the player can find a way to debuff, which is not long at all. * The Liberty Launcher: Having an identity crisis at the moment, the only thing the Liberty Launcher is good for right now is for soldiers that want to rocket jump, but still have the utility of a banner at their side. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of being a glorified nerf gun, requiring three shots for anything the stock would take two for. * The Cow Mangler 5000: This weapon is actually pretty good. Against anything that isn't a building. You would think that the charge shot of the mangler would be a useful tool in taking out sentry nests, but when used in practice, it's a pathetic weapon. The amount of time a sentry is down is barely worth the ammo it takes to get there, and unless you have a teammate rush in to take it out *for* you, your melee and secondary weapons do significantly more damage to buildings anyways. * The Righteous Bison: Oh where to start with this one. It used to be amazing, then worse than garbage, then just garbage. With all the recent changes, the Bison somehow does less damage than the shotgun, takes longer to hit opponents, holds less ammo, has a smaller hitbox than it used to, and travels so slowly, you practically need a sixth sense to tell where to aim the thing beyond close range combat. Furthermore, the bison also has an unlisted downside of having a slower firing speed than the shotgun. Maybe one day the Bison will be returned to it's former glory, capable of being a proper alternative to the shotgun. * The Mantreads: This is a bizarre item. It seems to imply it's a weapon for resisting knockback effects, but the 3x falling damage and increased air control suggest it's a gunboats alternative for the airstrike or liberty launcher. Either way, the only time I've seen this used decently is with the ""trolldier"" loadout, and even then, it's inclusion is tenuous. * The Equalizer: It used to be powerful back when it was just one weapon, but I suppose a nerf was bound for it eventually. This weapon embodies the ""fight or flight"" response, with the escape plan being much more popular. Sadly, the Equalizer never really finds it's use, since experienced players soon learn it's better to live to fight another day than to fight the respawn timer. * The Dragon's Fury: As much as it pains me to admit, the Dragon's Fury kinda sucks to use now. Any Pyro player picking this weapon up would be comparable to, say, a strictly stickybomb demoman going demoknight. The problem with the weapon is that in ultra-close-range, it becomes much harder to hit an opponent than it is in just close-range. Compare this to the flamethrower which is not only much more reliable, but also does even better the closer you get, making this primary somewhat pointless. * The Manmelter: Literally only used with the Phlog, this flaregun sucks on many levels. For starters, the lack of any kind of damage bonus for hitting burning targets places it a peg below all other flare guns. Stack this with the lack of any sort of particle effect or animation to signify when it's fully reloaded, and the vague smear of a projectile particle effect, and you have one of the more annoying Pyro secondaries. If they had some way of showing the player when it's fully reloaded, and improved the projectile graphic, I think this would be at least passable. * The Gas Passer: Unless you're playing in MVM, this pathetic secondary has almost no use in any game. The gas effect takes so long to get, and does so little, you might as well ignore it. Sure, you do retain gas even if you die, but unless they add some kind of heftier damage bonus on gassed players (such as exploding on ignite), this weapon is best left untouched. * The Thermal Thruster: This one is a personal complaint of mine, so I'm sure many of you reading this probably would object. The Thermal Thruster had so much more potential to be a good mobility tool. When I heard that there was going to be a jetpack-style mobility tool for Pyro in the update, I was expecting so much more than this. The problem with the Thermal Thruster is that it takes no skill to use whatsoever. One button press and you're tossed where you were looking. Nothing like the detonator, or rocket launcher, which can take *years* of practice to learn to use effectively. With such potential wasted **The Thermal Thruster would be more at home in Overwatch than in TF2** * The Sharpened Volcano Fragment: This weapon has never been changed. Personally, I think making the afterburn caused by the Fragment to be inextinguishable would balance it out, but it will probably be another ten years before that happens. * The Grenade Launcher: I got a lot of hate for saying this in the past, but the grenade launcher is a frustrating primary. From it's inconsistent projectile paths, to the disproportionate amount of effort you have to put in to aim it, the grenade launcher is one of the worst primary weapons in the game. Every weapon in TF2 doesn't take as much effort to deal the same amount of damage as the grenade launcher, so it's no wonder that the Iron Bomber is more popular than it. All the Iron Bomber does is remove the parts of the grenade launcher that are irritating to work against, such as the wild (and illogical) spinning pills do when launched, while also making where they land much more predictable, due to the fact that A: they do not bounce or roll much after hitting a wall, and B: the pills are all spherically shaped, preventing the randomness in bouncing caused by asymmetrical pills * The Loch N Load: I used to love using this weapon. The hefty extra damage felt to be a fair offset for having pills that do nothing if you miss. When you compare to the stock grenade launcher, it was also much easier to use, the lack of asymmetrical pills and spin, paired with extra projectile speed also meant a lot of the frustrating parts of the stock were completely gone. Sadly, the changes to the Loch have left it a pretty obvious downgrade. The reduced clip size really is a big downside on a primary weapon, and the fact that the only way it makes up for it is though the projectile speed and extra damage to buildings make using it against players a pointless endeavor. * The Ullapool Caber: This weapon has been nerfed to the moon and back. It used to be a fun meme weapon *and* a good last-resort melee as well, the kind of weapon you'd use when you're at 10hp and know you're cornered. Unfortunately the draw speed and swing speed penalty means that you'll very rarely get to use it aside from as a meme weapon, which is sad, as the weapon had so much potential. * The Dalokohs bar: Aside from *maybe* MVM, the Dalokohs Bar is a useless weapon. Sure, +50hp *sounds* good, but in practice it's literally not worth the time it takes to eat the thing. For starters, it only heals 100hp, which is good if you're rolling the enemy team, and can rely on being safe to gain the extra hp to continue fighting, but that's where the good ends. With such a small amount healed, this lunchbox serves almost no use, save for extinguishing and slightly healing teammates. Any heavy who wants to actually use a lunchbox item will either use the banana or the sandvich, the banana being the more powerful of the two. * The Buffalo Steak Sandvich: This weapon is only good for rollouts. Sure, it's good in medieval, but if you try and use it seriously, you'll end up with maybe one kill before you're dead, if you're lucky. If using this weapon didn't restrict you to melee only, it would be OP, but then again there isn't much that can be done to balance the weapon as is. * The Eviction Notice / Gloves of Running Urgently: Yet another casualty of the TF2 team's balancing for competitive play, both of these weapons are plain horrible to use. The health drain is so severe, you stand little to no chance of living if you enter a battleground wearing them, and even if you use it to just get to the front line you'll have to wait ages for your health to return to normal. I would say these are only meme weapons now, but even as meme weapons they're pathetic. Using the Eviction Notice as a combat weapon is a poor choice (when you could just switch to scout and do at least 10x better), and takes up a precious melee slot, and using either ass a mobility tool leaves you weaker than a scout, meaning that any class that can sneak up on you will almost always get the kill. * The Warrior's Spirit: This weapon was supposed to combo well with the Buffalo Steak Sandvich, but sadly, such a combo is doomed to fail. The **30%** damage vulnerability when active is what kills this weapon... and the fact that it's not that much better than stock. sure, the +30% damage bonus adds an extra 20 damage per swing, it still takes around 2-3 swings to kill an opponent. unless you're pairing it with the BSS, this weapon is only a liability. * The Pomson 6000: I really want to like this weapon, I really do. But sadly this weapon is a downgrade to the stock in many regards. Basically take everything I've said about the Righteous Bison and paste it here. Unlisted stats of less ammo and slower firing speed, yes, but also worse. The Pomson does not penetrate players, only fires a single projectile, as well as having a buggy ammo meter, which isn't divided evenly into four parts. All in all, the Pomson is a very sad primary weapon. * The Short Circuit: Another weapon that is almost kind of not quite just barely passable, but isn't. the original design was essentially an AOE projectile destruction weapon, which was great at denying spam happy sticky demomen, but alas, the new change of firing an energy ball replaced the projectile desctuction mode, and yet, is still kind of bad? As a utility, it only works a few times before you're outta ammo, as a weapon it has a *very* short range, and using the energy ball only irritates your enemies. perhaps if the primary fire shot smaller, faster versions of the energy ball, it would be a cool sidegrade, but as it stands now, it's kind of pointless. * The Vaccinator: The only times I reliably see this weapon used is to counter a cheater, or to annoy enemy snipers by healing friendly ones. This weapon isn't as bad as the others on this list, but it has a few conceptual problems that hold it back. First off, why does one button cycle resistances? Having to press one button multiple times is unintuitive and drags the weapon back more than it should. Personally, I would make shifting resistances be: hold R + pressing 1 2 or 3 to select resistances. This way, medics don't have to fumble around mashing R, potentially skipping or even forgetting which resistance comes up next. Secondly, the bigger issue, is that it's useless in a team fight. When are you ever hit *only* by bullets, explosives, or fire? very rarely. Teams that see a medic popping charges and healing will want to kill that doctor and his healing target fast, so using it in a team will draw more fire to you. Secondly, if you *do* use it to heal single targets in 1v2 scenarios, you would win anyways with any other medigun! Simply being healed practically guarantees your victory against a singular opponent, so having a medigun that protects you from *only* one source of damage at a time is a bad idea. * The Vita-Saw: Oh boy, more comp rebalances! Oh wait, the weapon was kinda poor to begin with and now is even worse? Yup, the vita saw was a bad weapon and with the rebalancing is even worse. The problem with the vita-saw is it's design: retain uber on death. Anything that does this is a super powerful tool in comp, but ""eh"" in casual. The conceptual issue is that it forces your medic to ask the question ""will my team protect me?"" and how the weapon responds to that question is why it's so jarring between the two modes. In comp, your team will always try to protect you, so anything that is designed around your team *not* doing that, is typically overpowered. In casual, your team couldn't give less of a crap if you're alive or dead, so a weapon that counts on your team not protecting you is just okay. * The Cleaner's Carbine: It's just a worse version of the SMG. While the mini crit meter is interesting, and useful if you're cornered, the damage dealt barely makes up for the slower firing speed and smaller clip size. * The Shahanshah: A sort of equalizer for sniper, this weapon only finds use when you're at 62hp or below. At this health, you're essentially dead, dealing only 81 damage per swing. If the health requirement was upped to 75%, perhaps this weapon would be okay, but as it stands, you're better off hoping for a random crit with stock. * The Red-Tape Recorder: This weapon is by far the worst sapper! The way it works means that your sapper will take significantly longer, and do significantly less. The only use case for this weapon is on mini sentries, and even then, it's probably better to just use stock anyways."
127,vulnerability,tf2,Heavy Balance Ideas (Be prepared for a wall of text),3,8eyv15,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8eyv15/heavy_balance_ideas_be_prepared_for_a_wall_of_text/,2018-04-26 11:18:49,"Hello! I am very new to Reddit and relatively new to TF2 (only have about 1000 hours, what a casual amirite?). However, I love TF2 and I enjoy balancing games. So I figured why not head over to r/TF2 where I can post my balancing ideas for feedback from a large group of TF2 players from all walks! I would like to say I have never played comp (neither the community's or Valve's), but I do have a general overview of how comp works and general class roles and balancing. However, I'm also aware watching FUNKe doesn't really count as being a comp player, so I'll be blunt: this is mostly from a pubber's perspective, but one who is interested in and learning about comp. So if any comp players wanna tell me why this would literally kill the 6s meta or what have you, please do! Quick warning: This is gonna be a massive wall of text talking about each balance idea and explaining them in detail. If you're not interested in reading a shit ton, I'll put all my proposed balance changes in a nice little ""tl;dr"" box at the end of each paragraph discussing each weapon. Finally, please remember these are all hypothetical and could be changed if I had the means and/or the knowhow to do so (speaking of which, if anyone could help me test these changes I'd love it). Alright, that aside, let's delve into balancing my personal main, Heavy! *General Balance Changes* Heavy is supposed to be a wall of damage absorption, taking hits and dishing out twice as much in return. However, Heavy (especially on his own) never quite felt like that. His large size and slow movement (only made even worse by the waddling speed which is a spun-up Heavy) make him incredibly susceptible to spam. This makes it very hard for Heavy to function without a medic and hurts his general viability. Why bother with a Heavy on defense if a Demo can do defense faster and still take a decent amount of damage before dying? As such, I propose two balance changes to beef up Heavy's bulk: 1) Heavy will now gain a blanket 10% resistance to all non-critical damage while spun up. 2) Heavy will have extra knockback resistance while spun up (I'd give an exact number, but numbers are hard to find on knockback statistics. If anyone has any info please let me know!) The idea is to buff Heavy in a slight way so as to make him slightly less susceptible to spam and Mouse2 happy Pyros. 10% doesn't sound like much, but it allows heavy to take 3 direct pipes and 4 direct rockets (assuming rockets deal the base damage of 90 each hit)! However, there's a catch: critical damage pierces the resistance. This means Snipers will still one-shot an overhealed heavy (preserving Sniper's ability to hard-counter Heavy) and a Kritzkreig charge will still tear right through you. It's a minor buff to hopefully make a waddling Heavy more of a wall and less than a sitting duck. The 10% resistance will be overridden by any other effect that applies resistance, like the FoS, the Vaccinator's Charge, and therefore will not stack with any other resistance. Next up is Heavy's speed. He's a little too slow in my opinion - when he's holding his Shotgun or his Fists. An increase in Heavy's move speed from 77% to 82% will have Heavy walking slightly faster than the Soldier. However, there's a couple catches: The Heavy is slowed by 5% while holding out his minigun (back down to 77% move), the minigun deploys and holsters 50% slower (from .5 to .75 seconds), and Lunchbox items and the FoS will give the user a 5% movement speed penalty as well. This is to encourage the use of the shotgun as well as give Heavy a slightly faster rollout. The speed boost obtained from other weapons like the GRU, the Disciplinary Action, etc., will be nerfed so that Heavy's rollouts as a whole are not buffed (E.g. the GRU will still only increase Heavy's movement speed to 99%). To summarize, the proposed balance changes are: 1) Increase Heavy's base movement speed from 77% to 82% 2) Apply a -5% movement speed while active penalty to the minigun, all Lunchbox items, and the FoS 3) Apply a +50% deploy/holster time penalty to the minigun *Unlockable Primary Balance Changes* The Natascha is in a pretty good place in my opinion, if somewhat boring and mediocre compared to alternatives. I believe it should be reworked after Heavy and his more terrible weapons are buffed and/or reworked if at all. Let's be honest - the Brass Beast is Brass Wank. I get what it's going for, though: compound Heavy's weaknesses and strengths to make him an insanely tough wall with terrible movement. The only problem is the slow half got really beefed up while the strong half got a pitiful resistance and damage bonus. I believe the spin up penalty should be reduced to a 35% penalty, or roughly a 1.17 second spin up time. It's still a decent amount of time, but it's much more forgiving than the 50% penalty that's currently applied to the weapon. Next, the resistance applied will be buffed to give Heavy a 20% damage resistance whenever Heavy is not overhealed rather than when Heavy is below 50% health. This extra resistance balances out with the fact that the Brass Beast will retain its incredible 60% move speed penalty. The idea is that Heavy moving so slowly will make him even more susceptible than usual to focus fire and Snipers, so his tankiness is beefed accordingly to make him a big slow target that can take a few hits. Finally, Heavy's base movement speed will be 5% slower when the Brass Beast is equipped. In other words, Heavy loses his movement speed buff which I proposed in the general changes section (and retains the -5% move speed while active from the general changes), because the Brass Beast is supposed to be Heavy to the max: a huge, tough, but slow wall able to soak up damage and dish it out tenfold. Proposed Brass Beast stats are as follows: +20% damage bonus +20% damage resistance when spun up and not overhealed +35% longer spin up time -60% less move speed while spun up -5% less move speed overall The Tomislav is arguably better than stock, and easily Heavy's most popular unlock. Same deal as Natascha, no balance/rework for now if at all. The Huo-Long Heater is arguably the worst minigun for Heavy, with no real redeeming features. Its fire ring is basically useless and its gimmick is so situational the Huo-Long ends up being a direct downgrade to stock in pretty much every way. Since its damage gimmick is super situational, I think it should be removed. Instead, its ability to cause afterburn should be focused on. This is essentially going to be a total rework, but with the focus still being kept on fire so as to not abandon entirely what the weapon is now. The firing speed of the fire ring will be given a boosted fire rate to firing out once every .1 seconds, the same fire rate as the minigun itself (the current fire rate of the ring is .5 seconds) and its damage will be halved from 12 damage to 6 damage per fire ring. This will hopefully make it a more effective Spy deterrant. The damage penalty will be increased to 20%, and the damage bonus vs burning players will be removed and replaced by a new stat: bullets apply afterburn for 8 seconds. The idea is that sometimes enemies disappear around corners before Heavy can finish them off, leaving them with minimal health but still alive and easily able to outrun the slow Heavy. The Huo-Long trades in some DPS for the ability to finish off enemies who escape before being totally killed. The Huo-Long still boasts and impressive 400 DPS and can be used to ignite pesky Snipers and check for Spies, making it a good choice for the supportive Heavy. Proposed Huo-Long Heater stats are as follows: Creates ring of flames while spun up Bullets ignite players for 8 seconds -20% damage penalty Consumes an additional 4 ammo per second while spun up *Unlockable Secondary Changes* All the lunchbox items receive a -5% movement speed while active penalty, as mentioned in the general changes. Besides that, they're all pretty well balanced with the exception of the Buffalo Steak Sandvich, which will be covered soon. The Panic Attack is multi-class and in an alright place after its rework and therefore won't be covered here. The Family Business is an alright sidegrade to the stock shotgun, if somewhat boring. Same as Natascha, save the reworks for later. The Buffalo Steak Sandvich is terrible, but is a fun idea in concept. Simply removing the increased damage penalty would probably make it a fun weapon in pubs, and considering it restricts you to melee for 15 seconds, it's not super viable for rollouts and therefore is unlikely to be abused as such. It's unlikely the Steak will ever be viable in a competitive sense unless it's completely reworked, so making it a fun pub weapon seems just fine. *Unlockable Melee Changes* The KGB are a fun pub weapon and are likely to remain that way without a major rework. Same as the Steak, just a silly pub weapon for fragging Gibus Engies. The GRU and the Eviction notice are... touchy subjects after Jungle Inferno nerfed them into the Ground. While I do agree they needed to be nerfed, I'm unsure of how to buff them again and if they would be better off just being reworked entirely. One change I would like to propose is to have the GRU only lower your health to 150 and the Eviction Notice only lower your health to 200. It might be enough to balance them and make them viable enough until a better solution is found, or it could end up being the good solution. Either way, a buff is a buff and they both need one badly. The FoS, as mentioned in the general changes, will have a -5% move speed penalty applied. Besides that, the FoS are in a pretty good place and work well for getaways and damage surfing. It might do to reduce the heal rate penalty from 40% to 20% or something, but like the Natascha, it's probably best to leave it alone until the rest of Heavy is in better shape. The Warrior's Spirit is just bad. However, I do see some potential as a Zatoichi for Heavy! Give the Warrior's Spirit a holster penalty of 75 health if no kills are made, and cause it to heal heavy 2/3 of his max health on kill, and suddenly... it's still kinda useless, but interesting and fun for general pub play. Also, get rid of that damage bonus and vulnerability. Neither are useful or necessary. Proposed Warrior's Spirit stats are as follows: On Kill: Regain 2/3 of your max health Warrior's Code: Lose 75 health if you holster this weapon without killing another warrior Well, that's every Heavy weapon reviewed and rebalanced. I'd love to hear your thoughts on my balance ideas, as well as your own ideas for balancing Heavy, so please give your feedback in the comments. I hope you enjoyed this massive wall of text."
128,vulnerability,tf2,Hypothetical Engineer Rework,8,8fmak1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8fmak1/hypothetical_engineer_rework/,2018-04-29 05:52:45,"I've heard a lot of scattered thoughts about how to rework engineer in the past, but never as a collected update, so I thought I would combine these ideas into a hypothetical update! Engineer update: 2.0 The way buildings and wrenches work has been redesigned: * Wrenches have been separated from their blueprints * Added: PDA section of loadout. The PDA holds up to three blueprint types, Sentry, Support, and Transport. Sentry contains the blueprint(s) for your sentry gun, Support holds the blueprint(s) for your dispenser/support buildings, and Transport holds the blueprint(s) for your transport building(s). * Changed: The Gunslinger has been separated from its blueprint New stats: Gunslinger. The Gunslinger arm now has +100% rebuild speed after placing a hauled building. +10% movement speed when hauling. -No random crits. -After placing a hauled building, marked for death for 4 seconds. Third punch in a row always crits. (Stat amounts would be tweaked to be balanced) * Added: Mini sentry blueprint Stats: +25 max health on user. +100% build speed. -Is a mini sentry, dealing less damage with less hp. * Changed: The Southern Hospitality New stats: +On hit: Bleed for 5 seconds. +Crits on hitting a bleeding target. -No random crits. -20% fire damage vulnerability -10% damage. (Stat amounts would be tweaked to be balanced) * Changed: The Pomson 6000 New Stats: +Does not require ammo. +Projectile cannot be deflected. Projectile moves +75% faster. Projectile starts out small, then spreads out evenly with range. At a set distance, the damage drops to 0 and the particle effect dissipates. Effects, and damage dealt is reduced the more spread-out the shot is when hit. On hit: Victim loses a base 15% cloak (losing 0% at max range). On hit: healing done on victim reduced by a base 20% (reduced to 0% at max range). (Stat amounts would be tweaked to be balanced) (The design intent for the weapon is to turn the Pomson into a reliable spychecking tool, as well as mild to moderate crowd control weapon. Overall damage is less than the shotgun when firing at point blank range) * Changed: The Short Circuit New Stats: Secondary fire emits a large, slow moving ball of energy that deletes enemy projectiles costing 65 metal. -No random critical hits. Primary fire shoots a very small, fast moving ball of energy that deletes enemy projectiles at the cost of 5 metal. Enemy sentries hit by the secondary fire are disabled for 3 seconds. Mini-sentries hit by the secondary fire are disabled for 5 seconds, and 3 seconds if hit by the primary fire. -Uses metal for ammo (Stats amounts tweaked to be balanced) (the point of this change is to make the short circuit a weapon as well as a tool. Since the secondary fire can be fun to use, a smaller, faster version would make the primary fire more useful as a weapon, or if used by a skilled player, a cheaper way to delete projectiles.) (After this point, ideas for different building types and other additions are suggested, likely not completely balanced) * Added support blueprint: Supply Depot Supply Depot stats: Constructs a tower with a support gun on the top. Gun automatically targets friendly teammates and fires supply kits at them. Supply kits have a weak homing ability, leave a tracer trail, provide the equivalent of a medium health+ammo kit at point blank (potency of the kit reduces with distance travelled), and auto target the teammate with the lowest combination health/ammo in sight. The Station has significantly increased range over the dispenser. The station has much less health than a dispenser. Downsides: The station cannot send any more supply kits at one time than allotted for it's level (Level 1: 2 kits. Level 2: 5 kits. Level 3: 6 kits). The Kits travel slowly, and if airblasted by a pyro, will heal the enemy team. *Added sentry blueprint: The Texas Heat The Texas Heat Stats: Sentry shoots incendiary bullets. At level 3: Sentry shoots large fireballs in place of rockets. Fireballs crit burning players. +35% fire resistance on user. +10% faster tracking speed. -25% damage. -Damage deals -50% knockback force. (Appearance of the sentry is similar to the stock sentry. ""Hot rod"" flames are emblazoned on metal plates covering part of the dual machine guns. Bullet impact displays a brief flame particle.) * Added transport blueprint: The Buffer The Buffer stats: A building that provides nearby teammates with a mobility buff, +20% movement speed, +20% jump height for 12 seconds. -Only one building -Cannot be upgraded * Added wrench: The Calipers The Calipers stats: Hitting buildings increases their effectiveness for two seconds. -15% damage. -33% damage penalty vs buildings -No random crits. -25% damage vulnerability for 3 seconds after swinging. * Added destroy PDA: The Detonator The Detonator stats: On destroying a building: causes a large explosion, with damage and radius proportional to building health and upgrade level. +25% explosive damage vulnerability * Added sapper: The Saboteur's Sachet The Saboteur's Sachet stats: +2 second delay before notifying engineer of sapper. -Sapper deals no building damage +After 7 seconds, the sapper detonates, destroying the building and damaging all opponents in range.

129,vulnerability,tf2,Reworking Old Weapons...,6,8frau1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8frau1/reworking_old_weapons/,2018-04-29 23:22:31,"So I think a few things need discussing &amp; quite frankly need looking over when it comes to their stats &amp; functions. I'll have ""suggestions"" on how these things could work in future but keep in mind, I'm not a gaming expert &amp; am a flawed human being. However, I am also a fan of this game &amp; wish to see some creative ideas come to bloom, which means I strive to see it grow to the best it can be &amp; with the most variety in gameplay. That said, here's my list. ===== Scout ===== The Shortstop needs a rework. It's been reworked once already and as is, a shove COULD be a good idea for scout but the fact of the matter is, no scout EVER wants to get that close except for using Bonk. You will always die before this shove is pulled off. If it was more damage behind the target, I could see a flanking type deal, but even then, THAT is covered by Back Scatter. Speaking of which. The Back Scatter needs to be buffed. This needs to give a 25&amp;#37; resistance to bullets while equipped. You just get too screwed over whenever you use this. In order to compete with other shotguns, we need bullet resistance. You can still counter with fire &amp; explosives but bullet resistance won't affect much, considering explosives always counter Scouts. The Wrap Assassin needs a rework. Quite frankly, NO ONE uses it. Honestly, I don't have any suggestions for this one. Could anyone suggest something for this? ======== Soldier ======== The Liberty Launcher needs a rework. No one bothers to use it because the Air Strike makes jumping more fun &amp; creative whereas Liberty Launcher is basically a Direct Hit with Air Strike. To make it do something that Soldiers can do already but better, I suggest 20&amp;#37; fire vulnerability when equipped but if 2 targets are hit by 1 rocket, you get 10&amp;#37; bullet resistance for the same duration of the buff banner/battalions/concheror, stacking up to 3 times. The Righteous Bison needs a rework. I think encouraging it firing into crowds with characters behind them could be creative, considering you're going to fire into crowds anyway as a Soldier. Righteous Bison shots could do subsequently more damage per enemy it passes through by 5&amp;#37; per enemy. It could also have the ""Cannot be reflected"" removed to compensate. The Equalizer needs a rework. No one uses it because the escape plan &amp; rocket jumping are just flat out better &amp; more thematic to the soldier. People want to have fun when they get kills. Market Gardener even It's been reworked once already &amp; as is, a shove COULD be a good idea for scout but er melee pickaxe, quite frankly, if you want people to not get confused about the original escape plan anymore. What should I do? Again, I don't heckin' hootin' know. Something to suit Bombardment Soldier? \(Air Strike, Parachute, etc\) Although Bombardment Soldier essentially has the Market Jumper and... basically ANY other melee goes well that isn't the pain train. Direct Hit Soldier? Maybe something can happen. Maybe with a NEW set that compliments the Soldier. ==== Pyro ==== Phlogistinator needs a rework. It's a dull idea for a dull weapon. Airblast is part of being a pyro. Weapons that take away Medic \+ Soldier \(Which can outcrit you or outlive you with uber, not to mention with raw health. Sure you can reflect but then what's the point of The Third Degree if any &amp; all Flamethrowers that arent the Phlog can do it better from a distance that is easier to dodge?\) They fixed the baby face's blaster to make it only reduce the boost on air jumps instead of flat out removal, so do the same here. Make it cost more. Detonator needs a rework or a buff. Not only is it conceptually boring but it is also pitiful damage even when you land the detonation. This needs buffing or a different idea entirely. The Dragon's Fury needs a buff. It needs a reduction to 1.5s for airblast not 1.6s. It's TOO LONG! If you airblast once with this in case of an emergency, you are straight fucked two ways from Sunday. MORE than Backburner. I know that's the point but the punishment is unnecessarily crippling for the crime. We need a different punishment in my opinion. Maybe you make it that it can extinguish teammates but not reflect? What about the other way around? The Neon Annihilator needs a rework. The Neon Annihilator seems like it's way more useful than the Homewrecker and removes its purpose completely. I think this should be reworked to something else. Either that or the Homewrecker needs to be buffed or reworked. The Third Degree needs a rework. It just doesn't have enough utility to make it useful. I like the idea but no pyro should be that close to a medic \+ pocketed mercenary combo. It's always going to be: Medic \+ Soldier \(Which can outcrit you or outlive you with uber, not to mention with raw health. Sure you can reflect but then what's the point of The Third Degree if any and all Flamethrowers that arent the Phlog can do it better from a distance that is easier to dodge?\) Medic \+ Pyro \(Airblasted away or burned to death, you can't approach them quick enough. You're done.\) Medic \+ Engineer \(Repairing his buildings, being healed by his dispenser &amp; so is the medic, they could defend each other &amp; have the Sentry to assist. The level 3 Sentry's knockback is devastating &amp; will keep you out of their way. YOU would need a medic. Gunslinger? He ain't gonna be around a medic. He's gonna be out there on his own. Third Degree is useless.\) Medic \+ Heavy \(Maybe if he isn't looking at you, MAYBE you could get 1 or 2 hits off but it won't kill either of them. Heavy could sandvich his bud and Heavy's health pool especially with overheal completely outlives The Third Degree, nullifying the point of going up close to something as brutal as the Heavy.\) Medic \+ Engineer \(Repairing his buildings, being healed by his dispenser &amp; so is the medic, they could defend each other &amp; have the Sentry to assist. The level 3 Sentry's knockback is devastating &amp; will keep you out of their way. YOU would need a medic. Gunslinger? He ain't gonna be around a medic. He's gonna be out there on his own. Third Degree is useless.\) Medic \+ Medic \(I wonder if the Third Degree does double damage or infinite damage if they link to each other? Let me know in the comments.\) Medic \+ Sniper \(Camping, taking potshots at the enemy team so the enemy sniper doesn't kill your best guy. His SMG will counter your Third Degree.\) So that leaves Scout &amp; Spy. Who SERIOUSLY \(if not with a friend, having fun\) would uber a scout or heal a scout for a specific purpose that isn't to catch up to your teammates then immediate attention is gone to the next ally? Especially with Quick Fix. Who SERIOUSLY \(if not with a friend, having fun or even just bored with randoms not trying\) would uber a Spy? He could use a bit of overheal, sure but he aint going to have a medic by him or his cover is done. Third Degree completely nullified.\) Not to mention another thing: Soldier can go just fine around the map on his own. Pyros are just fine on their own. Demomen are just fine on their own. Heavies are just fine on their own, even more so with a medic. Engineers are just fine on their own. They have their own Dispenser heals. Medics aren't fine on their own, so it COULD work but then again, they're bound to be paired with one of the others &amp; not with each other unless they're friends or not taking the game seriously. Snipers are fine on their own. Tribalman's &amp;/or Razorback to reveal spies &amp; Danger Shield to counter Pyros? Who needs a medic when they got the Cozy Camper? So I think The Third Degree could use a little more like: People linked via dispensers also get affected the same way. Deals 25&amp;#37; less damage to buildings. ==== Demo ==== I honestly think Demo is fine at the moment, very versatile &amp; a lot of options so I'm gonna skip him. Feel free to list your own thoughts. ===== Heavy ===== Fists of Steel needs a rework. I think I have an idea that could change its functionality &amp; could make it more fitting for what it is. Middle Click while equipping Fists of Steel smashes your fists together, sending armor pieces from the fists in all directions, causing nearby enemies to bleed for a short duration. To recharge, you gotta absorb damage above 50&amp;#37; health. Having a medic, a sandvich, a dalokoh's or a banana on hand is a good way to do this. While fully charged, you'd have the ranged damage reduction but the melee damage vulnerability. I honestly think it would work better or be more unique that way &amp; have more circumstances to be used in. The Eviction Notice needs a rework. I honestly think starting this with slightly slower than normal punching speed but getting subsequent punches that hit on the enemy increases the attack speed slightly every punch all the way up to the 40&amp;#37; faster firing punch speed with the \-60&amp;#37; damage penalty. The maximum health drained bit is a little much, in my opinion. You still have enough to counter them. Airblast or knockback &amp; you're history. ======== Engineer ======== Southern Hospitality needs a buff. I seriously think that the increase in fire vulnerability should be 15&amp;#37; or 10&amp;#37; &amp; that could help it being utilized more. ===== Medic ===== The Vaccinator needs a rework. It's a neat idea but the normal medigun completely trumps it in every way &amp; does its job better. Ubercharge completely trumps multiple types of damage at the same time. Although you do get Vaccinator uber in 4 chunks, it still feels pretty weak, quite frankly. Now if we think about it in depth, Damage enhancement is covered with Kritzkrieg, Health is covered with Medi Gun, what else? Well, one thing we could try with it is to do a similar healing rate with Kritzkrieg, have it in one &amp; not 4 chunks like it does now but have the ubercharge increase 1 of 2 possibilities: 1. Melee attack speed for those desperate situations. In which case the downside could be 75 max overheal. 2. Weapon firing speed but a slight damage reduction to stop it being too broken. In which case another downside could be 50&amp;#37; movement speed while ubercharge is deployed. This could employ some quick planning &amp; encourage some teamwork to escape. Perhaps running to an ally engi or an ally pyro to airblast the enemies away. To have it from being too overpowered, a third potential option for a downside could be that damage done on recently ubercharged ally is increased by 75&amp;#37;. I don't know. Just spitballing. Let me know how you guys would challenge this concept &amp;/or balance it to make sense toward a particular purpose/theme for Medic. Is the Vaccinator more useful for a specific circumstance that the Medigun does not cover? Let me know in the comments! ====== Sniper ====== Hitman's Heatmaker needs a rework. The unscoping sounds like a good thing in theory but the problem being that it's also a downside in dealing with spies shooting at you. In order to keep with the theme, I suggest 15&amp;#37; bullet resistance while in focus instead so it encourages use of your secondary more &amp; can have a bit more punishment to missing. The Bazaar Bargain needs a rework. It encourages a killing spree but the downsides completely throws repetitive use of the weapon out the window. The idea is okay\-ish so I suggest snipping the penalty in half &amp; decreasing the charge rate if a body shot by 25&amp;#37; instead. That way, the idea is still there but the punishment still fits the weapon's idea. The Classic needs a rework. I honestly think it needs lowering incrementally per body shot up to 50&amp;#37; so 5 body shots could be the maximum punishment considering it's hard to hit a spy to begin with &amp; it still encourages getting a headshot but not as crippling all the time as 10&amp;#37; damage on body shot flat out. If not that, I suggest merging with The Cozy Camper, considering they encourage concentration on headshots, plus it encourages you to not miss with the Classic. To be honest, I see the different way it is used but I don't see WHY it is used. Honestly, the normal Sniper just does better in my opinion. How does this do better than the original Sniper Rifle? Let me know what use it is for in the comments! Cleaner's Carbine needs a rework. I think that the firing speed needs to be replaced with 25&amp;#37; less accurate instead. A lot of games consider when applying a silencer that the accuracy drops. I think this would fit the idea of the Cleaner's Carbine. The idea of Cleaner's Carbine is to counter something close up so I think it being less accurate won't break it really in terms of its concept. The firing rate currently feels way too weak &amp; that you have to potshot it from far away. The Sniper Rifle completely covers that, though. === Spy === L'Etranger needs a small buff. I think the 20&amp;#37; damage penalty could be tweaked to 15&amp;#37; &amp; that could make it slightly more beneficial. I don't know. Maybe 10&amp;#37;? I don't know. What do you guys think? Let me know your thoughts in the comments below! Enforcer needs a small buff. Like my L'Etranger suggestion, I think one thing could be tweaked to make it better. Perhaps making it that consecutive hits on the same target without missing increases the firing speed by 10&amp;#37; stacking up to 3 times? I'm not sure. Maybe tweak the 20&amp;#37; slower speed to 15&amp;#37; instead? What are your thoughts? Let me know in the comments! Diamondback needs a rework. I think the 15&amp;#37; damage penalty should be tweaked to 10&amp;#37; &amp; 10&amp;#37; firing speed should be added instead, but deal mini crits to someone if you shoot them in the back. I think that's something that the Spy does anyway so why not make a weapon have him do something he does already, but better? Let me know your thoughts. Big Earner needs a rework. Like a few I've suggested already, I think it could benefit from the health being \-10 max health on wearer instead of \-25. I also think that there should be a 10&amp;#37; explosive vulnerability on the wearer when equipped. He can then be countered by explosives &amp; be punished for screwing up. Do I have the wrong idea? What would you do? For which type of Spy? Let me know your thoughts. ======== Again, these are all ""I think"" &amp; ""My opinion"". What's your opinion? What would you rework &amp; how? Leave them below! Thanks for reading!"

But I can't aim with it. So, I don't wanna use it and it really helpful in compititive but don't really play it much. Atomizer grants triple jump when its deployed and has lower damage output and 50% slower deploy time. Idk is it good or bad but in melee fight with other scouts, sniper or spies I gonna loose with it. Stock is any good? I am using candy cane from a long time. But now I noticed that the health pack which drops after killing an enemy is most of the time benefiting other enemies who were close to that dead one. And that 25% explosive vulnerability is too much. So I decided to change my melee of scout. So which one should I use? I am in a dilemma."

Well good news! I got ideas for them too. If you liked the train of thought I was on but you were afraid of having your favourite weapons broken, have no fear. That's what this thread is for. Here are some of my ideas. NOTE: A lot of these weapons are inspired. I do not claim ownership of most of these ideas. A lot of these ideas are inspired from: Rise of the Triad \(implementing more creativity\). Halo \(different styles of similar weapons for different gameplay\). Time Splitters 2 \(Again, more variant styles of familiar weapons to vary the gameplay\). Red Faction Guerrilla \(Inspiring a different way to play Heavy since he is a Heavy Weapons Guy\). Counter Strike: Source \(Inspiration of the Deagle\-like idea\). Team Fortress 2 \(Some of these are a way to implement the same type of art style\). NOTE 2: Some of the brackets will elongate a contracted name of the weapon. The rest of the brackets usually state which slot they replace. Primary, Secondary or Melee. ===== Scout ===== 8\-Gauge Scattershot \(Tactical Gauge Shotgun\) \(Primary\) You start with 8 shots.

No random critical hits. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Volcano Propeller \(Secondary\) You fire a flare like normal but where the projectile lands, it creates a small lava pool, setting fire to any enemies who spawn in it and dealing constant fire damage for 3 seconds. Downsides being it has to be in the air for at least 0.5 seconds before it can activate a lava pool. Hitting enemies with the projectile itself does 20&amp;#37; less damage and no afterburn. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Inferno Shooter \(Incendiary Shotgun\) \(Secondary\) Fires Inferno Breath Rounds, dealing damage and set the enemies on fire for a short amount of time. \+15&amp;#37; Firing Speed. \+10&amp;#37; Spread. \-15&amp;#37; Damage. \-15&amp;#37; Reload Speed. \-50&amp;#37; Afterburn Duration. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Firestarter \(Blacksmithing Hammer\) \(Melee\) 1 hit marks the target for Fire\-setting. 2 hits on the same target expands their form, slowing them by 15&amp;#37; but setting the target on fire. 3 hits on the same target causes them to explode, dealing explosive damage to the target and causes their allies in close proximity to get knocked slightly upwards. Any teammates can decrease the hits by 1 if they hit the same target as well. \-20&amp;#37; Damage. No random critical hits. Cannot use kritzkrieg on a target wielding this weapon. Unfinished Fire\-settings after death or after 8 seconds will reset. ======= Demoman ======= Lobbing Glen Valleymaker \(Primary\) Middle Click to switch between Alt Modes, 1 being an arc close to you, 2 being an arc 5 yards away from that and the furthest \(being 3\) being 5 yards further. The farther away the shot. the less accurate it becomes. \+15&amp;#37; Reload Speed. \-85&amp;#37; Clip Size. Must reload after 1 shot. At Alt Mode 1, 100&amp;#37; accuracy. At Alt Mode 2, \-15&amp;#37; accuracy. \-15&amp;#37; less movement speed.

Charge the shot to bury it deeper within the surface. Middle Click to set a time between 5\-30 seconds. Right Click to prematurely detonate, dealing 75&amp;#37; explosive damage instead and 75&amp;#37; less knockback. The mines emit a vibrating sound if you listen closely. Enemy Explosives set off the mines and deal the same amount of damage as if you detonated them yourself. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Proximity Mine Launcher \(Secondary\) Shoot proximity mines that hide themselves from enemy view. If enemies step on it, it explodes dealing damage to them and anyone else surrounding them, knocking them back. You can't detonate it manually. Enemy explosives will blow up the mines. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Slurring Scotsman's Juice \(Melee\) Bottle Taunt: Extends your stickybomb maximum by \+4 for 15 seconds.

No shattering occurs. If 2/3, \-15&amp;#37; Melee Damage and \-20&amp;#37; Firing Speed but on hit, causes a small knockback to the afflicted enemy. No shattering occurs. If 1/3, \-10&amp;#37; Fire Vulnerability but on first Hit, causes the bottle to shatter, making them 10&amp;#37; vulnerable to fire \(removing your vulnerability\) and dealing \+5&amp;#37; melee damage and bleed. When shattered, deals bleed damage on hit. Does not stack. If 0/3, \-15&amp;#37; Fire Vulnerability but on first Hit, causes the bottle to shatter, dealing \+5&amp;#37; melee damage and bleed. When shattered, affects the target with a bleed. Does not stack with itself. Bottle Taunt: Drink 1/3rd of spirits. Taunt executes 10&amp;#37; slower. Doesn't recharge on its own. ===== Heavy ===== The Baby Manschredder \(Gatling Gun\) \(Primary\) Instead of winding up, you can shoot it earlier but the fire rate is slower until it increases per second up to 5 seconds. During that time, your accuracy is 50&amp;#37; lower at 1st second but 50&amp;#37; better at 5th second. You cannot move while this is deployed but you have more control of your shooting when at 3 seconds and upwards from there. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Gauss.

You have 500 power. You deplete 10 Power per shot. Rev up time is what's used to fire the shot and half of that timer to be able to shoot it again. Your shots are in an arc in front of you. \-10&amp;#37; Movement Speed on nearby affected enemies. \+25&amp;#37; Damage. \-25&amp;#37; Range. You short circuit nearby enemy buildings for 3 seconds, stopping them working. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Selfish Chicken Dingwing \(Secondary\) Eat a chicken wing.

Left Click allows you to push your dispenser into overdrive, dispensing 25&amp;#37; more resources than normal in an aoe radius around the dispenser \(if there's no room, it will produce it and put it wherever it can, near the sentry. Only allows this exertion if you have enough in your dispenser. After triggering it, you have 5 seconds to wait for the dispenser to return to a normal rate. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Roborex Minibot Controller \(Melee\) \(Replaces Sentry\) Replacing the Sentry, you construct a small helicopter\-like platform with a Robotic T\-Rex on top of it named ""Roborex"".

Control tne Roborex with WASD. \- Fire to swipe with the left claw and deal 50&amp;#37; melee damage of the normal wrench to enemies. \- Right Click to swipe with the right claw with a slight step forward before the swing, dealing 75&amp;#37; melee damage of the normal wrench to enemies. \- Middle Click while in Roborex Vision to exit out of it and return to your Engineer. Your Roborex will turn around and return to its deployment pad. The closer the Roborex is to the deployment pad, the sooner it can be deployed again. \-50&amp;#37; melee damage to enemies upon melee swing of the controller itself. If the platform is destroyed, so is the Roborex. \-25&amp;#37; Controller Attack Speed. \-15&amp;#37; Controller Damage. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Double Sided Spanner \(Melee\) You repair a building in front of you and behind you, showing you an indicator of the building behind you on your hud in a speech bubble like the Medic! callout.

Alt Fire: Sends a small monkey to the nearest ally building to repair it at 25&amp;#37; of the normal engineer repair rate. Once the desired building at the crosshair has finished repairing, the monkey then manually walks back the way he came to the engineer. The Monkey: \- is AI controlled. \- cooldown is the same as the Sandman. \- has 25&amp;#37; engineer movement speed. \- sits on the engineer's shoulder. \- can be killed while on the engineer's shoulder or off to repair a building. \- has 75&amp;#37; health. \- can be headshot like a player. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Surreptitious Surveillance VR Stick \(Melee\) \(Replaces Teleporters\) Description: The latest in spy tech gadgetry, this retro joystick and headset allows you to change your point of view to the cameras you've set up. Keep an eye on those spies before they keep an eye on you. The radius of the camera's view is the same as a sentry. Right Click: Allows you to monitor your cameras. Camera 1 first \(entrance replacement\) then Camera 2 \(exit replacement\). Has a red dot emitting on the front of the camera that is visible to enemies and allies. Two beeps emit from the camera if an enemy is in the camera's range. The engineer will be alerted on his hud with a green eye with a number next to it, showing how many are in its sights. While monitoring, your other buildings have a 15&amp;#37; efficiency drain. Dispenser dispenses 15&amp;#37; slower while in Monitoring Mode. Attack speed of your Sentry fires 15&amp;#37; slower while in Monitoring Mode. 0.5 Seconds to go into Monitoring Mode. 0.5 Seconds to go out of Monitoring Mode and being able to move again. When in Monitoring Mode, press left click to go to Camera 2, then again to exit. When in Monitoring Mode, press right click to go to Camera 1 if on Camera 2. When in Monitoring Mode, press middle click to turn the camera selected off to not show the red dot to enemies to make it less obvious. The highest a Camera can be built is the highest an engineer can jump. \-25&amp;#37; Wrench Damage. \-25&amp;#37; Wrench Attack Speed. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- M.C.C \(Mumbling Constructor's Controller\) \(PDA 1\) This is themed towards the way the Pyro deals with his enemies. Burning. Slowly. The Sentry is replaced with an Auto\-Torcher \(Turret\). It turns 10&amp;#37; slower than a normal turret and shoots 15&amp;#37; slower than a normal Sentry. This is because afterburn is a factor here. The Dispenser is replaced with a Thermal Generator. This heals other engineer buildings but at the same rate as dispensing ammo/metal. The teleporters are replaced with 2 6 foot rectangular shields that reflects 3 hits from projectiles, reflecting them directly back to where they came from. Once the shields are down, they require a timer that is 1.5x the time it takes to dispense ammo from a dispenser. If an enemy is nearby, the closest building will vent a small amount of fire for 1 second in one direction then vent air to slightly push them away for 1 second. \+20&amp;#37; additional metal needed for your buildings' construction. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- E.M.P.R. \- \(Electro\-Magnetic Pressurized Remote\) \(PDA 1\) this encourages a slightly more aggressive style of play. Sentry is replaced with the Tesla Coil. This requires no turning but attack rate is 10&amp;#37; slower. The electric shocks deal 10&amp;#37; more damage than the regular. The upside is you can't tell what way it ""faces"" because it has no ""face"". Upgraded, it has a little more attack speed and damage. Upgraded again, it has 1.5x more attack speed and damage. Dispenser replacement is the Pulse Generator. It destroys potential sappers one at a time on a cool down \(the timer is the same as the amount of ammo/metal that would generate on a dispenser\). Upgraded, the timer of destruction of potential sappers is decreased by 1.5 seconds. Upgraded again, it's decreased by 3.0 seconds. Teleporters are replaced with Motion Detectors. When built, projects a minimap on the builder's screen and giving you your current room and half of the next room's blueprint and enemy's last position. Updates the image as often as a teleporter's cooldown. Upgraded, decreases the cooldown. Upgraded again, decreases the cooldown. Alt\-Fire: Increase security measures and compromise the safety of the Pulse Generators at the same time. They take 50&amp;#37; damage but send out a disruption wave, short circuiting any potential cloaks and temporarily showing a spy's silhouette for 1.5 seconds and dealing 20&amp;#37; damage to enemy buildings nearby. \(Doesn't counter dead ringer\). Also temporarily severs the connection of any nearby enemy medi\-beams for 0.75 seconds. You can upgrade this to level 3 like the Dispenser to counter spies and enemy buildings faster. When medi\-beams are severed, the silhouette of your Pulse Generator is temporarily shown for 1 second to your enemy. A sound and graphic will also display to the medic who projected said medibeam. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- D.P.C \- \(Dangerous Painful Constructions\) \(PDA 1\) When constructing your buildings, you deal a small amount of damage to any enemy running into your buildings' melee range and cause them to bleed for a small amount of time. Your buildings take 50&amp;#37; longer to construct because of the addition of the pointy shrapnel. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Texan's Terrific Taille \(PDA 1\) Description: Nothin' like sittin' on your robotic rockin' chair while drinking your Taille, telling a tale. Appearance Idea: Hook up two of those beers that the engineer drinks in his Rancho Relaxo taunt to each building on each side, to signify they are juiced up. Your buildings build 25&amp;#37; faster. Your buildings operate 15&amp;#37; faster. \+10&amp;#37; Movement Speed bonus when moving your gear. Your buildings are capped at Level 2. \-15&amp;#37; Explosive Vulnerability. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- E.E.D \- \(Extra Explosive Detonator\) \(PDA 2\) When you detonate your buildings, you deal 33&amp;#37; explosive damage of a stickybomb launcher and causes a slight knockback. Your sentry, dispenser and teleports have 85&amp;#37; health. If too close, explosives also knock you back and deal damage to you. You must manually detonate to trigger the effect. Getting your buildings destroyed by someone else, it will not activate. Your buildings must be level 3 respectively to have the effect be available to trigger. Costs 20 additional metal on each building. \_\_\_\_ NOTE \_\_\_\_ If multiple of these ideas are somehow seen by Valve \(I wish, xD\), If the wrench replacements replace a Sentry or a Teleporter or a Dispenser already, then you will not be able to equip the PDA replacements that also do the same thing to avoid software conflict. Basically like equipping cosmetics and/or weapons that occupy the same part of the body. ===== Medic ===== The Nadelprojektor \(A Nail Gun\) \(Primary\) Shooting out these needles to allies heals them and provides a 20&amp;#37; resistance to the damage type that the ally took. Shooting out these needles to enemies makes them 20&amp;#37; more vulnerable to the last type of damage they took \(Does not include the syringe damage type itself\). If damage not taken between ally or enemy, default resistance is bullet. Damage Types: Bullet. Explosive.

Ubercharge halts both the medic and the target's health at the current value and absorbs half the incoming damage. The rest of the absorbed damage is reflected back to where it came directly, including bullets and projectiles. \+20&amp;#37; explosive resistance. \-33&amp;#37; Overheal build rate. \-66&amp;#37; Ubercharge rate on Overhealed patients. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- The Seesaw \(A Seesaw with the balancer as the handle\) \(Melee\) \+67 Overheal build rate on Demomen, Soldiers and Engineers. \+10&amp;#37; Melee Resistance on wearer. \-66&amp;#37; UberCharge rate on non\-demomen, non\-soldiers and non\-engineers.

Holding Left Click charges the ubersaw for 30&amp;#37; more melee damage at full charge after letting go, letting a gritty swing loose upon your enemy at 30&amp;#37; less attack speed. \-40&amp;#37; Melee Attack Speed. ====== Sniper ====== Scoped Crossbow \(Primary\) Scoped Headshots deal 40&amp;#37; more damage. \+50&amp;#37; Firing Speed. Has a very tiny arc at the end, like the huntsman but cannot be ""charged up"". Unscoped headshots or bodyshots deal 20&amp;#37; less than a non\-charged bodyshot from the sniper rifle. You can light these arrows too like the Huntsman. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Shortsighted Shortbow \(Primary\) Fire 50&amp;#37; faster than the Huntsman. \+20&amp;#37; larger arc than the Huntsman. \-25&amp;#37; less damage if it's a body shot. You can light these arrows too like the Huntsman. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Compact Cablebow \(Primary\) \+25&amp;#37; attack speed. \+25&amp;#37; Slow to the normal Huntsman Movement Speed Debuff. Left Click for one arrow. Right Click to load 3 arrows but with 10&amp;#37; less speed than the normal charge rate. The arrows shoot forward, left and right of crosshair, respectively. You can light these arrows too like the Huntsman. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Python Longbow \(Primary\) Takes 25&amp;#37; longer to charge up than the Huntsman. The arc of the shot is 2x longer than the Huntsman. If the top of a level 3 sentry has an arrow lodged in it, 2 rocket shots from that sentry will blow up inside the sentry and do damage to itself, knocking back anything on it's left or right a little bit. If an engineer is on the sentry, hitting it 3 times, the arrow will dislodge after the first rocket. You can light these arrows too like the Huntsman. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Surf's Up for Desert Surfboard \(Secondary\) Left Click to surf down a hill at scout running speed, doing 75&amp;#37; sniper rifle unscoped damage to 2 targets maximum with an additional slow added to afflicted target enemies. Left Click up a hill sends you down behind you the opposite direction, taking 0.75 seconds to turn around. Halves the slow debuff applied by the Huntsman. Cooldown as long as the razorback once used. If any jars of liquids are thrown at the Sniper, the effect of said liquid is 1.5x longer. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Rocky Treadknife \(Melee\) Description: For a last ditch effort in melee range.

Throw daggers at enemies which are a little harder to hear. \+25&amp;#37; Firing Speed. \-40&amp;#37; Damage. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Chic Shuri\-kens \(Primary\) Left Click: Throw shurikens at enemies with 10&amp;#37; more firing speed. Right Click: Throw 3 shurikens at once in an arc horizontally in front of you. 30&amp;#37; less damage. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Mini Axes of Experts \(Primary\) Left Click: Throw an axe with an arc. It does 25&amp;#37; more damage than a revolver shot. Right Click: Throw 3 axes one after the other in half the firing speed with 30&amp;#37; less accuracy. \-50&amp;#37; Firing Speed. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Listening Amplifier \(Primary\) Left Click against a wall to get a more accurate trace of where the enemy is in that room on the other side of the wall. A glowing outline \(like when you sometimes respawn with teammates\) will highlight two targets closest to the wall for 3 seconds. This includes enemies and buildings. 1 Shot then reload. 0.75 seconds recovery time from pulling the trigger on a successful wall. Does not apply to enemy cloaked spies. You cannot move while amplifier is applied to the wall. Can only look to your left, right and in front of you while using the Amplifier. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Fibre Cable \(Melee\) \+25&amp;#37; Range Left Click: You do a small jump forward for 1 second. You do 10&amp;#37; of health per second for 10 seconds to the enemy you trap. If you miss, you are vulnerable for 0.3 seconds. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Portable Upgrading Software \(Sapper\) ""Still in beta stages. Do not apply to any engineer buildings or even sudden removal. It may cause the building to be damaged or result in death."" When applied to buildings, it lays a trap for the engineer to discover when upgrading their building. Once the engineer upgrades it to the next level, it will upgrade like normal but when the engineer goes 5 feet or more away from the afflicted building, it saps like a normal sapper but at 1.25x the speed. It uploads a virus into it that forces the building to upgrade again, forcing it into hibernation for self repair after the time is up. After 3x the time it would take to sap a building, it will downgrade to its original state before the forced update. If the engineer repairs their building before it takes effect, 1/5 of the building's health takes damage. If the building is level 3, then it cuts its effectiveness in half if completed. 5 Second Cooldown if suddenly removed via wrench ingenuity. Note The idea of that sapper is to create confusion. If you check via scoreboard and see no other engineers on your team or communicate to your teammates via voice, then you know a spy has tampered with your building\(s\). \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Curler's Rhoomba \(Sapper\) Target an area to throw the Sapper. You slide it along the ground to an area infront of you, activating the sapper, taking slightly longer than a normal sapper but just shorter than the Red Tape Recorder. Sentries cannot kill it even with Wrangler. Engineers take 25&amp;#37; more time to destroy it. Explosives destroy it. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Leathered Bond Wristwatch \(Invis Watch\) Description: After 007 retired and abandoned his gadgets, the Spy saw this opportunity and thought ""If you can't beat 'em, steal 'em."". Basically functions like the invis watch but leaves behind a hologram when you cloak. Cloak Type: Create Illusion. Leave an illusion behind at your current location on cloak and temporarily gain speed and damage resistance for 3 seconds while cloaked. The illusion has your current disguise on at the time of cloaking and will stand still and use your equipped pistol to shoot at the closest enemy nearby. 75&amp;#37; Regen Rate \-25&amp;#37; Maximum Cloak \-50&amp;#37; cloak meter from ammo boxes. No Cloak meter from ammo boxes when invisible. Your illusion does 15&amp;#37; of your pistol's base damage. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Debonaire's Dartwatch \(Invis Watch\) With one right click, a small dart ejects into the target enemy, slowing them down by half the speed of a sandman ball and doing bleed damage with the same recharge time as sandman then disappearing. \-50&amp;#37; Cloak meter from ammo boxes. \-25&amp;#37; Cloak meter from ammo boxes when invisible. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Cigar Smokescreen \(Invis Watch\) Throw down a cigarette that creates a smokey barrier that enemies cannot see through. This turns you invisible for the same amount of time as a dead ringer, allowing your escape. Your allies will get a barely visible outline of the last location of enemies in the line of sight of the occurring smokescreen. =================== Multi\-Class Weapons =================== Desert Hawk \(Desert Eagle\) \(Scout and Engineer Pistol Replacements\) You emit a powerful shot, jolting your aim slightly upwards from the force. \+15&amp;#37; Damage. \-25&amp;#37; Firing Speed. \-30&amp;#37; Clip Size. \-15&amp;#37; Magazine Capacity. \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- Remember, my aim is not to upset or annoy, it's to speculate. It's to theorycraft. To think of cool ideas for an extremely fun game. Leave your thoughts in the comments! Got suggestions of your own? Drop 'em down there, I'd love to see where your train of thought lies! Got a suggestion on how you could tweak what I came up with to make it better? Leave that bad boy in the comments too!

132,vulnerability,tf2,Some things that I (and other people) found about the Pyro.,10,87bc7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/87bc7j/some_things_that_i_and_other_people_found_about/,2018-03-27 05:17:17,"Go on a surf server and join as a Pyro, with whatever primary you want, except the Dragon's Fury. Press M1. The flames will get thrown forward at a certain speed. Now move forward, and press M1. They'll get thrown forward at the same speed, but with a 300 hu/s addition (your current speed walking forward), making the flame particles reach the same distance from your point of view to where it despawns. Now, surf a bit. You'll get almost 4000 hu/s in some maps. After you get a good speed (1700 hu/s or more), press M1 again. The same will happen. The flamethrower can essentially get flame particles with a speed of over 4000 hu/s. This doesn't really apply to pubs, since there aren't any giant ramps where you can surf on, but it does apply in certain situations where you get thrown forward (ex.: surfing a rocket / sticky, jetpacking), making the Pyro's range over double the original. The second thing that I wanted to talk about is the jetpack. [A jetpack charge can make the Pyro get flung upwards more effectively than a ctap](URL using literally just space + your mouse, while you need some timing to nail a ctap. (i gotta be honest, i play tf2 since quickplay was still a thing [i'm playing since tough break], and i still can't hit ctaps consistently.) Third one... well, if you're still using the Degreaser for some God-forsaken reason, use the Powerjack. It isn't really an exploit, just a minor thing that nobody talks about. Walk forward with the Powerjack out, jump, switch to the Degreaser (to avoid surprises / that 20% damage vuln.), just before you land, press Q and jump again while walking forward. It keeps your speed 345 hu/s, while getting you armed with a flamethrower, and without damage vulnerability. So, yeah."

135,vulnerability,tf2,PSA: The Buffalo Steak Sandvich is better then both the GRU and Eviction Notice,14,8bj68v,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8bj68v/psa_the_buffalo_steak_sandvich_is_better_then/,2018-04-12 04:03:29,"With the recent nerfs to the GRU and Eviction Notice, Heavy has seemingly returned to his old state of the slow, immobile specialist, unable to keep pace with other classes. The nerf affecting both the GRU and Eviction Notice were clearly born from the desire to change the competitive *meta* (since only the TF2 team can change that), a change which has made both weapons useless as actual weapons, and barely worth mentioning as utilities. The nerfs to the weapons mean that with the weapons: * The instant you pull out the weapon, 20 health is drained * For every second while active, the weapon drains away 5hp/s (10 for GRU), and when holstered, refills back at the same rate to 300 The instant drain health and bizarrely implemented health regen means that you will have to fiddle around with health more than if you had chosen another weapon. (there's still a bug where if you get drained down to 101 hp, then swap away, and back to, the weapon, you will be hurt for 20 points of damage, leaving you at a flat 81hp) (also please note, the -20 hp on equip will *always* activate, so switching between the weapon and your minigun in rapid succession will drain you completely down to 81hp) The GRU is really the only option for combat, now, due to the fact that the Eviction Notice does terrible damage, barely gives enough speed to catch up to enemies, and also drains your health, while both are terrible options for mobility due to the poorly implemented health drain/recovery mechanics. The solution? **Ignore both weapons and use the Buffalo Steak Sandvich instead** The Buffalo Steak Sandvich is a secondary lunchbox item with some pretty awesome (if underused) stats on it. On consumption, the Steak gives heavy +35% movement speed (which is faster than the Gloves of Running Urgently), minicrits for 16 seconds, with the only penalty being restricted to melee weapons during the buff duration, and an unlisted 20% damage vulnerability while active. The fact that this item is a secondary even makes it a better choice, since you can use a better melee weapon, like the Fists of Steel, or Killing Gloves of Boxing. The main downside of this choice is the lack of a Sandvich, however in most situations, this is not a big deal. * In competitive you will pretty much always have a Medic available to heal you * In casual, health and healing sources are everywhere, so long as you stick with your team and watch your back Speaking of Medics, did you know that the BSS actually counts as a medium healthkit like the Sandvich? For heavies that have a Medic to follow them, this means that they can get the benefit of a speed boost to get to the front line, and when there, can give the steak to their doctor to keep them alive. **TL;DR**: The Buffalo Steak Sandvich does basically everything that the GRU and Eviction Notice want to do, but better. I also calculated damage reduction/vulnerability using steak, fists of steel, and both, using the damage from a point-blank rocket as base. Base damage (no resistance): 112hp Steak damage (Wiki lists 20% extra damage taken): 135hp = 20.53% extra dammage taken Fists of steel (game lists 40% damage resisted): 67hp = 40.17% damage resisted Fists of steel + Steak (unknown %): 81hp = 27.67% damage resisted "
136,vulnerability,tf2,How I would balance weapons: Scout,6,8blzbl,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8blzbl/how_i_would_balance_weapons_scout/,2018-04-12 10:17:23,"If I don't play with any other stats that are already on the weapon, it means that I find them good the way they are. It doesn't mean that I'm literally removing all stats and adding a single downside to a weapon. Also, I'm assuming that the bullet spread will be active (but on a weaker scale, so the pattern used in comp is accurate, but with a minor bullet spread, so it won't be pin-point accurate), and random crits will be disabled. (pls valve. at least remove them in weapons that aren't on the melee slot.) Scattergun: Pretty good the way it is Force-a-Nature: 20% faster reload speed, 15% less accurate Soda Popper: 20% less accurate BFB: Getting damaged doesn't reduce the boost, but rather, the boost reduces over time, taking 15s to get down from 100% (or 99%, actually) to 0. 10% more accurate. Back Scatter: The range for minicrits on the back should be ramped up to 800 hu. Also, only 15% less accurate. Shortstop: 30% more accurate (yes. accuracy is important.) Pistol: Also pretty fine the way it is. Winger: -50% clip size, jump height only applies when the weapon is equipped and ready to fire (Atomizer mechanic, but with height instead of extra jump.) PBPP: It's on a pretty good spot now, I don't think that I'd be helping if I tried to mess with its stats. Mad Milk: Reduce the health gained from 60% to 40%, it literally out-heals a Conch charge. Guillotine (here's the big one.): Bring back the crit mechanic, but the stun crits will only be applied to Sandman stuns. Also, the damage should ramp-up like the Crossbow, starting at 15 (point-blank), with 3s of bleeding, and ending at 75 (in the original moon shot distance), with 7.5s of bleeding. If necessary, reduce the hitbox size. Make so the recharge time is brought to 15s, which will reduce if you hit the target (by 10% if you hit it at point-blank, and at 50% at the max damage range). Also, you would have to actually wait for the whole animation to finish before you can throw the Guillotine. Bonk! Atomic Punch: Speed debuff lasts for 7.5s, but fades away gradually. Crit-a-Cola: Instead of taking mini-crits for 5s, the Scout gets a 30% damage vulnerability for 5s. It doesn't sound as a nerf, but now you can take the 30% extra damage and another mini-crit if the user is marked / jarated / enemy has a buff of some sort, bringing the damage from a 88 damage melee hit, to a 114 damage hit. So, basically, deletes Scouts with the Sandman. Sandman: Hitting people at the old moonshot range stuns the target with the old stun for 3s, after the old stun ends, the speed debuff is applied. The ball should recharge at the old rate of 15s, but the ""moonshots"" at the new range speed up the recharge by 20%, the full stun recharges 30% of the ball. Candy Cane: IMO it's well balanced. Boston Basher: 20% slower deploy speed Fan'o'War: 40% less damage, 55% less damage (in relation to stock) in hits that aren't critical Atomizer: Normal deploy speed, 50% slower HOLSTER speed, so, you actually have to commit for the third jump, without getting lower heights to cross segments of the maps if you're using the Force-a-Nature or the Winger. Wrap Assassin: 20s recharge speed for the bauble. nuff said. Sun-on-a-Stick: 40% fire resistance / 50% afterburn resistance (as separate stats, not mixed stats, because then afterburn would deal at max 2 damage.) when the weapon is equipped. Because, yeah. It isn't useless, but it also isn't really good, considering that it has to be equipped, and to deal damage against a Pyro with that weapon, well, getting into point-blank results into dead without resistance."

The current stats are: On Hit : Bleed for 5 seconds 20% extra flame vulnerability on wearer And of course, no random crits This doesn't make sense to me because it doesn't really change the way that engineer plays. The other wrenches all give the player a much different playstyle than the others. The flame vulnerability doesn't matter because you shouldn't encounter pyros that often, and if you do, you're dead anyway, so it doesn't matter. The weapon however, does have a purpose. The bleed damage is greatly useful for tracking and punishing the spy who gets caught. But this is negated heavily by spy's resistance and shorter debuff time when cloaked, meaning that both it's upside and downside are very minor, which obviously makes it quite boring. The solution is to balance the wrench around it's role: Punishing bad spies. And I think I may have a solution: On hit: bleed for 5 seconds ( Lets you keep track of spies) On hit: Guaranteed mini-crits for 3 seconds (To punish the spy) Crits whenever it would normally minicrit (Can coordinate with a jarate sniper) -40% damage penalty (39 damage, or 117 with crit) Sappers take three hits to remove ( To make it more punishing if you fail to deter the spy) 20% longer swing speed (So that you can't just spam it) I would like to hear what you think about it, and maybe give some of your own opinions.

Also, you could build Ubers with this, allowing medics to Uber more people quicker. Its probably really bad, so any suggestions for balancing would be greatly appreciated.

Anyway, my ambassador post caused a lot of debate in the comments, so here's one not as hated, the eviction notice. If you are unfamiliar with this, i just go over each version of a weapon and give them a score from 5 being overpowered to 1 being underpowered. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Original Design: ber Update** (+) +50% firing speed. (-) -60% damage penalty. This was..... bad. You swung quick but did a lot less damage. It was boring too, two stats that counteract each other to make ""balance"". You had less dps than the bat, and the bat is supposed to be weak. There was one saving grace to this weapon though, random critical hits. You can swing 10 times in 4 seconds and if you've been doing damage you can have the max crit chance of 60%. That means 6 of those hits will crit thus doing 572 damage in 4 seconds or 143 dps. Stock can do 5 hits in 4 seconds with 3 being crits for 715 damage in 4 seconds or 178 dps. Hey wait, it's still doing less than stock! Yeah, this weapon was pretty bad. *Final Tally: 1.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 2: Gun Mettle Update** (+) Added 3 seconds of speed boost on hit. Oh hey, after 4 years of crap they decided maybe they should touch this weapon. And they did, they made it both fun and a bit more useful. You can run good but you have to run up and melee someone to do it. The good thing is you can hit them and catch up to them with the speed. This means getting off multiple hits is easier even if they do barely anything. You can also switch off and have an extra 2.3 seconds of speed with your other weapons out. It was an alright change, though you still had to run up to someone melee out and get a hit. *Final Tally: 2* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 3: Tough Break Update** (+) Added +15% move speed while active. (-) Added +20% damage vulnerability while active. And now it's actually useful. It's essentially a mini-GRU in which you can go at less speed but you aren't punished as bad. Unlike the GRU, the vulnerability goes away as soon as you put it away. This means you aren't at as much risk using it. It may be 20% less effective than the GRU, but it's a fine weapon. *Final Tally: 3* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Current Design: Jungle Inferno Update** (+) Removed 20% damage vulnerability. (-) Added -5 health drained per second while active. And just like the ambassador, it was fine until valve came in and nerfed it. Your health drains, wonderful. Now you can go into battle with 100 health just for getting out 3 seconds faster. The downside is way too harsh for the upside, and the others don't add much. Maybe if hits increased max health or something, but no. Now it's hard to justify using this. *Final Tally: 2* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Average Tally: 2.1* It was crap, less crap, good, then back to mediocrity. I used to love this weapon about as much as the GRU. That hasn't changed, because the GRU isn't that good now either. *sigh* i guess I'll just have to accept it. He's getting an update anyway, let's hope valve is nice. "

Heavy is probably the closest thing I have to a Main. yea I play a ton of Pyro but thats because I like to hit people with my Vintage Homewrecker....a lot actually. So Heavy Ideas. just note. if I dont talk about a weapon its because I think the weapon is fine as it is. Im also not talking about multiclass weapons. So no Panic attack Also I may be kinda drunk while writing this so if I stole any ideas from someone else....Im not sorry Brass beast - The beast is considered to be heavy's worst minigun. so lets make the damage resistance effective at full health while spun up. that way It is a true defensive minigun Natacha - Simular treatment to the Beast. However make the damage resistance effect active at half health at any time(regardless if it is spun up or not) Hou long heater - How about a firing speed bonus at the cost of a damage penalty? It does not have to be big. just something to make it more interesting. The Chocolate bar - Make it be able to overheal again(and find a long term way of fixing the stupid as hell infinite overheal exploit) Eviction Notice - Revert it to it's previous design.(the current one is a worthless watered down GRU) Warrior's spirit - Revert it to it's previous design(where it had the health penalty instead of the damage vulnerability) Holiday punch - make It not be able to be crit boosted. Thats about it. Other then that I would totally wanna see changes that makes heavy less reliant on other classes. thoughts?

I mean, it's kind of a big deal. Grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and brotha, this annoys people. Basically, kind of a big deal. Yes, it's the donger, it once was the most infamous weapon in the game. Now it's much more fair, but I'll talk about it in a minute. Oh yeah, I don't do these things anymore so let me explain what it is. Basically i just take the previous and current versions of a weapon and rank it from 1 to 5. 1 means really weak while 5 means it's overpowered. Now onto the thing. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 1: Mann-Conomy Update** (+) +25 max health on wearer. That's it. Extra health at cost of not having an smg to back you up. There's gotta be something more to it, right? Well there is, let me tell you about item set bonuses. Once upon a time, item sets gave you bonuses for having the whole thing equipped. The sheild's set gave you... headshot immunity, wonderful idea valve. Let's just give the class a counter to the only real class to directly counter it, itself. Though it wasn't as bad as you'd think because you had to use the Sydney sleeper which lacked the ability to headshot. So you could survive a headshot but the other person could too. But I'm going to leave this fact for a bit later, just keep it in mind. I'm not here to discuss the power of the set though, I'm going to talk about it on it's own. So was it good? Well, not so much. It was decent, but not exactly the best pick. What can you survive extra with it? Scatterguns, rockets, pipes, stickies, shotguns, crossbows, sniper rifles, and revolvers all kill you in roughly the same amount of shots. It could help against an ambassador headshot + bodyshot, but without the razorback, why would they shoot you? More survivability, health from packs, and overheal are good, but is it worth giving up an smg? The only time you need extra survivability is for combat sniper, and even then a backup damage dealer is pretty good to have. Though let me give another perspective. How useful is backup damage? Well you can finish off enemies who survive or dodge a close range headshot, which is quite useful. Though you can just follow up with an unscoped bodyshot. It's just useful enough to bump this weapon down a bit, but it's not the best weapon there is. With all that said, i think you can understand why i would give it a score slightly under a 3. *Final Tally: 2.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 2: July 10th, 2013 Patch** (+) +25 max health on wearer. (+) +15% bullet resistance on wearer. (-) -20% explosive vulnerability on wearer. **Gets killed by enemy sniper 42 times** Oh egads, my reputation is ruined! But what if, i were to purchase a weapon to disguise the fact that i suck. Oh ho ho, delightfully devilish, sniper. Yeah i don't know what to say here except shitty memes. The weapon was broken and stupid, what a difference a little bit of bullet resistance could make. Well if you don't know, the bullet resistance let you survive a quickscope headshot like before. This time though, you could headshot back. This meant you instantly won any sniper vs sniper fight unless you really sucked at aiming. This wasn't just a crutch, it was good on people who were gods at sniper, it was just plain overpowered. Maybe you shouldn't have added in the ability to survive the one attack that is most effective against them, huh? Though hold on a minute, there is a downside to this madness. You take 20% more damage from explosions. An explosion that would've done 125 to you normally would do... 150. Yes, the downside is negated by the upside. You will die in the same number of rockets as before, what a downside. Though there's one more thing to mention, you have no smg. Is surviving headshots worth giving up a good damage dealer? Well that's a bigger downside, but I'd say it is worth it. Remember that sniper really only has one counter, sniper. Spy can work, though most pub spies die before they get halfway to you, plus you have 2 weapons to counter them anyway. No, sniper is a hard counter to sniper and every other class really just does normal or bad against him. Backup damage is good for a quick 150 headshot and then a few little shots to finish off anyone, i won't deny that. But 55% of the classes die in one headshot and you still have a melee and 24 other shots on your primary. Sorry, but being almost uncounterable is better than a bit of backup damage. *Final Tally: 4.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 3: Jungle Inferno Update** (+) +50% fire resistance on wearer. (+) Wearer is immune to afterburn. Jungle Inferno... I have my big gripes about the update but i do like that they nerfed the dds. The new design though, well I'll give you my thoughts now. You give up your smg to get more survivability against pyros and... well that's really it. You can lower the dps of a pyro from 150ish to 75ish, a pretty noticable difference. They can still kill you in about 2 seconds, but it's better than less than 1 second. Also you are immune to afterburn which means you don't have to worry about extinguishing yourself. It also means scorch shot pyros don't become the bane of your existence. So the question is now proposed, is losing your smg worth it? Well considering that pyros kill you much slower now, you can easily get a second shot on pyros to kill them without needing an smg. That leaves 3 classes that you don't one shot. Heavies have too much health to headshot + smg, plus they likely won't get that close to you anyway. That leaves demos and soldiers. You lose killing potential on 2 classes that *might* come close to you while being good against another class. I think it's worth it. *Final Tally: 3* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ That was longer than usual, i just had a lot to say. If you need a tl;dr version, well too bad just tough it up and read. Bon voyage! "

150,vulnerability,tf2,Pyro Melee Weapon Balance Thoughts,9,7x76il,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7x76il/pyro_melee_weapon_balance_thoughts/,2018-02-13 16:18:58,"I just thought I'd share what I think could be done to make Pyro's melee options more balanced instead of the Powerjack being the overall best, and stock never being used. First, I just want to say that I'm not going to suggest anything for these weapons: **Back Scratcher:** I feel that this is pretty well balanced, with a good upside and a fair downside that can also be used to build uber faster sometimes, but still making a difference in a fight in that your medic won't be healing you much **Hot Hand:** Compared to stock, it's not better or worse, so you could choose between the two depending on preference. (Trading emergency damage that won't come up often for being able to slap someone and I guess use the speed to run away or avoid damage/chase) As for actual changes, I have specific ideas for some, but just basic thoughts about changes for others that I wasn't sure what to do with. **Powerjack:** What I have for the Powerjack is actually pretty simple. I think you can easily just replace the 20% damage vulnerability while active with a health penalty, probably -15 or -25 health. That way you'd actually have a real downside instead of taking extra damage on a weapon you don't usually have out when fighting anyways. To compensate, maybe up the health on kill to +50 and make it able to overheal again. (You could also make the overheal decay slower like the kunai but I'm not sure if that would be too good or not) **Axtinguisher:** You can go a lot of ways to make this weapon good again without making it better than stock at all times. Probably the easiest way to do that is to slap a passive downside on it, but saying a health penalty again kinda seems like a cop out to me since I just used that idea for the Powerjack (also get rid of the deploy speed penalty). As for the other stats like swing speed and the damage penalty, or anything else you might want to put on it, I'm not really sure what to do with those since it's a lot of different numbers to mess around with. (either way it should extinguish enemies because it's kinda in the name, and I guess it means that if you don't oneshot someone with the crit then they have a chance to react, a holster penalty could fit with this) **Homewrecker:** Overall this weapon isn't much of a problem, but it's usually better than stock since you won't be hitting people with melee that often, so the downside isn't very impactful. Maybe a speed-related downside could work, since it's a heavy sledgehammer that seems to promote being defensive around Engineers. To compensate, I think it could use something like being able to construction boost friendly Engineer buildings by hitting them like wrenches can. Changing the 100% damage vs buildings to 150% could also work in my eyes, as it would one shot sappers anyways, and now you can one shot level one buildings, and take out level 2 and 3 buildings that are a little damaged. You might actually consider running at a sentry and smashing it with this instead of trying to kill it with flames, as it might be faster. (A lot of people in the past have suggested a sentry resistance or knockback resistance while active to make it easier to hit them, but I'm not sure if it would be too much to put on the Homewrecker.) **Neon Annihilator:** I'll be honest, I can't think of much to do with this one, because it's more or less just two kinda gimmicky upsides and two randomish downsides, so you can really do whatever with this thing, as the water crits that everyone likes the Neon for isn't even usable on some maps without Mad Milk or Jarate, which you could just use your Flamethrower on anyways. The only real suggestion I have is that the Gas Passer should probably count as being wet. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment and Third Degree:** There isn't much to go on with these two either, since the SVF has one pointless upside and the Third Degree has one stat total that doesn't come in handy often. The Sharpened Volcano Fragment should probably get some afterburn related gimmick, like stronger afterburn or one that stacks with other afterburn, but there's a lot of ways to go about buffing it. The Third Degree could just keep some Medic-related stats, like maybe giving the medic healing you uber when you hit someone (although I did steal that idea from the Vs Saxton Hale mod) or something about overheal, but it's about time Valve got around to changing the last remaining straight upgrade in the game. Well, that's all I had on my mind for Pyro's melee weapons. Feel free to tell me what you think about them, or your own ideas for changes. (especially on the ones I wasn't specific about like the Axtinguisher please help me)"
151,vulnerability,tf2,"Pyro shouldn't be a short-range class. Also, flamethrower idea?",0,7kqkoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7kqkoo/pyro_shouldnt_be_a_shortrange_class_also/,2017-12-19 14:28:54,"Pyro as a short-range class doesn't work at the time for two reasons, IMO. 1. Other short-range/flank classes function better. Scouts are mobile and deal enough damage to get in your face and get kills without buggy damage. Heck, any smart player as almost ANY class can do a good job of flanking! 2. Pyro isn't fun to fight. The flames block your view, the particles deal more damage in some scenarios than in others, and there's no way to escape once he's close because his run speed isn't slow like soldier or heavy. If you reworked his flames to function as a long, narrow cone without ghost particles or whatever it is that makes his DPS wild, he'd be fine. Like a hybrid medium-range DPS/support class. Maybe he'd still do more damage at close range, like all classes do, but pyros wouldn't feel obligated to W+m1 their way around a fight. Also, change the particle effects so they don't blind enemies who probably can't get away from the pyro to begin with. Anyway, quick primary idea for pyro. The Air Support! * Airblast cooldown reduced (to counter extreme spam/ubers/etc * Airblast costs 25% less (only 15 ammo instead of 20) * 10% bullet damage vulnerability * 15% less damage than stock There, that's my idea. I'm doubt it'd work well in-game, but I usually play pyro on defense, so it'd fit my own playstyle."
152,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon Rebalance Ideas (V 1.0) [Long] [Unofficial],1,7ljtmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7ljtmz/weapon_rebalance_ideas_v_10_long_unofficial/,2017-12-23 06:54:48,"[See the Google Docs for the most recent version] (URL This is a Work-In-Progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes** **General** Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, the second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes a deviation from the bullet's path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo-random. Not sure why you would really want this with no random weapon spread though. **Scout** Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -10% air control when knocked in the air by knockback * Increase cooldown between shoves. Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 5 health/second * Add: Hype does not need to be full to activate (Similar to hitmans heatmaker) Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effecting against burning enemies, and allow it to chain. * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. * Add: +10% damage against overheal (Allows you to get rid of enemies overheal buff more easily) Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty Equalizer This weapon pails in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. **Pyro** Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the denotator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +50% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) **Demoman** Loch-n-Load This weapon's only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch. * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -75% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this, these changes are meant to strength it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. The clip size penalty is already enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Deploy Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage) *Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) *Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 20% Damage Vulnerability (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) **Engineer** Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: Projectiles ignite targets on hit * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changing the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) **Medic** Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. * Add: 30% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons (It will still disappear after the 2.5 seconds is up) Amputator This weapon pails in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Penalty Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 10% Damage Vulnerability **Sniper** Sniper Rifles General (Does not include Huntsman or Classic) Sniper Rifles are really good. However, it can be frustrating to lose a 1v1 against a sniper, a class that is supposed to be weak in close combat. This change is supposed to weaken the sniper in close combat, while it will still reward a skilled sniper in close combat * Change: Sniper Rifles have damage ramp up, from 50% damage at point blank up to full damage after 512 units. Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus. * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. These changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot not cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon. * Add: -50% Accuracy Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is, uhh, Im not sure. It seems pretty bad but some people think it is overpowered. (Edit: Probably becuase those posts are pretty old.) Not sure why though. This change assumes it is underpowered, but this is a small buff anyway. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter "
153,vulnerability,tf2,Why the Buffalo Steak Sandvich is actually decent,12,7llb6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7llb6q/why_the_buffalo_steak_sandvich_is_actually_decent/,2017-12-23 11:04:47,"The buffalo steak sandvich (I'll call it the steak for simplicity), one of the least used heavy weapons. Its a bit of an enigma because it's [barely used in pubs] (URL and [is banned in comp] (URL But hold on a minute, if it's banned in comp it has to have some use, right? Well I'm here to prove why the steak is actually a good weapon, maybe even comparable to the almighty sandvich in some situations. Now let's look at the stats here. If you don't eat the steak it's identical to the sandvich, 30 second recharge that can be sped up with recharge and you can throw it to heal someone for 50% of their health. The real difference is when you eat it. It has the same 4.3 second consumption time but instead of healing you it gives 4 effects for the next 16 seconds; mini-crit boost, +35% extra speed, +20% damage vulnerability, and you are restricted to melee weapons. This is a big gimmick if you look at it, there's only one stat that i would like to bring attention to, the extra speed. It is mostly there to make catching up to people to hit them easy. There is another use though. What is heavy's main downfall? If you said anything other than low speed, well it's his lack of speed. He is so slow which makes weapons that give him speed a godsend. There's 3 weapons that give him speed in the game, the GRU (which now sucks), the Eviction Notice (also sucks), and the steak. The steak is the only one that still has damage vulnerability rather than a health drain. That means there's no extensive wait to refill your health so you don't instantly die when stepping into battle. That means any rollout longer than 16 seconds has a free speed boost without much consequence. The only problem comes if you are attacked during that 16 seconds, but usually that won't happen unless there is a spy or good flanker. It's especially uncommon at the beginning of a round when you both have an entire team going out to protect you and very little chance of anyone going that far back that quick. So essentially, use it to rollout to get to the battle much quicker if it's a long walk. Ok but what about a big downside, it doesn't heal you when used. Well that's easily remedied with a medic. Even with the sandvich, you rarely ever eat it if you have a medic. You don't need your self heals if you have Dr. Hitler shoving his life cannon up your pootis 24/7. It still keeps the team heals for keeping your gibusvision f2p medic alive until he inevitably runs off a cliff. So does that mean it shouldn't be changed? Well.... no. I'd much rather see it become a fun weapon to go on mini-crit punching rampages than a rollout weapon. Its banned in comp so valve will probably nerf it to the 7th circle of hell and make the 3 people who use it slightly sad. **Tl;dr** So the steak can actually be viable, although pretty situational. The sandwich is usually just better for all around use but the steak can work. The thing is, it really only works if you have a pocket medic and are using it on maps with a long rollout time (5cp, some payload and attack/defend maps)."
154,vulnerability,tf2,Tier List for Medieval Mode,10,7lpfl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7lpfl7/tier_list_for_medieval_mode/,2017-12-24 03:22:30,"So medieval mode is another forgotten gamemode by valve, but an interesting one. So what about i bring some light to it with a tier list for the available weapons in the mode. I'll do one for each slot on each class, other than the ones with only one weapon. I'll rank them from C being lowest to S being best. I'll also give a brief explanation for each weapon. No fancy graphics because I'm not good at graphic design. **Scout** *Secondary* - S: - A: Flying Guillotine - B: Mad Milk, Crit-a-cola - C: Bonk! So the flying guillotine is your only long range damage dealer and can be pretty good for getting a good 50 + bleed damage from far away. The crit a cola gives mini-crits which isn't too much on a bat (only about 10 extra damage) and the marked for death makes you more squishy. Mad Milk can be good but you only get 39 health back on a normal melee attack and the small packs that drop are about as good, can be useful throwing on a point though. Bonk isn't that useful, especially with the new slowdown thing, there's not too much reason to use it. *Melee* - S: Candy Cane, Boston Basher - A: Atomizer, Fan O'War - B: Stock, Sandman - C: Sun-on-a-Stick, Wrap Assassin Candy Cane is pretty much a direct upgrade considering there's only one weapon that does explosive damage. Boston Basher is great for both mobility and damage, the self bleed is easily cured with health packs. The atomizer can be good for extra mobility and can do more damage than stock in the air. The fan o war is great for support but be wary of it's low damage. Stock is stock. The slow on the sandman is pretty good but the health loss is crippling. The wrap assassin give easily curable bleed and does no damage. Only one weapon gives fire so why would you use the soas? **Soldier** *Secondary* - S: Concheror - A: Battalion's Backup, Buff Banner - B: - C: Gunboats, Mantreads, Base jumper The conch has everything, a good passive effect, builds faster, and a really good buff. The backup gives extra health which isn't too big in this mode but the defense buff is pretty good. The banner gives mini-crits which can be pretty useful. Do i even need to explain why the other 3 are terrible? *Melee* - S: Pain Train, Half Zatoichi, Disciplinary Action - A: Escape Plan - B: Shovel, Equalizer - C: Market Gardener The pain train is a straight upgrade since there are no bullets. The Zatoichi is also pretty much a straight upgrade considering how you'll only switch off to use your banner and by then you'll probably have a kill. Disciplinary action can be great for both team support and can stay out of range and still hit your enemies. Escape plan only works at low health but at that point you're a speedy soldier doing the same damage as stock. Stock is stock. Equalizer does less damage at full health, so it's a bit worse. Do i need to explain the market gardener? **Pyro** *Melee* - S: Back Scratcher - A: Stock, Powerjack, Sharpened Volcano Fragment, Third Degree - B: - C: Axtinguisher, Homewrecker, Neon Annihilator, Hot Hand Back Scratcher does extra damage and you get more health from packs for literally no downside. Stock and third degree are just stock. Powerjack can be good for extra speed and health on kill and the vulnerability isn't the most crippling thing. The fragment can be better than stock granted they don't collect a health pack. The last 3 really don't have any upsides that matter in this mode. Hot hand is awful. **Heavy** *Secondary* - S: Second Banana, Buffalo Steak Sandvich - A: Dahlokos Bar - B: Sandvich - C: The banana is really good considering you fill most of your health and only have a 10 second recharge. The steak's melee only downside doesn't apply and it is really good for extra speed and mini-crits at only a small cost of damage vulnerability. Dahlokos is good for a quick 100 heal but the small packs around the area do almost as good of a job, the extra health is nice though. The sandvich takes much too long to recharge and is much better for pocket play rather than going solo. *Melee* - S: Killing Gloves of Boxing - A: Fists, Warriors Spirit, Holiday Punch - B: - C: GRU, Eviction Notice, Fists of Steel The KGB is amazing for going on killing sprees with the crits for a measly downside. Stock is stock. Warrior's Spirit is a bit better here because people can't shoot you, but it's still a bit eh. Holiday punch can be great if not a bit worse than stock. The GRU and eviction notice drain health which means you are usually going to be at 100 health the whole game. Fists of Steel make you instantly die to pretty much the only damage source here. **Engineer** *Melee* - S: Gunslinger - A: Southern Hospitality, Eureka Effect - B: Stock, Jag - C: The gunslinger gives extra health which is amazing, it does lose random crits but it has the 3 punch combo. The southern hospitality has bleed for pretty much no downside. The teleport on the effect can be useful and it has no real downside. Stock is stock. Jag is about equal in dps to stock. **Medic** *Melee* - S: Amputator, Solemn Vow - A: Bonesaw - B: - C: Ubersaw, Vita-saw The amputator is amazing considering you can heal an entire group of people. The solemn vow is pretty much a straight upgrade and seeing health can be good. Stock is stock. Ubersaw and Vitasaw both rely on uber, so they both are direct downgrades. **Sniper** *Secondary* - S: Cozy Camper - A: Razorback - B: - C: Darwin's Danger Shield Cozy Camper gives some good health regeneration which can be very useful in battle. Spies can't shoot you so the razorback is great against spy, but only spy. DDS protects from fire, one weapon sets you on fire, see the problem? **Spy** *Melee* - S: Big Earner, Kunai - A: Stock, Spy-cicle - B: Your Eternal Reward - C: The health loss on the big earner and kunai isn't too big considering on both you will still die to two normal melee hits. Stock is stock. Spy-cicle has no real upside but no real downside. YER has cloak drain which really kills it considering you can't use the letranger and ammo packs are less common. *PDA* - S: - A: Stock, Cloak and Dagger, Dead Ringer - B: - C: Stock is stock. Cloak and Dagger can be useful but requires stopping for a bit which can make going distances longer. The dead ringer's feign is great but no cloaking for 20 second kind of kills it."

156,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon Rebalance Ideas (V 1.2) (Long),5,7n1tti,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7n1tti/weapon_rebalance_ideas_v_12_long/,2017-12-31 01:35:54,"[See the latest version here](URL This is a work in progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Also, please give feedback on specific ideas, not vague general feedback. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive, because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes** **General** &gt; Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. &gt; Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes deviation from the bullets path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo random. Not sure why you would really want this over no random weapon spread though. **Scout** &gt; Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. * Add: Boost drains over time (4% a second) &gt; Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -10% air control when knocked in the air by knockback * Increase cooldown between shoves. &gt; Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty &gt; Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 5 health/second. * Change: Hype Mode lasts for 12 seconds (From 8 seconds) &gt; Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) &gt; Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that, making it weak in pubs but overpower in 6s. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost * Change: 25 Base Damage (From 50 Base Damage) &gt; Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. Like bodies. * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity &gt; Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effecting against burning enemies, and allow it to chain * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. &gt; Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. &gt; Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies. * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** &gt; Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds &gt; Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. * Add: +10% damage against overheal (Allows you to get rid of enemies overheal buff more easily) &gt; Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) * Change: Cannot Mini-Crit Blast Jumping Players. &gt; Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage &gt; Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty &gt; Equalizer This weapon pales in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option. * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. &gt; Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. Also, it can get teammates to the frontlines quickly, which is broken in 6s. * Change: Gives a mini-speed boost instead which increases the speed by half the amount the normal speed buff does (Its based on what class is getting the buff) **Pyro** &gt; Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits &gt; Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the denotator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) &gt; Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge &gt; Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +50% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed &gt; Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility. Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. &gt; Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time &gt; Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) **Demoman** &gt; Loch-n-Load This weapons only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -75% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings * Add: -20% Slower Reload Speed &gt; Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control &gt; Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this I have to designs: One that strengthen it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made, and that weakens the defensive capabilities and reduces the penalties Option 1 * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Option 2 * Change: +4 Max Pipe Bombs (From +6) * Change: +10% Firing speed (From +25%) * Change: 0.6 second Slower Arm Time (From 0.8 second slower arm time) &gt; Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. It isnt as effective as an anti-spam downside as it should be. The clip size penalty is already massive enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty &gt; Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Deploy Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** &gt; Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) *Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. &gt; Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 20% Damage Vulnerability (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) **Engineer** &gt; Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: Projectiles ignite targets on hit * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. &gt; Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changing the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) &gt; Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) &gt; Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) &gt; Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) **Medic** &gt; Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay &gt; Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. * Add: 30% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate &gt; Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons (It will still disappear after the 2.5 seconds is up) &gt; Amputator This weapon pales in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Penalty &gt; Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health while it is deployed * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 10% Damage Vulnerability **Sniper** &gt; Sniper Rifles General (Does not include Huntsman or Classic) Sniper Rifles are really good. However, it can be frustrating to lose a 1v1 against a sniper, a class that is supposed to be weak in close combat. This can frustrate some people. This change is supposed to weaken the sniper in close combat, while it will still reward a skilled sniper in close combat. * Change: Sniper Rifles have damage ramp up, from 50% damage at point blank up to full damage after 512 units. &gt; Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off &gt; Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. &gt; Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) * Add: Shots that penetrate deal damage in a radius Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** &gt; Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. &gt; Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. The first options changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. The second options are a simpler, less range restricted version of the stats. Option 1 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot not cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Option 2 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot not cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed &gt; Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon and weaken it. * Add: Crits have damage falloff. &gt; Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is pretty bad. Its far too slow to destroy stuff, just making it an annoyance. These changes are meant to make it easier to get away without an engineers teammates noticing you and to disable the buildings for longer after being removed, to make it more of a weapon that you use to prepare for a team push. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter * Change: Disables sentry guns for 1.5 seconds after being removed (From 0.5 seconds) "
157,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon History: Rocket Jumper,12,7ng1nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7ng1nc/weapon_history_rocket_jumper/,2018-01-02 03:47:27,"Hey, Happy New Year everyone! It's 2018, that means that we can get on the never-ending hype train until the heavy update. But anyway, I'll celebrate the new year with a weapon history. If you don't know these, i basically just take every previous version of a weapon and rank them from 1 to 5. 1 being really bad and 5 being overpowered. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 1: Mann-Conomy Update** (+) +200% max primary ammo. (+) No self inflicted blast jump damage. (-) -100% damage penalty. So the rocket jumper, a training weapon that i have to rank compared to real weapons. Now this is the original design, so you could carry the Intel and you could survive the kamikaze taunt kill. You can gain insane mobility at cost of your primary damage source. It's perfect for memeing with the market gardener or actually using it seriously.... with the market gardener. So it's nowhere near as good as stock, but it can be useful if used right. I'd say that's at least somewhat good. *Final Tally: 2* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 2 and 3: Scream Fortress and December 22, 2010 patch** (-) Added a -100 max health penalty (later changed to +100% damage vulnerability). Wh-wha-WHAT? What the hell was valve thinking here? ""Oh this rocket launcher that really isn't good in comparison to stock is a bit too much, let's just halve the wearers health."" Now it's horrible, you are as squishy as a rotten tomato and you can do 0 damage. And what's the upside? You can jump infinitely, except for fall damage which will limit you. You also have more ammo, fun. This is just.... horrible. *Final Tally: 1 (i would go lower if i could)* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 4: May 31, 2012 patch** (+) Removed damage vulnerability. (-) You can't randomly crit. (-) Wearer cannot carry the intelligence or PASS time jack. So it's back to it's original design except for one thing, you can't carry the Intel. It's not *that* big but frankly i always forget about this stat which is annoying when i play ctf and get to the intel. Anyway, I'd say it's still a two. *Final Tally: 2* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Average Tally: 1.6* I still can't wrap my head around it, why did they add the health penalty? I can see why they added the whole no carrying the Intel, but that? I don't know. Also keep in mind this happened to the sticky jumper so i don't have to cover that. "
158,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon Rebalance Ideas (V 1.3) [Long],14,7nntc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7nntc4/weapon_rebalance_ideas_v_13_long/,2018-01-03 04:22:26,"[See the most recent version (And changes between versions!)](URL This is a work in progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Also, please give feedback on specific ideas, not vague general feedback. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive, because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes** **General** &gt; Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. &gt; Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes deviation from the bullets path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo random. Not sure why you would really want this over no random weapon spread though. **Scout** &gt; Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. * Add: Boost drains over time (4% a second) &gt; Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -10% air control when knocked in the air by knockback * Increase cooldown between shoves. &gt; Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty &gt; Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. The extra time for the hype mode is to give the scout time to think about when and how he uses the jumps. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 5 health/second. * Change: Hype Mode lasts for 12 seconds (From 8 seconds) &gt; Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) &gt; Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that, making it weak in pubs but overpower in 6s. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost * Change: 10 second recharge time (From 6 second recharge time) &gt; Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. Like bodies. * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity &gt; Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effecting against burning enemies, and allow it to chain * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. &gt; Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. &gt; Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies. * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** &gt; Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds &gt; Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. * Add: +10% damage against overheal (Allows you to get rid of enemies overheal buff more easily) &gt; Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) * Change: Cannot Mini-Crit Blast Jumping Players. &gt; Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage &gt; Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty &gt; Equalizer This weapon pales in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option. * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. &gt; Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. Also, it can get teammates to the frontlines quickly with no huge downside, which is broken in 6s. Option 1 * Change: Gives a mini-speed boost instead which increases the speed by half the amount the normal speed buff does (Its based on what class is getting the buff) Option 2 * Add: Everytime you switch to this weapon or hit a teammate with it, it reduces your max health by 10 health. Max Health is restored and 5 health/second after the whip is holstered * Add: 15% slower holster speed **Pyro** &gt; Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits &gt; Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the denotator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) &gt; Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge &gt; Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +50% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed &gt; Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility. Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. &gt; Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time &gt; Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) **Demoman** &gt; Loch-n-Load This weapons only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -25% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings * Add: -20% Slower Reload Speed &gt; Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control &gt; Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this I have to designs: One that strengthen it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made, and that weakens the defensive capabilities and reduces the penalties Option 1 * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Option 2 * Change: +4 Max Pipe Bombs (From +6) * Change: +10% Firing speed (From +25%) * Change: 0.6 second Slower Arm Time (From 0.8 second slower arm time) &gt; Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. It isnt as effective as an anti-spam downside as it should be. The clip size penalty is already massive enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty &gt; Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Deploy Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** &gt; Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage). Its also powerful in 6s while defending the last point and sitting in spawn. * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Speed while spun up &gt; Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) *Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. &gt; Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 20% Damage Vulnerability (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) **Engineer** &gt; Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: Projectiles ignite targets on hit * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. &gt; Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changing the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) &gt; Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) &gt; Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) &gt; Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) **Medic** &gt; Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. &gt; Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay &gt; Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. * Add: 30% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate &gt; Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it. Option 1 * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons, but the duration is shortened by -33% Option 2 * Change: bercharge only provides a 50% damage resistance on the medic who is activating the bercharge. &gt; Amputator This weapon pales in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Penalty &gt; Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health while it is deployed * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 10% Damage Vulnerability **Sniper** &gt; Sniper Rifles General (Does not include Huntsman or Classic) Sniper Rifles are really good. However, it can be frustrating to lose a 1v1 against a sniper, a class that is supposed to be weak in close combat. This can frustrate some people. This change is supposed to weaken the sniper in close combat, while it will still reward a skilled sniper in close combat. * Change: Sniper Rifles have damage ramp up, from 50% damage at point blank up to full damage after 512 units. &gt; Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off &gt; Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. &gt; Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) &gt; Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) * Add: Shots that penetrate deal damage in a radius &gt; Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** &gt; Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. &gt; Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. The first options changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. The second options are a simpler, less range restricted version of the stats. Option 1 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot not cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Option 2 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot not cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed &gt; Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon and weaken it. * Add: Crits have damage falloff. &gt; Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is pretty bad. Its far too slow to destroy stuff, just making it an annoyance. These changes are meant to make it easier to get away without an engineers teammates noticing you and to disable the buildings for longer after being removed, to make it more of a weapon that you use to prepare for a team push. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter * Change: Disables sentry guns for 1.5 seconds after being removed (From 0.5 seconds) "
159,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon Rebalance Ideas (V 1.4) [Long],0,7nwaw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7nwaw2/weapon_rebalance_ideas_v_14_long/,2018-01-04 04:52:26,"[Click Here for the Most Recent Version and Changes in Between Versions](URL This is a work in progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Also, please give feedback on specific ideas, not vague general feedback. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive, because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes** **General** &gt; Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. &gt; Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes deviation from the bullets path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo random. Not sure why you would really want this over no random weapon spread though. **Scout** &gt; Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. * Add: Boost drains over time (4% a second) &gt; Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -10% air control when knocked in the air by knockback * Increase cooldown between shoves. &gt; Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty &gt; Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. The extra time for the hype mode is to give the scout time to think about when and how he uses the jumps. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 5 health/second. * Change: Hype Mode lasts for 12 seconds (From 8 seconds) &gt; Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) &gt; Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that, making it weak in pubs but overpower in 6s. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost * Change: 10 second recharge time (From 6 second recharge time) &gt; Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. Like bodies. * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity &gt; Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effecting against burning enemies, and allow it to chain * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. &gt; Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. &gt; Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies. * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** &gt; Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: Mini-Crits have damage fall-off * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while rocket jumping (Doesnt include your rocket jumps) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds &gt; Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. * Add: +10% damage against overheal (Allows you to get rid of enemies overheal buff more easily) &gt; Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) * Change: Cannot Mini-Crit Blast Jumping Players (Knocking players in the air will still mini crit though) &gt; Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage &gt; Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty &gt; Equalizer This weapon pales in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option. * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. &gt; Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. Also, it can get teammates to the frontlines quickly with no huge downside, which is broken in 6s. Option 1 * Change: Gives a mini-speed boost instead which increases the speed by half the amount the normal speed buff does (Its based on what class is getting the buff) Option 2 * Add: Everytime you switch to this weapon or hit a teammate with it, it reduces your max health by 10 health. Max Health is restored and 5 health/second after the whip is holstered * Add: 15% slower holster speed **Pyro** &gt; Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits Design 3 * Add: Weapon instantly reloads on successful hit * Add: Can penetrate enemies &gt; Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the detonator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) &gt; Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge &gt; Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +85% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed &gt; Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility. Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. Option 4 * Add: While active: * Add: +75 health on kill * Add: 50% of all afterburn is returned as health * Add: +30% damage vulnerability on wearer Makes it into a healing melee, which was a niche the old power jack had. &gt; Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time &gt; Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) **Demoman** &gt; Loch-n-Load This weapons only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -25% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings * Add: -20% Slower Reload Speed &gt; Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control &gt; Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this I have two designs: One that strengthen it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made, and that weakens the defensive capabilities and reduces the penalties Option 1 * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Option 2 * Change: +4 Max Pipe Bombs (From +6) * Change: +10% Firing speed (From +25%) * Change: 0.6 second Slower Arm Time (From 0.8 second slower arm time) &gt; Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. It isnt as effective as an anti-spam downside as it should be. The clip size penalty is already massive enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty &gt; Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Deploy Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** &gt; Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage). Its also powerful in 6s while defending the last point and sitting in spawn. * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Speed while spun up &gt; Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +300% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. &gt; Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 20% Damage Vulnerability (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 50% melee crit immunity while active **Engineer** &gt; Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. Option 1 * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: Ignite Enemy * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. Option 2 * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: All active buildings regen 10 health * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. &gt; Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changing the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) &gt; Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) &gt; Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) &gt; Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. Option 1 * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) Option 2 * Add: Marked for death while building being sapped &amp; for short time after * Add: +100% damage to buildings (sappers) * Add: This weapon deploys 50% slower * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability **Medic** &gt; Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. Alternatively just have it passively reload, but that it is kind of weird as all passively reloading weapons have only 1 shot per clip. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. &gt; Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Add: Overdose is displayed on the hip while hosltered * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay &gt; Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. Option 1 * Add: 30% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate Option 2 * Add: 60% Faster Overheal Decay * Change: 70% max overheal (up from 50%) * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate &gt; Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it. Option 1 * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons, but the duration is shortened by -33% Option 2 * Change: bercharge only provides a 50% damage resistance on the medic who is activating the bercharge. &gt; Amputator This weapon pales in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while active Option 2 * Remove: While active: * Add: +50% faster regen recovery rate (rate at which max regen comes back is twice as fast) * Change: -50% damage penalty (down from -20%) &gt; Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health while it is deployed * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 10% Damage Vulnerability **Sniper** &gt; Sniper Rifles General (Does not include Huntsman or Classic) Sniper Rifles are really good. However, it can be frustrating to lose a 1v1 against a sniper, a class that is supposed to be weak in close combat. This can frustrate some people. This change is supposed to weaken the sniper in close combat, while it will still reward a skilled sniper in close combat. * Change: Sniper Rifles have damage ramp up, from 50% damage at point blank up to full damage after 512 units. &gt; Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off &gt; Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. &gt; Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Ramp Up/ Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) &gt; Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) * Add: Shots that penetrate deal damage in a radius &gt; Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** &gt; Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. &gt; Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. The first options changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. The second options are a simpler, less range restricted version of the stats. Option 1 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Option 2 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Speed * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects &gt; Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon and weaken it. Option 1 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. Option 2 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. * Add: -20% damage penalty while disguised (In addition to existing damage penalty) &gt; Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is pretty bad. Its far too slow to destroy stuff, just making it an annoyance. These changes are meant to make it easier to get away without an engineers teammates noticing you and to disable the buildings for longer after being removed, to make it more of a weapon that you use to prepare for a team push. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter * Change: Disables sentry guns for 1.5 seconds after being removed (From 0.5 seconds) "
160,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon Rebalance Ideas (V 1.6) [Long],2,7o5nyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7o5nyg/weapon_rebalance_ideas_v_16_long/,2018-01-05 07:12:53,"[Click Here for the Most Recent Version and Changes in Between Versions](URL This is a work in progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Also, please give feedback on specific ideas, not vague general feedback. Not all of the ideas need to be implemented. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive, because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes** **General** &gt; Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. &gt; Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes deviation from the bullets path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo random. Not sure why you would really want this over no random weapon spread though. **Scout** &gt; Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. (25%/sec ?) * Add: Boost drains over time (4% a second) &gt; Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -25% air control when knocked in the air by knockback &gt; Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty &gt; Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. The extra time for the hype mode is to give the scout time to think about when and how he uses the jumps. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 2 health/second while in hype mode. 5 health/second after Hype Mode * Change: Hype Mode lasts for 12 seconds (From 8 seconds) &gt; Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) &gt; Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that, making it weak in pubs but overpower in 6s. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost * Change: 10 second recharge time (From 6 second recharge time) &gt; Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. Like bodies. * Add: +500% Ragdoll Velocity &gt; Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effective against burning enemies, and allow it to chain Option 1 * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. Option 2 * Add: No Random Crits * Change: -25% Damage Penalty against non-burning players (From -25% Damage Penalty) * Change: While active: Afterburn immunity (From +25% Fire Resistance) &gt; Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. &gt; Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies. * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Add: -20% Swing Speed * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** &gt; Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: Mini-Crits have damage fall-off * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while rocket jumping (Doesnt include your rocket jumps) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds &gt; Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. Option 1 * Add: +10% knockback on enemies Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +10% Damage Bonus on Wearer * Add: +10 Damage Vulnerability on Wearer &gt; Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) * Change: Cannot Mini-Crit Blast Jumping Players (Knocking players in the air will still mini crit though) &gt; Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage &gt; Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty &gt; Equalizer This weapon pales in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option. * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. * Add: +15% Speed Bonus while &lt;50% Health (To more easily catch up to victims) &gt; Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. Also, it can get teammates to the frontlines quickly with no huge downside, which is broken in 6s. Option 1 * Change: Gives a mini-speed boost instead which increases the speed by half the amount the normal speed buff does (Its based on what class is getting the buff) Option 2 * Add: Everytime you switch to this weapon or hit a teammate with it, it reduces your max health by 15 health (50 max health is the lowest). Max Health is restored at 5 health/second after the whip is holstered. * Add: 25% slower holster speed **Pyro** &gt; Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits Design 3 (It was a suggestion) * Add: +33% Damage * Add: Weapon instantly reloads on successful hit * Add: Can penetrate enemies &gt; Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the detonator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) &gt; Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge &gt; Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +75% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed &gt; Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility. Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. Option 4 (It was a suggestion) * Add: While active: * Add: +75 health on kill * Add: 50% of all afterburn is returned as health * Add: +30% damage vulnerability on wearer Makes it into a healing melee, which was a niche the old power jack had. &gt; Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while active * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time &gt; Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) * Add: +500% Ragdoll Velocity **Demoman** &gt; Loch-n-Load This weapons only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -25% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings * Add: -20% Slower Reload Speed &gt; Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control &gt; Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this I have two designs: One that strengthen it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made, and that weakens the defensive capabilities and reduces the penalties Option 1 * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Option 2 * Change: +4 Max Pipe Bombs (From +6) * Change: +10% Firing speed (From +25%) * Change: 0.4 second Slower Arm Time (From 0.8 second slower arm time) &gt; Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. It isnt as effective as an anti-spam downside as it should be. The clip size penalty is already massive enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty &gt; Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Holster Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** &gt; Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage). Its also powerful in 6s while defending the last point and sitting in spawn. * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -25% Damage Penalty) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Speed while spun up &gt; Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +500% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. &gt; Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 15% Damage Vulnerability while active (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 50% melee crit immunity while active **Engineer** &gt; Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. Option 1 * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: Ignite Enemy * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: All active buildings regen 10 health * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. &gt; Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changing the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) &gt; Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) &gt; Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) &gt; Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. Option 1 * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Add: Marked for death while building being sapped &amp; for short time after * Add: +100% damage to buildings (sappers) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability **Medic** &gt; Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. Alternatively just have it passively reload, but that it is kind of weird as all passively reloading weapons have only 1 shot per clip. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. &gt; Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Add: Overdose is displayed on the hip while holstered * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay &gt; Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. Option 1 * Add: 40% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Add: 60% Faster Overheal Decay * Change: 70% max overheal (up from 50%) * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate &gt; Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it. Option 1 * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons, but the duration is shortened by -33% Option 2 * Change: bercharge only provides a 50% damage resistance on the medic who is activating the bercharge. &gt; Amputator This weapon pales in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while active Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Remove: While active: * Add: +50% faster regen recovery rate (rate at which max regen comes back is twice as fast) * Change: -50% damage penalty (down from -20%) &gt; Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health while it is deployed * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while deployed **Sniper** &gt; Sniper Rifles General (Does not include Huntsman or Classic) Sniper Rifles are really good. However, it can be frustrating to lose a 1v1 against a sniper, a class that is supposed to be weak in close combat. This can frustrate some people. This change is supposed to weaken the sniper in close combat, while it will still reward a skilled sniper in close combat. The second change is to weaken body shotting while still rewarding accurate headshots. * Change: Sniper Rifles have damage ramp up, from 50% damage at point blank up to full damage after 512 (Maybe only 256) units. * Change: After 512 Units, bodyshots have damage falloff, though it only drops damage of half as much normal damage fall off (Headshots are unaffect) &gt; Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off &gt; Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. &gt; Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Ramp Up/ Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) &gt; Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. Option 1 * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) * Add: Shots that penetrate deal damage in a radius * Add: 50% Slower Holster Speed (Makes your more vulnerable since you cant switch ) This makes the weapon Option 2 * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Add: Shots ricochet of walls once (Allowing for bounce shots) (Bounce shots still have tracers) * Add: Max Charged shot base damage 100 (From 150) * Add: -25 Health Penalty * Add: -100% Damage Penalty against cloaked spies * Add: 50% Slower Holster Speed (Makes your more vulnerable since you cant switch) This design allows for trick shots that bounce of walls (Albeit you cant see the enemies) allowing for you to memorize spots that have good trajectories. This allows for very long shots, so the penalties make body shotting less effective and make you weak in close combat. The Damage penalty against cloaked spies is to prevent lucky shots on spies that are sneaky by to take you out. &gt; Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** &gt; Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. &gt; Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. The first options changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. The second options are a simpler, less range restricted version of the stats. Option 1 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -60% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -60% Slower Holster Speed * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects &gt; Ambassador This weapon was nerfed too reduce its range. Some people were not pleased with this. These changes mostly keep the changes intact, but make it a bit more forgiving * Change: Headshots deal full damage until 512 Hammer Units (From 447 Hammer Units) * Change: Headshots after 1200 Hammer Units deal critical damage (Though still only doing 51 Damage) &gt; Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon and weaken it. These changes include the ambassador changes above Option 1 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. Option 2 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. * Add: -20% damage penalty while disguised (In addition to existing damage penalty) &gt; Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is pretty bad. Its far too slow to destroy stuff, just making it an annoyance. These changes are meant to make it easier to get away without an engineers teammates noticing you and to disable the buildings for longer after being removed, to make it more of a weapon that you use to prepare for a team push. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter (I know this isnt helpful) * Change: Disables sentry guns for 1.5 seconds after being removed (While it is not unbuilding after being downgrade) (From 0.5 seconds) * Add: If the Sapper is removed and the building is being folded up, after the sentry rebuilds to Level 1, there is a 1.0 second delay before the sentry can be upgraded or fire.

161,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon Rebalance Ideas (V 1.7) [Long],7,7oltoj,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7oltoj/weapon_rebalance_ideas_v_17_long/,2018-01-07 07:46:39,"[Click Here for the Most Recent Version and Changes in Between Versions](URL This is a work in progress Disclaimer: These are not official changes. These are simply my ideas, and yes, they are probably very broken and make weapons far too powerful. I am only throwing these ideas out there. I am open to ideas and constructive criticism. In fact, the main purpose of this is to have some creative solutions to balancing. Also, please give feedback on specific ideas, not vague general feedback. Not all of the ideas need to be implemented. Note: I am not an expert on balancing, as you can probably tell. I also didnt include weapons just because they are banned in competitive, because I dont know enough about the bans to understand how to fix the weapon. Also sorry for any grammatical/spelling errors. English is my first language. **Weapon Rebalances and Changes** **General** &gt; Random Critical Hits Just remove random crits. However, the major upside to using a melee weapon is a higher crit chance. In order to help melee weapons, all melee weapons that normally get random crits will be able to combo, similar to the gunslinger. The first consecutive hit will be normal, second hit will mini-crit and the third will crit. Also, you should not be required to hold down attack, so you can have a short delay before attacking, to reward accuracy. &gt; Random Weapon Spread Two Options 1. Completely Remove it. (Makes it fairer) 2. Semi-Remove (Random weapon spread becomes deviation from the bullets path that it would take without random weapon spread.) This keeps it pseudo random. Not sure why you would really want this over no random weapon spread though. **Scout** &gt; Baby Faces Blaster Its fun to go fast, but the harsh penalties on the boost mechanic makes it frustrating to use. These changes still have the penalties, but make them less harsh. * Change the loss of boost on damage from 4% per point of damage to 1% per point of damage. * When boost is lost, have the boost meter go down rapidly instead of instantly going down. If the scout deals damage deals damage during this time, it stops draining. (25%/sec ?) * Add: Boost drains over time (4% a second) &gt; Shortstop The shortstop is kind of weak. You simply dont have the same damage per shot or the increased damage ramp up. In addition, the shove is kind of useless. These changes are meant to make the shove more reliable, while provide a niche for the shortstop. * Shove should have a larger range, less wind up and the ability to cancel a reload with a shove (Which is a quality of life improvement when auto-reload is on). It should also be stronger, similar to a airblast with half-strength (Including weaker versions of the changes made in Jungle Inferno) * Add: Enemies pushed into the air by shove can be mini-crit by teammates while airborne. (The scout can not mini-crit his own victims) * Add: -25% air control when knocked in the air by knockback &gt; Back Scatter The back scatter is pretty balanced, but the advantage is a very specific scenario and not significant enough to make a large difference. These changes are meant to make it to encourage flanking and more reliable while rewarding accuracy. * Add: Bullets go in a fixed spread pattern * Add: +15% Damage Bonus * Add: -33% Firing Speed (Makes it slower) * Add: -15% Reload Speed * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Add: -50% Max Ammo * Remove: -20% Accuracy penalty &gt; Soda Popper This weapon is overpowered in 6s as it gives the scout 5 jumps to easily dodge rockets and grenades. This change forces the scout to careful when using the soda popper to dodge. The extra time for the hype mode is to give the scout time to think about when and how he uses the jumps. * Add: Mid-air jumps after the double jump reduce the scouts max health by 10 health. Lowest health possible due to this is 25 (15 with sandman) Max Health regenerates at 2 health/second while in hype mode. 5 health/second after Hype Mode * Change: Hype Mode lasts for 12 seconds (From 8 seconds) &gt; Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol This pistol is practically a straight upgrade. However, the current design is much better than before. So instead of nerfing it into the ground, nerfing another aspect of the weapon to make of more a trade off and to fill a certain niche. * Add: -33% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Max Ammo * Change: +25% Firing Speed (Up from 15%) &gt; Flying Guillotine The Guillotine is not very lethal. It can potentially deal 90 damage, but enemies will usually retreat to get health before that, making it weak in pubs but overpower in 6s. It no longer has the cleaver combo with the sandman. The aim of this buff is to give it a new role: To engage or disengage enemies. * Add: Hits give a 1 second speed boost * Change: 10 second recharge time (From 6 second recharge time) &gt; Scout Melee (General) Bats launch things. Like bodies. * Add: +500% Ragdoll Velocity &gt; Sun-on-a-stick The Sun-on-a-stick is not very effective. It deals pitiful damage, and even with crit swings its rather weak for all the trouble you need to go to. The damage resistance is also not very helpful since you need it out. These changes allow you to be more effective against burning enemies, and allow it to chain Option 1 * Add: No random Crits. * Add: Critical Hits ignite nearby enemies * Add: +20% Swing Speed Penalty * Remove: +25% damage resistance from fire while this weapon is active. Option 2 * Add: No Random Crits * Change: -25% Damage Penalty against non-burning players (From -25% Damage Penalty) * Change: While active: Afterburn immunity (From +25% Fire Resistance) &gt; Fan O War This weapon is useless outside of MvM. For the benefit of getting mini-crits, you might as well shoot the enemy twice instead of risking getting close. These changes will help the scout to have a team supporting role with this weapon. * Add: +50% Switch to and switch from Speeds * Add: 1 Second speed boost up on successful hit (To aid with getting away) * Add: Creates an outline around the victim that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (One at a time) * Change: Teammates can mini-crit the victim (Scout is unable to mini-crit his own victims with this) * Remove: Crits whenever it would normally mini-crit. &gt; Wrap Assassin This weapon deals very poor damage. The bauble deals pitiful damage, and bleed can be easily canceled with heal packs. The baubles cant be picked up again. There isnt much reason to use this weapon. These changes are designed to make this weapon more viable by dealing more damage. * Add: Can hold up to 3 baubles at a time * Add: Crits bleeding enemies. * Add: Shatter effect causes bleeding as well * Add: -20% Swing Speed * Change: +40% recharge speed (Up from +25%) **Soldier** &gt; Liberty Launcher This weapon has a lot of interesting upsides, but none that really complement each other well. I think that the liberty launcher could be an effective combo weapon, especially given its item set. These changes reflect that. * Add: +25% Knockback while rocket jumping (Enemies receive more knockback) * Add: All attacks while rocket jumping are mini-crits (Even your shotgun or melee) * Add: Mini-Crits have damage fall-off * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while rocket jumping (Doesnt include your rocket jumps) * Add: +33% faster switch from and switch to speeds &gt; Buff Banner The buff banner is balanced, though there isnt much reason to use it over the banners unless you are team player, since it there is no passive benefit. This change adds a simple passive buff to give it more use. Option 1 * Add: +10% knockback on enemies Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +10% Damage Bonus on Wearer * Add: +10 Damage Vulnerability on Wearer &gt; Reserve Shooter After Jungle Inferno, this weapon was nerfed into the ground. And for good reason. But now, its pretty useless. Usually when someone is in a situation that you can mini-crit them, they are too far away. This change is supposed make it more viable and make it more skill based. * Add: +30% Accuracy * Add: -10% Damage Penalty * Add: -25% Reload Speed (Makes it slower) * Change: Cannot Mini-Crit Blast Jumping Players (Knocking players in the air will still mini crit though) &gt; Righteous Bison This weapon was thankfully reverted (Mostly). However, it is still weak, even if valve ups the firing speed to compensate for the small hitbox to make damage comparable to the same as pre-MYM levels (As pointed out by Soundsmith) After that would be fixed, just buff the damage. * Increase the firing speed to hits the same number of the times as pre-MYM * Add: +15% Damage &gt; Escape Plan The escape plan is really good. However, the main downside is supposed to be that it cant a viable weapon and should be only used to escape. However, the speed bonus can allow you to dodge during melee combat. This change prevents it from being used in melee combat. * Add: -50% Damage Penalty * Add: -20% Swing Speed Penalty &gt; Equalizer This weapon pales in comparison to the escape plan. The utility of the escape plan overshadows being better at combat. This change is to make it better at combat at low health to make it an effective option. * Add: Swing speed increases as health is lowered, up to twice the normal swing speed. * Add: +15% Speed Bonus while &lt;50% Health (To more easily catch up to victims) &gt; Disciplinary Action This weapon has a much longer range than normal. This makes it really good for melee combat. I have to solutions: Simply keep it the way it is, but just list the longer range, or have the weapon use two separate ranges, one for hitting teammates, and one for hitting enemies. Also, it can get teammates to the frontlines quickly with no huge downside, which is broken in 6s. Option 1 * Change: Gives a mini-speed boost instead which increases the speed by half the amount the normal speed buff does (Its based on what class is getting the buff) Option 2 * Add: Everytime you switch to this weapon or hit a teammate with it, it reduces your max health by 15 health (50 max health is the lowest). Max Health is restored at 5 health/second after the whip is holstered. * Add: 25% slower holster speed **Pyro** &gt; Manmelter This weapon is a weak secondary as the only way to get crits if the enemy team has a pyro. This makes it hard to be viable as it is extremely situational. I have two options to help remedy this. Design 1 makes it a more reliable damage dealer, while design 2 makes it into a more support focused with the ability to not use crits. Design 1 * Add: Can penetrate enemies * Add: +33% Damage * Add: After Penetrating enemies it deals mini-crits Design 2 * Add: Can penetrate enemies and teammates * Change: Primary Fire no longer uses crits automatically * Change: Alt-Fire: Fires with using crits (If they are stored) * Change: Projectile can extinguish teammates * Change: Anytime you extinguish a teammate, you get crits Design 3 (It was a suggestion) * Add: +33% Damage * Add: Weapon instantly reloads on successful hit * Add: Can penetrate enemies &gt; Thermal Thruster Its fun to be used, but it cant easily be used for bombing and it can be sluggish to use for mobility. Maybe this is to keep the detonator viable, but I dont think that should hurt this weapon. One option is to allow you to press a button, such as reload, and you can use it with any weapon equipped. I dont like that idea, as it has a custom taunt already. My idea should have a compromise. * Change: 0.7 Weapon holster time (Down from 1.1 seconds) &gt; Gas Passer This weapon has an interesting effect, but its long recharge time and lack of a secondary weapon hurt the weapons viability. The fact that charge isnt lost on death isnt exactly helping. Here are my thoughts on improving this weapon. * Add: Gas effect cannot to be removed or shortened in duration except by water * Add: Afterburn caused by the Gas effect can not be extinguished or shortened in duration except by water. * Remove: Gas meter isnt lost on death * Change: Half the required damage/time until a full recharge &gt; Axtinguisher A moment of silence for the Axtinguisher. It was nerfed for making the pyro too good at close range despite being a class designed to be close range? Anyway, these changes allow it to deal some serious damage while taking risks to use it. * Change: -50% Damage penalty against non-burning players (From 33% Damage Penalty) * Change: +15% Switch to speed bonus (From -75% Switch speed penalty) * Add: +75% Slower Holster Time * Add: Attacks Extinguish enemy players (Gets on crit and youre done) * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while Deployed &gt; Sharpened Volcano Fragment This weapon is worthless. Its so worthless, its hard to think of balance ideas. Here are several different ideas with a slight commentary. Option 1 * Add: On hit: Ignite and knock nearby enemies vertically into the air * Add: On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -20%) * Remove: Ignites players on hit This allows you to ignite several players and knock them back as well as being helpful for mobility. Option 2 (Stolen from Cosmic Afro) * Add: +33% Damage bonus on non-burning players * Change: -50% Damage Penalty on Burning players (From -20% Damage Penalty) This makes the sharpened volcano fragment into a burst damage ambush weapon Option 3 * Change: +20% Damage Bonus (From -20% Damage Penalty) * Add: Mini-crits Burning Players * Add: Player is ignited while deployed * Add: -50% Slower Holster Time * Add: No Random Crits This reverses the weapon completely. It becomes excellent at melee combat while making the player take damage over time and vulnerable to enemy pyros weapons. Option 4 (It was a suggestion) * Add: While active: * Add: +75 health on kill * Add: 50% of all afterburn is returned as health * Add: +30% damage vulnerability on wearer Makes it into a healing melee, which was a niche the old power jack had. &gt; Third Degree This weapon is literally a straight upgrade to stock. Not a very helpful one though. These changes make this weapon into an effective medic killer while differentiating itself from stock. * Add: Crits enemies in a medic chain * Add: 20% Slower Swing Speed * Add: 20% Damage Vulnerability while active * Add: 20% Slower Holster Time &gt; Hot Hand This weapon is a meme weapon, so its understandable bad. However, due to its weak nature and fun with slapping (Especially since it swings twice), here is a buff to make the weapon a bit better while keeping it a meme. * Add: +10% Faster Swing Speed * Change: -20% Damage (It is actually -15% despite the description saying -20%) * Add: +500% Ragdoll Velocity **Demoman** &gt; Loch-n-Load This weapons only use is as a crutch. The only upside besides easy to hit shots is a useless damage bonus against buildings. The stickybomb launcher is already amazing against buildings. These changes are meant to make it reward accuracy while not being too much of a crutch * Add: Mini-Crits while Blast Jumping * Add: Mini-Crits on enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack. (Like the direct hit, includes air blast) * Add: Crits enemies sent airborne by an explosion, grapple hook, or enemy attack while blast jumping * Change: -50% Clip Size (From -25% Clip Size) * Change: -50% Blast Radius on non-critical and non-mini-crit attacks (From -25% Blast Radius) * Remove: +20% Damage Bonus Against Buildings * Add: -20% Slower Reload Speed &gt; Wee Booties and Bootleggers These weapons are pretty good on demoknight, but the +25 Health seems to small of a reason to give up the Grenade Launcher as when using stickybombs. This change is to encourage their use more. * Add: +200% Air Control &gt; Scottish Resistance This weapon is easily outclassed by the sticky bomb launcher because of the longer arm time. It cant simply be used in an offensive style. Because of this I have two designs: One that strengthen it defensively and increase the number of traps that can be made, and that weakens the defensive capabilities and reduces the penalties Option 1 * Add: 15% Damage Bonus * Change: +8 Max Pipe bombs (From +6) Option 2 * Change: +4 Max Pipe Bombs (From +6) * Change: +10% Firing speed (From +25%) * Change: 0.4 second Slower Arm Time (From 0.8 second slower arm time) &gt; Quickiebomb Launcher This weapon is pretty balanced. However, there is a damage penalty which makes sense? You want to prevent spamming, right? But since damage increases with charge, it counteracts at makes it deal damage. It isnt as effective as an anti-spam downside as it should be. The clip size penalty is already massive enough of a downside, so removing this mechanic should keep it balanced. * Remove: Up to +35% damage based on charge * Remove: -15% damage penalty &gt; Ullapool Caber Poor Ullapool Caber. It is basically useless. Its even slower to kill light classes than stock. The solution? Make it re-usable with a timer, similar to the new razorback and give it a way to be devastating while making it actually take skill. Also copy a beloved weapon. * Add: Crits while blast jumping * Add: Recharges after 30 seconds * Add: Crit Kills reduce recharge time by 33% * Add: 75% Slower Holster Time * Remove: 100% Slower Deploy Time **Heavy** &gt; Natascha The slowdown makes this a pretty good anti-scout weapon but the weaker damage and slower spin up time penalties are quite significant. The damage resistance was nerfed in MYM, I guess as an attempt to allow snipers to one-shot overhealed heavies, even though the resistance affects attacks that drop below the threshold. These changes buff the resistance without affecting critical hits. (Critical damage is always Base Damage (Whatever type) + 2 x Critical Damage). Its also powerful in 6s while defending the last point and sitting in spawn. * Change: -33% Damage Penalty (From -25% Damage Penalty) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: 20% Slower Speed while spun up &gt; Brass Beast The same changes as above, but with a slight increase in speed while spun up. * Change: 45% slower speed while spun up (From 60%) * Change: 20% resistance to non-critical damage while spun up (From 20% damage resistance when spun up and health is less than 50% of max) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability &gt; Buffalo Steak Sandwich This weapons speed boost is literally broken. It doesnt stack with the GRU, and it can be used to get the heavy to mid quicker with no disadvantage, which is broken in 5cp. However when used for its intended purpose, its quite weak. I have two fixes (And a combination of these two options) for the speed specifically, and stats to buff it. (Assuming Valve fixes the bugs with the speed boost interacting with the speed boost from the disciplinary action and the GRUs speed bonus) Speed Fix (Use one or a mixture both) Option 1: * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Option 2: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Remove: +35% Speed Bonus Option 3: * Add: Receive Speed boost for 3 seconds on kill * Change: +25% Speed Bonus (From +35% Speed bonus) * Add: -50% speed penalty when the duration runs out and no kill was secured during the duration of the weapons use Buffs (Regardless of Speed Fix) During the duration of the buff * Add: +5 seconds to the duration per kill * Change: 20% non-critical Damage Resistance (From 20% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 10% Critical Damage Vulnerability * Add: Unable to capture intelligence or capture points/payload * Add: -75% Healing from Healers (Like the Backscratcher) * Add: +500% Ragdoll Velocity on Kills These changes are made to make the heavy stronger while under the duration of the buff. You are already limited to melee weapons so having a damage vulnerability to all damage while only being able to deal melee damage made you a sitting duck. The critical damage vulnerability, removal of the ability to capture objectives and reduced healing from Medics and Dispensers remove the possibility of using the steak as a tool to tank damage. The added duration upon kill allows the heavy to continue the rampage. &gt; Warriors Spirit This weapon is pretty bad. Its hard to justify dealing more damage while taking more damage if you can only deal melee damage where as you can be attacked from any range. The health on kill is rarely a factor as well. * Add: Health on kill can overheal * Change: 15% Damage Vulnerability while active (From 30% Damage Vulnerability) * Add: 50% melee crit immunity while active **Engineer** &gt; Pomson 6000 The Pomson is bad. Its a pretty bad weapon with an unfair ability to drain bercharge and spy cloak. Its not fun to use or fun to fight. Here is an idea for a rework that doesnt have annoying mechanics and makes it more reliable. Option 1 * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: Ignite Enemy * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Add: Projectiles penetrate enemies * Add: On Hit: All active buildings regen 10 health * Change: Increase Projectile speed to 1600 Hu/s (60 Hu/s faster than Liberty Launcher) (From 1200 Hu/s) * Remove: On Hit: Victim loses up to 10% Medigun charge. * Remove On Hit: Victim loses up to 20% cloak. &gt; Rescue Ranger This weapon is really good. A little too good. It allows you to heal at a range, and even at a lower amount of metal then what you would do with a wrench. It also allows you to pick up buildings from afar. I dont think it should be cheaper to heal a building with this weapon than with a wrench when you can do it from a range, though to be fair, a wrench can heal more. I had 3 ideas for changing the Health to Metal Ratio: 1. Make it the same as the wrench 3:1, still quite a good deal (20 metal per bolt) 2. Make it significantly worse, 2:1 I think still fair, but might be a bit too much for some (30 metal per bolt) or 3. Something done the middle, with a ratio that uses a nice, even amount of metal: 2.4:1 (25 metal per bolt) * Change: 2.4:1 Health to metal ratio (25 metal per bolt) (From 4:1 (15 metal per bolt)) &gt; Wrangler This weapon is really good because of its shield. It can stop 66% of the incoming damage, bringing the effective health of the sentry up to 648. These nerfs are designed to weaken the defensive capabilities of this weapon. Option 1 * Change: Shield stops 25% of incoming damage Option 2 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but the damage only blocks damage from the front of the gun Option 3 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage, but damage blocked drains your metal at a ratio of 1:1 Option 4 * Change: Shield stops 50% of damage but drains a meter that when empty, the shield doesnt activate until it is full again. The shield can absorb up to 250 damage before empty and it recharges at a rate of 16.6 points of damage a second while the shield is not active. (Takes 15 seconds to fully recharge) &gt; Short Circuit This weapon is quite balanced, but there are two problems. Primary fire is basically useless as it has toothpick range and secondary fire can be used a lot, especially with metal being restored with a dispenser. * Change: Alt-fire uses 20 metal per shot, plus 5 per projectile destroyed (From 10 per shot) * Change: Holding down primary fire creates a small arc of electricity that can connect from enemy to enemy (Think a chainsaw made of electricity that can link between enemies) &gt; Southern Hospitality This wrench isnt bad. Its just kind of boring. Its bleed on hit makes it sound like its good for spies, but the cloak shortens the duration of status effects. Also its risky to go into melee range of a spy. However, the fire vulnerability rarely is a factor. These changes are designed make it an effective counter for spy, but only for proactive engineers or teams with effective coordination. Option 1 * Add: Applies an outline to the target on hit that can be seen through walls for 5 seconds (Shows even if cloaked) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability * Add: Buildings have a 25% sapper vulnerability (Sappers deal 25% more damage and buildings are destroyed 25% faster from sappers) Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Add: Marked for death while building being sapped &amp; for short time after * Add: +100% damage to buildings (sappers) * Remove: 20% fire vulnerability **Medic** &gt; Syringe Guns General Syringe Guns are bad. Sure, medic isnt meant for combat, but sometimes you need to be able to defend yourself. Its hard defend yourself with against even a spy, and the crossbow its just so good. Here are two suggestions to help make needle guns in general able to compete with the crossbow. * Change: Instead of having a clip and an ammo pool, replace the clip with pressure meter. Taking a shot removes ammo and reduces the pressure meter. Reloading refills the entire pressure meter. The pressure meter has enough to shoot 40 needles. So what would this change? Well the idea behind this is to make it so that you can automatically reload the needle gun when it is not active. This makes switching between healing and shooting easier. Alternatively just have it passively reload, but that it is kind of weird as all passively reloading weapons have only 1 shot per clip. * Change: Projectile speed 1450 Hu/s (From 1000 Hu/s) About the same as the loose cannon. This makes the weapon more reliable. Even though the needle guns DPS is about 120 point blank, most shots will not hit. This makes it easier to defend yourself. &gt; Overdose This weapon is bad. You need to stop healing to make use of the speed boost so this makes it only good for running away with full Uber. Plus, you can heal a scout to fast. These changes make it helpful in more situations and to encourage medic to use it to go from patient to patient quicker and more often * Add: Overdose is displayed on the hip while holstered * Change: +10% Movement Speed (From Up to +20% based on bercharge while active) * Add: 20% Faster Overheal Decay &gt; Quick-Fix This weapon is overpowered in 6s. The healing rate is too much that the current disadvantages cant compete. Option 1 * Add: 40% Faster Overheal Decay * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate Option 2 * Remove: Mirrors blast jumping targets * Remove: +10% bercharge Rate &gt; Vaccinator This weapon is also overpowered in 6s, as it is very common to be fighting only one damage type at a time. These changes weaken the bercharge and buff the weapon to compensate for it. Option 1 * Change: bercharge no longer protects both medic and the target. The resistances is applied to healing target by default, only applying to the medic if they are not healing or the target already has the resistance for that type. * Remove: -33% bercharge rate on Overhealed patients. * Change: If bercharge is activated on the medic, the resistances do not disappear if you switch weapons, but the duration is shortened by -33% Option 2 * Change: bercharge only provides a 50% damage resistance on the medic who is activating the bercharge. &gt; Amputator This weapon pales in comparison to the bersaw or Vitasaw. And ever since the change the way regen works, it cant save you from afterburn. The medicating melody isnt very effective for healing as you need to keep pressing Alt-Fire (Or Taunt). These changes allow for the amputator and effective mass healing weapon with the cost of being more vulnerable * Change: +5 Healing per Second while deployed (Flat Rate) (Up from +3 Healing per second) * Change: Medicating Melody Range: 512 units (Up From 450 units) * Change: Medicating Melody loops, with a brief delay before the healing begins and before control is restored to player * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while active Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Remove: While active: * Add: +50% faster regen recovery rate (rate at which max regen comes back is twice as fast) * Change: -50% damage penalty (down from -20%) &gt; Solemn Vow This weapon isnt that great. You need to relay the information to your team, which does make sense, but the upside it too small outside of 6s. These changes allow it to help teammates in a radius while putting yourself at risk * Change: Allows you and teammates within 512 units to see enemy health while it is deployed * Add: Enemies can see your health * Add: 15% Damage Vulnerability while deployed **Sniper** &gt; Sniper Rifles General Sniper Rifles are really good. However, bodyshotting can be a bit unfun to fight, as its way easier to hit someone with a bodyshot. This change is to weaken bodyshotting while still rewarding accurate headshots. Note: I do not full agree with this change myself, it is simply an idea. * Change: After 512 Units, bodyshots have damage falloff, though it only drops damage of half as much normal damage fall off (Headshots are unaffected) Alternatively, one may argue that sniper is too powerful and quickscopes are too powerful. This is a change that would help with that, but note: I do not personally think this is the right choice, even if sniper is extremely powerful in the right hand. * Change: After 512 Units, shots have damage falloff, though the amount it drops of per hammer is based on the amount of charge, starting at half the normal rate. This makes snipers have to wait longer charging and prevents bodyshotting &gt; Sydney Sleeper and Jarate This change is less to these weapons and more to the Jarate effect. This change is to make these weapons more balanced in comp, namely 6s * Change: The Jarate effects mini-crits have damage fall-off &gt; Hitmans Heatmaker This weapon isnt bad, just situational. The focus seems to be meant to for helping the user to be efficient and to have a plan to kill everyone you meet. However, its more helpful in sniper duels. This changes is to make the focus better for killing multiple targets * Remove: +25% faster charge rate with focus * Add: +25% faster reload Speed with focus. &gt; Classic This weapon is awful. It tries to emulate the sniper rifle from Team Fortress Classic, however, it just leaves this weapon as just bad. You can see more while charging, but that is small potatoes for not being able to headshot unless you are fully charged. This weapon needs a redesign. This redesign is a more mobile rifle that can be used to easily reposition at the cost of slower DPS. * Add: No Damage Ramp Up/ Damage Fall Off (See above) * Remove: Cannot headshot unless fully charged. * Add: Automatically charges at -66% Speed (Takes twice as long to charge) (No speed reduction here) * Change: Pressing primary fire shoots, pressing reload will go into a charging mode (What holding down normally does) Alt-Fire will go into charging mode and zoom in. * Add: Charge is not lost on unzoom or leaving charging mode (Though it is lost on weapon switch or shooting) * Add: Charging mode charges with -25% Speed (Compared to normal charge, not the auto charge) * Add: 50% Slower Reload * Change: -10% damage penalty (From -10% Damage penalty on body shot) &gt; Machina This weapon is popular for body shooting, because of 15% damage bonus. These changes are meant to help the piercing ability while rewarding accuracy. Option 1 * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Change: Shots that penetrate deal +30% More Damage (From Fully charged shots deal +15% damage.) * Add: Shots that penetrate deal damage in a radius * Add: 50% Slower Holster Speed (Makes your more vulnerable since you cant switch ) This makes the weapon Option 2 * Change: Shots penetrate players and damage players behind them (From Fully charged shots penetrate players and damage enemies behind them.) * Add: Shots ricochet of walls once (Allowing for bounce shots) (Bounce shots still have tracers) * Add: Max Charged shot base damage 100 (From 150) * Add: -25 Health Penalty * Add: -100% Damage Penalty against cloaked spies * Add: 50% Slower Holster Speed (Makes your more vulnerable since you cant switch) This design allows for trick shots that bounce of walls (Albeit you cant see the enemies) allowing for you to memorize spots that have good trajectories. This allows for very long shots, so the penalties make body shotting less effective and make you weak in close combat. The Damage penalty against cloaked spies is to prevent lucky shots on spies that are sneaky by to take you out. &gt; Shahanshah This weapon is an interesting side grade. However, its benefit is only when you are in danger. This change is not change that, but to increase benefit when you are in that risky situation. * Change: +50% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max. (From +25% increase in damage when health is less than 50% of max.) * Change: 50% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max. (From 25% decrease in damage when health is more than or equal to 50% of max.) **Spy** &gt; Disguise General Lets face it. Disguises hardly fool anyone, unless the spy is a master of deception. Below are two ideas to make disguises fit in more. However, I am skeptical of these ideas, as this will just make people always spy check as there are less ways to see if a player isnt a spy. * Add: Add key bindings to allow the spy to feign a shot with his disguises weapon. The shot would look just like the real thing and behave the same way (e.g. Explode animation would play, minigun would slowdown spy, scope would seem to move to the spys face), except it doesnt deal damage, knockback or any other effect. There would need to be a weapon for primary and alt-fire. However, the shot ignores any ammo restrictions, so if a careless spy isnt careful theyll be shooting 6 grenades from a grenade launcher. This is to make this new ability actually take some skill. * Add: If a teammates attack hits a disguised spy, the disguises health will appear to drain unless a shot is fatal. &gt; Enforcer This weapon is broken. The pierce doesnt even work half the time. The first options changes are to make this weapon have more similarities with older designs and turn this weapon into a close range revolver for a gun spy. The second options are a simpler, less range restricted version of the stats. Option 1 * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -60% Slower Holster Speed * Add: +25% Max Ramp-up (Like the scatter gun) * Add: -60% accuracy (Revolvers are already quite accurate, not sure how much this would change) * Add: +100% Damage Falloff * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects Option 2 (It was a suggestion) * Change: +25% Damage Bonus (From +20% Damage Bonus while disguised) * Change: -10% Slower Firing Speed (From -20% Slower firing speed) * Add: Cannot cloak while this weapon is deployed * Add: -60% Slower Holster Speed * Remove: Attacks pierce and resist shield effects &gt; Ambassador This weapon was nerfed too reduce its range. Some people were not pleased with this. These changes mostly keep the changes intact, but make it a bit more forgiving * Change: Headshots deal full damage until 512 Hammer Units (From 447 Hammer Units) * Change: Headshots after 1200 Hammer Units deal critical damage (Though still only doing 51 Damage) &gt; Diamondback This weapon is really good. Its a spy weapon that rewards you for doing spy things. Also, people are upset this weapon wasnt nerfed when the ambassador was. These changes are supposed to reduce the effective range of this weapon and weaken it. These changes include the ambassador changes above Option 1 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. Option 2 * Add: Crits have damage falloff. * Add: -20% damage penalty while disguised (In addition to existing damage penalty) &gt; Red-Tape Recorder This weapon is pretty bad. Its far too slow to destroy stuff, just making it an annoyance. These changes are meant to make it easier to get away without an engineers teammates noticing you and to disable the buildings for longer after being removed, to make it more of a weapon that you use to prepare for a team push. * Add: Noise Created is 75% Quieter (I know this isnt helpful) * Change: Disables sentry guns for 1.5 seconds after being removed (While it is not unbuilding after being downgrade) (From 0.5 seconds) * Add: If the Sapper is removed and the building is being folded up, after the sentry rebuilds to Level 1, there is a 1.0 second delay before the sentry can be upgraded or fire. "
162,vulnerability,tf2,"Weapon bans in Community Competitive, and closing the gap between Casual and Competitve",21,7pgl0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7pgl0h/weapon_bans_in_community_competitive_and_closing/,2018-01-11 03:13:53,"Warning: This is an extremely long post. Do not read unless you are comfortable and ready for a long read. There will not be a tl;dr version. With the long-awaited update to Valve's own official competitive mode approaching, I'd like to reflect on the current issues with taking weapons balanced (primarily) around the casual scene into the 6s format, as well as general weapon balance issues that don't have a specific effect on the game. The primary focus will be on the 6s format, as this appears to be the format that Valve is endorsing as their idea of competitive TF2, but I will still cover weapons allowed in 6s but banned in Highlander/4v4. Weapon stats are post-Jungle Inferno and are accurate as of January 10, 2018. The 6s banlist used is the Global Banlist as of January 20, 2018. The Banlist was last updated January 25, 2017. 6v6 is a community-created format of competitive TF2 that existed as early as 2007. Teams are limited to two of each class, with the exceptions of Medic and Demoman, which are limited to one. 6v6 matches are mainly played on 5cp maps, but are also commonly played on koth maps. The general meta is 1 Demoman, 1 Medic, 2 Soldiers (1 protecting the Medic, the other attempting to flank the enemy team) and 2 utilities, usually both Scouts. The other classes are not usually run all-game due to low mobility or poor combative ability. 6s fosters very different playstyles to a 12v12 casual server, and so weapons that are balanced in casual may not be so in 6s. As such, the competitive community bans various unlockable weapons (never stock weapons), due to being overpowered and therefore discouraging variety; forcing the enemy team to run the same weapon to avoid being at a passive disadvantage; or simply being bugged/not having the intended stats. Currently the 6s Global Banlist bans 24 weapons, along with a handful of Cosmetic items. Of these 24, 10 were reworked in Jungle Inferno and are likely waiting to be unbanned. The below text will explain the reason for the ban, then suggest a way to balance the weapon to no longer need a ban. **Scout Weapons** **Soda Popper** The Soda Popper currently has the ability to grant its' user 5 mid-air jumps after filling the Hype meter. In the highly Medic-centric 6v6 meta, it is not particularly difficult to obtain Hype mode at least once per life. A Scout with Hype is nearly impossible to kill with Rockets or Grenades, and often requires both enemy Scouts to focus the Hyped Scout in order to kill him. This, coupled with the fact that non-Hyped Soda Popper Scout has a combative ability easily as strong as a Scout wielding the Scattergun, makes a Soda Popper Scout very overpowered. To make the Soda Popper balanced in 6s, the SP would have to either have a significantly reduced Hype mode, or punish Hyped Scouts severely for *not* dodging. Suggestion 1: Make Hype mode less effective by reducing the 5 mid-air jumps to 2. This would still make the weapon great for dodging projectiles, but not quite as ridiculous as it currently is. Suggestion 2: Severely punish Hyped Scouts if they fail to dodge an attack. Have the Scout Marked for Death during Hype mode, making any error an immediate death sentence. Suggestion 3: Completely remove the added mid-air jumps, replacing it with additional movement speed or health regeneration. **Bonk! Atomic Punch** Pre-Jungle Inferno this weapon offered the ability to pierce the enemy defence with no real downside (lack of a Secondary weapon isn't necessarily a big problem for Scout, who isn't suited to prolonged combat). However, the JI changes made a Scout phasing with Bonk! much easier to shut down, making this weapon potentially fit for unbanning. As stated above, the JI changes were probably enough to make this weapon no longer problematic in 6s. **Crit-a-Cola** Guaranteed mini-crits is an extremely powerful ability in 6s, and is the reason for several weapon bans in the format. A mini-crit Grenade, Sticky Bomb, Rocket or Scattergun blast at close range will 1-shot a Scout, and a Medic taking mini-crits is as good as dead. The ability to give oneself guaranteed mini-crits for 8 seconds at the cost of no Pistol is an incredibly powerful ability. The JI nerf was a step in the right direction, but the C-a-C still has the ability to wipe out several enemy players in the 8s of mini-crits, an ability that a Pistol Scout simply does not have. This makes the weapon still very overpowered in 6s (and 12v12). A Scout with C-a-C should not be able to kill several enemies whilst under its effects, and he should be nearly guaranteed dead should he not be able to kill his enemy during the effects. I suggest that the effect be shortened to 6 seconds, and that the Scout be slowed by 20% for 4 seconds after the effect wears off. This would ensure that the Scout cannot easily kill the enemy Soldier-Medic combo, and would also make the Scout easily killable by the enemy Scouts after the effect wears off. **Flying Guillotine** The infamous combination of the Sandman and the Flying Guillotine, noted for its ability to quickly kill nearly any enemy given enough aiming ability was a recipe for disaster in the competitive scene. The ability to easily pick off the enemy Medic at mid-range gave Scout mid-range abilities far exceeding Demoman and Soldier. The weapon was banned for being extremely overpowered. Simply banning the Sandman would not have been enough, as the weapon could still slaughter enemies stunned by the Nastascha. However, like several weapons on the banlist, this weapon was reworked in the Jungle Inferno update. Specifically, this weapon no longer deals massive damage to stunned enemies, and works as a rechargeable mid-range finishing weapon. As such, it is potentially balanced and may soon be unbanned. **Mad Milk** Whilst not the most dangerous throwable bodily fluid on this list, the Mad Milk still provides exceptional supportive ability. During a mid-fight (the first fight in a 5cp/koth match), simply staying alive is the best way to help your team to capture the point. Teams also tend to show up together, and tend to be bunched up at the start of the fight. The ability to coat multiple enemies, or potentially the entire enemy team with the sticky fluid with questionable origins can completely turn the tide of battle in your favour with very little difficulty or risk, is far too powerful. If your Soldier can simply jump into the entire enemy team and kill half of them without being killable himself, your team is basically guaranteed to take the point. The weapon also gives you much higher survivability in a 1v1. As such, the weapon is overpowered. The ability to coat multiple enemies, and the ability to easily coat a single enemy could be removed with a few changes. The most simple change would be to drastically reduce the splash radius of the projectile. This would prevent coating multiple enemies (unless the enemy team is too bunched up), and would require more accurate aim to coat a single enemy. Giving a longer delay on the throwing of the projectile would also discourage Scouts from using it in a standard 1v1, making it only really effective when ambushing an enemy. The second change I recommend is making the Milk (and by extension other debuffs like Jarate and general Mark-for-Death) removable via Medic healing, similar to how Bleeding and Afterburn can be removed by the Cart, a Dispenser or a Med-beam. This would make throwing at groups of enemies less effective, and would allow Milked enemies to retreat to their Medic to be cleansed. The third change, and one that could potentially be difficult to implement, is to make the healing effect apply the same 'crit-healing' curve that the Medigun has. What this would mean is players who had not been recently damaged would heal the full 60% of damage dealt (or even more, maybe?), but players who had been damaged in the last 10 seconds would only heal 20%. This would prevent the 'roaming-Soldier-bombing-entire-enemy-team-and-being-basically-invincible' situation, and would also stop the weapon being an easy-win button in Scout 1v1s. It would still allow Scouts with crit heals active to get health back quickly, however, and would allow low-health Scouts to ambush enemies without instantly dying. **Atomiser** Prior to Jungle Inferno, this weapon was banned due to its ability to passively grant its user 2 mid-air jumps for no downside. The update removed this ability, requiring the weapon to be actively wielded to use the second mid-air jump. However, the update also added a buggy attribute: Mini-crits whilst airborne. This stat is intended to apply only to the Atomiser, but due to a bug, the mini-crits can be passed on to other weapons, [as seen in this video.](URL The weapon has remained banned due to its glitched state. The previous issue with the weapon (being able to jump twice in mid-air without any visible indication of being able to do so, and no real downside to balance the ability) has been fixed, so once the bug with the weapon is fixed, it will likely be unbanned. **Sandman** As covered in the Flying Guillotine section, the Sandman-Guillotine combo was extremely overpowered until it was removed in the Jungle Inferno update. Even by itself, the ability to render the enemy unable to attack, and prevent them from fleeing, with an insufficent downside (-15 max hp) was overpowered and irritating to fight and use. The weapon was reworked substantially in the Jungle Inferno update, and now only slows enemies (and damages them slightly). This means that it is no longer irritating to fight against, and is likely fit to be unbanned. **Soldier Weapons** **B.A.S.E. Jumper** I'm starting to sound like a broken record less than halfway through the post, but this weapon gave a very powerful ability before being reworked in Jungle Inferno. In this instance, the B.A.S.E. Jumper gave the ability to cancel ones' own momentum mid-air several times, similar to the Scout's mid-air jumps. The ability to redeploy the parachute in mid-air meant that a Soldier could dodge projectiles with ease. Again, this weapon was reworked in Jungle Inferno. It is no longer capable of redeploying in the air, so the Soldier using it is limited to 1 mid-air dodge at the most, at the cost of no Secondary weapon. As such the weapon seems balanced, if a little crutchy, and is probably ready to be unbanned now. **Reserve Shooter** This weapon was banned on Pyro for being a scourge on humanity, and was probably banned on Soldier because the inbuilt weapon banslist mechanic is bad. Post-Jungle Inferno, this weapon is terrible on Pyro and incredibly underwhelming on Soldier, and could use a complete rework. In its current state, it's arguable that it gives Soldiers who can reliably pop enemies into the air too much of an advantage, but doing so is difficult, and using the RS on popped-up enemies is potentially less effective than just firing another Rocket, so I argue that the weapon is not overpowered, and is in fact very underpowered and just bad. Suggested Change: Remove the mini-crits on airborne targets mechanic. Increase the switch speed boost to +50%, and give it slower reload speed. This makes it better as emergency switch-to weapon, but worse for continued combat, without encroaching too much on the recently redesigned Panic Attack. **Disciplinary Action** 'Rolling out' to mid at the start of the round is a time competitive players spend countless painful hours trying to perfect in order to give themselves that sweet, sweet half-a-second advantage over the enemy team. Teams co-ordinate heal orders, health-pack allocations and even explosive jumps in the pre-round freeze to maximise the effectiveness of their time and ensure that everyone arrives at mid as quickly as possible, with as much health as possible. The Disciplinary Action gives a big middle-finger to that, and allows the Soldier and one lucky ally to roll out quickly without explosive-jumping. Given that teams are allowed 2 Soldiers, and will generally have 2 Scouts as well, the Disciplinary Action could make complex rollouts defunct and significantly lower the skill level difference between a fantastic player and a god-like player. A smaller side-issue is that it allows a Pocket Soldier to escape from the enemy with the Medic with little risk. As such the weapon isn't *overpowered* per se, just very regressive and boring. Recommended change: Make the length of the speed-boost scale with the health of the player (as in, less health, you don't get boosted for as long. Reads each player's health separately when calculating boost times). This would make the weapon less amazing for rollouts (though still really good), and would prevent easy low-health escapes (that's what the Escape Plan is for). Admittedly this change probably wouldn't be completely effective, but it's better than nothing. **Pyro Weapons** **Reserve Shooter** This weapon was ludicrously overpowered on Pyro prior to Jungle Inferno. Now it's pretty bad, unless you're working with an ally Soldier, and even then it is very underwhelming. Go read the analysis of this weapon in the Soldier section if you want my rework idea. **Demoman Weapons** Currently no Demoman weapons are banned. The Loch-n-Load used to be banned, but after its +20% damage stat was changed to +20% damage vs buildings, it's become a weird crutchy weapon that isn't used much in competitive. **Heavy Weapons** (ha) **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** So apparently this is banned in 6s. The weapon gives the Heavy, a class balanced around slow movement, a way to roll-out slightly faster. However, the weapon does basically nothing for the Heavy after he rolls out, and costs him his Sandvich/Banana/Shotgun. I suppose people think this is overpowered. I don't think this weapon needs any changes. The changes in Jungle Inferno made it almost viable as a meme weapon, but it still doesn't match up to any of his other Secondaries in serious play. I guess they could make it take a bit longer to eat? **Fists of Steel** Before Jungle Inferno, an overhealed Heavy with the FoS active had an effective 750 Health, plus health regen. This made a Heavy a near invulnerable road-block if he was blocking the point. This was overpowered. The Jungle Inferno nerf of -40% max overheal and -40% healing from healers has made this strategy far less effective, and I personally believe the weapon is now suitable for unbanning. **Gloves of Running Urgently** Heavy is balanced around low movement speed, making him less effective at attacking than Soldier, Demoman and Scout. The GRU increases his movement speed when active by 30%, for a downside that, even after the Jungle Inferno update, doesn't really give much risk to using the weapon. The weapon is very overpowered, and if unbanned in its current state would be an instapick for all Heavies. Rather than nerf what makes the weapon interesting (more mobility), I believe the weapon should be made a dedicated highly-mobile flank-Heavy weapon, one that synergises well with the Tomislav and Second Banana. Suggested Change: Remove current downside. Replace with -50 max HP. Make Second Banana still regen 200 HP, though. This would discourage Heavies from running the weapon full-time, as a 250/375 HP Heavy would be unable to defend as easily, and would be less of a roadblock. The weapon would also potentially synergise with the Dalokohs Bar. **Eviction Notice** Ok, this one isn't actually banned in 6s, nor is it banned anywhere, but I'd like to see Valve treat this weapon as something other than just a mini-GRU. The current losing-max-health thing makes the weapon borderline useless, and is also buggy. Suggestion 1: Remove the instant removal of 20 max HP when switching to the EV. It is this mechanic that makes the small speed boost the weapon provides nearly inisgnificant, as the Heavy takes a long time to regain the lost health. Also fix the general bugginess of the mechanic (being able to go below 100 max HP, not regaining health from the resupply cabinet). Suggestion 2: Revert the weapon to pre-Jungle Inferno status. The weapon was fine as it was, it really didn't need anything done to it. Keep it as a distinctly different weapon to the GRU. Suggestion 3: Remove lose-max-health downside, replace with pre-JI GRU downsides of marked for death when wielded and for 2 seconds after switching away. Would discourage Heavies from using these whenever possible, and would also make the weapon funner in x10 (Not that that gamemode should be a consideration for weapon-balancing, I just wanted to mention it). **Engineer Weapons** **Rescue Ranger** This is the one I really wanted to talk about, because the Jungle Inferno nerf really rubbed me the wrong way. Firstly, the downsides to using the Rescue Ranger. The main one that discourages use in 12v12 is the loss of the Shotgun for self-defence. The Rescue Ranger has very poor offensive capabilities, and it is often run alongside the Wrangler, making a Sentryless Engineer very weak. However, Spies are uncommon in 6s, and if one does show up your teammates will usually deal with it for you, allowing you to simply focus on removing the Sapper and healing your building. Also worth mentioning that you are marked for death when moving a building, even if you didn't pick it up with the Rescue Ranger. This can be avoided by not moving through an enemy sightline carrying a building. The Rescue Ranger provided several great utilities to the Engineer. They were: * Healing buildings at range * Healing buildings actively taking splash damage without putting yourself in the firing line * Healing buildings for no metal * Picking up buildings at range for added mobility * Picking up buildings at range actively taking damage to rescue them from potential destruction Of these, 1, 3 and 4 are useful utilities that make the Engineer's life much easier, but do not have negative effects on the enemy players. However, the ability to heal or rescue a building (let's be real here, 99% of the time this will be your Sentry) when it is actively taking damage can completely stuff the enemy push by what is effectively standing in a safe place and pressing M1 or M2. When your Sentry is attacked by an Ubered Soldier, Demoman or even Heavy/Pyro, you have two options: * Move close to the Sentry and swing your wrench at the Sentry to repair it. You increase the chance of your Sentry surviving the push, but place your squishy 125 HP body in the firing line, and you may potentially die from splash or be intentionally focused down. * Keep your distance from the Sentry. Without repairs, your Sentry will likely go down, but you will be alive to build another Sentry, provided your team can deal with the enemy push. However, having the Rescue Ranger allows you to heal off 240 damage in a single clip, without putting yourself at risk of taking splash damage. It also allows you to rescue the Sentry to a safe place, wait for your team to deal with the enemy push, then simply place the Sentry back in place. The change in Jungle Inferno removed one of the good utilities of the weapon (free healing, which is of immense importance for metal conservation), but did not deal with the two issues with the weapon. The ability to rescue your Sentry when it is actively taking damage is powerful, but is also an integral part of the weapon's design/name. It also makes your Sentry unable to tank or do damage for at least 4 seconds, plenty of time for the enemy team to push into your team. However, I believe the ability to heal a building taking damage at range is far too powerful and irritating to fight. I suggest these changes: * Bring back the free healing. This wasn't a problem, removing this just made the weapon less fun to use. * If a buliding takes damage in the same tick it is healed by a RR bolt, it will receive 0 healing. The healing will increase as the time since last damage increases, reaching max healing at 2 seconds without taking damage. If a Demoman puts Stickies around your Sentry when it is low-health, you will still be able to boost its health to 216 before the Stickies detonate. If a Heavy/Pyro engages your Sentry, you will be unable to heal your building at range. Finally, if a Soldier spams your Sentry from range, you will need good timing to get the most of your bolts, and you will still be unable to tank it for very long. **Short Circuit** This weapon allows an Engineer to shut down enemy Soldiers/Demomen with relative ease. The weapon still relies on really good timing, which is a good start, but more needs to be done. The weapon is overpowered in the explosives-ridden 6s meta of double Soldier, one Demoman. My suggestion is a simple one: 25% increased damage vulnerability from Explosives. A highly skilled Engineer, like a highly skilled Pyro, will still be able to keep themselves safe from Grenades and Rockets, but a less skilled Engineer will be 1-shot by these explosives unless using the Gunslinger. And maybe decrease metal consumption of the primary attack, to compensate for the nerf. **Wrangler** The Wrangler is a common sight for defensive Engineers, due to its ability to reduce incoming damage to the Sentry, as well as increase the firing rate of the Sentry (Rockets moreso than Bullets). It also grants the Sentry limitless range, and can be used for an advanced mobility technique known as Wrangler-Jumping. The weapon is somewhat irritating to fight in a 12v12, but with several people focussing fire, even a 648 HP Sentry will go down quickly. In 6s, however, this is deemed far too powerful, and the weapon is banned. The limitless range is fine, and the increased attack speed isn't complained about much, so I guess that means it's fine too. Wrangler-jumping adds a skill-indexed level of play to the Engineer, increasing the skill ceiling, so there's no problem there. The problem stems from the -66% damage from all sources stat. It's simply far too strong, and allows the Sentry to take far too much damage. Suggestion 1: Flat reduction of the shield's power to -40% damage taken. The Sentry will now go down to 4 Rockets. Suggestion 2: Keep the shield at -66%, but after 5 seconds of being shielded have it slowly decrease to -20%, taking 10 seconds to do so. The shield should visually fade as this occurs. Suggestion 3: The shield starts weak, at -20%, but will build in strength the longer the Sentry is wrangled. Resets upon weapon switch, is not reset by Engineer death. Bonus Suggestion: more of a general Engineer buff that only comes into play when using the Wrangler, but give the Engineer some resistance to his own Sentry Rockets. -30% should do the trick. Should not affect airblast-reflected Rockets. **Southern Hospitality** Like the Eviction Notice, this weapon isn't actually banned in 6s (or any league, for that matter). Most unlockable melees for the Engineer have a massive change on the way the class plays. The Gunslinger makes you a Battle Engi, less reliant on your Sentry and more reliant on your Shotgun. The Jag makes you better at erecting and upgrading buildings quicker, but makes keeping them alive harder. The Eureka Effect allows you to teleport around the map, but makes erecting buildings harder when not utilising the teleport ability. Then there's the Southern Hospitality, with its ability to make enemies bleed for a couple seconds when you hit them, but you die a bit faster from Pyros. Riveting stuff Long-term, the SH needs a full rework, but short-term, the addition of a single stat would give it a use: Guaranteed Critical Hits when Explosive Jumping. This would make it the dedicated 'Market Pardnering' weapon. Pulling off a Wrangler-jump-into-melee-hitting-an-enemy manoeuvre is difficult to do, usually results in your death immediately afterwards, and only has an ~30% chance of working anyway (due to relying on random crits). With the Southern Hospitality, you would be rewarded with guaranteed 195 damage melee swings, plus some extra damage from bleeding, allowing you to secure kills on enemy Soldiers not even an ally Soldier could get. **Medic Weapons** **Quick-Fix** The Quick-Fix offers, relative to the Medigun, 40% faster healing and faster Uber build, along with the ability to mirror ally explosive jumps, at the cost of 50% less Overheal and an overall less effective Uber. In 12v12, it is the dedicated 'my team is bad and we only have 1 medic' weapon due to its faster base healing and ability to act as an emergency triage when Uber has been built. In 6s, it is very difficult to output enough raw DPS to slay a Quickfix-Ubered enemy due to the general lack of Heavies and Sentries in the format, and the immunity to knockback prevents a Pyro from neutering the Uber push. The mirroring of explosive jumps allows the team to run 1 or even 2 off-classers during the mid-fight, as the Medic can rollout with the Demoman. The only real downside in the format is the -50% maximum overheal, which is not enough to justify using a different weapon. As such, the weapon is banned. I've spent a while trying to think of ways to make the Quick-Fix not OP in 6s without decreasing its effectiveness in 12v12, and I haven't been able to come up with anything. Maybe -100% max overheal, no increased Uber build, and +50% healing rate? **Vaccinator** The Vaccinator has long been a sticking point in the balance of the game. The ability to give allies resistance to certain damage types is very powerful in the right hands. In 12v12, the Vaccinator sees most of its use as a 'the enemy team has a spinning Sniper and they won't kick it' weapon, or as a stop to a pub-stomping Soldier or Demoman. The weapon is very underwhelming on large teams where resisting 1 damage type isn't very helpful, and becomes more and more powerful as team size decreases. As such the weapon is kind of balanced in Highlander, OP in 6s, extraordinarily, ridiculously OP in 4v4, and an instant-win button in Ultiduo (2v2, 1 Soldier and 1 Medic per team). This is a problem in Competitive, but is also a problem in Casual, where teamsize isn't always guaranteed to be 12v12. My idea is to completely rework the weapon. Throw out all existing stats and start again. The weapon relies on teamsize and team composition to be balanced, and so is fundamentally broken. I suggest the Vaccinator be repurposed as the dedicated 'Overhealing' Medigun. Thematically, it works by giving the player's immune system more grunt to fight an infection, rather than making it better at fighting a specific infection. In general terms, the Vaccinator would function as a mildly less effective Medigun until it builds Uber. When the Medic using it builds Uber, they gain the temporary ability to grant 200% Overheal to allies. However, the Uber would be short and only suited for Overhealing two allies. To prevent players just pocketing one ally, it should have 50% less Uber build on an overhealed ally, and 90% less Uber on an ally over 142.5% health (I think that's when the stock medigun starts building Uber slower). As for stats, these are what I recommend: -10% healing rate on damaged allies, +20% healing rate on Overhealed allies. +25% Uber build rate, but -25% Uber duration. When Ubering, the Medigun heals damaged allies at the same rate the stock Medigun does, but heals Overhealed allies at double the rate. The Medic will also gain a small amount of Overheal when using the Uber (could decay much slower?). -50% Uber build on full health or Overhealed allies, -90% Uber build on allies over 142.5% health. Allies healed over 150% health cannot be healed by anything other than a Vaccinator currently using Uber until they have dropped below 150% health. **Solemn Vow** The Solemn Vow allows you to see the health of enemies. On a co-ordinated team, this is a very powerful passive ability with no real downside, other than that it isn't the Ubersaw. Suggestion 1: The Medic can only see enemy health when actively wielding the Solemn Vow. This means the Medic cannot heal teammates whilst doing so, and cannot quickly snipe a low-health enemy with the Crossbow. Suggestion 2: Remove -10% swing speed, give -10 max HP. Gain a good passive upside, get hit with a bad passive downside. **Vita-Saw** Pre-Jungle Inferno, this weapon would force the enemy Medic to run it if your ally Medic was using it. It passively made you recover up to 20% Uber after death, allowing you to potentially build Uber faster than the enemy. The -10 max HP penalty hurt, and was usually enough to discourage players from using it, but it still saw some use. However, the Jungle Inferno update reworked it, adding an 'Organ Harvesting' ability. Technically the weapon is bugged, as firing needles at an enemy then switching to the VS before they hit will produce a shower of Organs, but it's a visual error not worth banning the weapon over. In its' current state, the weapon feels like a less useful Ubersaw that could still go well if your team is fine with Kamikaze Medic-for-Medic trades. I recommend replacing the -10 max HP with -20% swing speed. **Sniper Weapons** **Machina** Whilst not currently banned, the Machina is often banned, due to its ability to penetrate players. This means that a team cannot use their own bodies to prevent their Medic from being sniped. Even though the weapon is unbanned at the moment, the reasons for banning it still exist. I recommend the following stat: Enemies hit by the Machina bolt who are not the first target hit will take 20% less damage from bodyshots. This would mean that it could do a maximum of 139 damage to secondary targets. **Darwin's Danger Shield** The Darwin's Danger Shield used to be one of the two weapons (the other being the Vita-Saw) that forced the enemy to use it if your team was using it. A DDS Sniper could tank a quick-scope headshot, thanks to an extra 25 max HP and a 20% resistance to bullets. As such the weapon was anticompetitive and was banned. Jungle Inferno reworked the weapon to grant immunity to Afterburn, and reduce direct damage from fire by 50%. As such the weapon is no longer an instant-win in Sniper duels, and is ready to be unbanned. **Jarate** Mini-crits are a powerful ability that usually allow a player to easily defeat an opponent in competitive. The ability to Mark an Enemy for Death is even more powerful, giving mini-crits to teammates who may be in a better position to utilise them. Jarate, with its large splash radius, is capable of giving everyone on your team minicrits against everyone on the enemy team. It also makes 1v1s against enemy non-Snipers less likely to result in your embarassing death, as the large splash radius is basically impossible to dodge. Similar to the Mad Milk, I recommend reducing the splash radius, and making the effect able to be removed via Medigun healing. To increase its supportive ability, maybe make it reduce its cooldown by 50% when extinguishing allies, or have it use a larger splash radius for deciding whether to extinguish allies or not. **Sydney Sleeper** The Sydney Sleeper has the ability to apply Jarate to multiple enemies via the Jarate explosion function. This has the same issue as Jarate. I recommend reducing the splash radius, making it removable via Medigun healing. Maybe make it charge a little faster, or apply Jarate for longer. **Spy Weapons** Currently no Spy weapons are banned. **Cosmetics and Taunts** Interestingly, some Cosmetic items are deemed to give an unfair advantage to the wearer. Most notably, the Bombinomicon is not allowed, as the explode-on-death mechanic makes alerting your team to an enemy who has just killed you slightly easier and faster. Taunts that can be cancelled at any time are also banned, as they give the user the ability to enter 3rd person and leave it at will. Cosmetic bans could be a hard sell, but simply banning cosmetics that produce sound or particle effects should do the trick. Even more extreme, Valve could ban all non-head cosmetics from competitive. Taunt bans would be easy, just disable partner/group taunts outside of setup time, or even ban all non-weapon-specific taunts. To conclude: Valve has made huge strides in closing the rift between casual and competitive, but there are still several issues that need to be addressed prior to the release of the upcoming reboot to their official competitive mode."
163,vulnerability,tf2,My idea for a Southern Hospitality rework.,19,7dw592,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7dw592/my_idea_for_a_southern_hospitality_rework/,2017-11-19 09:07:49,"The bleeding mechanic is kinda meh (plus I don't like to get too close to Spies in case they do know how to abuse hitboxes trickstab), and the fire vulnerability doesn't really matter since Sentries will shred an unaware Pyro before he can get to you (unless he Ubers in or uses flares), and if you're caught out alone against a Pyro, you're probably gonna die with or without the vulnerability. So I was thinking of this: I want to keep it as an anti-Spy weapon, but without the risks involved with going into melee combat with a competent Spy. So for starters, we remove the bleed on hit stat and the fire vulnerability, but we give it the ability to remove Sappers in a single hit. Buildings that are sapped take 50% less damage from the Spy that sapped it, meaning the old ""sap-and-shoot"" technique is harder to do. In addition, removing a Sapper with this weapon will deal a small amount of damage to the Spy that placed it (about 15 damage or so) which discourages Sapper spam by the Spy, or encourages him to take out the Engineer before going to sap. However, removing the Sapper costs 15 metal."

But I feel like it has too strong of an upside for a almost unnoticeable downside (10% isn't really that much, a Heavy will still shred you at close range, quickscope headshots still can't kill you, and a Scout can still two-shot you at close range). This is what I suggest should be done, while still keeping the +1 cap rate. 1) Give it to the Pyro. It was originally intended for the Pyro, so why not? 2) Make it useful outside of CP and Payload maps too. Give the wearer a speed boost when they carry the intel in CTF or Special Delivery. 3) Remove the constant 10% bullet vulnerability and replace it with a 20% total damage vulnerability while capturing control points, pushing the cart, or carrying the intelligence."

Yep, the only downside was that it could not randomly crit. So it's basically a straight updgrade, right? Well random crits on a melee weapon is actually quite a big thing. Melees crit like hell, but in a situation where crits are turned off it is a straight upgrade. Though it's honestly not that much, especially compared to pre nerf axtinguisher. The damage bonus and health on kill only really apply for meleeing which isn't that useful on pyro and relies on killing without random crits. *Final Tally: 4* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 2: Hatless Update** (+) +75 health on kill. (-) +20% melee damage vulnerability while active. So to understand the damage vulnerability you have to remember that the powerjack was in a set that gave +10% speed for -10% bullet vulnerability. Though how good is this weapon? Eh.... You get a good amount of health on kill and it's easier to do so with crits enabled. The melee vulnerability doesn't really add too much and is honestly less of a downside than no random crits. *Final Tally: 3.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Current Design: July 10 2013 Patch / Gun Mettle** (+) +15% move speed while active. (+) +75 health on kill (reduced to 25). (-) -20% damage vulnerability while active. Ah yes the current powerjack. You move fast but die fast. The problem is that you can holster it quickly to dodge incoming damage. Also if you use it for rollouts, there's no worry about damage. *Final Tally: 4* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Average Tally: 3.75* So it went from straight upgrade but still only could compare to the axtinguisher because it was part of a set bonus, to kind of awkward, to pretty much pyro's best melee. Cool."
170,vulnerability,tf2,The most irritating part about the Dead Ringer is the speed boost,24,7k1rk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7k1rk1/the_most_irritating_part_about_the_dead_ringer_is/,2017-12-16 05:55:55,"Don't get me wrong, the spamability of the watch to just tank damage was incredibly annoying, but it was (in a loose sense) fair. If you triggered the watch (before they added the speed boost), you could easily hunt down the spy because you know how fast he moves, and where he's likely to go. However, since the speed boost was given on activation of the watch, it's become more annoying to fight against. Not only is the spy invisible, he's running very fast, making it harder to predict exactly where the spy is. I understand why this is a thing, the Dead Ringer supposed to be more of an escape weapon, but the combination of high speed + invisibility is much more annoying to fight whether you're a seasoned veteran or a new player. If I were to rework the watch, it would look something like this: The Dead Ringer +Grants 75% initial damage reduction, and crit immunity for 2 seconds on activating hit +40% cloak regen rate +50% cloak duration +Makes collisions with enemies while cloaked ""soft"" (Similar to when you collide with a teammate) -50% cloak when activated -25% damage vulnerability while cloak is not at 100% What this does (or what I hope it would do) is bring back the more agressive playstyle that the old Dead Ringer had, without being as irritating to fight against. Rather than making the Ringer a ""run away"" tool, increasing the duration of the cloak, reducing the regeneration rate, and making collisions soft lets spy much more successfully penetrate enemy lines. Once behind the enemy lines, however, is spy is very vulnerable while his cloak regenerates. This can be offset by using weapons such as the Big Earner or L'Etranger, except both weapons would be much more risky to use as the L'Etranger does less damage (and therefore gives the enemy more time to take advantage of your 25% damage vulnerability), while the Big Earner gives you -25 max health, which when paired with the damage vulnerability could spell death with one or two well placed rockets. What do you think?"

Stars are earned by completing objectives. - Contracts can be turned-in once the Primary Objective is complete - Partially completed Contracts can be reactivated, for tree, at any time - Party members who are on the same server and same team can now help earn progress on each other's Contracts # GAMEPLAY CHANGES ### MULTI-CLASS **Panic Attack** - This is one of our least-used weapons. The main culprit seems to be the queued,'delayed-tire aspect, which tights against the basic concept of the secondary slot on classes that can use this weapon (Soldier, Heavy, Engineer, Pyro); players generally expect a secondary that is immediately ready to fire - tor the rare case where their main weapon isn't available (e.g. out of ammo), or isn't the optimal choice (e.g. airborne, too close, etc.). Removing the queued/delayed-fire concept basically invalidates the original design, so we've started over. - Goal: Make the weapon immediately usable, remove the large burst potential (generally hard to balance), and give the weapon a unique design space to occupy - New design: - 50% taster switch speed - 50% more pellets - 30% less damage - Fires a wide, fixed shot pattern (regardless ot server settings) - Shot pattern grows with successive shots (e.g. while holding down the attack button), but resets after you stop tiring or reload **Reserve Shooter** - Pyros are too easily able to take advantage of this weapon's primary feature via airblast (i.e. no-penalty, on-demand launching of their target), and so their damage-potential can greatly exceed that of the other classes that also use this weapon. Rather than take a heavier-handed approach to solve this, we've instead decided to remove airblast as a source tor mini-crits - Attacks on targets Knocked into the air by Pyro airblast no longer mini-crit - Added: Attacks on targets flying via the Thermal Thruster mini-crit ### SPY **Ambassador** - Players that are head-shot from across the map are expecting to see a Sniper in their death-cam, but they sometimes see (more often that we'd like) a Spy with a revolver - Goal: Reduce the effective combat range to something more reasonable and expected with the Spy changes: - Headshot damage is now subjected to distance falloff effects - Headshots beyond 1200 world units do normal (non-crit) damage **Dead Ringer** - Feign death is an interesting effect, but a good Spy can use it extremely frequently making it frustrating to play against and reducing the risk of using it nearly constantly - Goal: Rather than make it less interesting, let's make it more predictable to fight against by removing methods by which Spies can reduce its cool-down. This should create more of a rhythm to fighting against a Spy using this and introduce a little more risk to player using it. - Changes: - Ammo kits and dispensers no longer refill the Spy's cloak meter **Your Eternal Reward** - This is the least-used Spy knife (technically, the reskin is, but anyway...). While silent-kill and rapid-disguise-on-kill are good, the downside on this knife is extreme. - Changes: - Removed: ""Cannot disguise"" penalty - Added: Non-kill disguises require (and consume) a full cloak meter - Backstab-based disguises are still free - Increased cloak drain rate by 33% ### SCOUT **Sandman** - The feedback on this weapon has been fairly consistent for a while: Players really hate losing the ability to fight back. Compounding this, the ball has to travel really far in order to disarm players. Being hit by a long-range ball (more often than not) ends up feeling random, rather than skilled. - Changes: - Long-range ball impacts no longer remove the victim's ability to fire their weapon (but the victim is still slowed) - We've updated achievements that were looking for disarmed players - Max range balls now do 50% increased damage (from a base of 15) - The flight time required to trigger the ""max"" effect has been reduced by 20% - Ball regeneration time reduced to 10 seconds (from 15) **Bonk! Atomic Punch** - This weapon was designed to allow Scouts to pierce hotly-contested areas. While it does this quite well, it doesn't require enough skill, or carry much of a down-side. - Changes: - Apply a slow effect to the player after phasing wears off, based on the amount of damage they absorbed - From -25% at low damage, to -50% at 200+ damage - Lasts 5 seconds **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** - This weapon is one of the lower owner-equipped items in the game. Looking at the current design, it seems that not taking falling damage ranks pretty low on the value scale for a Scout, and a flat +20% damage taken penalty is basically the kiss-of-death for a low-health class. - Goal: Make the weapon less of a liability and focus it as a ""get health quick"" tool with decent burst, at the expense of total damage - New design: - +15% firing speed - Up to +7 hp per hit (from +5) - -25% clip size (9 shots) **Crit-A-Cola** - The last change to this item added Marked-For-Death when the effect ended. This was okay because it forced Scouts to get out after a little while, but it didn't add any risk in-the-moment. - Goal: Add more decision/thought on when/where to activate and how to manage the risk/reward of the effect - Changes: - Added: Each attack while active adds marked-For-Death debuff for 5 seconds (does not stack) - Removed: marked-For-Death when effect expires - Removed: +25% move speed bonus - Removed: +10% damage taken penalty **The Atomizer** - Triple-jump as a passive effect is just too strong. It makes combat against the Scout unpredictable because opponents don't see the bat, and therefore have a hard time anticipating the Scout's capabilities until late in an encounter. It also makes the Scout very strong against explosive classes - due to a combination of extreme mobility and high close-range damage. - Goal: Require the Scout to deploy the bat to take advantage of the extra jump - which is also is a signal to other players that they can perform an extra jump - and reduce the bat's negatives to compensate - Changes: - Triple-jump is now only possible while the bat is deployed - Removed: self-inflicted damage when triple-jumping - Removed: Attack speed penalty - Added: Melee attacks done while airborne mini-crit - Added: 50% deploy time penalty (to prevent quick-switch bypass) - Reduced damage penalty vs players to -15% (from -20%) **Flying Guillotine** - This weapon is capable of high burst-damage under what sometimes seems like random conditions - such as mini-crits at long-range, and full-crits when the target is slowed or stunned by anything (eg Ghost ""Boo!"" effect, Natascha, etc.) - Goal: Remove the feeling of randomness, and reward accuracy - Changes: - Removed: Crit vs stunned players - Removed: Mini-crits at long range - Added: Long range hits reduce recharge (by 1.5 seconds) - Distance considered ""long range"" reduced by half of previous value when determining mini-crits ### SOLDIER **B.A.S.E Jumper** - Players often complain that the BASE Jumper is frustrating to fight against because the target is simply too hard to hit. This is mostly due to the combination of being able to deploy/retract at will, and the amount of steering control they have - which makes them too unpredictable. - Changes: - Reduced amount of air control while deployed by 50% - Removed the ability to re-deploy the parachute once retracted (until the player lands on the ground again) **Mantreads** - The second least-used item in the game. The aerial stomp mini-game is difficult, and The Gunboats are superior in most scenarios. - Changes: - +75% push-force reduction now includes airblast - Added: +200% air control when blast jumping **Cow Mangler 5000** - Removed: Cannot be Crit boosted - Granted/earned Crits (e.g. Kritzkrieg) will be converted to Mini-Crits instead **Righteous Bison** - Note: This weapon has been reverted to its previous design - Deals 20 damage per tick (down from 45) - Note: This is necessary because the projectile is no longer limited on the number of times it can hit targets - Projectiles are no longer limited on the number of times they can hit the same target(s) - Projectile velocity increased to 1200 (from 840) ### SNIPER **Darwin's Danger shield** - Snipers using this item had an advantage against Snipers who weren't. As a result, players felt like they were required to equip this item in order to be competitive. - Goal: Remove the increased survivability against enemy Snipers (which invalidates the existing design). - New design: - Counter ranged burn attacks (e.g. flares), and strengthen melee fights vs Pyros - Afterburn immunity - +50% fire resist **Razorback** - Goal: Reduce the effectiveness of ""pocket'd"" Snipers in stalemates/standoffs (this primarily happens in organized/competitive play) - Changes: - Added: -100% overheal penalty - Added: shield regenerates after 30 seconds ### MEDIC **Vita-Saw** - Ubercharge on death is too valuable of an effect to be passive - Goal: change the weapon in a way that requires skill and risk in order to gain this effect - Changes: - Added ""Organs"" collecting concept (...you know, hit someone with a saw, and out pops a vital organ which you then take, and hold). Each hit with the Vita-Saw harvests the victim's organs (shown on the HUD). - Added: On-death, preserve 15% ubercharge per Organ harvested. This effect caps at 60%. **Crusader's Crossbow** - Bolt healing is very high and significantly out-heals the Medigun when the target is in combat. This might be okay given the trade offs (risk-vs-reward of ranged shots hitting and the opportunity cost, no overheal). However, it's also the fastest way to build Ubercharge - under the right conditions (e.g. corner damage farming with the medic behind cover). - Changes: - Ubercharge gain rate reduced in the same way that the medigun's healing (and therefore, ubercharge build rate) is - based on the last time the target was in combat - Reduced by a third when 1 - 10 seconds outside of combat, and scales up to normal over 10 - 15 seconds ### HEAVY **All Miniguns** - Changes: - The 1-second damage and accuracy penalty now applies to the first second of spun-up time, whether or not the Heavy is firing. Previously the 1 second damage penalty would only be removed after 1 second of firing. - Accuracy and damage penalties now reset when the Heavy spins down, rather than when the Heavy stops firing. This means if you stay spun-up beyond one second, and fire in bursts, damage and accuracy will remain at 100%. **Gloves of Running Urgently** - Speed (lack-of) is used to balance the Heavy's high health, over-heal and damage output. While we still believe It's OK to have a class of items that increases Heavy's movement speed, players have been able to easily bypass the existing negatives. - Changes: - Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-10/sec), and regenerated while holstered - Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time - Each time the gloves are deployed, the drain rate is accelerated for a brief period of time - Removed: Marked-For-Death effect while active - Removed: 25% damage penalty **Eviction Notice** - Changes: - Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-5/sec), and regenerated while holstered. Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time. - Removed: 20% damage vulnerability **Fists of Steel** - The downside of ""increased melee damage"" doesn't ever really come into play when it counts (e.g. holding a choke point or objective), and when a Medic is attached, the resulting pool of effective health is unreasonably large - Changes: - Added: 40% overheal reduction while active - Added: 40% healing rate penalty while active **Added The second Banana** - Secondary slot item - When consumed by the Heavy, restores 200 health - Acts like a small health kit when dropped by the Heavy and picked up by another player - Item regenerates after 10 seconds ### ENGINEER **Rescue Ranger** - The ability to repair buildings safely from range without using metal is powerful. Combine this with the ability to instantly teleport buildings from far away - which by itself is interesting and useful enough in many circumstances - and you end up with a package that is very strong. - Changes: - Ranged repairs now consume metal (at a 4-to-1 health-to-metal ratio, e g. repairing 60 damage costs 15 metal) - Doubled the amount of metal applied (per wrench hit) when upgrading buildings during the ""Setup"" period. ### DEMO **Claidheamh Mor** - Note: This weapon has been reverted to its previous design. - Removed: +25 health on kill - Added: 0.5 second Increase in charge duration ### PYRO **Added The Dragon's Fury** - Primary slot item - Uses a shared pressure tank for Primary Fire and Alt-Fire - Primary Fire Launches a fast-moving, limited-range projectile that deals 25 damage and briefly ignites enemies - Deals +300% damage to burning players - +50% repressurization rate on hit - Alt-Fire: Airblast - -50% repressurization rate on Alt-Fire **Added The Thermal Thruster** - Secondary slot item - Fires a short-duration blast that launches the Pyro in the direction they are aiming - Deals 3x failing damage to anyone you land on - Has a 1.1 second holster duration - Mann vs Machine upgrades: - Able to re-launch while airborne - Stun enemies when you land (duration based on impact velocity) - Note: Landing directly on an enemy grants a bonus to stun duration - Faster recharge rate **Added The Gas Passer** - Secondary slot item - Creates a horrific visible gas cloud that coats enemies - Flammable material then ignites into 10 seconds of Afterburn if enemies take damage (even Pyros!) - Mann vs Machine upgrades: - Enemies explode when ignited by attacks - Faster recharge rate **Added The Slap Attack** - Gain a speed-boost when you hit an enemy player - -20% damage penalty - Every successful slap is announced in the kill-feed **Flamethrowers** - Better visual sync, more consistent (no visuals/damage mismatch) - New particle effects - Applies to all flamethrower variants **Airblast** - Hit detection for both players and projectiles is now a consistent cone - Aiming at a player's feet no longer misses! - Airblasting players now factors in the momentum of the Pyro and target, giving both more control over the interaction - The target's existing velocity is no longer cancelled - Players moving at the Pyro at great speed will be reflected away at great speed - Players moving towards/away from the Pyro will experience less/more push force - Airblast now causes target player to have reduced footing and air control for a short period - No longer a flat stun - Now factors in the upward angle of the airblast, rather than having a fixed upward force - Total push force slightly increased **Afterburn** - Flamethrowers no longer apply maximum-duration afterburn on contact. Afterburn duration is now based on how long the target is in contact with direct flames  starting at a minimum of 3 seconds, and stacking to a maximum of 10 seconds - Per-tick Afterburn damage increased to 4 (from 3), for a total of 8 damage per-second (up from 6 per-second) - Flareguns now apply 7.5 seconds of afterburn (down from 10 seconds), resulting in the same total damage as before - Afterburn now reduces all direct medic healing and resist shields by 20% - Note: This effect was previously applied by direct flames from all flamethrowers (at 25%), but was moved to afterburn, and slightly lowered *** Rumor has it: * **Please give a round of applause to both /u/xPaw and /u/medli20 (and /u/Bobsplosion) for their OCR magic!** * **This MAJOR update finally brings an end to the record longest drought that has lasted since 12/21/16 (Smissmas 2016), with the last non-seasonal update having occurred on 7/7/16** * For reference, here's a comparison of some long waits: * The wait for Jungle Update was exactly 9 months and 29 days since Smissmas 2016, or 1 year, 3 months and 13 days since Meet Your Match * The wait for a reworked de_dust2 in CS:GO took 1 year and 5 days * The wait for AMD Vega took exactly 1 year, 4 months, 16 days, 3 hours and 15 minutes, and then some for retail availability * The wait for what would eventually be Windows Vista took 5 years, 3 months and 5 days (or 2 years, 5 months and 3 days due to XP SP2 and the Longhorn reset) * **Do you happen to be fluent (or near-fluent) in another non-English language?** If so, consider signing up for [the Steam Translation Server](URL to help [translate the ~600 strings](URL added in this update * Here's the *mammoth* GameTracking diff, containing HUD file updates, strings, and a whole lot more: URL * Size is ~1.2 GB - data capped users should have their preparations in place"

It's up to you to decide which ones to work on and in what order to work on them. You can now make progress on Bonus Objectives while working towards completing your Primary Objective Only one Contract can be active at a time Contracts are now unlocked by spending Stars. Stars are earned by completing objectives. Contracts can be turned-in once the Primary Objective is complete Partially completed Contracts can be reactivated, for free, at any time Party members who are on the same server and same team can now help earn progress on each other's Contracts Gameplay Changes Multi-class Panic Attack This is one of our least-used weapons. The main culprit seems to be the queued/delayed-fire aspect, which fights against the basic concept of the secondary slot on classes that can use this weapon (Soldier, Heavy, Engineer, Pyro); players generally expect a secondary that is immediately ready to fire - for the rare case where their main weapon isn't available (e.g. out of ammo), or isn't the optimal choice (e.g. airborne, too close, etc.). Removing the queued/delayed-fire concept basically invalidates the original design, so we've started over. Goal: Make the weapon immediately usable, remove the large burst potential (generally hard to balance), and give the weapon a unique design space to occupy New design: 50% faster switch speed 50% more pellets 30% less damage Fires a wide, fixed shot pattern (regardless of server settings) Shot pattern grows with successive shots (e.g. while holding down the attack button), but resets after you stop firing or reload Reserve Shooter Pyros are too easily able to take advantage of this weapon's primary feature via airblast (i.e. no-penalty, on-demand launching of their target), and so their damage-potential can greatly exceed that of the other classes that also use this weapon. Rather than take a heavier-handed approach to solve this, we've instead decided to remove airblast as a source for mini-crits. Attacks on targets knocked into the air by Pyro airblast no longer mini-crit Added: Attacks on targets flying via the Thermal Thruster mini-crit Spy Ambassador Players that are head-shot from across the map are expecting to see a Sniper in their death-cam, but they sometimes see (more often that we'd like) a Spy with a revolver Goal: Reduce the effective combat range to something more reasonable and expected with the Spy Changes: Headshot damage is now subjected to distance falloff effects Headshots beyond 1200 world units do normal (non-crit) damage Dead Ringer Feign death is an interesting effect, but a good Spy can use it extremely frequently making it frustrating to play against and reducing the risk of using it nearly constantly Goal: Rather than make it less interesting, let's make it more predictable to fight against by removing methods by which Spies can reduce its cool-down. This should create more of a rhythm to fighting against a Spy using this and introduce a little more risk to player using it. Changes: Ammo kits and dispensers no longer refill the Spy's cloak meter Your Eternal Reward This is the least-used Spy knife (technically, the reskin is, but anyway...). While silent-kill and rapid-disguise-on-kill are good, the downside on this knife is extreme. Changes: Removed: ""Cannot disguise"" penalty Added: Non-kill disguises require (and consume) a full cloak meter Backstab-based disguises are still free Increased cloak drain rate by 33% Scout Sandman The feedback on this weapon has been fairly consistent for a while: Players really hate losing the ability to fight back. Compounding this, the ball has to travel really far in order to disarm players. Being hit by a long-range ball (more often than not) ends up feeling random, rather than skilled. Changes: Long-range ball impacts no longer remove the victim's ability to fire their weapon (but the victim is still slowed) We've updated achievements that were looking for disarmed players Max range balls now do 50% increased damage (from a base of 15) The flight time required to trigger the ""max"" effect has been reduced by 20% Ball regeneration time reduced to 10 seconds (from 15) Bonk! Atomic Punch This weapon was designed to allow Scouts to pierce hotly-contested areas. While it does this quite well, it doesn't require enough skill, or carry much of a down-side. Changes: Apply a slow effect to the player after phasing wears off, based on the amount of damage they absorbed From -25% at low damage, to -50% at 200+ damage Lasts 5 seconds Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol This weapon is one of the lower owner-equipped items in the game. Looking at the current design, it seems that not taking falling damage ranks pretty low on the value scale for a Scout, and a flat +20% damage taken penalty is basically the kiss-of-death for a low-health class. Goal: Make the weapon less of a liability and focus it as a ""get health quick"" tool with decent burst, at the expense of total damage New design: +15% firing speed Up to +7 hp per hit (from +5) -25% clip size (9 shots) Crit-A-Cola The last change to this item added Marked-For-Death when the effect ended. This was okay because it forced Scouts to get out after a little while, but it didn't add any risk in-the-moment. Goal: Add more decision/thought on when/where to activate and how to manage the risk/reward of the effect Changes: Added: Each attack while active adds Marked-For-Death debuff for 5 seconds (does not stack) Removed: Marked-For-Death when effect expires Removed: +25% move speed bonus Removed: +10% damage taken penalty The Atomizer Triple-jump as a passive effect is just too strong. It makes combat against the Scout unpredictable because opponents don't see the bat, and therefore have a hard time anticipating the Scout's capabilities until late in an encounter. It also makes the Scout very strong against explosive classes - due to a combination of extreme mobility and high close-range damage. Goal: Require the Scout to deploy the bat to take advantage of the extra jump - which is also is a signal to other players that they can perform an extra jump - and reduce the bat's negatives to compensate Changes: Triple-jump is now only possible while the bat is deployed Removed: Self-inflicted damage when triple-jumping Removed: Attack speed penalty Added: Melee attacks done while airborne mini-crit Added: 50% deploy time penalty (to prevent quick-switch bypass) Reduced damage penalty vs players to -15% (from -20%) Flying Guillotine This weapon is capable of high burst-damage under what sometimes seems like random conditions - such as mini-crits at long-range, and full-crits when the target is slowed or stunned by anything (e.g. Ghost ""Boo!"" effect, Natascha, etc.) Goal: Remove the feeling of randomness, and reward accuracy Changes: Removed: Crit vs stunned players Removed: Mini-crits at long range Added: Long range hits reduce recharge (by 1.5 seconds) Distance considered ""long range"" reduced by half of the previous value when determining mini-crits Soldier B.A.S.E Jumper Players often complain that the B.A.S.E. Jumper is frustrating to fight against because the target is simply too hard to hit. This is mostly due to the combination of being able to deploy/retract at will, and the amount of steering control they have - which makes them too unpredictable. Changes: Reduced amount of air control while deployed by 50% Removed the ability to re-deploy the parachute once retracted (until the player lands on the ground again) Mantreads The second least-used item in the game. The aerial stomp mini-game is difficult, and The Gunboats are superior in most scenarios. Changes: +75% push-force reduction now includes airblast Added: +200% air control when blast jumping Cow Mangler 5000 Removed: Cannot be Crit boosted Granted/earned Crits (e.g. Kritzkrieg) will be converted to Mini-Crits instead Righteous Bison Note: This weapon has been reverted to its previous design Deals 20 damage per tick (down from 45) Note: This is necessary because the projectile is no longer limited on the number of times it can hit targets Projectiles are no longer limited on the number of times they can hit the same target(s) Projectile velocity increased to 1200 (from 840) Sniper Darwin's Danger Shield Snipers using this item had an advantage against Snipers who weren't. As a result, players felt like they were required to equip this item in order to be competitive. Goal: Remove the increased survivability against enemy Snipers (which invalidates the existing design). New design: Counter ranged burn attacks (e.g. flares), and strengthen melee fights vs Pyros Afterburn immunity +50% fire resist Razorback Goal: Reduce the effectiveness of ""pocket'd"" Snipers in stalemates/standoffs (this primarily happens in organized/competitive play) Changes: Added: -100% overheal penalty Added: Shield regenerates after 30 seconds Medic Vita-Saw Ubercharge on death is too valuable of an effect to be passive Goal: Change the weapon in a way that requires skill and risk in order to gain this effect Changes: Added ""Organs"" collecting concept (... you know, hit someone with a saw, and out pops a vital organ which you then take, and hold). Each hit with the Vita-Saw harvests the victim's organs (shown on the HUD). Added: On-death, preserve 15% ubercharge per Organ harvested. This effect caps at 60%. Crusader's Crossbow Bolt healing is very high and significantly out-heals the Medigun when the target is in combat. This might be okay given the trade-offs (risk-vs-reward of ranged shots hitting and the opportunity cost, no overheal). However, it's also the fastest way to build Ubercharge - under the right conditions (e.g. corner damage farming with the Medic behind cover). Changes: Ubercharge gain rate reduced in the same way that the Medigun's healing (and therefore, Ubercharge build rate) is - based on the last time the target was in combat Reduced by a third when 1 - 10 seconds outside of combat, and scales up to normal over 10 - 15 seconds Heavy All Miniguns Changes: The 1-second damage and accuracy penalty now applies to the first second of spun-up time, whether or not the Heavy is firing. Previously, the 1-second damage penalty would only be removed after 1 second of firing. Accuracy and damage penalties now reset when the Heavy spins down, rather than when the Heavy stops firing. This means if you stay spun-up beyond one second, and fire in bursts, damage and accuracy will remain at 100%. Gloves of Running Urgently Speed (lack-of) is used to balance the Heavy's high health, over-heal and damage output. While we still believe it's OK to have a class of items that increases Heavy's movement speed, players have been able to easily bypass the existing negatives. Changes: Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-10/sec), and regenerated while holstered Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time Each time the gloves are deployed, the drain rate is accelerated for a brief period of time Removed: Marked-For-Death effect while active Removed: 25% damage penalty Eviction Notice Changes: Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-5/sec), and regenerated while holstered. Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time. Removed: 20% damage vulnerability Fist of Steel The downside of ""increased melee damage"" doesn't ever really come into play when it counts (e.g. holding a choke point or objective), and when a Medic is attached, the resulting pool of effective-health is unreasonably large Changes: Added: 40% overheal reduction while active Added: 40% healing rate penalty while active Added The Second Banana Secondary slot item When consumed by the Heavy, restores 200 health Acts like a small health kit when dropped by the Heavy and picked up by another player Item regenerates after 10 seconds Engineer Rescue Ranger The ability to repair buildings safely from range without using metal is powerful. Combine this with the ability to instantly teleport buildings from far away - which by itself is interesting and useful enough in many circumstances - and you end up with a package that is very strong. Changes: Ranged repairs now consume metal (at a 4-to-1 health-to-metal ratio, e.g. repairing 60 damage costs 15 metal) Doubled the amount of metal applied (per wrench hit) when upgrading buildings during the ""Setup"" period. Demo Claidheamh Mr Note: This weapon has been reverted to its previous design. Removed: +25 health on kill Added: 0.5 second increase in charge duration Pyro Added The Dragon's Fury Primary slot item Uses a shared pressure tank for Primary Fire and Alt-Fire Primary Fire: Launches a fast-moving, limited-range projectile that deals 25 damage and briefly ignites enemies Deals +300% damage to burning players +50% repressurization rate on hit Alt-Fire: Airblast -50% repressurization rate on Alt-Fire Added The Thermal Thruster Secondary slot item Fires a short-duration blast that launches the Pyro in the direction they are aiming Deals 3x falling damage to anyone you land on Has a 1.1 second holster duration MvM upgrades: Able to re-launch while airborne Stun enemies when you land (duration based on impact velocity) Note: Landing directly on an enemy grants a bonus to stun duration Faster recharge rate Added The Gas Passer Secondary slot item Creates a horrific visible gas cloud that coats enemies Flammable material then ignites into 10 seconds of Afterburn if enemies take damage (even Pyros!) Mann vs. Machine upgrades: Enemies explode when ignited by attacks Faster recharge rate Added The Hot Hand Gain a speed-boost when you hit an enemy player -20% damage penalty Every successful slap is announced in the kill-feed Flamethrowers Better visual sync, more consistent (no visuals/damage mismatch) New particle effects Applies to all flamethrower variants Airblast Hit detection for both players and projectiles is now a consistent cone Aiming at a player's feet no longer misses! Airblasting players now factors in the momentum of the Pyro and target, giving both more control over the interaction The target's existing velocity is no longer cancelled Players moving at the Pyro at great speed will be reflected away at great speed Players moving towards/away from the Pyro will experience less/more push force Airblast now causes target player to have reduced footing and air control for a short period No longer a flat stun Now factors in the upward angle of the airblast, rather than having a fixed upward force Total push force slightly increased Afterburn Flamethrowers no longer apply maximum-duration afterburn on contact. Afterburn duration is now based on how long the target is in contact with direct flames -- starting at a minimum of 3 seconds, and stacking to a maximum of 10 seconds. Per-tick afterburn damage increased to 4 (from 3), for a total of 8 damage per-second (up from 6 per-second) Flareguns now apply 7.5 seconds of afterburn (down from 10 seconds), resulting in the same total damage as before Afterburn now reduces all direct Medic healing and resist shields by 20% Note: This effect was previously applied by direct flames from all flamethrowers (at 25%), but was moved to afterburn, and slightly lowered"
173,vulnerability,tf2,Reworking The Pyro Melee Weapons,4,78kc63,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/78kc63/reworking_the_pyro_melee_weapons/,2017-10-25 12:07:45,"I think it is fair to say that as of the latest Major Update Pyro has the least interesting and least powerful Melee weapons. The only one that is ever worth using is the Power Jack, and because of it the Melees of the Pyro feel very lackluster. Here are my Suggestions. New added changes are in **Bold**. *** #Fire Axe Stays the Same *** #Axtinguisher / Postal Pummeler (+) Deals critical hits on a burning target. **(+) Hit allies to extinguish them from fire, then restore 100 health to both players.** (+) -33% damage penalty. () No random critical hits. () -20% attack speed. () -75% switch-to speed. With the advent of the **Dragon's Fury**, there is literally no reason to ever use the Axtinguisher. I added an extra feature to the weapon so that it can do some pretty cool supportive things. If your medic is on fire, hit him with the weapon to heal him and yourself in the process. *** #Homewrecker (+) Deals double damage against enemy buildings. (+) Able to remove Electro Sappers (in one hit). () Deals **33%** less damage against players. The damage it deals went from 20% less to 33% less. Not saying that the Homewrecker is overpowered, but very rarely does less melee damage matter for the Pyro since it is already such a close range class. It's just something to consider using the Stock Axe. Also same goes for the **Neon Annihilator**. *** #Powerjack **(+) On hit: Coat the enemy in gasoline.** (+) +15% faster move speed on wearer when active. **() Coats self in gasoline when active and for 10 seconds after putting it away.** Pyro's go too Melee weapon. The active ability is just so good because mobility rules, but it's also so boring and uninteresting. To go along with the Gas Jockey set that this was released alongside with, I made it coat hit enemies and yourself in gasoline. You might get to the battle quicker, but you will be more vulnerable. *** #Back Scratcher Fine as it is. *** #Sharpened Volcano Fragment **(+) On hit: target is engulfed in Hellfire, which lasts until the target is fully healed.** () Deals 20% less damage. Giving the Sharpened Volcano Fragmen's fire a special attribute which makes it last infinitely unless the target is fully healed. You cannot wait out that afterburn, because it will kill you. *** #Third Degree (+) Damage transfers to all players connected by Medic beams. **(+) Deals critical hits on Medic patients.** **() 30% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer.** A very feast or famine weapon. It's great against pocketed Heavy + Medic duos if you are able to get close, but you get absolutely decimated by explosions. ***"

The new downside of draining Max HP is too high of a risk/punishment verses a small reward of a bit more movement speed. Especially since how slowly you regain your HP back. I also think it was stupid to put it on the same downside on the Eviction Notice. Bring back the Marked For Death/Increased Vulnerability, draining Max HP is an over the top nerf."

When I first saw this red sign it was really surprising for me because i never done anything illegal on steam, and only one fact that my friend got banned too and that we got banned in the exactly same time reminded me about small forgotten security breach that we found one year ago. One day my friend found a XSS (Cross Site Scripting) vulnerability in workshop and told me about that. It was interesting for me because i like doing security researches as my hobby, so after short amount of time I found where it exactly was. I tested some basic stuff like domain security policy and bypassed the symbol limit. I sent additional information to my friend and forgot about that case until now. To prevent questions, i did all tests in private workshop items and deleted all of them in the same day. I didn't report this to Valve because 1) My friend found it first so this is not very ethical and 2) Valve have no public bug bounty program. I don't know if my friend reported it after or not, but i can clearly say that none of us used or published it. After bans my friend tested it again, the vulnerability is fixed now. I don't know what exactly caused the ban. Maybe someone found it and used, maybe there's a bot that reads one year old logs. The only thing i can say - bans for RESEARCH is absolutely retarded way to keep service security. Even PornHub and Imgur have their bug bounty programs (see hackerone(dot)com), and only Steam offers you a 20 years ban just for research. I tried to contact with Steam Support, but as always support sending their ""informative"" sample answers instead of solving the actual problem. They didn't even say what I did or which paragraph I violated in Terms Of Use. They just said something like ""we told you everything you want to know (That I got banned! Yes I know that thanks!) so goodbye"" and closed the ticket, nice help! I tried to send this to /Steam/ subreddit, but mods misunderstood my post and immediatly removed it with ""you exploited steam"" reason. Again. I haven't ever used it at all. My steam profile if someone want to see how community ban looks like to others. And if someone interested in the story and its upshot - /id/umfc"

This gives the heavy a health regeneration of 5-10 points a second depending on the weapon, that can be used while firing. This will last for as long as the heavy keeps his guns out and I think will be really powerful, not only can you speed charge uber but also give the heavy roaming health regeneration. Anyways that's just what I've seen, I could be completely over estimating this stuff but I really think the last change is just going to make the GRU even more of a must pick, at least in comp games or with half decent players"
180,vulnerability,tf2,The most realistic nerf for the Ambassador,0,70qj02,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/70qj02/the_most_realistic_nerf_for_the_ambassador/,2017-09-18 07:48:49,"As we all know in Valve's 'recent' balance change blog post, they have decided to nerf the Ambassador, which the comp community has been yelling for for years. This is due to it's insane burst damage and range. It does not follow the Spy's design at all as it is not stealthy, and imposes on the Sniper's design as a precision elimination class. Nothing besides other Snipers should be able to contest a Sniper at a range, as it is the Sniper's design to be the uncontested long range class. My solution to this problem is to remove the headshot entirely from the gun, as only the Sniper should be able to get headshots. They could replace this with a minicrit when attacking from behind within 3 feet from the opponent, as this accentuates the Spy's role as a stealthy class. On this track of making Spy more stealthy, they could follow up with a nerf to the Spy's most offensive weapon, the Deadringer. My suggestion is to remove the damage resistance on hit and replace it with a damage vulnerability, to punish the Spy for being caught. On the topic of class roles, incredibly, Valve didn't list nerfs on some of the other insanely broken weapons in the game: the Targe, the Neon Annihilator, the Holiday Punch, the Tomislav or the Sandvich. Each of these weapons completely screws over game balance, allowing the Demoman to overcome his range weakness and become a close range monster, the Pyro to become the best class in water combat, and most atrociously allowing the Heavy to completely replace BOTH the Spy, the Sniper AND Medic at ONCE. And don't even get me started on the Bonk replacing Uber, the Backburner, the Eureka Effect's flanking, and the most disgusting weapon in the game; The Sun-on-a-Stick completely replacing the Axtinguisher, rendering Pyro's crit combos irrelevant. I hope the TF Team will see this post and fix all these weapons appropriately. Thanks for reading!"
181,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon History: Shortstop,21,7175hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7175hf/weapon_history_shortstop/,2017-09-20 09:44:46,"So I'm going to step of the pyro update hype train and do the opposite, discussing past updates. I'm going to try and make this a daily series, basically i just go over how a weapon has changed, and give my thoughts on each design. I will only do ones that were more drastically changed (like the shortstop). I will rank each design from 1 to 5. 1 being underpowered, 2 being below average, 3 being quite balanced, 4 being above average, and 5 being overpowered. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 1: Mann-Conomy Update** (=) Has 4 clip which shoot 4, 12 damage pellets. It has a .5 second attack interval and 1.25 reload speed. (+) On Hit: Slow target movement by 40% for .5 seconds. This design is wildly different from the original, being more like the Natascha. 40% slow can be rough, especially while you are being constantly shot. Though .5 seconds isn't long and they can still kill you pretty easily. It's not the most effective weapon, and it's mostly a downgrade. *Final rating: 2* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 2 and 3: Australium Christmas and Manniversary** (-) Removed the speed loss on hit. (-) Increased reload speed by 50% This just made the weapon suck, it lowered the reload by a bit and removed the only upside in put in the description. It's tighter bullet spread isn't bad, but it's a straight downgrade to stock unless and long or medium-long range. *Final Tally: 1.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 4, 5 and 6: July 10, 2013 and Feb 2, 2014 patches and Gun Mettle** (=) Same damage and function times as before. (+) +20% bonus healing on wearer. (-) +80% vulnerability to push force on wearer (reduced to +40% in the next patch). (Both were changed to only be applied while active and firing speed nerfed in GM) This new design (mostly the 2nd one) is a more interesting idea. The healing only apples to health packs, which makes little ones heal 24% health instead of 20% and the medium ones heal 60% health instead of 50%. It's really not that much, though it could have been better with all healing sources. The knockback isn't too bad but i can hurt against pyros, especially reserve shooter ones. Overall it's a decent idea and is better than before, but still is not too good compared to stock. *Final Tally: 2* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Current Design: Meet Your Match** (=) Same damage and function times as before. (+) Alt-fire: Reach out and shove somebody. (-) +20% knockback vulnerability while active. It could have been simple, just have bonus healing for extra knockback, why valve? I understand the idea of using the shove to get a player to where the stop shines, but it just sucks. The shove is wonky so it's pretty much design 2 and 3 but with a tiny bit more knockback. *Final Tally: 1.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Overall Tally: 1.75* Overall, this weapon hasn't been the best. It does 48 damage max at medium range, and is not much better than stock unless at a far range. The best design was 5, having the best and least annoying stats. I was originally going to give my stat ideas for the weapon, but whatever. So what do you guys think? Was 5 your favorite design or was something else? Previous: Next: Soda Popper"

I do it in a scale of 1 being underpowered and 5 being overpowered. I'm going to do the pocket pistol today and i won't waste time and just get into it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 1: Pyromania Update** (+) +15 max health on wearer. (+) Wearer never takes falling damage. (-) -25% firing speed. (-) -50% fire damage vulnerability. So this weapon was pretty good. Pyro's would destroy you but other than that it was pretty cool. 15 health can help a bit and not taking fall damage is alright. Overall it's pretty much a better pistol unless you run into a pyro. *Final Tally: 4* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 2 and Current Design: Gun Mettle and Tough Break** (+) On Hit: Gain to to +3 health. Increased to 5 in TB. (+) Wearer never takes falling damage. (-) -25% firing speed. (-) -20% damage vulnerability. So... This is a thing. Now you can be taken down pretty easily for a mere 5 heath on hit. The firing speed just makes that health on hit even worse. This weapon is more contradictory than a politician and it just sucks. *Final Tally: 1.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Upcoming Design: Pyro Update** (+) +15% firing speed. (+) +7 hp per hit. (-) -25% clip size. Alright so this new design is pretty overpowered. A loss of 3 shots isn't much pay for 7 health on hit and faster firing speed. This would be nice to have the pistol be great again, but maybe it's too much. *Final Tally: 4.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Average tally: 3.3* So this weapon was good, crap, a tiny bit less crap, and is going to be op. What a great weapon. Now, i understand why the max health was removed. Valve seems to not want weapons that you can't see give more health, because that seems a bit unfair to them. The health on hit was a cool idea, just not handled well. "
183,vulnerability,tf2,Weapon History: Crit-a-cola,34,71zzi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/71zzi1/weapon_history_critacola/,2017-09-24 04:28:41,"In this series i take each version of a weapon and rank them from 1 being underpowered to 5 being overpowered. Got it? Good. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Version 1: April 28, 2010 patch** (=) While under the effects you give and take mini-crits for 6 seconds. Has a 24 second recharge after use. Well this weapon used to be very simple. You would dish out mini-crits for taking mini-crits. Now this weapon obviously needed a bit of a buff, especially since you couldn't do much damage in 6 seconds. Taking mini-crits and only having 6 seconds of extra damage wasn't that good. It *was* made in 1 day, so that says something about it. *Final Tally: 2* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 2: Pyromania Update** (+) Increased effect time to 8 seconds. (+) Added +25% speed while active. (+) Decreased recharge time to 22 seconds. (I couldn't find when this changed, so whatever. Now this was probably my favorite version of the weapon. You now can deal more damage with the increased time and you could move faster. The downside is fair and the weapon is overall balanced. The pyromania update was pretty good for scout, despite being a pyro related update. *Final Tally: 3* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Design 3, 4, and Current: July 10, 2013 and December 20, 2013 and Meet Your Match** (+) Removed damage taken is mini-crits and replaced it with 25% vulnerability. (Changed to 10% later) (-) Added 2 seconds of mini-crits afterwards. Apparently it was still very imbalanced. Let's just make it purely overpowered. That was an absolutely incredibly idea, huh valve? Alright, this weapon is overpowered with barely any downsides. It severely needs a nerf, and I'll cover that it one second. *Final Tally: 5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ **Upcoming Design: Pyro Update** (+) While under the effects, all damage dealt is mini-crits. (-) On Attack: Marked for Death for 5 seconds. This change is... surely a nerf. It doesn't have a speed bonus and you can take up to 5 seconds of mini-crits afterwards. It's even worse than design 2 but is still at least better than the original design. *Final Tally: 2.5* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ *Final Tally: 3.1* The first design was alright, but a buff was needed. The second design was the most balanced design and should've been kept that way. Next designs just made it incredibly overpowered, being banned in comp. But the pyro update...

185,vulnerability,tf2,Pyro balance ideas,0,73j77w,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/73j77w/pyro_balance_ideas/,2017-10-01 13:32:20,"First off, these are just my ideas of how it'd make the Pyro a better class as support. If you dislike people have opinions, you shouldn't have joined Reddit. Personally, I don't see enough Pyro's using that neato airblast on flaming allies. (I have died too many times as a soldier literally sitting in front of a Pyro asking for help before burning to death slowly.) I think a way we could combat this is to possibly change the health you obtain for helping your teammates out, increasing the 20 to 25 health per fire put out. Second, a rather popular one, the mobility. I think Pyro should have at least a 10% faster speed to make up for the fact that Pyro is painfully slow. Clearly other flamethrowers, most likely the Backburner, are going to prove to be issues very quickly when that speed is combined with the Powerjack. I don't really understand why a heavy piece of metal makes you faster, I imagine the Powerjack would have been better off with having a damage buff instead of speed if Pyro was faster. Well, that's how I'd fix it right there. Remove the speed buff, and replace it with a 15% damage buff (keep the damage vulnerability.) I don't think the Backburner will need to be nerfed, a good Pyro would need that speed boost to truly take control of the Backburner's full potential as many, MANY, Pyro's fail to use it for its actual purpose. I also think Pyro should have just a little less health, maybe 10-25 less health now that he has a faster move speed. For those of you who like to yell ""WM1'S ARE NO SKILL NOOBS"", technically that Pyro is doing what he should be doing. If he doesn't burn you alive, he's a civilian in a fireproof suit. I think that some of his melee weapons should be worked on, ESPECIALLY the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. There is literally no good use for this in regular TF2, not even on Degroot. I'm not hating towards anyone who likes it, I'm just saying that this weapon isn't all that great. I think it should keep its engulf in flames on hit, but should either have damage reduced set to 5 or removed. The weapon should cause a longer after burn effect, and should increase the Pyro's move speed. ""STRAIGHT UPGRADE FROM STOCK!!1!"" Yeah, let's make him weaker to all damage to make up for that, that way the axe can still be an okay/good option. One last thing currently on my mind, the Scorch shot. I find it utterly useless. I think it should explode on physical contact, allowing the Pyro to make a better jump for himself and deal with groups of enemies in a better way. It should have a little less damage, but in exchange for this, it should keep the explosive effect as I stated above. Perhaps 10%-15% less damage. That's about all I have to say right now, what's your thoughts on these ideas? Also apologies, I try to speak my best English on these sites so please help me out by politely telling me about any mistakes I've made."
186,vulnerability,tf2,Revised Suggestions,1,74rt0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/74rt0u/revised_suggestions/,2017-10-07 11:41:35,"**Matchmaking** Casual Mode * Lets be honest, XP does not mean anything. Since our community is strictly against negative XP for a poor match in a casual game, TF team cannot utilize XP effectively. However, they can use other stats like K/D ratio, time played, matches played to create better teams. Some like to play medic, use the healing done stat to increase the chances of both teams having a medic. Same goes for engineer who gains a lot of support points. * Bring back auto scramble, but use it to create fresh teams when the round ends. Scramble based on points gained by players in previous round. Try to distribute the healers and support classes irrespective of points scored. * Have an intensive to rank up. Currently you get a new colored badge when you level up. Its not used in matchmaking and it is not rewarded. Maybe give the player a unique weapon when they level up (tradeable), and a unique hat every 20 levels or so (untradable). * Bring the timer used in competitive payload maps to casual. This point got a lot of flag, but I suppose it could use some tweaks. Don't end the round when one team pushes further or fails to meet the time requirement. Just use it as a motivation to make coordinated pushes aka Pub Push^TM more often (as opposed to the last minute push when administrator yells overtime). Again, I just want this to be a psychological thing. Payload maps will remain the same, but now teams will (probably) work together to beat opponent's time. Again, I cannot stress this enough, don't end the round when time expires: just use the timer as an intensive to make coordinated pushes. Competitive * I'm still pessimistic about the competitive scene. There are some weapons which will always be banned in competitive unless they are completely redesigned. For example, I cannot see vaccinator in the popular 6s leagues and tournaments because it actively shuts down one type of damage (and 6s meta means there will be only 2 types of damage: bullet and blast). Another example is crit-a-cola, Valve may try to nerf it by adding damage vulnerabilities, but the scout can basically guarantee crucial picks; med-scout trade heavily favors the team which lost scout. * Having said that, there are some weapons which can be tweaked because TF team can keep the fundamentals of a weapon and fix what's wrong with it. Proposed changes with DDS is an excellent example of this; just by switching the resistances from bullet to blast/flame/melee, Valve can fix sniper v sniper problem while keeping the +25 health. * At the moment with the current weapons, TF team needs to ban certain weapons, and this is where the esport factor comes in. Valve (not the TF team, but valve) will not endorse a TF2 esport like they do with DoTA and CS because the current competitive mode (the stock one you see in-game) is broken. They are pushing for 6s, but with current unlockable weapons community is not happy with the other team using certain weapons, and TF team cannot possibly pander to everyone's needs. Some weapons are clearly broken/OP, but what about weapons like razorback, solem vow, sydney sleeper, madmilk. Some of these are OP in highlander or 6s and okayish in the alternate. **General Balancing** Sniper Sniper needs a nerf across all weapons. * Bodyshot damage shot be significantly reduced * No-scope damage should be reduced from 50 to something like 20 plus a threshold distance should be implemented where if a no-scope is attempted from a distance of x hammer units or greater the shot deals no damage * A reverse damage falloff should be implemented because sniper is a long range class and although close quater headshots make a lost of sense physcially but it does not work mechanically in a game like TF2 where successful flanks should be rewarded. * I would also suggest to bring a system like TFC where sniper needs to charge a shot to get headshots, but tone it down to 1-2 secs. At the moment, if a (decent) sniper watches a sightline, teams will not push unless they pick the sniper (by using counter sniper or a spy) or they have an uber ready. I get that sniper is a stalemate breaker, but the idea of a long range spy (one shot class) does not fit TF2 imo; hence, the idea of a charged shot also doubles up as a 2-5 second window where a team can push when other team is running a snipe without bringing a pick class or deploying uber. Pyro * Remove the ability to airblast players, but keep the projectile reflect attribute. * Give the ability to airblast ubered, vaccinated, kritted players. This ability lasts for 5 seconds after the said effects fade; this includes flashed players. * Also give the ability to airblast soldiers using any banner permanently. Or tone it down to give the same 5-second-airblast while banner is deployed plus anyone who benefits from that banner. Engineer Engineer is pretty balanced, but problem arises when a team stacks engineers. * Add a repair debuff on other engineer's buildings (except teleporter) when a team has 3 or more engineers. Effectively, add a psuedo wrangler shield effect for buildings which belong to other engineers. Again, this only activates when a team has 3+ engis. I don't know how this can be possibly implemented, but it helps the current situation because our community cannot deal with class limit. * Add a sapper removal debuff for other engineer's buildings when that team has 3+ engis. Multiply the hits to remove sapper by 2. So stock takes 4 hits and jag takes 6 hits. * These effects do not apply on your own buildings. Heavy * Give heavies the ability to equip shotgun and family business as a primary (in addition to secondary). Stats * Yes, the stats you on weapon selection. It is allright for the most part, but adding information like BASE DMG: xxx. CRIT DMG: xxx. should help new players. Also, revise the language of some stats. for example ""Damage vulnerability"" does not mean much unless we know that it only applies to blast damage. Moreover, adding a line like BASE DMG TAKEN: xxx. BASE DMG TAKEN WHILE EQUIPED: xxx. will help new players. Elongate the cards across the horizontal to accommodate new information. Bullet Spread * Remove it **Unused weapons and OP weapons** [Why they suck] + [my suggestions]. * Volcano Fragment: Pyro does not need flame damage on his/her melee weapon. Add bleed damage on this weapon OR make this a utility weapon which extinguishes teammates on hit without any crit gimmicks. * Sun on a Stick: Scouts don't need a damage/crit based melee weapon because scout is a close combat class. Remove the crit on burning players and boost the anti-flame elements by giving similar attributes as spycicle (melts when deployed + adds fire damage vulnerability). * Third Degree : It is a direct upgrade to the stock melee for pyro at the moment. Add disable healing for 3-5 seconds when hits a med-player chain and grant 25% movement speed for 5 seconds on hit (any enemy player). Add a damage penalty of 70%. * Fire Axe: Boost melee damage by 20%. Make this weapon the ""shotgun"" of pyro melee. * Axtinguisher: Nerfs killed this weapon. If pyros do lose the ability to airblast players, I would love to see this reverted to its glory days. However, it still needs a buff; remove the switch penalty OR keep the switch penalty but increase base damage so that crits actually mean something. * Caber: It is decent, but becomes useless after initial use. Add a recharge timer and increase blast radius. * Fists: Boost melee damage by 20%. Make this weapon the ""shotgun"" of heavy melee. * Warrior Spirit: (blast) Damage vulnerability kills it. Make this a hybrid of buffed fists and GRU. * Huo-Long Heater: Since a good spy can jump over its ring of fire, having a debuff of 4 metal/sec is too harsh. Reduce it to 2 metal/sec. * Pomson: Ability to drain cloak and uber is uncalled for and nerfing the amount drained won't do it. It needs a rework from the ground up. Keep the damage as it is and add ability to overheal bulidings up to 50%. Increase the reload time. Only works on your own buildings. 10 hits-&gt; 50% overheal. Overheal does not heal the building and it can be only applied when sentry is at max health. Overheal fades like medic's overheal. * Wrangler: Shift the resistance to engi for extra surviablilty with a EHO about 230 HP and shield is only active while weapon is deployed. Engi still gains manual control of sentry. Penalty of time b/w manual control to auto is reduced to 1 sec if engi is alive during the switch, and increased to 10 seconds if engi dies before switching. * Amputator: Make the taunt loopable, but keep the first person perspective. [don't go to the third person camera when taunt is performed]. * Overdose: Increase the speed a bit and make it passive. * Enforcer: I don't like the idea of additional damage on spies, but Valve outdid themselves by not even implementing the resistance penetration properly. Scrap everything and give spies 10% damage (with resistance penetration) for 3 seconds after a backstab. Reduce accuracy and chamber size. * Reserve shooter: If we do implement the no-airblast thing on pyros, this weapon will become balanced for pyros. It will be an effective counter for kritzkrieg and banner soldiers. As of now, it should be removed from pyro. * Bison: Add a massive wave/pulse which deals minimal damage but covers an enormous area. That's all folks. Hope TF team reads this."

More specifically, I love playing demopan. With the splendid screen, you can kill anything that isn't overhealed or a heavy with one charge + crit swing, which already gives you a decent crit chance for the next 30 seconds... After about 3 kills, your crit chance can be up to 50%, which is nice Anyway, this is not what I want to discuss. I got the idea of giving up my precious pan for the pain train. Extra cap rate, but 10% bullet vulnerability... With the shield, you're still more resistant than the average demoman. Also, on paper, your crit rate should be the same as when using the pan (but, then again, so is a bottle... I've tried using a bottle, but I always inevitably go back to the pan)... It might just be crazy enough to work Charge onto the point. Can kill one guy with charge + crit, and if there's more guys on the point, just start hitting them and hoping for crits. Even if you don't get it, the close proximity of the point can help guarantee you'll get more hits... If you can survive that long I tried googling ""pain train demoknight"", and found nothing that's really relevant. I even went to page 2, so you know I'm serious. That's why I decided this thread is worth it Also, if you've got any other possibly good but severely underused weapon loadouts, post them here "
189,vulnerability,tf2,Scout balance ideas,15,6xuane,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6xuane/scout_balance_ideas/,2017-09-04 02:59:07,"You get the point, I won't bore you with worthless rambling. Baby Face's Blaster: This has been nerfed to the 9th circle of hell. I understand why but they went a bit too far. (+) Now takes 100 damage to remove the boost instead of 25. (+) Boost lost on double jump changed from 75% to 50%. This basically allows you to actually keep the boost for more than 12 seconds when a stray bullet hits you and you become slower than a crippled snail. Back Scatter: Unlike the bfb, this weapon was always pretty shit. It's not as bad as people think, but it's mostly a straight downgrade. (+) Removed -20% accuracy. (+) Removed clip size penalty. (-) Added -30% damage penalty on non-back shots. This gives it simple stats which aren't contradictory. It gives incentive to be a flank scout and punishes not doing it right. Pretty Boy's Pocket Shithole: The new balance idea valve has is pretty good, but I have another approach. (I will just put my new stats for it instead of all changes, k mate?) (+) 5 health on hit. (+) 15% firing speed. (-) 20% damage penalty. (-) 25% slower reload speed. This just allows for quick heals at cost of damage. The reload speed is just so you can't heal too fast after you empty your clip. Crit-Ebola: Ah the crit a frickin cola. Everyone hates you, so let's fix that, shall we? (+) Removed 10% damage vulnerability. (-) Added Marked for Death while under it's effects. Simple fix, just give it some love of it's old design. You give crits, ya get crits. Basic shit. Flying Guillotine: I do kinda hate the sandman combo but I wouldn't want to see it go, just nerfed. (-) Removed crits on stunned players. (+) Added +75% damage against stunned players. (-) Increased reload time from 11 seconds to 15 seconds. (+) Added +30% damage. This nerfs the combo but still makes it viable and doable. Also I made it slightly better as a standalone weapon. Atomizer: This can be pretty can good for dodging projectiles in competitive. It's not overly overpowered but I'll tweak it slightly. (+) Removed damage on triple jump. (-) Added Marked for Death for 2 seconds on triple jump. Basically just makes you more vulnerable after a jump and a good airshotting soldier can easily take you out after the jump. Sandman: You get it. (-) Remove the movement speed penalty on stunned players. (-) The ball is now a ten health object that disintegrates after taking 10 damage. This makes the clever combo harder but also makes aware players be able to counter being stunned. Sun on a Shit: This is just so bad, what else do I have to say. I have two designs for it because design 1 might be hard to implement. Design 1: (+) Added alt-fire launches fireball that does 30 damage and lights people on fire. (-) Fireball has a 10 second reload time. This one allows for you to make use of the crit thing, and make a new gimmicky combo for scout. Design 2: (+) Added second successful hit lights people on fire. This one is more simple and gives that 3 hit combo of the gunslinger to scout, as well as being pretty easy to implement in (I would think). Wrap Assassin: This just sucks. It's a fine idea, just not handled well. (+) Added 200% max secondary ammo. (+) Added +30% blast radius. (+) Added +50 blast damage. (-) Added +40% reload time This allows the ball to be a good damage dealer and you can miss but still do some damage. You can use the 3 ammo strategically or just spam them into a choke point like the douchebag you are. So that's my idea for balance changes. I guess just tell me if I missed a weapon or tell me how homosexual I am because my changes suck."

192,vulnerability,tf2,Some suggestions for nerfing the sentry and buffing other buildings...,0,6pz9ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6pz9ab/some_suggestions_for_nerfing_the_sentry_and/,2017-07-28 07:40:23,"Sentry guns are some of the most effective defensive obstacles that a team can employ, especially if they use multiple sentries and if the opposing team is composed of new or even average players. Meanwhile at higher levels, the sentry gun is almost kind of a joke, only really denying the scouts and medic from advancing forward, as a good soldier or demo can easily take down a sentry if the enemy team is sufficiently distracted. Thus the sentry should be nerfed so that classes other than the soldier, demo, and spy (who often isn't even used in higher level comp play to take down sentries) can have a better shot at taking it down. I propose that sentry guns now have increased bullet damage vulnerability (I don't really know what percentage would be fair), so that a heavy without a medic has a fighting chance against a level three sentry, and other class can take down the sentry much easier if they take advantage of the sentry's rotation speed. Engineer's other buildings are often an afterthought for players, as they take a long time to build and mean more work for the engineer to maintain and upgrade each building alongside the sentry gun. I think that dispensers and teleporters should have the same wrench boosted build and redeploy rate as the sentry, and perhaps the regular build and redeploy speed of stock. Mayyybe also less required metal to upgrade them, as an engineer already has to build all these buildings and repair them frequently, making himself vulnerable to enemies while doing such things. This would encourage newbie engineers to build dispensers and teleporters more, and make setting up easier for high level engineers. I'd love to know what you think would make dispensers and teleporters much more effective options than they are right now, especially on modes like KOTH and 5cp"
193,vulnerability,tf2,Some of my ideas for weapon balances,1,6q3vzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6q3vzd/some_of_my_ideas_for_weapon_balances/,2017-07-28 23:47:08,"Razorback Still keeps protection from 1 backstab but gives 15% more damage vulnerability but stuns the spy for 3 seconds in which they can only run and not switch weapons. I think this would make games especially competitive a bit more balanced and would make the razorback seem less of a ""fuck off spy"" weapon. The Phlogistinator Retains the uber when mmph bar is full and taunting to recieve the critical hits, however mini crit damage is taken like when you finish the ability of the crit-a-cola. I think this would stop those annoying pocket medics of the phlog pyros from giving them complete protection when they charge at enemies and literally cause a massacre. The Vaccinator It could retain the damage block ability however in my opinion it should take longer for the 4 seperate uber charges it gains and damage vulnerability from the resistances not use could be ramped up 10% to stop the patient from becoming a pain to kill. This would help as new players would find it easier to counter and experienced players alike would have an easier time stopping a vaccinated enemy. Downies Danger Shield It could retain the bullet resistance and hp boost however damage from all other sources would have to be greatly increased. This would stop super annoying snipers just becoming really difficult to kill as they are a very linear class and do not fit in with tf2s form of close range attacks. The only thing to counter a good sniper is another one and this becomes even more annoying when there no spies or if the sniper has basic spy checki knowledge because only an enemy sniper could be able to kill them and would probably die because of the darwins snipers ability to survive a headshot. In the case they are weakened due to this they usually run away and go for some health beforing repeating the same process again. The Reserve Shooter Allow the ability to minicrit victimes when airborne however damage drop off is greatly increased. Less clip size and damage vulnerability is increased from projectile sources. This could help soldiers and demos escape as a good pyro can reflect almost all of their attacks before killing them quickly with the reserve shooter. Those are all I could think of so far which are significant and difficult for some players to counter If you have any suggestions please leave a comment, opinions are welcome"

196,vulnerability,tf2,Thoughts On How to Improve TF2's Modes,0,6rdthp,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6rdthp/thoughts_on_how_to_improve_tf2s_modes/,2017-08-04 03:16:14,"Have ideas of your own? Please share them down below! --- My random ideas: > Attack/Defend * The more points the BLU team has captured, the longer future points will take to capture. * When a point is captured, all members of the RED team will be instantly respawned. * When in overtime, points will be automatically captured at their maximum rate, regardless of the player capturing. > Capture Point (5 CP specifically) * There is a 30 second 'setup' time, during which the middle point cannot be captured. (Similar to King of the Hill) * Each point takes the same length of time to capture (1 player capturing the mid point will cap at the same speed as 1 player on the last point). > Arena * Every match begins with a 15 second setup time, during which time players can get in position and engineers can build without being damaged by enemy players and players cannot head over to the enemies' side of the map. * Every match will last 2 minutes. * Half-way through the match, the Control Point can be captured. * Capturing the maps control point will give all the surviving players on your team guaranteed mini-crits, a 20% speed boost, and highlight enemy players regardless of their status (similar to carrying the intelligence). * Getting 'First Blood' (the first kill of the match) will give you 10 seconds of guaranteed mini-crits, a 20% speed boost, and 20% damage resistance. * Failing to eliminate the entire enemy team will cause both team to go into humiliation, at which time all killed players will be respawned as the purple team and have 30 seconds to kill all surviving players. Purple Team players will have full crits, a 40% speed boost, and all non-purple players will be highlighted on the map. > Territorial Control Completely rework it. Instead of multiple mini-maps with 2 control points, open up the entire map for a 10-20 minute where the four main points can be captured in any order. Teams have 3 different ways to win each round. * Winning Method 1: Capture all 6 territories. * Winning Method 2: Have more territory under your control when the timer runs out. * Winning Method 3: In the event of a tie, Sudden Death comes into effect. Killing all enemy players during sudden death will win the match (points can still be captured as well, and will cap at their maximum speed). * Stalemate: A stalemate can only occur if both teams are tied at the end of the timer during Sudden Death. * The RED/BLU Base points cannot be captured until the four center points are captured by the attacking team. * Players will always spawn at their Base point, regardless of how many points are captured. The Base will have teleporters available (as well as a map) that allows players to teleport to any captured point. * While all points are connected by a single main path, alternate routes can be opened up by capturing points, allowing for additional ways to attack the enemy's points for your team, as well as closing off routes to other points for the enemy. * When Sudden Death begins, all non-base points are reset to neutral, all respawning players are instantly respawned, and all living players are given full (standard) overheal and suffer non-damaging knockback if near a point. Buildings and sticky traps are temporarily disabled/reset (respectively) when Sudden Death begins. > Capture the Flag * Holding onto the flag for more than 20 cumulative seconds without it being captured (regardless of if you've dropped it before or died in the meantime) will mark the carrier for death and make them vulnerable to friendly fire for 10 seconds whenever they pick up the intelligence until it has been captured. * Capturing the intelligence no longer grants a crit boost to the capturing team. * The intelligence can be picked up by its own team and brought back to its spawn location. * (This idea is very unlikely to be liked I think): Teams take turns capturing the other team's intelligence, instead of both attacking each other's base at the same time. > Mannpower * Powerups only last for 30 seconds. After that, the player loses their powerup and it returns to one of the powerup spawn locations. > Special Delivery * The Australium case is always neutral. If dropped, it can be picked up by either team. * The Australium case will reset after 10 seconds of not being touched. * If the Australium goes 30 seconds without resetting or being placed, it will inflict any carrier with Marked for Death and a vulnerability to friendly fire. * The player carrying the Australium case will gain 20% damage resistance and a 20% speed boost. * The main platform will automatically rise while a player is carrying the Australium, regardless of if they are standing on the platform or not. The closer they are to the platform however, the faster it will rise. * There will be a small, narrow platform at the top of the rocket that players can reach before the main platform reaches the top of the rocket. If Australium-carrying players stand on this platform, it will trigger the top of the rocket to open up and allow the player to place the Australium early. * Once the Australium is placed, there is a 10 second delay before it launches and the capturing team wins. During this time, the enemy team can attempt to take and replace the Australium, resetting the countdown in their favor. It takes up to 5 seconds for an enemy to recapture the intelligence (can be sped up by a faster capture rate). The countdown will not progress while the enemy team is trying to recapture the intelligence. > Slaughterhouse (a rework of Player Destruction) * Each team will have a base that makes it easy to leave and reach various points on the map while being difficult to camp and lockdown. * For 5 minutes both teams kill as many enemy players as they can (no soul/beer/other item collecting) * The team that kills the most players wins. * Each map will have a control point. Each minute, this point resets and can be captured. The capturing team will gain a 10 second crit boost, 40% speed boost, and the ability to see all enemy players (highlighting them on the map). * Players will instantly respawn when killed. > Boot Camp/Mann Up * Mannpower Powerups can now be purchased in-game as alternatives to the canteens, costing $2,000 each. They recharge over the course of 30 seconds and are triggered like an MvM canteen. When activated, they will grant the player all of their upsides for 15 seconds, after which they start their 30 second cooldown. * Teleport Canteens: These will now activate automatically if the user takes fatal damage, granting all of their usual benefits. They can also be shared by a Medic - the patient will not automatically be teleported, but will instead have the option of teleporting back to spawn (with all benefits, including the automatic activation upon taking fatal damage) for 5 seconds. * Uber Canteens will now grant knockback immunity in addition to invulnerability * Ammo/Clip Refill canteens now replenish cloak and sentry ammo as well. In addition, they will prevent the user from consuming any non-clip ammo for 5 seconds (this does mean that 'clipless' weapons, like the minigun, flamethrower and watches, will consume no ammo for 5 seconds). > Demolition (a rework of Robot Destruction) * This is an alternative MvM mode to Boot Camp/Mann Up * The goal is to take out as many enemy bots as possible before time runs out, preferably without dying. * Robots respawn infinitely and from different areas, with occasional upgraded bots appearing to defend the weaker bots and/or seek out the human players. * Robots drop money when killed, which can be used to purchase upgrades, fill your canteen, and buy additional lives. * You have limited respawns in this mode. If you die without having any money for respawns, you will not be able to rejoin the match. Luckily, your first 3 respawns are free. Allies can also spend money to respawn you."

199,vulnerability,tf2,Ideas for Tweaking the Mantreads and Gunboats,0,6t6ai4,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6t6ai4/ideas_for_tweaking_the_mantreads_and_gunboats/,2017-08-12 13:42:53,"**Mantreads** ~~**+40 max health on wearer**~~ ~~**75% knockback resistance on wearer**~~ ~~**15% faster movement speed on wearer**~~ =Note: * The knockback resistance on wearer, while listed as an upside, will also now serve as a downside because the distance a rocket jump will send the soldier is heavily reduced. It would also now apply to airblast knockback as well. (Clarification: the current Mantreads knockback resistance does not affect the Soldier's rocket jumps. This redesign will change that, so that the Mantreads knockback resistance WILL apply to your rocket jumps as well). * While the '3x fall damage to enemy players you land on' effect can be a fun one, it is too weak a stat to be an effective upside on its own. I would rather not get rid of it however; instead, I'd rather make it a generic trait of the Heavy and all footwear items (Bootlegger, Ali Baba's Wee Booties, Gunboats and Mantreads) or simply a basic mechanic all classes can technically make use of. * While the TF Team has suggested their own buff for the Mantreads (increased turning control when rocket jumping), I'm not a fan of it being on the Mantreads, since it would mean the Mantreads are simply another jumping weapon through and through, instead of having more of their own role that isn't shared by the Gunboats to an extent. This is not me saying it would be a bad change however. The Mantreads are an often overlooked weapon for the Soldier. Though useful for staying on objectives, pushing sentries with a Medic, and preventing your jumps from being disrupted, they are still rather weak compared to the extra mobility granted by the Gunboats, the self-defense potential of the shotguns, and the buffs of the banners. Such is why I'd like to rework them to be a defensive counterpart to the Gunboats. With the increased health and movement speed, the Soldier is less reliant on rocket jumping to navigate the map and will have an easier time reaching the front lines and dealing damage there, while the knockback resistance will continue to make the Soldier far more difficult to remove from objectives and otherwise knock around. However, the knockback will also restrict the Soldier's rocket jumping by reducing the amount of knockback rocket jumps deal to the wearer, forcing him to more heavily rely on his standard movement to get around. --- **Gunboats** ~~**80% less self-damage from rocket jumps**~~ ~~**+200% air control**~~ ~~*-40 less max health on wearer*~~ =Notes: * The self-damage resistance to rocket jumps will now apply even if your rocket damages an enemy. * The increased air control is similar to the Demo shields' turning control - you will effectively be able to turn more sharply, both when blast jumping and when surfing knockback from enemy damage. In contrast to the Mantreads, the Gunboats are an arguably overused and/or overpowered weapon for the Soldier, as the grant him a great deal more potential mobility (due to the reduced health cost of rocket jumps) at little cost (in pubs at least, where the lack of a shotgun is not as potent or crippling). These changes attempt to preserve the Gunboats focus on low cost bursts of mobility and even enhance it (using the TF Team's suggested idea for buffing the Mantreads), and then meet it with an inherent downside: the reduced max health. While this might seem counterproductive, the reason for reducing the max health is to prevent the Soldier from being too durable while being mobile. The rocket launcher he is ferrying is a powerful weapon, and letting the Soldier be durable and mobile while carrying it makes him a bit too difficult/frustrating of a target to take out. Reducing the max health keeps the Soldier at a constant state of vulnerability compared to a normal Soldier, while the increased (back to the original levels actually) rocket jump resistance means rocket jumps are nearly free for the Soldier, balancing out the nerf and the weapon on the whole. --- Please let me know your thoughts below."
200,vulnerability,tf2,"Nice try Valve, but no, just no. -- a commentary from that guy who started the petition last time",0,6imc73,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6imc73/nice_try_valve_but_no_just_no_a_commentary_from/,2017-06-22 00:58:45,"[cross-posting from TF2 forum, which apparently is a shitfest and thus reddit might be a better place to post this commentary] Let me start off by saying, that it's good that Valve listens to the competitive community, but understand, the competitive community is not all there is. There is also the casual community. What the competitive community wants is not what the casual community wants. The casual community includes a diverse array of play styles too. Here, I'm not only going to talk about the problems with this update, but also suggest some changes that might help achieve some of the same objectives. I don't want to just give you problems without solutions here. First, the Spy. Valve, I know you want to make the Spy play a certain way, but these changes are not beneficial to casual mode, and the Spy is already not competitively viable. The Spy's ambassador is already a sad and pathetic excuse for a sniping weapon. The fact that a very very small number of extremely good players can deal some headshots with it at range reliably does not even make it a viable sniping weapon in general, simply because it only deals 102 damage. Is there actually any good reason to remove the Spy's long range capability? Not really. Yes you can score headshots, and you can sneak odd angles on them. If anything, that's one of the Spy's unique strengths. There are situations that can arise where a spy headshot is the only effective counter strategy, typically where an engineer has set up in an area which is difficult for demos to reach because of snipers or whatever. When heavily guarded, the Spy being able to sneak behind enemy lines and headshot an engineer camping in his sentry nest is an important counter-play. The Spy's sniping ability is inferior to the Sniper's sniping ability, but he fills a niche role in being able to snipe from surprise angles and spots. That role, as the ""ambush sniper"" is something that Spys everywhere have grown to love. We aren't ready to part with it, and if you take it away, only the Engineer benefits, and maybe the occasional oblivious sniper. Spy snipers who shoot other players at the start of the round or whatever are usually not actually playing the Spy as a Sniper because the Ambassador is an amazing sniping weapon, but because they need to practice or because it's too early in the game to get behind anyone. The fact is, the ambassador has never been overpowered, the other revolvers in general have been underpowered. Actually, compared to other classes, the Spy is weak overall. I would suggest that you leave the ambassador alone. In fact a zoom on the thing would be a better change... Alright that would probably be a bad idea, but I think the balance on the ambassador is fine as-is. Next, the Enforcer. This thing is probably the gun that you should change, not the Ambassador. This weapon is weak and buggy. Why not do something to it that makes it actually useful? I suggest that you do this: +30% damage vs buildings +10% damage vs players +20% accuracy Pierce all damage resists (not bugged version, all except regular ubercharge) -10% firing speed -33% clip size -50% reload speed No random critical hits There you go. Balanced revolver that rewards clip management and well timed shots. Or I think it would be. If it's not balanced, simply adjust the damage boost and firing speed. This would preserve the niche without ruining the gun. The changes to the Your Eternal Reward are interesting, but I don't think they are optimal. Certainly, this will make the knife more approachable to new players, but I think that these changes are a negative to skilled players and it dumbs down the knife too much. A good spy doesn't gain much advantage by using this improved YER because he wont be making frequent use of the upside to the knife and will frequently be facing the downside. To balance the YER, instead of reworking the knife entirely, I suggest something closer to the original design. The current YER rewards Spys for being very sneaky, and helps them stay sneaky. Instead of nerfing the stealth element from the YER in exchange for removing the thing that made the weapon highly unique, I suggest adding some new upsides without removing the existing downside: -50% (de)cloak volume. (adjust this percentage to balance) No footstep or hit sounds while cloaked. By adding these upsides, we get something closer to the original saharan spy set bonus. We already know that silent decloak is overpowered, so reduced volume should be somewhere in between overpowered and useless. Also consider ""No cloak shimmering from bumps."" and ""No blood particles from fall damage while cloaked"". I understand how the dead ringer can be annoying. That being said, DR spam is usually because the other team is either not Spy aware or a result of metal fragments from engineer buildings that have been destroyed. First, because the Spy is already an underpowered class that isn't viable in competitive mode, any nerf to the spy should be accompanied by some kind of buff to compensate so as not to make the spy a weaker class than he already is. Ideally, if the Dead Ringer is changed, it should be changed in a way that makes it both less frustrating to play against, and also more competitively viable. The main reason why Spys can use the DR so frequently is the instant recharge mechanics. As it turns out, the DR can be recharged instantly if you combine a large ammo box and a quick decloak. The Spy doesn't need to made not to be able to recharge the Dead Ringer at all, the only things that need to be adjusted are the percentages such that the combination of decloaking quickly + large ammo box no longer yields and instant DR charge. If it takes even only 1 second to recharge after taking a large ammo box, that will prevent almost all instant recharges and make the Spy vulnerable. So change it from -35% recharge from ammo boxes to -45% and you will have essentially solved the problem. But even this issue is mostly a result of unaware teams, when you have an insta-DR Spy they are almost 100% predictable, they always move to the nearby ammo boxes. This is a huge weakness, and the reason why box based insta-DR only works against teams that are oblivious to Spys or don't know how to counter it. The other, and potentially far more annoying method for the Spy to obtain instant DR recharges is through fallen metal from destroyed engineer buildings. Though annoying and effectively uncounterable, the technique only works as long as supply of metal lasts. (which is far too long, imo) Simply reduce the amount of recharge obtained from scrap metal or eliminate that method of recharge altogether. In combination with these nerfs, the Spy should also get a buff to prevent the DR from being useless. Valve has a habit of over-nerfing things to the point they become useless, please don't make this mistake again with one of the Spy's watches, he only has 3 to choose from! Even if these changes are intended to reduce DR spam, that DR spam also provides survivabillity to the Spy, something he doesn't have much of. So to counterbalance these changes, we should inquire into the way that the DR is used in most games to see how it is used and how these changes will impact the DR playstyle. First, feigning death. This doesn't work against anyone who has more than about 50 to 200 hours. The feigns are too obvious to fool anyone, and the loud decloak sound doesn't help that, on top. So, anyone who somehow managed to get fooled by the DR despite all the giveaways will know as soon as you decloak that no, you did not die. Anyone who uses the DR to fool people is a noob. It doesn't work, and wont work, because there are so many DR bugs and giveaways that it almost never fools anyone. Yes, the crusant spy is fixed. Now fix the death cam, because everyone just yells ""Spy has DR"" into the mic when they die to DR spy. Also fix the hit sounds, because if you hear the spy still being burned after you ""kill"" him with your flamethrower, you can tell that the spy isn't dead because air doesn't burn nor do dead bodies. 3 second fire damage immunity does not help with this much, because the particles and sounds still seem to be affected. Don't forget to fix the disguise smoke too. And the explosion gibs, especially with the bombanomicon. Ok, Valve isn't going to fix all those bugs are they? Probably not... so what does the DR do if not fool people? Two things, it allows the Spy to Escape and Survive. To make the Spy more predictable and less annoying with the DR, making it less frequently usable but stronger would be an option. The original GOD-DR back in the good old days made the Spy into a invincible tank, that's probably not the ideal situation, but the main reason why it made the spy basically invincible was because it combined high damage resistance with fast recharges. Trying to fix the GOD-DR, Valve attack the shielding element to make the Spy easier to kill. This of course, made it useless for feigning. So Valve kept adjusting numbers and right now we have something that while not nearly as powerful as the ancient GOD-DR is fair and balanced. It's just that it happens to be very annoying against people who don't understand how to counter it. One thing to be aware of is that as we make it more difficult to activate DR charges, the impact of making the shielding effects of the DR stronger progressively lessens. Thus, while I think the GOD-DR was kind of insane since you basically couldn't die, having a high shielding factor that does not decay quickly would be a fair way to balance changes that reduce the spammability of the DR. I.e. we can counter-balance changes that make the DR able to be used less often by making it stronger when it is used, the net effect could balance out but make the DR more skill based and less spam based. In this aspect, we also have an opportunity to reexamine the elements of the DR that make it unreliable and not competitively useful. Namely, there are some simplistic changes to the DR that would be able to make it into an improved and rebalanced weapon that gains competitive viability, reduces spam, raises the skill ceiling, and makes it less frustrating to play against, here are my suggestions: Cloak Type: Feign Death Leave a fake corpse on taking damage and temporarily gain invisibility, speed and damage resistance +50% cloak regen rate +40% cloak duration -50% cloak meter when Feign Death is activated No cloak meter from ammo boxes when invisible No cloak meter from metal -60% cloak meter from ammo boxes Damage resistance: -80% damage from all sources except explosions during supercloak, after supercloak ends, reduces to 50% over the duration of the DR cloak. -90% damage from explosions during supercloak, after supercloak ends, reduces to 60% over the duration of the DR cloak. Crit and minicrit immunity while under supercloak, including the attack that activates the charge. Still displays crit in kill feed though. Activation mechanics changes: When charged, DR can always be activated instantly, even after attacking etc. To compensate, add a short lag after closing the DR when it did not activate before being able to attack again. Sniper: Good changes, I can't object much to the intent here. The razorback changes are positives. Although I can't agree with the Darwin's Danger Shield changes. The existing design needed to be replaced, but flares and particularly scorch shots provided a way to cause snipers to flinch and thus not pose a severe threat at range. Without that ability, Pyros cannot attack snipers easily except with Detonator jumps. But because of the massive self damage from Detonator jumps, the Pyro can usually be killed with a body shot, thus the Pyro loses the ability to counter the Sniper as a result of this change. The razorback is kind of okay for two reasons, first, the Spy has other ways to kill the sniper, the Razorback makes it harder, but not impossible. The new DDS basically makes it impossible for Pyros to kill Snipers unless they somehow get behind them without the Sniper noticing. I'm not sure that there should be a change that nerfs the Pyro when the Pyro is already a rather weak class, and is near Spy in terms of being weak, perhaps even weaker. So, instead of changing the Sniper this way which makes an already weak class (the Pyro) weaker, lets change it from fire to explosions. Explosions are already rather overpowered. Simply add 50% explosion resistance instead and the DDS is balanced. Sniper already has jarate which helps against Pyros, but no explosions counter-items. This could add an interesting dynamic and break up the explosion meta as well, which would be a boon to players of every class except soldier and demo and make all classes competitively viable. As explosions are nerfed this would result in more heavies and engineers in competitive which would also buff the Spy, which needs a good competitive buff. Yes, that's right. Changing the DDS from fire resist to explosion resist buffs the Spy. Who would have thought? In fact, I'd even add a +30% fire vulnerability for good measure. The Pyro needs some love! Medic: The vita saw changes are... bad? So 4 hits can save 60% of my uber, but if I was using the Ubersaw I would instead have 100% uber now. That one wasn't well thought out was it? I don't know any way to make the current vita-saw competitively mechanics viable and not overpowered, so why bother? Start with a casually viable but not overpowered weapon and balance it into competitive. Suggested new Vita-Saw: On hit: Gain +25% HP -15 Max HP No random critical hits Crusader's Crossbow: OK Heavy: Fists of running urgently don't need such a weird mechanic. Simply extend the mini-crit duration to balance it. Small, incremental changes, are better. Firsts of steel is consider a gimmick weapon in casual. I don't know if anyone would not be aware enough to use melee in competitive, but if they don't know about that, they deserve to die. &gt;:D To reduce pocket spam simply add ""-20% healing from medic sources while active"". Problem solved. -40% overheal and -40% healing rate is another case of Valve overreacting to problems that aren't that bad and making huge changes that make the weapons useless when they weren't that overpowered to being with (see e.g., Enforcer, for case study as iconic example of a weapon that went from ""slightly better than some other guns"" to ""totally useless"" because Valve overreacted.) The chocolate bar needs a buff as well. It's basically a sad excuse for a pocket medic. Make it stack with medic overheal and it will actually be useful. Scout: Good in general, but you underestimate how severe 5 seconds of mini crits is. It should be reduced to 3 or 4 at the most. Furthermore, the -50% deploy speed will make the atomizer useless. This game does not give you very much time to react, and the weapon switching is already slow in general. Even a more modest -30% would make it more fair and not useless (probably). Some things that need changing on scout: Baby Face's Blaster: Make the speed penalty only apply when you are hit while holding the gun. Also make it charge faster. At least this way the FISH CRIT Scout can return to the casual meta! Even if it would be a broken weapon in competitive mode if you did anything more to it. Also make the crit-a-cola self mini crits only apply when you attack with the gun, and not the melee (especially the holy mackerel!). Wrap Assasin: Does anyone actually use this? Are they an idiot? I have no idea what to do here, but please make it do something remotely useful. Maybe just increase recharge rate and damage. The Sun on a Stick: Make the Sun on a Stick have 50% fire resistance instead of 25%. And/or make the scout mini-crit while burning/on fire. The Sharpened Volcano Fragment: Make a swing release a ring of flames. This gives it a better ability to do the one thing it's supposed to do, set people on fire. A longer, and more damaging, afterburn could also work. Caber: Make it explode, with at least enough damage to kill light classes like scout and spy. So maybe 150 damage, including 150 damage to self. Makes it a good weapon but also a sort of suicide weapon. Feels demoman-ish. Comments? "

(side note thanks for showing us this before hand) all class panic attack: it's a great Idea even if it's not as goofy spy amby: I have to say is not a good Idea because this is a skill based weapon that is not great because it's not adding luck and chance to a weapon that doesn't need it dead ringer:YES PLEASE OH GOD PLEASE this idea is a perfect for the dead ringer since you can no longer spam it over and over again Y.e.r.: this is not a good Idea because it pretty much screws with people that actually know how to use it with the increased cloak drain scout sandman: honestly your going in the right direction but the slower movement should be swapped with the not being able to use your weapons the bonk:this is a bad idea because it's use is to run threw choke point and kill the pick classes but you'll be slower then the pick classes so you won't be able to kill that's problem with it Pretty Boys : honestly great idea you should change it that way so you won't a stroke while trying to heal Crit-A-Cola: the changes are kinda meh but there's really no other way I could think of balancing this weapon The Atomizer: the changes are also kinda weird for the Atomizer but what you could do is make so every 3 jumps you can't double or triple jump for 2 seconds after wards of like you only have limited amount of 3 triple jumps and you have to wait a while to get them back Flying Guillotine: FOR THE LOVE OF GOD NO I NEEDS TO HAVE THE STUNNED PLAYER MECHANIC TO ACTUALLY BE GOOD SO PLEASE DON'T ADD THIS Soldier base jumper: um honestly it's really weird and I can't and I don't if your trying to make the soldier into more of bullet whore Mantreads: yeah do it the Mantreads really need a buff sniper Darwins Danger Shield: um I don't really care what you do to it it's just the most cancerous thing to fight against as a sniper so please just don't let the survive from a headshot Razor back: yeah no Its really not worth the overheal penalty especially in competitive medic Vita saw:um it's weird I do't even know how to balance it correctly so um yeah your asking the wrong guy because medic is my least played class Crusader's Crossbow:Yeah it sorta needs a nerf because getting with it is really quick so I'm ok with this Heavy Literally every minigun: Yes please yes and more yes Gloves of Running Urgently:no it's really weird what you did and honestly this should be more like after you stop using them for 5 second your as fast as a brass beast heavy Eviction Notice: don't change it and if you are going to change it make it so the vulnerability is only you have the Eviction Notice out Fist of Steel: honestly I'm sorta in the middle with in one side i heals allot slower but in the other side it gives uber faster so um idunno test I guess Engineer Rescue Ranger:don't change it it's great as it is well tf2 team please consider adding my suggestion into the game and may you have a nice rest of your day xoxo Soulzune 
202,vulnerability,tf2,The Pyro Update: My Thoughts on Game Balancing [WORK IN PROGRESS],0,6jhtaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6jhtaq/the_pyro_update_my_thoughts_on_game_balancing/,2017-06-26 10:29:38,"**INTRODUCTION** I've played TF2 since mid-2014 so to say that I'm a veteran is a bit of a stretch. However, after about 3 years and having experienced much of TF2 (Quickplay, Casual, Competitive, Jump Maps, x10, Randomizer, etc) as well as learning how to do most intermediate-to-advanced tech of each class (Rocket Jumping, Airshots [not the fake Direct Hit ones but actual stock airshots] as Demo and Soldier, trickstabs, Sigafoo Save, Sentry Jumping, flick aim, etc), I'd daresay that I am a jack-of-all-trades, although not necessarily a master of all. That said, I hope that you are assured to a certain degree that what you are about to read is not another shitpost about complaining about Lime Scouts or hackers or etc but rather a comprehensive commentary about game balancing. **WEAPON BALANCING** Weapon balancing, no doubt will definitely be an important aspect of the Pyro Update so in this section, I'll go over all the released balance changes as well as all of the weapons that, in my opinion, need re-balancing. **The Scout** The Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol Buff There's not really much to say about this one. The rationale behind it was justified and the buff itself is well-executed. The PBPP should find itself a role in the meta after the upcoming balances. The Bonk! Atomic Punch Nerf Overall, this is also a good nerf. By applying the speed penalties, this will place an even greater emphasis on positioning during the invincibility period will add a greater degree of skill to the weapon and teach its newer users the value of good positioning, which is especially important for Scout. The Crit-A-Cola Nerf The Crit-A-Cola, in short, is a broken weapon in its current state. It takes all of what makes Scout good and just makes him better (albeit for 8 seconds). The 10% damage vulnerability was effectively irrelevant coupled with the move speed bonus and the Marked For Death penalty afterwards just made it so the Scout had to exit the battlefield a little bit earlier, which wasn't a problem given the move speed bonus. The nerf, however, remedies all this. By adding a penalty *during* the Mini-Crit state, Scout is forced to be more wary of taking damage and thus, the Scout must have a sense of position as well as gamesense as to knowing how many enemies is too many. The removal of the speed bonus only serves to enforce this. The Atomizer Balance Unfortunately, this is an instance in which VALVe had the right goal in mind but executed it in the wrong way. The new balance change essentially allows the Scout to switch to the Atomizer, hold down M1, and spam the Space Bar. The Air-Borne Mini-Crit effect is a bit too rewarding, seeing as the new Atomizer will allow Scouts to stay airborne much longer. Coupled with the attack speed penalty removal and the reduction of the damage penalty, this makes the Atomizer a powerful support-offense weapon. In short, all this balance does is empower and encourage the Scout playstyle that is Melee-SPACE-M1. The fix, in my eyes, is quite simple. The Atomizer is kinda, or should kinda be like, the Winger and the Rescue Ranger; a weapon you use more as a utility and less of something to kill enemies with. These utility-type weapons focus more on giving the user some sort of benefit but are less oriented towards killing. That said, my proposed changes to the proposed balance changes (lol) are simple: * Remove the deploy time penalty * Change the damage penalty to 29% OR Remove damage penalty and add 25% slower attack speed * Remove Mini-Crits while airborne This way, the Atomizer gets the role that it deserves: an active utility weapon. In exchange for extra mobility, the Scout's dm ability decreases, taking 2.5 seconds to kill a 125 hp class instead of 2 seconds. The Sandman-Guillotine Combo Nerf I'm sorry Blu. Looks like no more Long-Range Scout Montages :''''''''''''''''''''''''''( Anyways, looks like combo Scout is dead now. But let's look at the re-balances, beginning with the Sandman. Like Uncle Dane said in a video, movement-inhibiting abilities in MMOFPS's suck. Especially if the source of it was from some projectile that was thrown from the other side of the map and accidentally hit you. Thus, VALVe's re-balance of the Sandman makes sense. By allowing players to attack during the stun and increasing damage at long-range and decreasing refresh time all go to encourage a more skillful playstyle. There's just one problem: the Sandman itself was never good. Any somewhat-skilled player rarely equipped it alone. What made the Sandman frustrating to play against was not the Sandman itself; it was the Flying Guillotine. The one aspect that sort of kept the combo in check, however, was the -15 hp penalty. But in the upcoming update, this combo will cease to exist, meaning that the -15 hp penalty will go from a minor inhibitor to a larger problem. Thus, I propose 2 changes: * Remove the -15 hp penalty * Add a 15% damage penalty on the bat These changes will make the Sandman viable as its own weapon instead of part of a combo and will also orient the weapon more towards the ball. Moving onto the Guillotine... The balances to the Guillotine seem, in part, somewhat counter-intuitive. VALVe said that their goal was to remove randomness and reward accuracy yet they choose to remove long-range Mini-Crits...? Once again, this is a balance that had the right motives but the wrong execution. That said, I have 1 revision: * Bring back long-range Mini-Crits A Mini-Crit from the Guillotine is only 67.5 (68) damage and the Scout won't be able to throw another cleaver for another 4.5 seconds which is plenty of time for a hit enemy to retreat. Without long-range Mini-Crits, the Flying Guillotine would be quite useless. The Mini-Crit will help enforce urgency for enemies hit by the weapon because unlike a regular hit, they can't just wave it off and keep fighting. On top of that, it does exactly what VALVe wants the cleaver to do: it rewards accuracy. **The Soldier** The B.A.S.E. Jumper Nerf This is, in my opinion, a good nerf but in more than 1 way. This goes parallel with VALVe's idea of increasing the skill it requires to use a weapon which is always good. However, this nerf also indirectly nerfs the Chute-Air Strike Combo and will force these players to be more keen about their positioning, as less air control and no re-deploy allows little room for error. The Mantreads Buff Once again: right idea, wrong approach. VALVe compares the use rate of the Mantreads to the Gunboats but then forgets what makes the Gunboats good, which is kinda sad given the Gunboats only have 1 stat. Anyways, this buff will do little to remedy the the simplicity of making the decision of which boot to wear to kick Heavy's Communist ass back to Russia with. The extension of push-force resistance is nice and air control is always welcome but these changes don't put the Mantreads on par with the Gunboats. The Gunboats are good because they allow the Soldier to rocket jump whilst taking minimal self-damage, thus greatly increasing his potential for mobility *without decreasing his damage potential*. If the Mantreads are to be even remotely on par with then Gunboats, they must be able to do at least that much. Here is my proposed addition: * -39.13% (39%) damage to self This effectively means that you will be taking about 28 damage per rocket jump using the default Rocket Launcher. While that might seem like a HUGE buff, understand this: the Mantread, in its current state offers very situational benefits. You've got to land on top of a person to make any use out of it or you've got to be getting pushed around a lot. What this buff does is that it makes the choice between Mantreads and Gunboats more dependent on map knowledge and gamesense: Do I choose to take a miniscule amount of damage rocket jumping or do I choose to take some more damage but be able to kill people by landing on them. For example on cp_process, if you're pushing Mini-Spire, you may be more inclined to use the Mantreads because the high skybox and openness gives more potential to land on people. Likewise, if you're pushing last on Process, you may be more inclined to use the Gunboats because the closed space and tight hallways make it more difficult to inflict substantial damage with the Mantreads. I'm going to end it here for now. Like it says in the title, this is a work in progress so I'll try to continue. If you have any questions/comments/feedback/opinions drop a comment below! Thanks for reading!"
203,vulnerability,tf2,some opinions on tf2 in general and patch notes,1,6jpdiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6jpdiq/some_opinions_on_tf2_in_general_and_patch_notes/,2017-06-27 11:07:31,"before i say anything, i think i should give some background info to make the post sound at least somewhat relevant. WHO THE HELL AM I? i have been an active tf2 player from 2012 till somewhere around 2015, in fact i created a steam account SPECIFICALLY to play tf2. i have 2.4k hours in that game(i hate my life) and i have spent some time in the competitive scene with no major success. i was told that i am a good player by some plat and gold etf2l div players but i seriously doubt that they were honest, in fact i think i still suck major balls at sixes and highlander. i am not big on talking with the general tf2 community, not out of some sense of superiority but because i generally don't care to. i was also told by multiple people that /r/tf2 is a terrible place and i should stay away from it but i don't care, as my reasons are simple: valve is trying to communicate with the community and in the current environment, where the game has dropped below payday 2 in player count and, considering just how bad that game is in comparison, that is a legitimately weird concept to me. i don't want to one day come back home from work and sit down to play tf2 only to realize that the only servers that are still active are skial 32 player servers. i loved the game for it's stupid pub fun and for it's competitive scene and i don't want that to die anytime soon, so i would like to put some effort into preserving the game by hopefully leaving a message that the tf2 team will read. speaking of which, if the tf2 team is reading this, HI GUYS CAN YOU PLEASE GIVE ME A FREE BURNING TEAM CAPTAIN?? WHAT IS MY VIEW OF TF2 AS IT IS RIGHT NOW tf2 has always had a weird, schizophrenic idea of what balance is and should be, and i'd say that right now it's not as bad as it used to be but an even more unsettling issue of stagnancy is being presented to us. there's just not enough being done by the TF2 team. they might be working their assess off but here's the thing about them doing their work: as long as we don't see results, we don't know IF they did any work. their communication skills would have been fine if we saw that they consistently do good stuff in a regular manner but i think we can all agree that the job they do is not only not satisfactory to most people, but is also done at such a pace that i am afraid the next big update will happen when humanity will create a cost effective nuclear fusion reactor. thus, no matter what we expect from valve we gotta realize that they have a reputation as inconsistent, slow and at times almost blind to the community's requests, a blatant example would be the gunslinger's crit bug or, if we're talking about the company as a whole, greenlight and refunds. just to clarify, i am not hating on the company, i just think that they are better at creating initial product and making it successful than fine-tuning them. now, the game currently has one very big issue - most of it's stock content that came with the package in 2007 is very much fine. i am, of course, talking about the classes, their weapons and overall balance of the game cuz early maps were either bad, variations on tfc maps or hydro. the only thing that irks me about vanilla balance is the pyro but he has always been an out of place class who's only obvious utility was spychecking. now, in it's current shape tf2 is, in my honest opinion, bloated with too much damn content that was put in the game without too much thought. thus, on top of the general difficulty of balancing 9 distinct classes you also gotta take into account that each class has around 20 or so weapons, thus making it so that if you are balancing one weapon you gotta take into account how it interacts with 9 classes multiplied by the weapon count in tf2 minus reskins. on top of that, you gotta consider subclasses such as the demoknight, gunslinger engie, lucksman sniper, et cetera. it's no damn wonder that the team is so barebones and works so slowly in such a horrifying clustertruck of variables, you gotta either draw the short straw or really love the game to still work with THAT mess. one of the issues that i see with the game is that it's filled with artifacts from older design decisions and throw-shit-at-the-wall style of weapon balancing. an example: the shortstop. upon release it was a very powerful primary, the main idea behind it was such: give the scout another primary shotgun that wasn't like a regular scattergun, is better for slightly longer ranges than the scattergun and can reload faster than the scattergun due to the gun reloading all shots at once instead of being loaded one at a time like the scattergun. doesn't sound too bad, right? sounds like a reasonable alternative to a gun that we all already like and it gives scout a slightly different effective range. but unfortunately, every single one of you is a sinner and must suffer, which is why jesus christ made it part of a polycount set. for those who are new and innocent, polycount sets were loadouts that typically consisted of 2-3 weapons and a hat that would give you stat bonuses, such as: -additional hp -extra speed -sentry gun fire resistance et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. point is, this was unfair because f2p players couldn't afford having hats and premium players basically had better stats than their f2p counterparts. frankly, the difference is minor, but as a scout if you had a full milkman set without the milkman hat you would've been disadvantaged compared to a scout with that set and the corresponding hat. sucks to be you, boi. thankfully, that wouldn't be the case for very long. in 2013-14, valve decided to remove the polycount set bonuses and make it so that the weapons would have the bonuses spread around among them. for some weapons that worked out very well - the powerjack, although it still didn't compete with the pure insane DPS potential of the axtinguisher, became an interesting utility alternative for pyro. it became sorta like a sprint button with a minor bullet damage debuff that seemed like a very fair trade off. other weapons, such as the aforementioned shortstop, had to go through some rather ridiculous balance changes. i suggest you read my description of the shortstop from 2 paragraphs above and ask this question - how does a pushback debuff and a healing buff come into play in what i have described? the two go together like cake and pizza, it just makes no goddamn sense unless you know the history of the polycount sets. then they removed the healing buff, decreased the pushback debuff and give the gun a pushback mechanic. valve have, for no reason other than the gun's history, tempered with what is the essence of the gun and made it into something that makes no goddamn sense anymore. they haven't ruined the gun, i am just saying that if you were to look at tf2 without considering it's history this balancing would have made 0 sense to you. why does that gun make me easier to push? cuz it weighs less? why can i push with that gun but not with any other scout primary or secondary? what is the purpose of the push? another example i can bring to the table is the sniper's ""no headshots allowed"" set (trust me, that is the official name of the set, don't believe anyone that says otherwise). at first it was just a weird idea, this made the sniper into some sort of debuffer with 150 hp that can't be headshotted by other snipers. then the tf2 removed the headshot invulnerability and instead gave the darwin's danger shield a 15% bullet resistance, which means a sniper can survive an uncharged headshot if he wears that. this made the DDS into an absolutely insane OP beast that would make fighting a sniper with it an uphill battle for snipers without the item. i honestly believe that the tf team didn't think properly as to how that will affect the game because this is just too broken and i am glad they are considering removing the bullet resistance and giving DDS some other utility. my suggestion would be to make it another item focused around the sniper's overall survival in combat without making him able to survive a headshot. maybe give him a speedboost when unscoped and below a certain amount of health to make escapes easier? eh, i dunno, just throwing that out there. i think i made my point with the weapon balance clear. some of the stuff is straight up silly or OP, let's discuss other facets of the game that i don't think are well thought out. mainly, game modes and general innovations that have been introduced in the last 2-3 years. this game has too many game modes that are perfectly good but haven't been expanded on, too many game modes that have been straight up abandoned and in general feel like the tf team throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks. there are too many to list. i would attribute this to this notion that the developers with big fanbases seem to have that they can just throw a feature into the air and watch what the community creates. i would say that it makes sense - the community will probably make cool maps and all the heavy lifting with the code and networking has been done by the devs, the artists and map designers can now go crazy. i have absolutely no problem with that except for one issue, mainly the fact that the already limited tf2 team is focusing on making tf2 american football instead of fixing the core experience. i had fun in most game modes that valve have introduced, it's just that i don't think that they are in the state in which they can afford to spend time on moonbase robot fighting or tf2 american football or tf2 karts. speaking of which, add some new mvm maps volvo alright, alright, the game modes are broken and the guns are broken. what else ya got? well, i could talk about the class balance outside of pubs. in public servers, it doesn't really matter what class you play, if you've got good enough game sense you can literally wreck even as a spy without cloaking or disguising. let's talk about the pyro first. as i said, he is a very niche class that has some nice utilities but isn't terribly important to a team. let's just say that if my pyro died in highlander i never felt like we've got no chance of winning the next team fight. the spy also has an inherent problem that is a part of his core design - he relies on deception, a team that is aware of his existence will start checking behind their backs every 4-5 seconds and that's it, your spy is now simply there to give you intel, zap the engie buildings and fail to backstab the medic. i don't think that's very exciting, my duderinos. now unto 6s and general usefulness of each available character in the game. classes that have the best balance in the game are the ones that are considered core in 6s. you've got an amazing team that can do anything in just 3 classes - demo is amazing at area denial and massive AoE damage, scout is able to easily go into the enemy team and do serious damage on single targets and soldier is able to do both tasks. i am ignoring the medic because he is kind of a must pick in every possible situation, there's not a single case in which not having a medic is beneficial to the team. every other class is utility and fills a niche role in which he is better than one of the above in some area but either lacks the mobility or often doesn't do enough to justify being picked all the time. again, spy and pyro come to mind - they are situational. the tf team either has to make them less situational or increase their usefulness in those niche situations to make them feel comparably powerful when in a team. maybe i explained this in a way that seems convoluted, so let me give you a tl;dr: death of some classes is less important than others and i want to see an increase in the value of a pyro and a spy in a team. PATCHNOTES AND WHAT I THINK ABOUT THEM first of all, thank you for even attempting to balance this mess of a video game. without further ado, let's look into the changes Panic Attack 50% faster switch speed 50% more pellets 30% less damage Fires a wide, fixed shot pattern (regardless of server settings) Shot pattern grows with successive shots (e.g. while holding down the attack button), but resets after you stop firing or reload i disagree with this change. panic attack is, in essence, a shotgun that fires a volley of shots. the idea that it should have increased spread as your health gets lower is utterly insane, that will only make your survival even more difficult. what you WANT to do is make it easier for you to survive in a pinch. how about a damage ramp up on successive shots and/or amount of hp lost? Ambassador First-shots are no longer perfectly accurate. Bullet-spread is instead reduced by 50%. This makes head shots less reliable at long range, while still very viable at close and medium-range. i see this as a positive change. maybe decrease the bullet spread on 1st shot by 75-80% but we'll see how that one goes. Dead Ringer Ammo kits and dispensers no longer refill the Spy's cloak meter i will admit to being personally biased against the dead ringer, i just think that it's a frustrating mechanic to play with. that said, i am afraid that the tf team will nerf this thing into the ground, to the point where it's just an inferior way to play spy Your Eternal Reward Removed: ""Cannot disguise"" penalty Added: Non-kill disguises require (and consume) a full cloak meter Backstab-based disguises are still free Increased cloak drain rate by 50% legitimately my favorite thing about this list. i used to love the saharan spy set because of the playstyle that it provided. it was a unique experience and if you enjoy spy and haven't tried dead ringer + YER then i highly recommend you try that out on a pub server, it's a very intense experience. Sandman Long-range ball impacts no longer remove the victim's ability to fire their weapon (but the victim is still slowed) We've updated achievements that were looking for disarmed players Max range balls now do 50% increased damage (from a base of 15) The flight time required to trigger the ""max"" effect has been reduced by 20% Ball regeneration time reduced to 10 seconds (from 15) i like this change as well. crowd control that removes player's agency is a terrible mechanic that is not fun to fight against because you are literally unable to do anything once you're hit by it, just slowly slug your way into some direction, hoping that the scout will miss his next few shots and the medic will heal you and the stars will align, etc. that said, ambushing heavies as a scout with sandman will be a bit harder. [s]Dr Pepper[/s] Bonk Apply a slow effect to the player after phasing wears off, based on the amount of damage they absorbed From -25% at low damage, to -65% at 200+ damage Lasts 5 seconds hmmm... not sure about that one. as a scout, i used bonk in one of 2 scenarios - to suck up the damage of an ubered heavy or get through a sentry nest. i might have to think more about that one, i feel as if it should be nerfed further. Pocket Pistol +15% firing speed Up to +7 hp per hit (from +5) -25% clip size (9 shots) the original design of the gun was to simply make it a shitty pistol that gives you a healthy hp bonus. that was a terrible idea, it wasn't an interesting weapon to use, in fact i think no one used it for anything other than the hp buff. the newer iteration gave you the ability to heal when hitting a target but 5 hp per hit is like lmao, might as well just go look for a health pack. this is a good buff, however i doubt it should be buffed anywhere beyond this point. i agree that no fall damage was a stupid stat to give to a class that can literally jump before he hits the ground. [s]Coca-Cola mixed with Columbian Cocaine[/s] Crit-a-Cola Added: Each attack while active adds Marked-For-Death debuff for 5 seconds (does not stack) Removed: Marked-For-Death when effect expires Removed: +25% move speed bonus Removed: +10% damage taken penalty effectively what you're getting is the old crit-a-cola which allowed you to minicrit enemies but also made any hits on you minicrits, minus the speed bonus cuz why the hell was that in there in the first place. approved for pubs but it will never be seen in legitimate competitive play simply due to the fact that it gives you a damage boost Atomizer Triple-jump is now only possible while the bat is deployed Removed: Self-inflicted damage when triple-jumping Removed: Attack speed penalty Added: Melee attacks done while airborne mini-crit Added: 50% deploy time penalty (to prevent quick-switch by-pass) Reduced damage penalty vs players to -15% (from -20%) ok, so first things first - atomizer is a utility melee weapon. don't try to make it into a gimmicky combat weapon, i genuinely don't feel like minicritting as a scout while airborne is a fun mechanic. you have a scattergun that has a higher dps up close, use the pistol for god's sake. might be fun to humiliate people with but i see no reason for that addition. as for the triple jump change - totes. reason why it was banned in comp is that a scout is already hard to hit due to his double jump and now he can literally avoid your rocket twice while taking minimal damage and shooting you with his very damaging scattergun. now it's not so much of a straight up buff to scout and more of a utility weapon. good job volvo Flying Guillotine Removed: Crit vs stunned players Removed: Mini-crits at long range Added: Long range hits reduce recharge (by 1.5 seconds) Distance considered ""long range"" reduced by half of the previous value when determining mini-crits personally, i felt like the stun + cleaver combo was a bit like the pyro's fire + flare combo. it seemed fine to me cuz you gotta hit 2 projectiles at very long range to get the combo. that said, even without that the cleaver is a very good secondary - basically a rechargeable meatshot! not good enough as an alternative to pistol though, might need further buffs after this change [s]absolute bullshit[/s] Base Jumper Reduced amount of air control while deployed by 50% Removed the ability to re-deploy the parachute once retracted (until the player lands on the ground again) Y E S. anyone who used that thing to avoid getting airshotted is a terrible person and i hope we never meet in person Mantreads +75% push-force reduction now includes airblast Added: +200% air control when blast jumping air control boost will only help in 2 scenarios - elaborate rocket jumps and avoiding an airshot. the 1st situation almost no one outside the rocket jumping community will care about, the 2nd might be the reasoning for this thing getting banned in comp in the future. pushback resistance is a meme. Darwin's Danger Shield Counter ranged burn attacks (e.g. flares), and strengthen melee fights vs Pyros Afterburn immunity +50% fire resist a)cozy camper already deals with the most annoying part of flare rockets, which is flinching b)how often do you even see pyros getting close to you as a sniper. too situational, i suggest making it trigger a speed boost at certain health percentage. Razorback Added: -100% overheal penalty Added: Shield regenerates after 30 seconds agreed. snipers that have razorback + pocket medic are nigh unstoppable and require intense amount of teamwork to take out, either that or a lucky charge headshot. shield regeneration is also nice, means you don't have to run to spawn. Vita-Saw Added ""Organs"" collecting concept (... you know, hit someone with a saw, and out pops a vital organ which you then take, and hold). Each hit with the Vita-Saw harvests the victim's organs (shown on the HUD). Added: On-death, preserve 15% ubercharge per Organ harvested. This effect caps at 60%. so let me put it this way. i hit a guy 4 times with the vita-saw while having 10 less hp and i get potential 60% uber if i die... or i take the ubersaw, hack someone 4 times while having 150 health and get full uber. i can see this maybe being a crutch for medics that can't survive for shit on pubs but this is too risky for comp. Medic's Crossbow Ubercharge gain rate reduced in the same way that the Medigun's healing (and therefore, Ubercharge build rate) is - based on the last time the target was in combat Reduced by a third when 1 - 10 seconds outside of combat, and scales up to normal over 10 - 15 seconds i see these as just quality of life improvements for medic, nothing much to say miniguns The 1-second damage and accuracy penalty now applies to the first second of spun-up time, whether or not the Heavy is firing. Previously, the 1-second damage penalty would only be removed after 1 second of firing. Accuracy and damage penalties now reset when the Heavy spins down, rather than when the Heavy stops firing. This means if you stay spun-up beyond one second, and fire in bursts, damage and accuracy will remain at 100%. quality of life change. i still don't see the point of why heavy has to rev up his minigun for it to do full damage though. you already need time to wait for heavy to lower the minigun before he can shoot it, now you have even more delay before you can do real damage. just why? maybe someone can explain it to me GRU Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-10/sec), and regenerated while holstered Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time Each time the gloves are deployed, the drain rate is accelerated for a brief period of time Removed: Marked-For-Death effect while active Removed: 25% damage penalty an interesting change. this gives me what is basically a getaway/sprint ability but in turn it decreases my healthpool over time, presumably till i reach zero health and die. yeah, i am ok with this. good job team Eviction Notice Added: Max-health is drained while item is active (-5/sec), and regenerated while holstered. Health will regenerate only the amount drained while active - minus any damage taken during that time. Removed: 20% damage vulnerability i mean, considering that the brass knuckles were made into GRU 2 i see this as simply making it slightly more up to speed with the original GRUs. i have no further comments. Fists of Steel Added: 40% overheal reduction while active Added: 40% healing rate penalty while active ok so here's the deal, this is what i was talking about when i was talking about weapon balance - the tf team added a thing into the game and now don't know how to make it not OP while also keeping it as a reasonable item to equip. the whole point of fists of steel is that you are a behemoth. i doubt heavies will trade the damage reduction for overheal Rescue Ranger Ranged repairs now consume metal (at a 4-to-1 health-to-metal ratio, e.g. repairing 60 damage costs 15 metal) i like where this is going. as of right now, i think that it's ridiculous just how difficult it can be to kill a sentry gun even if you're an ubered heavy standing right next to the sentry gun because the engie can juggle between rescure rangering, wranglering and repairing the sentry gun and then you've wasted your uber, the single most powerful ability, on a failed attempt to destroy a sentry gun. needs further nerfs though. thank you if you read this whole thing, i really appreciate it."
204,vulnerability,tf2,My own email to Valve about the potential balance changes.,8,6jvx1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6jvx1n/my_own_email_to_valve_about_the_potential_balance/,2017-06-28 07:28:32,"These are just my own opinions, I'm not perfect, I don't know everything. That said, I've played since 2009, and purchased an Orange Box set back in 2008. I have what I consider a fairly decent knowledge of the game, but I don't know everything. Anyone can email the TF2 team, so if you disagree go and tell them. Here's my email to Valve: ""I really like that the team has chosen to share what they are doing with the community, and I really hope that you continue doing this. TF2 remains my most played game of all time, even though I don't play it quite as much anymore. I know I'm not Banny, or a well known YouTuber with a following, but I hope that you take my input into consideration. Here is my take on your proposed changes that you have listed in the recent blog post on June 20, 2017. To start, I want to say that I think the TF2 team is likely trying to balance most everything for Competitive play. This is a good thing to do, but I think they should not loose sight of the more casual game play that most of the the community enjoys. I also want to mention that Man vs Machine is still a fun thing to do from time to time, and I wouldn't want that to see it forgotten. - Panic Attack: I really like the panic attack In it's current un-patched form, in which you can load multiple shots, and choose when to unload all of them in rapid succession. I believe the reason that it is not used it not because it is not viable, or well designed, but because 3 of the 4 classes that can use it, don't use it as a primary weapon. The engineer however (which while not my favorite class, is one that I really enjoy playing) can use it highly effectively, and I feel that it is a wasted potential to simply remove the current form of The Panic Attack from the game entirely. You said it in the blog post itself, The Panic Attack ""fights against the basic concept of the secondary slot on classes that can use this weapon."" But for the Engineer, this isn't a secondary weapon, it's a primary weapon, and it fills that role just fine. The other classes don't use it, not because it's a bad weapon that needs to be changed, but because they need a different kind of weapon for their secondary slot. Not to mention that the current mechanics match the theme of The Panic Attack's model quite well. With all that said, your proposed changes that you have presented, are not a bad idea. But they are the stats for an entirely different, and NEW shotgun. The community is always asking for new weapons, and this is great opportunity to give them that. I propose that the TF2 team make ""The Panic Attack"" Engineer (and maybe Heavy) only. I then propose that you take your new Panic Attack ideas, and turn them into a new secondary weapon for the Soldier, Pyro, and Heavy. This should leave the Engineer with a good offensive primary weapon alternative to the default shotgun, and give the classes that need a good secondary alternative, the new option they deserve at the same time. TL;DR: The Panic Attack is designed to be a primary weapon, and as such should be left for the Engineer. Instead of getting rid of the original idea altogether, give the other 3 classes a new shotgun with the stats you are considering giving the panic attack. - Ambassador: The Ambassador is an interesting weapon, that is fun to use when your aim is on point. It also allows for those who might enjoy pistol play from games like Counter Strike to have a weapon that they are familiar with. The changes proposed for the Ambassador make sense, and appear to accomplish their goal. TL;DR: I approve of the changes. EDIT: I did not see the arguments for the Ambassador until after I sent the email, but I would rather the weapon had damage falloff, over inaccuracy. The proposition seems to be that instead of a full crit, after so many hammer units, headshots would only grant mini-crits, and then eventually no crits at all. In my reaction to the Amassador, I mention that it is a weapon that might feel familiar to a CS:GO player, and this is more inline with that, since CS:GO uses damage falloff. - Dead Ringer: I have had more experience playing against a Dead Ringer than I have playing with it. This is because I don't play Spy very often. The current state of the watch appears to be very forgiving, and allows for players that know a map's ammo location to stay alive far longer than one would expect. I like the balance change, and feel that a good player can still make use of it without feeling like it isn't viable anymore. TL;DR: I approve of the changes. - Your Eternal Reward: In Pub games I have seen Your Eternal Reward be used highly effectively by players that know how too blend in. However in a competitive game that has good communication, you must almost always rely on cloaking, and a team will always know who has been killed, so your disguise will be useless. Even if you manage to face a team that doesn't realize who you have killed, you need to know how to convincingly act like the enemy team, which takes a lot of game knowledge, and experience. Adding to this, if for any reason you need to use your pistol, you have to rely on cloaking to get around again. Allowing the player to disguise with it gets rid of half of this problem, makes the weapon more viable in a competitive environment, and makes it friendly to more casual players that haven't mastered the art of blending in as well. TL;DR: I approve of the changes. - Sandman: The changes proposed appear to be going in to the right direction, and I think that giving players the ability to fight back is a good idea. That said I think that the theme of being hit in the head with a hard object should be kept in mind a little bit more. When you say ""Long-range ball impacts no longer remove the victim's ability to fire their weapon (but the victim is still slowed)"" Do you mean that movement alone is slowed? Or do you mean that movement, and fire rate are slowed? I think that decreasing the fire rate of the affected target would be in theme with getting hit in the head, but I don't think it will matter too much either way. What I would like to see included with the slow movement, is a decrease in accuracy of all weapons while under the slow effects. The reason I want to decrease accuracy is because I believe the Sandman should effect all targets equally, and only effecting movement isn't really a downside for the Heavy. He already moves slow as hell when he's firing his Minigun. It should allow for the target to fight back, but it should impair their ability to do so, heavy included. TL;DR: I mostly approve of the proposed changes, However slowing movement does not effect the heavy when he attacking. Classes should be able to fight back, but they should still be hindered somehow. Decreasing the accuracy of ranged weapons while the effects of being hit in the head are active, would equally affect all classes, even the heavy. - Bonk! Atomic Punch: Against an experienced team, the Bonk! Atomic Punch can be compared to the Invis Watch, because they both cause the enemy team to ignore you. In the same way that timing your uncloaking badly and revealing yourself in front of an enemy will result in your death, timing your Bonk! Atomic Punch badly, and having it end in front of and enemy will likely also result in your death. The point I'm making is that being slowed after you use the Bonk! Atomic Punch will only affect you if it ends in front of an enemy, which it already punished. The proposed changes would alter this because they encourage the enemy team to chase the scout, and give him a longer slow once it's effects have worn off. This actually helps a coordinated team, because the enemy team is more likely to be distracted chasing the scout, which they can use right before a push. This is an interesting possibility, and I would like to see if it has an affect on game play. TL;DR: I'm not sure if the proposed changes will effect game play very much because coordinated teams usually ignore bonked scouts, because it's better to push forward, than to be distracted by a damage immune target. The changes would encourage this distraction, which could result in potential openings for pushes and such. I approve because I'm curious as to whether it will have any effect. - Pretty Boys Pocket Pistol: As you have mentioned the damage vulnerability the weapon has, counters any benefit it might give you. Removing the damage vulnerability is the best thing you could have done. The new reduced clip size is a decent downside that doesn't seem to make the weapon loose it's viability. TL;DR: I approve of the changes. - Crit-A-Cola: Removing the movement speed bonus is a good nerf that keeps the Crit-A-Cola viable. Changing the way marked for death aspect works is interesting and I look forward to seeing how this effects game play. TL;DR: I approve of the changes. - The Atomizer: Forcing the player to switch to the Atomizer is a good nerf, and does what you wanted by letting the enemy know what's going on. The slowed switch speed doesn't seem like it's going to have a noticeable effect, except when trying to switch back to your gun. TL;DR: I approve of the changes, but I don't know if the slowed switch speed is necessary. - Flying Guillotine Removing the crit to stunned/slowed players is not a bad idea (I believe bleeding players are still effected?) but it would be interesting if the combo with the Sandman was kept intact somehow, as that combo did take skill to pull off. If that combo was somehow kept in the game, I would appreciate it. TL;DR: I approve of the changes, but I would like to see the Sandman combo kept in tact somehow. - B.A.S.E Jumper: Removing the ability to redeploy the parachute once retracted is a good change, and makes when you retract the parachute more important, which increases the skill ceiling of the item. The steering control sounds like good change, but I would need to experience it myself to know for sure. TL;DR: I think I approve, but I would need to experience it myself to be sure. - Mantreads: In my experience, Pyros were not usually aware that I was above them when I used these, so I'm not sure how effective the air blast push force reduction will be, but I see no problems with adding it, so I welcome the change regardless. The 200% increase in air control is very interesting, I look forward to seeing how it effects rocket jumping. Have you considered letting the Demoman use these? It's not necessary, but he could definitely use them about as effectively. TL;DR: I approve of the changes, and look forward to seeing how improve air control effects rocket jumping. - Darwins Danger Shield: The new design will only be effective against Pyros, which are a mostly close range class. Pyros typically will not be much of a threat at long range if you are a good sniper, because flare gunning a sniper to death was already pretty futile to begin with. This change sounds like it will only effect close range encounters where a Pyro somehow isn't seen by your team, sneaks up on you, and tries to flame thrower you to death. The After burn resistance will save you a few times when you otherwise wouldn't have been able to reach a health pack, but in a competitive environment where Pyros are rarely seen, this item will almost never be used. It's not a bad, it's just not going to be used very often. The Razorback works because Spys are able to get behind enemy lines really easily by cloaking, or disguising, and taking out an effective sniper is near the top of their ""to do"" list. TL;DR: Countering Pyros isn't going to be enough of an incentive to convince most players to use this item, and it will almost never see competitive play. - Razorback: I have never really liked this item, because it only counters a single class, and does nothing else for you. However is it still an effective item, because Spys are very good at getting behind enemy lines and killing anyone who isn't aware of their surroundings, which a scoped in Sniper never will be. The over heal penalty seems harsh, but I don't mind it. Regenerating after 30 seconds is somewhat quick, but as long as it gives a Spy long enough to get his second stab in before it regenerates, it should be fine. TL;DR: I approve, but I wonder if regenerating after 30 seconds might be a little too fast? - Vita-Saw: The Vita-Saw was not an item I saw very much of. Most players went for the Ubersaw in pubs, and competitive has banned it since as long as I can remember. The idea of collecting organs as the medic, is very thematic to his character, and I like it. The risk of needing to actually use your melee weapon, is quite high, but is in line with the Ubersaw, so I see no problems. TL;DR: I approve of the changes, and look forward to collecting player's organs. - Crusader's Crossbow I love this weapon. I used to be quite good with it, but I'm pretty bad right now. Changing the Uberchage rate to be more in line with the Medigun sounds like good change, and I see nothing wrong with doing so. TL;DR: I approve of these changes. - All Miniguns I like the idea of burst firing to try to more accurately pick someone off who is running away. I see no problems with these canges. TL;DR: I approve of these changes. - Gloves of Running Urgently I personally felt that being marked for death while having the Gloves of Running Urgently active was enough of a downside, because the marked for death effect stayed active few a few seconds after you switch away. Unless you wanted the enemy to crit you, you needed to stay in cover for a few seconds for the mark to go away. It sounds like this makes you do the same thing, except it's not a mark of death, it's your health draining as if you were under water too long, but once you switch away, or come above the surface of the water, your health returns. I think this is fine as long as there is a maximum amount of health that can be drained. I don't think that you should suicide just for having these on for too long. Cap it out at say, 60% of your health drained, and I would be more okay with it. Don't forget Man v. Machine either, because these are a go-to on that game mode. TL;DR: Being marked for death made you want to stay hidden for a bit after switching away, and this does the same thing, so it's fine, but I would like to see a cap for the amount of maximum health drained from this effect. - Eviction Notice Was this weapon used very much anyway? I don't remember it being very popular in comparison to the Gloves of Running Urgently. It seems like you are just making the same change to this, that you did to the Gloves of Running Urgently. I suppose that's fine, but just as I wanted a cap to the maximum health drained from the GorU, I also want that cap placed on this weapon. TL;DR: The changes are okay, but I want a cap on the maximum amount of health drained. - Fists of Steel I think the overheal reduction is fine, since the damage reduction so good in the right situations. I would need to test it out in game to see if the heal rate penalty is too high or not. TL;DR: I think I approve, but the heal penalty would need to be experienced to tell for sure. - Rescue Ranger This change is so intuitive, that I'm surprised to wasn't on the weapon on release. The metal drain is still better than using your wrench, so there's incentive to use the weapon still. I think this is the best, most logical change you have proposed. TL;DR: I highly approve of these changes. Now that I have gone through everything in the blog post, I would like to make some suggestions for the other weapons in the game, that I feel could benefit from some balancing. - Soda Popper This weapon used to give minicrits, and so it's skin, which features Crit-a-cola, made sense. In it's current state, it no longer gives crits, but instead gives mobility, so I would like to see the weapon skin changed to feature Bonk Atomic Punch. This is more a quality of life change, and I wouldn't care too much if it never happened. - Sun-on-a-Stick In my opinion this thing needs help, and badly. It's only useful if you are working closely with a Pyro, and if you are doing that, then you aren't fulling the role of the Scout as well as you could be when using almost any other weapon. The problem is that this weapon requires players to use it on burning enemies, to make it effective, but the Scout lacks any method of lighting someone on fire. I propose that the Sun-on-a-Stick be given an alt fire. This alt fire could work in 2 different ways. The first is to make the Sun-on-a-Stick launch out a small fire ball, that does no impact damage, and only lights players on fire. It would be on a cool down like the Sandman. The fireball would arc just like a Sandman baseball, but it would be destroyed if it hit anything, just like a lock-n-load pill. The afterburn would only last maybe 5 seconds, so you would need to act fast. The second way the alt fire could work, is to ignite the end of the Sun-on-a-Stick, so that the next player hit would catch fire. This would only be good for a single hit, after which the Sun-on-a-Stick would no longer ignite players until a cool down finished. The initial hit would not trigger the crit, but any future hits would. For both of these alt fire methods, to counter being able to full crit anyone you want, the crit bonus should be changed to mini crits only. - Righteous Bison I liked how this weapon functioned on release, and don't really care for it in it's current state. It was not bug, it was advertised to hit the same target multiple times. Making it only able to damage up to 4 players is pretty lame, at least change the damage reduction to like 15%. It rarely even has the possibility of hitting more than 4, so it really should matter. I doubt this change will happen, but I would be happy if it did. - Scottish Handshake This weapon used to be able to break on hit just like the normal bottle, and at one point that was removed for some reason. Even it's kill icon shows it broken. I see no reason not add this effect back into the game. - Claidheamh Mr What exactly is the point of this weapon in it's current form? It used to give you a 25% charge meter on kill, and it increased the duration of your charge. Now 25% charge meter might not sound useful by itself, but when equipped with the Tideturner, a melee kill would give you a full charge meter on kill. Now instead of any of that, it gives 25 Health on kill, but with the Half-Zatoichi there's no reason to choose the Claidheamh Mr, and it just seems useless. I can understand if the charge duration was seen as too powerful, or if the 25% charge meter on kill was seen at too good when coupled with the Tideturner, but either leave one of these stats, or give it a harder downside, don't just destroy the weapon's usefulness. Please give the Claidheamh Mr back one of these two stats, so that it will have it's own purpose again. P.S.: Why is the ""Beat Me Up, Scotty"" achievement also on the Claidheamh Mr, when the achievement itself says it's for the Eyelander specifically? I don't really care, I'm just curious. Thank you for reading all of this, and I hope you take my suggestions into consideration. I look forward to the Pyro/Jungle update. - Leaf_It"" Let me know what you think Reddit.

205,vulnerability,tf2,"Weapon and class balance, Part 2 : Scout",0,6ktecs,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6ktecs/weapon_and_class_balance_part_2_scout/,2017-07-03 00:07:46,"So, I did the Spy weapon balance review, after the feedback , decided to do some additional research before posting. Here is promised Scout weapon balance: Pirmary Stock - Nothing really. Force-A-Nature - Pretty balanced towards the stock. Shortstop  the shortsop is a weapon designed more for medium range than usual close range of the scout. The problem is  it feels underwhelming. It does need some additional buff imo. Since the new push is useless atm, why not give it something useful: Enemies pushed by alt fire will take minicrit from scout for 2 seconds ( or while airborne, but I dont think that would work). This rewards scout who closes the distance with this weapon and gives additional damage to compete with other scatter guns. Some also say to buff the reload speed, but that might not be a good idea  in addition of having faster firing speed, it might lead to spamming shots if the reload is buffed too much. Soda Popper  One of the best weapons that demonstrates the devision between Casual and Competitive TF2. In casual, this weapon is perfectly balanced, but has been lately banned in Comp leagues because the Hype makes scout nearly impossible to be killed by explosives classes. The ideal thing would be to have Heavy or Engi, or even pyro deal with him, but comp meta doesnt favour those classes, so it comes out as being op. This is inherently a flaw in Comp meta. To somewhat compensate ( before comp meta becomes a little more diversive), I would say add 20% explosive damage vulnerability to scout while in hype mode might remedy it more or less  you are strong against explosive classes because you can avoid their fire, but you must be careful, otherwise you will be killed pretty easily. Makes the hype require a little bit more skill . Baby Faces Blaster  probably the worst scout primary atm. While gaining boost is easy, it is much easier to lose it - only 25 damage and you are back to 120% speed again Basically a breeze will deplete the whole meter. So, with an upside that is negated easily, inconsistent speed, 2 less shells in the magazine and 10% slower move speed make it a direct downgrade from stock To make it a little bit viable, I would suggest: + 25% more accurate ( similar to the old upside). + Dealing damage charges the speed meter. Alt-Fire while the meter is full : gain 60% speed boost ( basically you gain 173% movement speed) for 10 seconds, dealing damage charges the meter ( basically, if you deal damage, you theoretically have permanent speed boost) and keep all other stats same ( maybe remove or reduce the penalty for double jumping to 50% or less too). Because the boost is fixed, it makes it consistent speed, which wont throw off the scout because of ever changing speed. Also, Since the boost is temporary, it will not mean that scout will be running around the map at the speed of light all the time like old BFB. Alternatively, add a kill collect mechanic  scouts gets faster the more he kills, like Eyelander. Back Scatter  an ok weapon, but could use several additions  Add 2 magazine size instead of -2, so scout can have max 8 shells. It clearly has bigger magazine than the Scattergun ffs , and would make for a different feel for a weapon, considering EVERY scattergun replacement has a reduced magazine size. Considering it is less accurate, it will be pretty balanced since on a little bit more range, it will need those extra shots.(If that seems a little bit op, maybe a reload speed penalty to balance it out?).Also, maybe make the range at there it will mini crit somehow indicated. Just small nitpick tbh, since the Back scatter should be used for close range anyways. Secondary Pistol and reskins  nothing really. Bonk! Atomic Punch  to me, the recent suggested changes seem a little bit too much, especially max speed penalty : -65% speed is too hefty imo, it will basically mean that scout will be a sitting duck after using the Bonk. I would say reduce it to at least  45% not too little and not too much. Imo, one way to balance this weapon would be: Since scout is basically Matrixing the shots fired at him - Direct shots pass through scout for the duration of the effect ( i.e. he dodges them), but can be hurt with splash damage. This would make it require more skill and also not make the scout a meatshield for pushes. Crit-a-Cola  the suggested stats seem pretty ok, so there is that. Mad milk  nothing really. Pretty balanced as is. Winger  nothing really. Takes the role of burst damage for finishing off the fleeing opponents. Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol  the new suggested changes are good. Maybe Too good in fact. Additional fire rate AND healing at the cost of 3 bullets in the magazine seems a tad bit op imo. It shouldnt do too much damage, since it will outclass Winger and stock pistol higher dps than both and also gains 7 health per health. I would say that -15% damage penalty in addition to suggested stats would make it a balanced weapon. Flying Guillotine  from the suggested stat changes, this weapon is one of the most fucked over ones. Removing ANY type of comboing AND adding an upside which a) will barely even matter because by the time it reaches the long range to trigger it the weapon would have recharged a lot and b) encourages and REWARDS long range spam In addition to the fact it does NO DAMAGE to buildings, it would become as straight downgrade to pistol  sure, 90 damage in total( if you are lucky that the target wont stop bleeding , which they will most of the time) seems a lot, but any pistol can do more in shorter time, and can also damage buildings, and arent on 8 second recharge. But, basically the requirement of using the sandman with this weapon makes less versatile. My idea would be to add: On hit: applies cleavered effect for 5 seconds. I have 2 suggestions for Cleavered status effect: 1. Cleavered enemies take 20%(maybe only 15?) more damage from scout and are revealed to him through walls as long as they are bleeding. This makes it a good weapon to finish off fleeing enemies or to start the fight. It also gains a combo effect with other scout weapons. 2. Cleavered enemies take 20% more bullet damage. Again, a combo with scouts weapons, but only the scatterguns this time, but also adds teampaly aspect to the weapon. In addition, possibly add: mini crits on headhosts. Also, maybe add a trail to the weapon. Melee Bat and the reskins - nothing really. Sandman - suggested stats seem pretty nice, but are vague  do the targets still get stunned and unable to fight while being hit close range? I hope so, since close range hits last too short time for the slow to be any useful really. The more it travels, the less time it disarms the target would be nice. Also, the added 50% damage on max range is, to put it simply, pathetic. I would say that give it a reverse damage falloff and make it do 35 damage at max range. Candy Cane  pretty balanced as is. Might be ok to reduce the vulnerability to only 20%, but still ok as is I guess. Boston Basher and Three-Rune Blade  well, again, shows how different Casual and Comp are. In casual, its a rarely used weapon because of self damage, but nearly a requirement in comp because of self damage is good for charging Ubers. Because that most other melees are either banned or not viable in comp, it has basically became a go to melee for scout. Imo, the self damage should either be removed or heavily reduced while leaving the self inflicted bleed  it becomes less required in Comp and more viable in Casual. Sun-on-a-Stick  even after the buff this is one of the worst weapons for scout. My idea to change it: +On hit  set the enemy on fire. +Mini-Crits on burning enemies.  25% fire damage resistance and afterburn immunity then active. -25% damage to players Fan OWar  reduce damage penalty to 50% to make it even reasonable to continue meleeing your target. Atomizer  suggested stats are pretty good. Well see how they turn out when it comes out. Wrap Assasin  pretty ok as it is right now. But maybe reduce the damage penalty to 50% instead? Thats it for scout for now. Feel free to debate and discuss the suggestions."
206,vulnerability,tf2,Reworking and Buffing the Hibernating Bear Set for the Heavy,5,6l2vpg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6l2vpg/reworking_and_buffing_the_hibernating_bear_set/,2017-07-04 07:42:06,"The Hibernating Bear. Such a fun-looking set, yet it almost completely disappoints. The set seems to imply a slow and powerful Russian meat tank, but the Buffalo Steak Sandvich and Warrior's Spirit are weak and counter productive to their goals most of the time (BSS = melee speed and damage, WS = more damage and finishing for health recovery, both at the cost of vulnerability), while the Brass Beast doesn't have an effective damage boost or resistance boost (anymore at least). **Brass Beast** =Current Stats: ~~**20% damage bonus**~~ ~~**20% damage resistance when spun up and below 50% health**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~*50% slower spin-up time*~~ ~~*60% slower movement speed when spun up*~~ * (Note 1): [This has actually been tested by Sigsegv, showing that the resistance is applied whenever you take damage that would put you below 50% health, rather than just when you are below 50% health.](URL The Beast is an unappreciated and underpowered weapon. Its bullets are slightly more damaging than the stock minigun's, a difference usually too small to make a difference in any case, while also having a slightly slower spin-up and a significantly slower movement speed. While a bit more true to the minigun's original design (slow and powerful), it easily demonstrates why the Heavy's spin-up penalty and speed penalties were lessened. Despite having an increase in damage, a Heavy (even one on defense, near a dispenser or riding a cart) is incredibly vulnerable and fairly easy to remove from play while spun-up. My changes are meant to change this, making the gun more damaging and dangerous by changing the number of bullets shot instead of the firing speed, as well as slightly reducing the speed penalty and spin-up speed penalty. I'm also replacing the damage resistance with crit resistance while spun up (in honor of the set's original bonus) as well as to prevent the increased chance of landing shots from becoming too strong. =New Stats: ~~**2 more bullets fired with each shot**~~ ~~**60% crit resistance while spun-up**~~ ~~**50% larger ammo capacity**~~ ~~*40% longer spin-up time*~~ ~~*50% less healing from outside sources while spun-up*~~ ~~*70% movement speed penalty while deployed*~~ *(Note 1)* * (Note 1): This is reworded to show that it isn't tacking on a new penalty like the current Brass Beast, but instead is changing the minigun's natural penalty to 70%, which is slightly faster than currently (about 23% compared to the current 15%). Currently, the penalty is stacked on top of the natural minigun's speed penalty, which is why the movement speed when revved with the Beast is roughly 15% only, not the 31% some people might think it should be from a quick glance. These changes make the weapon noticeably more effective, giving it a better chance of hitting enemies at mid- and long-range on top of heavily increasing the damage output, at the cost of your movement speed and ability to spin-up in an emergency. You also can tank a headshot when overhealed and spun-up, as well as provide a wall to crits, but will be vulnerable to all other forms of damage (since you can't dodge). The healing penalty (and the minigun-wide penalty to reloading ammo) serve to prevent players from camping Dispensers and carts, forcing them to spin-down now and then to recover, giving enemies a window of opportunity to pierce the defenses if they haven't already done so. Outside of this, the extra ammo allows you to stay in the fight for longer, reducing your need to spin down and hunt for ammo. ----- **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** =Current Stats: * Alt-Fire: Share with a friend! (Medium health kit) * For 15 seconds on consumption: ~~**All damage dealt mini-crits**~~ ~~**35% faster movement speed**~~ ~~*25% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*Restricted to melee weapon for duration*~~ The Buffalo Steak Sandvich. While a wonderful idea for dinner, it is lackluster in actual gameplay (outside of Medieval). The damage vulnerability and restriction to melee relegates it to a rollout secondary with the ability to heal allies if needed. To try and make it more useful in general (as well as make it stand out more from the classic Sandvich), I'd like to refocus it on its set theme: slow and powerful. A lunch that makes you hard to take down without teamwork if you play your cards right. =New Stats: * Eat to restore 50% of your max health. Can overheal. * Alt-Fire: Share with a friend to restore half their health *(Note 1)* * For 15 seconds: ~~**Overheal does not decay**~~ ~~**All damage dealt mini-crits**~~ ~~*All damage received mini-crits*~~ ~~*50% less healing from outside sources*~~ * (Note 1): This does not act like a health kit. Like my ideas for the other lunchbox items, it only provides health restoration (instant in this case, rather than regeneration over a a few seconds). It does not cure afterburn or bleeding effects; however, it will be able to overheal those who pick it up if possible. With these changes, the BSS can combo with miniguns as well as the Heavy's melees (namely the Beast and the Spirit), allowing you to temporarily buff your maximum health and deal damage at long range, at the cost of also taking increased damage from long-ranged sources. You won't be able to be healed much for the duration, but you'll be able to output a massive amount of damage. Combine it with a minigun and you become practically a lumbering sentry, while combining it with a melee weapon allows you to rip apart your enemies like only a shaved bear can. ----- **Warrior's Spirit** ~~**30% damage bonus**~~ ~~**On Kill: 50 health restored**~~ ~~*30% damage vulnerability*~~ The Warrior's Spirit's major flaw is the damage vulnerability, due to a simple thing: the Heavy is too slow. He has no way of countering the damage vulnerability, meaning he is hurt more by the weapon than he is helped. While another class might be able to use the damage and health-on-kill as a quick finisher to restore a good chunk of health (ala Zatoichi and Powerjack), the Heavy is too slow (and, usually, revved) to take advantage of that (his health is also so high that a small health kit would be more beneficial in all regards). What options do we have for the Spirit though? There are a few ideas, but what do the Heavy's melees already cover? The GRU cover movement speed, the Fists of Steel cover tanking, the Eviction Notice is a proto-GRU, KGB covers damage boosting, and the Holiday Punch is a stun weapon. Perhaps something to do with recovery, or countering enemies? Perhaps...the original Equalizer holds the answer? =New Stats: * While Active: ~~**Firing speed and movement speed increase as the user becomes injured**~~ *(Note 1)* ~~**4 health regenerated per second on wearer**~~ *(Note 2)* ~~*Blocks healing from all outside sources*~~ *(Note 3)* ~~*25% damage vulnerability*~~ * (Note 1): Similar to the original Equalizer/current Escape Plan, the boost to movement speed would cap at 60% when you are at or below 20% of your max health (60 health left). Unlike the original and current Equalizer, the firing speed would receive the same boost at the same rate, also capping at 60%. * (Note 2): The health regeneration would be a flat 4 points per second while active, rather than the shift into adjustable rates that Valve has been favoring as of late. * (Note 3): This will prevent the Heavy from restoring their health with Medics and health kits while active. Only the Spirit's regeneration and your lunchbox effects would be able to restore your health. With these changes, the Spirit now better fits the concepts of both a hibernating bear and a warrior. You start out as your usual slow self, but as you are beaten up you gain melee speed and potential damage. Since this would eventually mean a roughly 120% speed heavy with 'Consecutive Normal Punches' and regeneration that can quickly counter or escape, the Heavy cannot be healed while the Spirit is active. Unlike the Back Scratcher, the Heavy's reliance on outside sources for healing most of the time makes this a major downside."

I know some new players initially think the syringe gun is used to heal, but what if it was? Stock heals at a slow rate, overdose even slower, and maybe the blutsauger doesn't have it? But they can be used for short to mid-range for quick healing, and the crossbow for long range. Of course it wouldn't grant much ubercharge, but at least less players would use the crossbow all the time (I'm guilty myself). Other than that, I'm really hoping the overdose is buffed with: 1. passive effect 2. higher speed increase 3. Maybe an increasing vulnerability to knockback, up to 100% to pair with the quick fix What do you think? Thank you for reading."

213,vulnerability,tf2,An in depth look at the Claidheamh Mr,20,6fzh7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6fzh7x/an_in_depth_look_at_the_claidheamh_mòr/,2017-06-08 17:28:30,"I quite like this weapon. I figure I'm in a minority. Anyway, it is by no means what it once was. Valve has, for better or worse, a habit of designing a weapon with a core philosophy in mind, and over time losing that key concept through buffs and nerfs. The Claidheamh Mr is one such weapon. Here, we'll look at what the Claidheamh Mr once was, and how it is now, and how it stacks up in comparison to the other weapons. At the end, I'll throw down my ideas or how this weapon can become more unique. The Claidheamh Mr once had quite simple stats - a permanent -15hp, a 0.8s increase in charge duration, and a 25% charge refill on melee kill. It also had no random critical hits and the extended melee range of swords. It seems this weapon was designed to make the Demoman's charge itself stronger, which is a good concept in relation to the other swords - the Eyelander is for extended melee use, the Persuader is for charging more often, and the Zatoichi is, or more accurately was, designed as a last ditch backup. The 0.8s charge duration really came into its own with the Tide Turner and trimp jumps - suddenly the Claidheamh Mr had it's own niche, and all the swords could see equal(ish) usage. After the Demoknight nerfs however, it is clear that is no longer the case. The new stats leave the Claidheamh Mr with a kill reward of +25hp and 25% charge refill, with the downside of an active 15% damage vulnerability, as well as the other sword downsides (slower switch speed and no critical hits). This leaves the Claidheamh Mr in an odd position - it is definitely the least punishing of the swords to use alongside a Launcher, as this is no passive downside. However, its main rival in the ""backup blade"" category, the Zatoichi, is now also much less punishing and has a bigger potential bonus. As a full Demoknight the Claidheamh Mr doesn't stand up to the other swords. However, I feel like with some targeted changes, the Claidheamh Mr could both be an interesting and effective Hybridknight weapon. The first issue is that whilst the +25hp and 25% charge refill on kill are nice bonuses, they feel like a discount Zatoichi and Persuader, respectively. The 25% charge refill needs to stay - it meshes in nicely with the Tide Turner to allow for a full recharge every kill without sacrificing the Launcher. The +25hp can however be replaced. ""But with what?!?"" I hear you not ask. Well, first up the 0.8s charge duration increase would be a very nice addition, but for some reason I doubt Valve would reimplement it - whatever logic they had when they removed it probably hasn't changed. Ideally, it would make a return though. This would allow Hybridknights to keep up with Booties wearing Demoknights during a charge, but not when the charge is down, keeping the Booties as a viable option for full Demoknights. The downside is a good one, but could use an increase in magnitude - 20% when active encourages the Demo to only use the sword when necessary, letting the Launcher take the active role. However, to complement this I feel the weapon could do with a slightly faster switch speed - whether this is permanent or based on certain conditions (eg; no switch speed penalty when charge is ready), is really up for debate In short I don't even know dude, help me"
214,vulnerability,tf2,My idea for the TF2 pyro: Burn Levels,246,6g2skq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/6g2skq/my_idea_for_the_tf2_pyro_burn_levels/,2017-06-09 04:25:45,"Note: This is quite a long post so bear with me. I've tried to be as concise as I could be while still explaining it adequately and getting the point across. Also I'm awful at formatting but I did what I could. # The history Before the advent of Team Fortress 2, many of you know of its direct predecessor, Team Fortress Classic or TFC for short. There were many difference but one of the most notable was the Pyro. With a vulnerability to fire if his armor ran low enough, a single-barrel shotgun that dealt around 16 damage maximum per shot, and an afterburn that does pitiful damage, he was generally unused in any serious setting due to his many short-comings. Fast-forward to 2007, two games are on the horizon of release. Team Fortress 2 by Valve, as a direct official sequel to TFC. Meanwhile, a Half-Life 2 mod called Fortress Forever was a community-made sequel. Both of them had many clear differences and improvements over TFC, but the most notable is how they buffed certain classes. Given that they were released about the same time, they independently had their own ideas. While the Pyro maintained his general weaponset (Including an Incendiary Cannon ported from TFC, which morphed into the Flare Gun in TF2), he was given higher mobility, including the use of the flamethrower to give himself lift into the air when pointed down and fired, like a jetpack. Not much by itself, but combined with an Incendiary Cannon jump (Which is much more impressive than what the Scorch Shot/Detonator can provide in TF2), it managed to provide very capable movement for the Pyro, counteracting his generally slower movement speed. This was enough to make him not fully useless, but he was still fairly weak. This changed on September 10th, 2016 for the 9th anniversary of the games release date. This gave him a massive overhaul as a class. Rather than pointing the flamethrower downwards to propel himself upwards, he could simply hold down right-click to give himself some light upward momentum. Combined with an Incendiary Cannon jump and he could get very far. It even prevented 25% of fall damage when hitting the floor. But, far more impressive than the mobility is how his weapons were reworked. Burn levels existed before, where combos could be used to increase afterburn damage. A napalm grenade, flamethrower puff, and an incendiary cannon shot all on one person, and they get tremendously higher afterburn compared to before. The overhaul removed afterburn entirely, its solely burn levels. Burn levels dont cause damage over time, they increase damage from Pyro weapons. Not by a huge amount but enough to cause harm. Burn level 1 raises the direct damage from the Incendiary Cannon to 85, 2 raises it to 95, 3 raises it to 105, and the burn level limit is at 3. This makes it much harder for a Pyro to attack safely from a distance, and hide as their opponent burns to death. # The Idea Theres very often complaints about how Pyro is a no-skill class, and while thats arguable, it definitely has a ceiling. Some of the best pyros couldnt feasibly beat a soldier that knows what hes doing. Reflecting rockets can be easily beat by the soldier making his firing more random and less predictable as a pattern. Even with weapons such as the Scorch Shot, Pyros long-range ability is weak. My question is, would borrowing some ideas from Fortress Forever help TF2 in these regards? Burn levels is the most interesting because itd cause serious disruptions to the W+M1 feasibility, no matter how its implemented. It could even be worked to give life to previously useless Pyro weapons, even the Sharpened Volcano Fragment could possibly see use. One idea is how Fortress Forever 2007 did it. If you set someone on fire with the flamethrower, back up and hit them with a shot from a Flare Gun, Detonator, Scorch Shot, or Manmelter, theyll receive more afterburn damage than if it was just the flamethrower or just one of the flare guns. A burn level 3 could also be an exclusive property of...None other than the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. In exchange for the difficulty of landing a hit with it, if someone is on Burn Level 2 and is hit with the Volcano Fragment, they could go to a Burn Level 3 that deals substantially more damage over time. Add that along with an attack speed bonus to the weapon, and the useless Pyro melee could see new light as a weapon that can cause chaos in groups if you can get enough of a combo. Degreaser, Scorch Shot to set several more people onto Burn Level 2, and then run up with the Volcano Fragment. If you can hit 2 people, they have a low chance of survival, even if you die. Though, since this would be a straight buff, thered need to be other changes too. Fortress Forever, in the overhaul, introduced changes to other classes. The Scout, Medic, and Spy each extinguish their flames (Burn Levels, in this case) much faster than other classes. As well, the Heavy has a special rechargeable ability that can extinguish the flames of himself and those around him (An idea for a new Heavy weapon in TF2, possibly?) # The second idea Theres no doubt that the first idea could have some problems with it, so theres the second idea too. To rebase it off the FF Pyro Overhaul. Afterburn could be completely removed, or at least severely nerfed so it can only pick off a weak enemy. Burn levels would be how much extra damage a Pyro does with his weapons on a second attack. Combos wouldnt be needed either, but they would increase general effectiveness. Flamethrower would increase burn level to a player overtime, any flare gun shot increases burn level every hit. This would encourage a return of puff-and-sting on a wider and trickier scale. If you flame someone for say, 3.5 seconds (Exact numbers open to tweaking) which would bring them to Burn Level 3, then a shot with any flare gun, then that flare would do 30 damage more than it usually does if theyre not already burning. Nothing monstrous, but enough to finish medium-health classes off, provided they dont have a way to easily extinguish themselves or a nearby healthpack. # In closure I realize the Pyro update is well underway and possibly right on the brink of release and big changes would be difficult or impossible to make right now, so even if this post is seen and liked, I severely doubt this would be a possibility to implement in time, I firmly realize that. But, if this can offer even smaller but feasible ideas for the Pyro update, or something fuller in the future, thatd be welcome. Nothing Ive said here is concrete, everythings open to criticism and possible/definite change. Everyone whos read this far, I sincerely thank you for taking the time to hear my thoughts. Any critique is completely welcome. **TL;DR** (Edited this in at the request of a commenter): Two ideas to get rid of the view that Pyro is an unskilled class. First is to make it so opponents on fire have a ""burn level"" meter, causing afterburn to deal more damage depending on how many types of flame damage they were exposed to. Volcano fragment, flamethrower, flare gun, etc. Second still uses the burn level idea, but it'd raise naturally depending on how long they were exposed to flames, and instead of raising afterburn damage, it raises how much damage they'd take from direct exposure (For example, a flare doing more base damage to an opponent that already felt the heat of a flamethrower for a few seconds than otherwise, the amount of extra damage varying depending on how long they were hit by a flamethrower) The counter so it's not a straight buff would be certain light classes extinguishing themselves faster than others, plus other careful tuning I'm sure."

I'm not great at balance ideas, so please don't hate on me too much. **The Claidheamh Mr** (-)When weapon is active: This Weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower +25 health restored on kill (-)Melee kills refill 25% of your charge meter. No random critical hits (-)15% damage vulnerability on wearer This reiterates the Claidheamh Mr to be another weapon more suited for non-demoknights by removing the damage vulnerability and the give-charge-on-kill attribute. The deploy and holster penalty is enough to offset for the given health on kill. The ""when weapon is active"" is pointless to keep now, so let's just delete it for easy reading sake. The health on kill attribute only applies to the current weapon regardless, if anyone was wondering. **The Persian Persuader** This Weapon has a large melee range and deploys and holsters slower Melee hits refill 20% of your charge meter. Ammo boxes collected also give Charge (+)0.5 sec longer charge duration No random critical hits (!)-50% max primary ammo on wearer (!)-50% max secondary ammo on wearer (+)Can't refill ammo from ammo packs This gives the Persian Persuader the longer charge attribute that you guys loved when it was on the Claidheamh Mr. This given with the already buffs that give charge on hit and from ammo packs lets you charge pretty much all the time, given that you catch people every charge. The ammo reserve attributes on this weapon are REALLY weird. According to the wiki, the player refills charge instead of ammo if they don't have a full charge bar, so let's just tone down their full reserve ammo to 50% less ammo, as well as making them unable to refill ammo unless they go to resupply. Tell me what you guys think of this! I'm an amateur at balance thoughts, so I won't be surprised if nobody agrees with these ideas."

Give me feedback and submit your ideas as well **Making Melees Better** It's no secret that there is no reason to pull out the fire axe unless you are somehow out of ammo or really want random crits. Also, the Powerjack is so good since, it give the extra mobility the pyro needs. However, the pyro as a whole would be weakened if the speed bonus was removed, and increase the vulnerability wont help much as its not used in combat (This is the same basic problem with the GRU) I think the solution is to indirectly nerf the Powerjack by making the other options better. Heres my idea: Add an ablity to all pyro melees *except* for the Powerjack. One idea is to have all pyro melees mini crit flaming players. Obviously some weapons would need to be tweaked (The third degree would be OP, but I think then it should have a damage penalty to compensate), but it gives a reason to actually pull out your melee. Also here are some ideas to tweak some weapons after this change * Axtingusher: This change should happen even if the minicrit change isnt implemented, but the damage penalty should be only against non-flaming enemies. * Sharpened volcano fragment: Maybe a slight swing speed penalty * Third Degree: 10% damage penalty **Air blasting Flames** This a bit of a silly idea, but what if you could air blast your one flames. Obviously, you couldnt make then minicrit, but it would offer a slightly farther ranged attack, albeit weaker and less accurate, as a sort of reverse puff n sting "

222,vulnerability,tf2,The Eviction Notice is an all-round better weapon than the G.R.U.,32,5xdavx,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/5xdavx/the_eviction_notice_is_an_allround_better_weapon/,2017-03-04 08:53:28,"The only benefit that the GRU give people is that it has the largest speed boost in the game to the slowest class in the game. That's it. Rollouts on 5CP are where it shines out, and is the reason why it's banned in 6s and why people want it to be nerfed. However, that is the only situation where the GRU is better then the Eviction Notice or any other Heavy Melee. The Eviction Notice allows the Heavy to become more mobile *overall* as well as have a decent speed walking up to the frontline. If you can bare Soldiers movement speed, you can deal with the Eviction Notice movement speed. Not having that -50% holster speed penalty allows Heavy to do a mini ""Powerjack Jump"" with the Eviction Notice, switching between the Minigun and Eviction Notice. The only reason why the GRU is banned is because it can get a Heavy to a mid ASAP with no effort. Side Note: I hate it when people say ""the GRU removes Heavies only weakness."" Long distance movement is not Heavy's only weakness. The GRU removes *one* weakness out of ~3 weaknesses, including long range mobility. His mobility when doing damage is significantly reduced and his reliance on a Medic because of his slow speed basically forces the Heavy to stick with the Medic. The Eviction Notice negates the 2^nd downside because being able to switch to a weapon that allows you to move faster then a Soldier without any switch time penalties and only having a small damage vulnerability whilst ""Dolphin Diving"" with the Minigun makes Heavy very mobile whilst being able to do damage. This allows Heavy to run to Healthpacks quicker which slightly reduces Heavy's medic reliance. One little advantage of the reduced speed boost is that is makes being whipped easier and more constant as you're at a similar speed to the soldier whipping you. The Eviction Notice can also be used in dire situations to get out without being a slave to the Marked for Death attribute. The speed boost on hit is pretty pointless in a competitive setting, but in pubs its pretty fun, especially if random crits are enabled. Being able to be a 300hp melee scout causes people to panic and is utterly stupid, but fun. "

I saw quite a few comments that mention how they felt the wrangler was overpowered in some regard. I don't expect all of these to be good. Just brainstorming! The goals of any of these potential nerfs: To balance out the risk/reward associated with using the wrangler, without changing the identity of the weapon. Basically, I want to add downsides without modifying the fire rate increase and shield damage reduction, or without modifying what made it the wrangler we all know today. +50-100% building construction time. (Minis unaffected?)Nerfs the wranglers ability to be abused offensively. It is already really good on defense, it shouldn't be nearly as good on attack. Also if a team manages to kill the gun, it should take more time to build back up again. Buildings cannot be moved while wrangled: A passive trait to add to engineers. Prevents a gun that just ate a lot of damage from 'cheaply' getting out. A gun that was focused down properly should not a free pass via rescue ranger. Weapon deploys and hostlers 50% slower: Sentries are vulnerable to burst damage. The engie has to be on top of his game to save his gun with the wrangler from rockets, pills, stickies. It also takes longer to swap to healing weapons. +15-25% user explosive vulnerability when active: Great protection for your gun comes at your own risk. It's much easier for spamming classes to focus down the engie, leaving the gun as good as dead if they do. Thoughts? EDIT: formatting, grammar "

When fighting spys with this wrench you will be able to one hit sappers, cause a bleeding effect and also make them slower than you allowing to easily kill them before they get away. This wrench also however makes afterburn much more deadly as you have fewer options to extinguish it. Medi-beams, Dispenser-beams, healthpacks and life-steal will do nothing while on fire so the only way to put it out would be an air-blast, jarate/mad milk, water or just waiting it out. Just having a friendly pybro can completely negate the downsides but that was always the case with the old wrench too. "
228,vulnerability,tf2,How to make Heavy more fun with this ONE WEIRD TRICK,76,5q859s,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/5q859s/how_to_make_heavy_more_fun_with_this_one_weird/,2017-01-26 14:56:12,"(Disclaimer: Actually multiple weird tricks). Today I will discuss the key to making Heavy more fun by reworking just one weapon, the Buffalo Steak Sandvich (other reworks are optional). **TLDR for this section: People don't play Heavy because they find him boring. Buffalo Steak Sandvich is competitively OP, and UP in pubs. Skip to below the line if you agree with this.** Heavy is famous for [having some of the fewest mains out of any class,](URL so obviously there's something wrong with him. Is it that he's underpowered? I don't really think so. It's pretty easy to get into a pub and mow down enemies with him, getting 5 kills or assists per life; in Highlander he's a vital part of the team, and in 6s he's so strong they have to ban anything that lets him be used full-time, or else both teams would always run him. My diagnosis? Heavy's problem is he's **boring.** He moves slowly and fights by looking at enemies while holding M1. He has five unique primaries, but all of them are basically the Minigun with numbers changes. He has one viable secondary (Sandvich) and one viable melee (GRU). This is a great formula for making a class that gets boring fast. Conclusion: Heavy needs a big dose of FUN, and more people will play him. Now there's another part of Heavy also in need of some love. The Buffalo Steak Sandvich [is Heavy's least used secondary item. Only **5%** of Heavies use it, while 59% of Heavies use Sandvich.](URL It's also [banned in competitive 6s play.](URL The speed boost is used to make Heavy reach mid quickly, and as mentioned above, things that make Heavy full-time viable are banned in 6s because he's too strong. So it's OP in competitive, [but it's underpowered in pubs, as identified by FUNKe, a noted ""Heavy main"". Even with the speed boost, Steak Heavy frequently dies before he can get in range to attack enemies. Even in pubs, Buffalo Steak Sandvich is just too weak to be worth using. If you're not close enough to reach enemies before they kill you, you WILL die, and there's nothing you can do about it.](URL This is corroborated by other players I've talked to and my own experience: Steak is weak. Buffalo Steak is also cancer to play against, the few times that it does work. If Heavy is fast enough to reach you before you can kill him, he *will* kill you, and there's nothing you can really do about it. But because this doesn't happen often, almost nobody uses Steak. Finally, Steak's stats doesn't really match its design. [Heavy yells ""So filling!"" when he eats it,](URL but it doesn't provide any healing at all! It's meant to make Heavy go on a crazed rampage, but since it has a high damage vulnerability, you're punished for running into combat, and forced to play more like a fat Spy if you want to get kills. So there are a lot of problems to be fixed here. I think I can do that. ____________________ Buffalo Steak's stats are currently: &gt;[Click to eat (4.3 seconds). While under the effects (15 seconds), move speed is increased (by 35%), attacks mini-crit, damage taken will be increased 25%, and the player may only use melee weapons. Alt-fire to throw a medium health kit to allies.](URL My rework is: &gt;**Buffalo Steak Sandvich** &gt;**(+)** Click to eat (4.3s). While under the effects (15s): Gain a speed boost *when damage is taken* (*+40% for 3s*), *regenerate 5 HP per second (75 total)*, attacks mini-crit, &gt;**(-)** and the player may only use melee weapons. &gt;**(?)** Alt-fire: Share with a friend (Medium Health Kit) &gt;[(now also displays a unique icon above Heavy's head while active, to let enemies know that he's under a special effect.)](URL This rework has three buffs and one nerf. * **I remove the 25% damage vulnerability.** This helps Heavy survive longer so he can run head-first into battle, like an angry bear. * **I add 5/sec (75 total) health regen to Buffalo Steak.** This makes Steak more useful on the battlefield, helps Heavy survive better, and even *encourages* a full-health Heavy to intentionally take damage for his speed boost, because he will heal away some of the damage. * **I increase the movement speed buff by a tiny 5%.** This helps Heavy actually catch up to enemies when his speed is boosted. * **I make the speed boost only apply when Heavy takes damage.** This removes the reason for Steak to be banned in competitive play (speed boost to mid), and adds *counterplay* to the Steak Heavy. A Steak Heavy is now faster and harder to kill for every class, thanks to the buffs mentioned above; BUT, if you don't think you can kill him before he kills you, then not attacking him will give you the chance to escape. This leads to an ""Incredible Hulk"" style of gameplay for the Heavy: *You wouldn't like him when he's angry.* Enemies now have an important choice: Do I shoot the bear running at me and make it even faster and angrier, in the hopes I can kill it? Or do I leave it alone and run for it? Meanwhile, on Heavy's end, Buffalo Steak now takes more skill and thought, and rewards more skill. You can intentionally try and absorb enemy attacks to gain your speed boost, and use it to charge into battle, zooming in circles around enemies; making sure to get hit just enough times so you keep your speed boost, but not so many times that you lose too much Health. [Buffalo Steak will be a lot more effective at actually running into the fight.](URL How would this measure up to other Heavy weapons? Compared to Sandvich, it's much worse for healing because it heals 225HP less, leaves you locked in melee and takes a long time, but it will also give you those dank melee crits and a potential speed boost. Compared to Shotgun, you lose the mobile attack/backup damage potential of Shotgun, but you gain a weak heal and stronger melee combat. So this rework fixes every problem mentioned above: * It makes Heavy more fun by giving him MANY MANY more ways to play, utilizing his many varied melee weapon unlocks. * It removes the reason that Buffalo Steak Sandvich is banned in competitive (the flat speed boost), so BSS can become unbanned. * It makes Steak more viable in a pub game by buffing it. * It makes Steak have more counterplay by giving enemies a choice as to ""How fast you want your Heavy, fam?"" * It makes Steak fit its theme better, by being more filling and actually encouraging Heavy to rush into battle. _______________________________________________ As I mentioned above, there are also these optional changes to other Heavy melees, to allow all of Heavy's melee options to be viable choices with Steak. **Killing Gloves of Boxing**- *No longer randomly crits.* As FUNKe pointed out, it's too good of a choice to use the other options with Steak; why would you use Fists when you can use KGB that can randomly crit on the first hit, and then give you 5 seconds of full crits? (For anyone worried about the power of their existing Medieval Mode Steak loadouts, you don't have to worry. KGB having no random crits will make Heavy a little less powerful in Medieval, but the Steak buffs will make him overall more powerful if you're good, so it's a net gain.) Removing random crits from KGB will also make Heavy Boxing Matches more honourable. **Eviction Notice**- *Speed increase reduced by 5%.* Okay so I actually disagree with FUNKe on this one from my own experiences using it. If you run circles around your opponents with Eviction Notice, it's actually the second strongest steak combo. You become too fast to escape from, and 2 fast 2 furious to hit. **Holiday Punch**- *25% damage penalty.* Right now there's not really any reason not to use Fists over Holiday Punch with its guaranteed stun from behind. Sure it stuns enemies for 3 seconds rather than randomly critting them, but a stunned enemy is just about as good as a dead enemy anyway. Holiday Punch is also the only thing in TF2 that can stun Ubercharged enemies. This penalty will make Fists and its many reskins more viable. Think of all the ""Demoknight""-like Heavy loadouts that would ensue: Bruiser/Saint/Chef/Hippie/Freedom/Mortal Kombat/Angry Cameraman/Meat-Beating/Wack-A-Mole/Thomas the Tank/Edgy Heavy (Steak+Fists and reskins). Heavyweight Champion (Steak+Killing Gloves of Boxing). Speed Demon (Steak+Gloves of Running Urgently). Hungry Bear (Steak+Warrior's Spirit). Soviet Main Battle Tank Heavy (Steak+Fists of Steel). Hit his weak point for Massive Damage!) [FIST OF THE POOTIS STAR (Steak+Eviction Notice).](URL Stunned-Up Comedian (Steak+Holiday Punch). _______________ So yeah. That's my rework idea, I'm very excited about it, I think it could solve a lot of problems and be very **FUN.** Your thoughts?"

The Marked for Death effect is a step in the Right direction but its A) too short and B) if the Scouts good enough he can easily escape or Dodge all incoming damage. This is where the new after-use effects come into place which severely dampen the Scouts use after using the Crit-a-Cola. **Darwins Danger Shield** * Increase explosion vulnerability to +50% (From +20%) * Add Stun user on surviving a Headshot for 3 seconds. Reasoning: Raising the explosion vulnerability will kill overly aggressive DDS Snipers in one shot buy most explosion classes. This makes Soldier bombings of DDS Snipers quicker and easier. Adding the Stun will allow the Sniper to retaliate with a second shot however the user still has the ability to move. So the stun will be similar to a Short range sandman stun. -25% movement speed whilst stunned and you can't do anything for 3 seconds as you're stunned. **Reserve Shooter** * Reduce the Slip size to one shot * Add a -100% reload speed penalty. Reasoning: The 100% slower reload would put the reload at 2 seconds and having a single shot to kill will make missing more detrimental to the Pyro or Soldier using it. This also stops it from being spammed if the enemy misses their first shot, allowing more skillful players to use it to its full effect and not use it as a 4-shot shotgun that can occasionally mini crit airborne enemies. These changes make the weapon more specialized. Thoughts? "

234,vulnerability,tf2,I've come up with the worst possible loadouts that are as useless as possible.,4,5f3fs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/5f3fs5/ive_come_up_with_the_worst_possible_loadouts_that/,2016-11-27 14:48:02,"See if you can come up with worse loadouts. bonus points if you can actually use them in a match and record it. you win the internet if you can topscore using one of them. **Scout: baby face blaster, winger, and atomizer.** this one was tough. the back scatter was also a big contender since it gives you situational extra damage for 2 fewer shots and lower accuracy. also the pocket pistol since it gives shitty upsides for lower fire rate and vulnerability. its upside is essentially negated by its downside. but bfb and winger takes the cake. the 3d mobile scout becomes a 2d fast but limited scout, that only gets extra speed for 2 seconds at a time in most cases. no double jumps, and no permission for getting hurt means that you will rarely get any use out of the primary ability, leaving you with 2 fewer shots and -10% run speed. the winger gives a bonus to jump height, but is basically useless for anything but slightly higer than normal ledges for jumping, since air jumps drain your boost. it does extra damage but has much fewer shots making it difficult to land them. and if you actually manage to get your boost full, you won't be landing any shots since you're going so fast. and the atomizer gives you a third jump that will let you drain your boost even faster. it also lets you deal less damage with it as a bonus. **soldier: rocket jumper, gunboats, and the pain train(on capture the flag for even shittier effect)** rocket jumper does zero damage, but increases mobility. gunboats block rocket self damage. and pain train makes you cap points faster, but gimps you -10% bullet vulnerability. your only damaging weapon has no inherent damage benefits. the only god thing about it is that it can random crit i guess. maybe you can use the loadout to be super mobile and race across the map to fast cap, but aside from that, you are completely useless. **pyro: degreaser, manmelter, and sharpened volcano fragment** degreaser does the lowest base and afterburn damage of any flamethrower. its use is in combos. luckily, none of the other weapons are useful for combos. the manmelter gains no crits on burning players, but can extinguish allies for crits. this sort of helps the degreaser since it has extra airblast cost, but is a terrible weapon in its own right, like the degreaser. the SVF deals more burn damage than the degreaser, but only deals 52 damage per swing compared to even the stock fire axe. fun fact: it used to be somewhat useful. for four days after release, its afterburn lasted indefinitely. then they changed it. **demoman: base jumper, sticky jumper, pain train** much like the soldier, the first 2 deal no damage, and the third slot gives you extra capture rate for being inherently vulnerable to bullets. only use is jumping around either hoping for random crits or running ahead to help cap. **Heavy: huo long heater, buffalo steak, and stock fists.** heater deals -10% base damage, and flames only start up a second or 2 after you spin up. basically, if you jump at someone at point blank range, the person is mostly dead by the time the person gets ignited and you get the benefit of +15% damage. it also prevents pre-revving due to excessive ammo use. it also rarely deters spies. buffalo steak is pretty bad. it limits you to melee, and makes you take extra damage. even with the speed boost, you're hurting bad before you even have closed the distance to benefit from your own extra damage dealing. and the fists are just bad. if you get a crit then maybe they aren't terrible, but even the holiday punch gives you a guaranteed way of immobilizing a victim for subsequent attacks, though its tradeoff is a lack of one hit kills. **Engineer: gunslinger, rescue ranger, and short circuit.** a disposable sentry that has as much health as a single pill, less dps than a level one sentry, and has a big glowing light on it, this thing's good for about one kill if you hide it somewhere and then it's toast. but it tracks faster, whoohoo. with it, you usually are relying on your other weapons for your damage, with the sentry being more support than anything. but that's the kicker. your primary is a tool, and so is your secondary. the rescue ranger deals 35 damage per bolt, and the short circuit is like a really bad flamethrower in terms of its combat effectiveness. **Medic: overdose, vaccinator, and vita saw** the overdose boosts run speed when deployed, but you have to have high ubercharge. and if you're using your vaccinator properly, you're popping them -25% like demo pops pills. so you're usually left with a -15% damage syringe gun after you've unloaded all your mini ubers and are on the retreat. the vita saw is pretty pointless since the mini ubers are rather easy to come by and aren't incredibly strong on their own, or when facing more than one person at a time(and even that is troublesome, if you don't have multiple ubers for going against a shotgun pyro or soldier for instance) med is still strong in his own right, but this seems to make him the weakest possible. **sniper: classic, cozy camper, and bushwacka.** with headshots only guaranteed after holding your primary fire button for four seconds minimum, and 10% damage in most every other case, this weapon makes for a very bad choice. but hey, you can see wider i guess. aside from regen, the camper is terrible. it only gives you flinch immunity on a full charge, and that doesn't even make a difference since you'll be rarely scoped in. yaya, less knockback. that help, i guess? and with the whacka, you get damage vulnerability, with no way to personally make use of its only upside since you can't give yourself minicrits. **spy: c&amp;d, YER, enforcer and red tape.** cloak and dagger doesnt get cloak from ammo boxes while cloaked, and gets less cloak from them. it also drains faster than the stock when moving, so you can't clear as far distances with it. the YER prevents manual disguise, and you have to get a stab to have one disguise, with no way to gain it back after attacking. the enforcer requires disguises to use its damage, and since disguises are so valuable for the YER spy, one won't be giving it up just for +20 damage on one shot. maybe half of players will even have a resistance modifier. not to mention that resists often don't even get pierced. so you're usually left with a revolver that deals damage slower, since you usually won't have a disguise to boost damage with. red tape just saps much slower. it's good for de-leveling huge nests but that's about it. and you can't even bother sapping things without a disguise.

237,vulnerability,tf2,[Detailed Suggestion] How to Balance All the Pyro Melees Without Nerfing the Powerjack,171,5ivvjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/5ivvjg/detailed_suggestion_how_to_balance_all_the_pyro/,2016-12-18 05:41:01,"#Prelude Currently, Pyro has three melees that are any good: the Powerjack and, to a lesser extent, the Homewrecker and the Back Scratcher. It's easy to look at Pyro's melee arsenal and think, ""There's no way that X will ever be as good as the Powerjack."" But with one across-the-board change alongside a few follow-up changes, I believe that *all* Pyro melees can be made viable, without nerfing the ones that are currently useful or making a lot of Pyro's melees situationally overpowered or overly annoying. ___ ___ #The Biggest (and Most Important) Change I posit that there is one very important change that must be made for all Pyro melee weapons to be ""viable"" without further nerfing the Powerjack. This is because the Fire Axe, even at TF2's very beginning was a weapon that was only to be used if you were counting on getting a random melee crit or if you were completely out of ammo. The Fire Axe is inherently ""useless"", whereas almost all Pyro's other melee weapons introduced since 2007 *have* a use, and that creates a major problem if you truly wish to balance ""all"" the Pyro melees. In particular, even if you never use it in battle as a finishing weapon (as it was designed for), the Powerjack is an incredibly convenient mobility tool which is at least somewhat useful in any life. That extra mobility is *really important* for the Pyro, and the reason why all the Pyro's other melees are at least partly situational is that they're balanced around the Fire Axe, a weapon inherently situational to the point of uselessness, instead of around the Powerjack, a weapon which is inherently useful. So how can we balance *all* the Pyro melees, without nerfing the Powerjack in a way that makes it as situational as the rest of Pyro's melee weapons and thus nerfing Pyro as a class, like Valve did with the Degreaser changes? &amp;nbsp; Here's my proposal: **By default, Pyro moves +15% faster while melee is active.** &amp;nbsp; You could then balance various weapons around that change. If it is thought to be truly necessary, you could *add some damage vulnerability* by default, too, but I personally don't think that that is important, for reasons that I will touch upon later as I make some suggestions as to how melee weapons could be further rebalanced. But before I do that, let me clarify this major change by explaining why I believe it would work and by addressing some likely early negative reactions. ____ ###Why This Change Would Promote Weapon Balance The Powerjack is the go-to weapon for most Pyros because its upsides are not situational; no matter what playstyle you're using, it can help you at no cost with its very convenient - if relatively small - speed boost. The damage vulnerability is very minor, and only really makes the Powerjack risky to use in *combat*, not for general use in getting to where you need to go a little faster. Compare that to the Neon Annihilator (only useful on maps with lots of water if you can get in melee range of a wet enemy), the Homewrecker (only comes in handy if you're hanging around buildings or happen to be near one when it gets sapped), the Back Scratcher (not worth using if your team has a Medic, unless you're playing roamer), or the Fire Axe (useful if you're completely out of ammo and you don't own the Back Scratcher). The Powerjacks convenient speed boost, in stark contrast, is useful to any Pyro playstyle that involves moving around even a little, and by picking a different melee, you have to give up that convenience for a situational use. Instead of massively buffing each Pyro melee weapon individually by making each of their upsides so useful or so situationally good that players would consider using it over the Powerjack, I believe that the simplest, cleanest solution is changing Pyro as a class so that it has benefits from that convenient melee-only speed boost **by default.** Then Pyro melee would no longer have to be a choice between a convenient weapon and a serious of situationally useful ones, but rather a choice from an array of worthy options. ___ ###Addressing Common Objections This is a relatively big change, so I will try to address any objections raised in the comments. However, I will address several of them in advance. - **It would require the non-standardization of melee.** While it's true that most class's melees have identical stats, Scout's bat is completely different, so there is at least precedent there. - **Too confusing for new players.** Having faster movement speed when your melee is out is a gameplay element already found in Counter Strike, so the mechanic itself wouldnt be too unfamiliar for most newcomers. As for Pyro being the *only* class which benefits from this melee speed boost, Valve could put the movement speed attribute either on the Pyro's melee weapon description (similar to how Valve put a description for the backstab mechanic on the butterfly knife) or in the list of class stats on the loadout screen, and/or add a ""speed"" icon to the HUD when your melee is out. And even if a player doesn't realize at first that they can boost their movement speed as Pyro in this way, it's a small enough difference for newcomers that it shouldn't greatly affect their enjoyment of the game, just like the weapon movement speed variation in CS:GO. - **It would make the Pyro too good.** Any Pyro worth their salt currently uses the Powerjack by default and only occasionally uses other melees. As such, applying that same Powerjack's movement speed buff to Pyro melees *in general* would only buff Pyro as a class in that Pyros could benefit from that melee speed boost without +20% damage vulnerability (assuming that damage vulnerability when active wasn't added to all melees, too). As that's a pretty small downside, it would make for a relatively small buff, one that would be significantly smaller than the Spy's movement speed buff from MyM. No, the true purpose of this across-the-board change is not to meaningfully buff Pyro, but to *improve the variety of viable melee options for Pyros*. ...However, just because Pyro *as a whole* wouldn't change too much doesn't mean that certain *weapons* wouldn't become overpowered by blindly adding a +15% speed boost to every Pyro melee; on the contrary, further tweaks to individual weapons must be made with this overall speed boost in mind. ___ ___ #Individual Weapon Changes Now that I've defended adding a convenient when-active speed buff to all Pyro melee weapons by default - thus putting them all on a level playing field with the Powerjack - I would like to propose further changes to ensure that individual melee weapons are kept relatively evenly balanced. ###The Fire Axe, the Third Degree, and the Powerjack Now that the **Fire Axe** actually has a use, there's no longer an excuse for the **Third Degree** being a direct upgrade. As such, it should have a relatively small, commensurate downside that would be noticeable in regular play, but not annoying enough to discourage its use altogether. I feel like the best downside would be slightly longer deploy or holster speed, because those would mildly affect the convenience of the speed boost. The Third Degree's downside definitely *shouldn't*, however, be longer swing speed (because unlike the Medic's Bonesaw, the Pyro's stock melee still won't be particularly useful as a weapon, so that wouldnt be significant enough a downside) or lower damage (because that would specifically reduce the Third Degree's effectiveness in the one situation in which it differs from the Fire Axe). Overall, the Fire Axe and Third Degree should be kind of like the Rocket Launcher and the Original; effectively identical most of the time, but situationally different. Now, after giving all Pyro melees +15% movement speed when active by default, **the Powerjack** no longer has a ""niche"" of convenient mobility (although calling convenient mobility a ""niche"" in the context of TF2 weapon attributes is somewhat like calling Walt Disney Animation/Pixar movies a niche in the space of great animated movies). Even without the massive advantage previously afforded to it by that attribute, however, the Powerjack still offers a risk/reward system for using it as a ""finishing weapon""; i.e. a weapon used to deal the finishing blow in combat. The Powerjack will differ from the other Pyro melees by having damage vulnerability on the wearer (or simply *more* damage vulnerability on wearer, in the scenario in which Valve gave that particular attribute to Pyro melees by default as well) and restoring health on kill. As such, it's a slightly riskier weapon to use in and around combat compared to the Fire Axe and the Third Degree, but unlike those weapons, it can be worthwhile using the Powerjack to finish off enemies. Exact amounts of damage vulnerability and health gained on kill to properly balance the Powerjack with the Fire Axe/Third Degree can and likely should be tweaked after gathering player data, but I'd start with +20% damage vulnerability and +50 health on kill (and allowing this to overheal again as it once did). &amp;nbsp; **New Fire Axe:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) &amp;nbsp; **New Third Degree:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) - All players connected via Medigun beams are hit - This weapon deploys and holsters 15% slower &amp;nbsp; **New Powerjack:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) - +50 health restored on kill - +20% damage vulnerability on wearer &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Back Scratcher and the Homewrecker Unlike most other Pyro melees, the **Back Scratcher** was actually a relatively useful weapon *without* the convenience of the Powerjack's speed boost. As such, it would be imbalanced to give the Back Scratcher a full +15% speed boost without nerfing some of its other characteristics, so I think that in order to preserve the integrity of the original weapon, it should merely be given a *reduced* speed boost. This boost will serve as a nice little buff to the Back Scratcher overall, but because its a lower speed boost than that of other weapons, the Fire Axe/Third Degree won't completely outclassed by the Back Scratcher whenever there's no Medic, and the extra damage doesn't make the Back Scratcher completely outclass the Powerjack in the niche of finisher weapons. I would start it off with a *+7.5% speed boost* and adjust it as needed. Similarly to the Back Scratcher, the **Homewrecker** was not useless pre-speed boost, either. While I think that giving a speed boost when active will somewhat improve the Homewreckers attribute of dealing extra damage against buildings by making it better-suited for rushing a minisentry, the fact that the Fire Axe still isn't worth using as an actual weapon (as I mentioned before) means that the Homewrecker's small damage penalty isnt reason enough not to use it over Stock. As such, like the Back Scratcher, the Homewrecker should grant a smaller speed boost. I think the Homewrecker is just a bit more situational than the Back Scratcher in everyday Pyro play, however, so I would start it out with a *+10% speed boost*, which is slightly more than that of the Back Scratcher. If necessary, then I could see it getting nerfed later down the line and requiring *two hits* to take out a sapper instead of one for the sake of Spies everywhere. &amp;nbsp; **New Back Scratcher:** - +25% damage bonus - +50% health from packs on wearer (passive) - -75% health from healers on wearer (passive) - -50% speed boost on wearer (i.e. +7.5% move speed on wearer) &amp;nbsp; **New Homewrecker:** - +100% damage vs buildings - Damage removes Sappers - -25% damage vs players - -33% speed boost on wearer (i.e. +10% move speed on wearer) &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Neon Annihilator If the **Neon Annihilator** is going to give a +15% speed boost when active, then no random crits and a small damage penalty are not good enough downsides, since - like the Homewrecker - it can remove sappers. The simplest solution would be to remove the sapper removal function altogether, making it basically Stock, but dealing less/more damage on dry/wet players. However, I would go further and have the Neon Annihilator give slightly *extra* movement speed to the wearer while ""wet"" (i.e. having recently touched water) and also let it allow the wearer to swim faster (i.e. suffer less slowdown from moving while underwater). This would enable Pyros to make much more consistent use of water/""wetness"" when using the Neon Annihilator; for example, by retreating faster when covered in Jarate, choosing a route to the objective through which you cross over a puddle to speed yourself up, or sneaking behind enemy lines faster using underwater flank routes on maps like Well, Watergate, and Freight. To me, those would be much more interesting uses for the Neon Annihilator than simply getting free one-shots on anyone who touches water, and it would be far less situational than simply hoping that you get the opportunity to be in melee range of a wet enemy. Now, to compensate for this faster swimming speed, the damage done with the Neon Annihilator's crits should be reduced so that Pyrosharks aren't *too* monstrous; I'd say they should still be able to one-shot Scouts if they can get away with it, but probably not full-health Medics. As such, lets raise the damage penalty against players from -20% (crits deal 156 damage) to -25% (crits deal 144 damage). &amp;nbsp; **New Neon Annihilator:** - (+15% move speed on wearer) - 100% critical hit vs wet players - +5% extra move speed on wearer while wet - -35% move speed reduction on wearer while swimming (passive) - No random critical hits - -25% damage penalty vs players &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Sharpened Volcano Fragment Even with the speed boost, there's no real reason to use the **Sharpened Volcano Fragment (SVF)**. Neither the Fire Axe nor the SVF are worth using in combat over your other weapons in the first place, but at least the Fire Axe can deal a lot more damage with random crits in pubs. The SVFs one upside of setting enemies on fire only really makes sense in Medieval Mode, in which the Pyro only has a melee weapon, because in that mode, it's like, ""Why should the Sniper be able to set people on fire but not the Pyro?"" ...But I digress. Now, I have an interesting idea for the SVF. You could probably just give the SVF minicrits against burning players, reduce the speed boost it gives by 2.5%, and call it ""balanced"", and maybe it would be, but Id like to propose another, much more interesting possibility. We'll start with the SVF giving afterburn on hit, having reduced damage, and dealing minicrits to burning players (for a total of 70 damage per swing, mind you; giving it minicrits against burning players don't suddenly make the SVF a powerful melee weapon). From there, lets make it so that the SVF only boosts movement speed by *+10% by default*. However, for each enemy player suffering from afterburn inflicted by the wearer (including afterburn caused by your flamethrower or flare gun), that boost *goes up by +5%*, so while you have a single enemy on fire, the speed boost given by the SVF becomes equal to the base speed boost of +15%. These ""boost enhancements"" stack, with each enemy currently suffering afterburn inflicted by you adding an extra +5% to the SVF's speed boost, up to a maximum of *+35% move speed* at five players burning. In comparison, Scouts run at 133% base speed, so youll be able to temporarily move a tiny bit faster than a Scout while holding your SVF after setting about half the enemy team on fire. I see this as being a utility tool that encourages a **""disruptive""** playstyle. You can flank the enemy, rush in and set a bunch of people on fire with your flamethrower, and then switch to your melee and run away at Scout speed. Alternatively, you can set several enemies on fire from afar with a flare gun (ideally the Scorch Shot or the Detonator) and use the resulting speed boost enhancement to relocate faster and harass the enemy from a different angle. Setting lots of enemies on fire can be just as helpful to your team as killing an individual enemy or two, and the speed boost afforded by this new SVF allows you to make an escape after lighting up a group or constantly be moving around when harassing large groups from a distance. I don't think that this SVF is overpowered, since it's surprisingly hard to keep 2-3 enemies on fire for more than a couple of seconds at a time while your melee is out, let alone 5, but if it turned out to be a bit annoying, you could always nerf it by appropriately adjusting the numbers involved with its ""boost enhancement"" attribute. The weapon's main drawback is that the quality of the speed boost the provided by the SVF is lower than that of the Fire Axe/Third Degree/Powerjack/Neon Annihilator most of the time, unless you're constantly setting enemies on fire. In particular, the SVF provides only +10% movement speed for actually getting to battle, so it is inherently less useful when there are no enemies around. Overall, I think these changes to the Sharpened Volcano Fragment would make for a weapon with a very interesting niche that serves unique Pyro playstyles. &amp;nbsp; **New Sharpened Volcano Fragment:** - On hit: target is engulfed in flames - 100% minicrits against burning players - -20% damage penalty - By default, only boosts wearer's move speed by +10% when active - Speed boost is increased by additional +5% for every enemy player currently suffering from afterburn inflicted by the wearer, with a maximum speed boost of +35% &amp;nbsp; ___ ###The Axtinguisher With the **Axtinguisher**, I think it makes sense for its main downside to be that it offers *no* speed boost while active, since it's historically been the only melee that's properly useful specifically as a weapon. I'll be honest, though; the Axtinguisher is a very controversial weapon, and no matter what stats I suggest, I know I'm going to catch flak for it from a large section of the community. As such, I defer to you readers to suggest balanced stats for the New Axtinguisher that would make it useful for a Pyro yet not overly unpleasant to play against for a *non*-Pyro. *If you have ideas for a ""New Axtinguisher"", please leave the stats in a comment!* &amp;nbsp; ___ ___ #Conclusion So, thats how Id rebalance the Pyros melee weapons. But what do you think? Do you think that the core change of applying the movement speed boost to Pyro melee by default is a good one? If so, would you include the Powerjack's damage vulnerability by default as well? Do you agree or disagree with specific weapon changes Ive suggested? What changes would *you* make to make Pyro melees balanced? I look forward to reading your comments! ___ ___ ___ **TL;DR** Summary of my suggested changes: - **Most Important Change: By default, Pyro moves +15% faster while melee is active.** - *Fire Axe* would be go-to melee, with no downsides and a convenient, consistent speed boost - *Third Degree* would be an Original-style alternative to Fire Axe, with a situational upside in exchange for slightly longer deploy and holster times - *Powerjack* would be risk/reward finisher weapon instead of the utility/mobility tool it currently is, having downside of damage vulnerability but giving +50 health on kill - *Back Scratcher* would only give +7.5% speed boost when active instead of full +15% - *Home Wrecker* would only give +10% speed boost when active instead of full +15% - *Neon Annihilator* would no longer remove sappers and wouldnt do enough damage to one-shot full-health, wet Medics, but would offer better mobility to Pyros when wet or underwater, allowing for more dynamic and interesting uses on maps with shallow water and/or underwater sections that don't involve simply hoping that enemies go into the water so you can hit them - *Sharpened Volcano Fragment* would have lower speed boost by default, but that speed boost would increase relative to the number of enemies currently suffering from your afterburn, making for a weapon that encourages a disruptive playstyle in which you focus on pestering lots of enemies with afterburn whilst constantly repositioning yourself "
238,vulnerability,tf2,Is the southern hospitality a direct upgrade?,11,5ixg6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/5ixg6x/is_the_southern_hospitality_a_direct_upgrade/,2016-12-18 10:58:58,"Mostly speaking in a competitive experience, i believe the southern hospitality is literally a direct upgrade. Recall the [degreaser rant from b4nny](URL remember how he said pyros dont care about burn damage and how they *only* really care about airblasts and their secondary? It's basically the same thing whereas the engie doesn't really move from his position where a pyro cant touch him. Here's the hospitality's stats &gt;On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds &gt;No random critical hits &gt;20% fire damage vulnerability on wearer Now, to me this is there is no downsides in this weapon. Of course there are, but if you think about it, random crits arent even available in competitive, and really think about the fire damage. If youre going to be set of fire there's going to be a dispenser/medic/friendly pyro to help you out. Even if there isnt theres no way a pyros going to let you go with literally any other wrench. You're also protected by a sentry gun 9/10 times you get caught on fire. The only way i see this weapon being flawed is a god tier scorch shot pyro picking you off enough to *move* to get health, like i said before you have so many resources to help you, if you dont then you're probably already dead. Let's talk about the bleed. Bleeding can be a super handy tool. Obviously as an engineer you most likely wont be using the bleed as a primary source of damage, but isn't it nice to deal 65 and more over time? It's also a great way to track invis spys if youre pyro/heavy is preoccupied given the spy doesnt kill you. And it 5 whole seconds of bleed, and if you didnt know bleeding sucks. It's different from fire whereas you cannot be extinguished/jump in water to get it off, thats really the only difference from flame afterburn. Now i think this weapon should be rebalanced sometime in the future, here's my input &gt;On Hit: Bleed for 3 seconds &gt;No random crits &gt;-30% movement speed when hauling buildings* &gt;+25% Weapon switch speed ^*=Might ^need ^a ^fix Let me know what you think!"
239,vulnerability,tf2,A suggested rebalance of the Ullapool Caber (x-post from /r/tf2weaponideas),5,59d8y3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/59d8y3/a_suggested_rebalance_of_the_ullapool_caber_xpost/,2016-10-26 07:10:14,"Ah, the Caber. Oh, how we miss ye! (Or, depending on your main, hate ye, but that's just a matter of opinion.) It used to be regarded as the epitome of ""fun"" in the game, being able to go all-out suicide bomber and take an enemy out instantly, along with yourself if you weren't careful. It was either loved for the wacky antics it could be used for, or hated by targets as a stupid tool that denied a kill that should have been theirs. The true problem with it, you see, was that it only appeased one side while the rest found it annoying to fight back against. Well, I say we need to balance it as both fun for explosive madmen and their targets. Current shit-tier stats: &gt;**[](/caber) ULLAPOOL CABER** &gt;*Level 2 Stick Bomb* &gt;* **(-) 20% slower firing speed** &gt;* **(-) This weapon deploys 100% slower** &gt;* **(-) No random critical hits** &gt;* **Unlisted: (-) ??% chance to misfire (probably a bug but worth mentioning)** &gt;* **Unlisted: (-) Deals 15% less base damage with an added 75 explosive damage** &gt;* **Unlisted: Has a unique taunt that, upon contact with a surface, detonates the weapon** Here's where the Caber currently stands. It's complete garbage, and undoubtedly one of the worst weapons in the game. The problem with it is that the last changes made to it did not reduce the overall ability to deal high damage to enemies, but instead just made it extremely difficult to utilize successfully. The bugginess of the weapon didn't help at all, making many Demomen leave this once beloved weapon in the garbage. Suggested stats: &gt;[](/caber) **ULLAPOOL CABER** &gt;*Level 4 Stick Bomb* &gt;* **(+/-) Upon contact with the first enemy, this weapon explodes, dealing 145 damage to the target and user, as well as 80 explosive damage to anyone caught in the blast radius** &gt;* **(+/-) Deploy speed changes based on current health, from a minimum of 70% slower deploy speed at 100% health to a maximum of 70% faster deploy speed at 1% health** &gt;* **(+) Explosive recharges 15 seconds after an unsuccessful detonation and 6 seconds after a successful detonation** &gt;* **(+) Deploy speed penalties are negated while explosive jumping** &gt;* **(-) Deals 15% less damage after detonation** &gt;* **(-) 20% damage vulnerability from fire and syringes** &gt;* **(-) No random critical hits while the explosive is present** &gt;* **Unlisted: Has a unique taunt that, upon contact with a surface, deals 250 damage to anyone caught in the blast radius, including the user** &gt;* **Unlisted: Demo will speak ""drunk"" lines occasionally while swinging the weapon and, along with ""explosion"" lines, upon detonating the explosive** (a little gimmick to add to the fun and to go along with the ""a sober person would throw it..."" bit in the description) Now THAT'S more like it! With these stats, the pointless damage penalty while the explosive was still equipped has been removed, leaving an overall base of 65 damage for victims unfortunate enough to be the Demoman's initial target. This is more than enough to kill pesky low-health classes like Scouts (who shouldn't be in close range), Spies (who shouldn't be visible), Engineers (who should be hiding behind a Sentry), and of course, Snipers (who IMO should be the ultimate target of Cabers). However, this still leaves enemies with 150 health and higher, particularly Medics (whom I honestly think don't deserve to be oneshot by Demos, but should still be hiding behind another player anyways), with a chance to escape with their lives. The additional damage from fire and syringes should allow both Pyros and Medics to effectively counter any suicide-bombing Demoman charging at them. As for the swing speed penalties, they make the weapon geared more for a last-resort playstyle, in which the user can whip it out in order to take someone with them as they die. The last resort idea appears to have been the original intention, after all, and this would serve that purpose well. Meanwhile, the explosive itself finally gets to recharge after a while, with an even shorter recharge time to reward players who hit their targets properly. Even better, the player can embrace the classic sticky jumping method to get rid of the deploy speed debuffs (if any are present) to quickly whip out their weapon and smack some enemy heads. Additionally, the taunt now does what it should have done the entire time - does an instakill to all classes, barring the Heavy. Let's face it - if you're gullible enough to get hit after hearing ""AHM GON' TA BLAST YA INTA THIN GLEW!!!"", you deserve to die. And hey, the Demo dies too, so it's not exactly one-sided. These changes, I believe, will make the weapon more fun for the user, and less of a hassle for other players, particularly Medics (an unfortunate victim) and Pyros (who as a Demo's hard-counter should be able to fight back effectively)."

Just ideas I'm not trying to destroy the game. Also I have put names on some ideas and some I haven't. Just concepts so they could be changed. Also I haven't seen any weapon concepts like mine but I haven't checked so I'm not copying or I don't know if I am. Scout Primary: Haven Shooter: Mini Crits targets while in the air. -66% clip size 10% Damage Vulnerability while active I don't play much scout so this might be stupidly OP or Under-powered. Soldier Primary: The Sky Launcher 50% Increased push force taken from rocket launchers. Mini Crits while airborne 50% Increased clip size -25% blast damage from rocket jumps -40% Damage Penalty 25% Slower Reload Speed -40% Ammo capacity (Only Two clips, each hold 6 rockets) No random Critical Hits Could be good for burst damage if you need to stop a group of enemies. Heavy: Primary: The Riot Shield The shield covers the front top half of the heavy while standing and covers all of the heavy while crouched. Immune to attacks that hit you where your shield is. -50% Movement Penalty while active. -10% Passive Movement penalty Attack shoves the enemy back. Alt Fire to charge at an enemy disarming them for 2 seconds. 30 Second cool down. The Man held sentry (Mini gun) Press F to activate Man Held sentry: 2 second taunt to activate. Place your sentry on stands and now it's stronger deals mini crits while active and take 40% less damage from all sources, infinite ammo while active. No jumping or walking while active. -25% Damage Penalty -25% Slower Spin up time Engineer: Helping Hand: Replaces Dispenser with Healing Station. The Healing Station forces out a healing wave the size of a control point. Healing every 1 seconds Level 1 = +20 Hp Level 2 = + 40 Hp Level 3 = + 60 Hp I think this is balanced since it doesn't give the engineer any ammo. Spy: The Venom Spike: On backstab let's out a poison hitting all nearby enemies. The poison reduces healing by -50% and Adds a 20% damage vulnerability on targets for 8 seconds. Wearer can not disguise -25 Max health on wearer The Clone Watch: When Cloaking and uncloaking leave an image of you're current disguise behind. This one is just a concept I thought it could come on handy but could also give away your position really easily. Medic: The Hollow Medi Gun, Changes the medics normal uber look to a faded version with the team color like a ghost. Uber lasts for 50% longer Heal 2x more with your medi gun while active You can resurrect nearby allies while active +20% Increased movement speed while active Only can uber you're self No Health pickups No capturing points while active. +20% longer uber build up +50% Increased push force taken from knock back effects. I dunno this is all I could think of I do have more ideas but they are bad. Not the greatest ideas I do feel like some of these would be op or under powered or would change the game too much for people. "

The Enforcer's Resistance Pierce stat does not work on various forms of resistances.

The resistances that it does not work on are the resistances of the Battalion's Backup, the Fists of Steel, the Wrangler shield on Sentries, the Invis Watch, the Cloak and Dagger, the Dead Ringer, and the Mann Power resistance Shield. One more thing that is very strange about the weapon is how the damage vulnerability of the Pain Train does not work properly (the 10% bullet damage vulnerability does not apply to the Enforcer for some reason).

246,vulnerability,tf2,Pyro Rebalance Suggestions: Improving Pyro's position in Comp and Casual,3,54jsap,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/54jsap/pyro_rebalance_suggestions_improving_pyros/,2016-09-26 19:25:11,"With hope in mind that their changes aren't already finalized, thought I'd help out Valve with a few suggestions for the promised Pyro Update rebalances, based on my ingame/reddit/tftv/twitch/youtube/tf2stats observations, [using their criteria from the Heavy class pack that created the Sandvich for inspiration.](URL Some problems I have identified with Pyro are summed up in the goals below. **GOAL 1:** Make Pyro more competitively viable. Pyro is very underused in competitive 6v6, as there is little it can do which another class can't do better. [Often games go by without Pyro being picked at all.](URL Making Pyro more competitively viable will add more variety to competitive play, and allow Pyro mains to show off their unique skills in a serious environment. **GOAL 2:** Raise Pyro's skill floor and skill ceiling (make it require more skill to use effectively, but more powerful in a skilled player's hands). Because of Pyro's low skill floor (holding W+M1 and walking towards players can get you kills if they don't escape or kill you first), some players can find it unfair that they died with very little effort or skill on the enemy's part. Raising the skill floor and skill ceiling will make Pyro feel more ""fair"" to play against, and make it more interesting to watch and play. **GOAL 3:** Level out Pyro's weapon unlock balance. Make stock more viable. Pyro's weapon unlock balance still leaves much to be desired. Stock is outclassed in the various slots by Degreaser/Reserve Shooter/Powerjack. Unless we want to be considered a P2W game, stock should always be a good option. [Meanwhile some weapons go seriously underused, eg Backburner.](URL *Constraints:* * Balance of defensive and offensive elements. Currently, Pyro's only competitive role is defensively oriented (using its airblast to defend last in 5CP). Making it stronger at this role will make it too good at preventing teams from winning, which causes stalemates. Hence I didn't buff airblast at all, and focused on its offensive elements. * Try and keep Pyro unique. [Robin Walker has said that the whole point of a class system is having unique classes;](URL so my changes are targeted at focusing on what makes Pyro different, and expanding on that. * Keep things simple. A less complex game is an easier one to balance, code, and for new TF2 players to learn. As such, all suggestions below will try and involve as little complexity as possible. My suggestions attempt to reach the goals and solve the problems, while keeping the constraints in mind. ______________________________________________________________________ * Fix the bugs showcased in URL Certain bugs make Pyro weaker from a balance perspective, so this fits into goal (1). Valve has indicated they're looking at this, but I just want to underline how vital it is. * Change the Flamethrower's particle system to some kind of hitscan cone or jiggleboned object. (2). This will make Pyro's range and damage more consistent, and less subject to variation based on ping and weird bugs. * Increase the range of the Flamethrower's cone by 25%, reduce its width by 50%. Goal (1) and (2). Because of Pyro's short range, it rarely gets close enough to damage enemies in competitive. Increasing the range would make Pyro able to actually attack enemies more often, making it a better offensive class more suited to full-time usage. If I only buffed the range, this would make W+M1 more annoying in pubs. But by nerfing the width in conjunction, the Flamethrower becomes a weapon which requires more tracking skill to use effectively, [similar to the Lightning Gun from Quake.](URL This would increase the counterplay to W+M1 Pyros by dodging left and right when they run right at you, meaning that they have to keep their fire on you to maintain damage. Pyros with good aiming skills would benefit from the longer range. * Buff the damage Afterburn deals (from 6 damage/sec to 8 damage/sec) on every fire-based weapon except Degreaser. Covers goal (1) &amp; goal (3). Increasing the lethality of afterburn means that Pyro will be a more effective counter to Spies, more effective against Scouts (the most powerful 6s class) if they can get in close range, and more dangerous in general. It also makes Pyro's afterburn immunity/extinguishing a more useful skill. Afterburn as a stronger killing tool makes stock Flamethrower and Backburner, Manmelter, Scorch Shot, Flare Gun, Detonator, and Sharpened Volcano Fragment all more viable. Finally, damage-over-time is a unqiue signature move of Pyro, which makes it a more unique experience to playing as ""quick, weak, short range Heavy"" or ""tough, slow, short range Scout"". Thus, buffing something that makes Pyro unique, so Pyro players can rely on it more, means that their decisions in combat will be different to those of a Scout or Heavy. * Buff Backburner: *Now grants 60% self-damage reduction from blast jumps.* This covers all three goals. (1), it gives Pyro a ""Gunboats"" option to reach the frontline more quickly in 5CP with Detonator jumping, making it a more viable class. (2), it gives Pyro a more skillful way of being effective. (3), it buffs one of Pyro's least-used primary weapons. * Buff Detonator: *Increase the splash damage radius from 110HU to 125HU.* Goal (1), (2) and (3). Detonator is the most skillful Pyro secondary, but not very viable in competitive usage because of its high costs. Buffing it in this way, plus the afterburn buff, will make the most skillful way to play Pyro more viable. For comparison, the Rocket Launcher's splash radius is 146HU. * Nerf the Reserve Shooter: *Clip size reduced from 4 to 3.* Goal (3), because Reserve Shooter's upsides outweigh its downsides, and it is superior to the stock Shotgun. It also has a tendency to piss people off. Reserve Shooter is one of the weapons [banned by all competitive 6s leagues (incl. asiafort).](URL * Rework the Axtinguisher: *Crits burning enemies from behind. Extinguishes burning enemies on hit. 50% less damage against non-burning enemies. No random critical hits.* Goal (2) and (3). Old Axtinguisher was better than stock. Love and War Axtinguisher was skillful, but still better than stock. Tough Break Axtinguisher is a sidegrade to stock, but not skillful. This should strike a happy medium between the three reworks, as this Axtinguisher will be more powerful in the hands of players who can ambush well, but worse than stock for straight-up conflict. ""Extinguishes target on hit"", apart from matching the name, will prevent this Axtinguisher from being used to 2shot Heavies. * Rework the Sharpened Volcano Fragment: *Ignites target on hit. 50% of Afterburn damage dealt (with all weapons) heals wearer. 2 HP drained passively per second.* Goal (3). Currently [nobody uses SVF](URL because it doesn't do anything the Flamethrower can't; this will solve that issue, making people use it as a fun stock sidegrade. Works similarly to Blutsauger and Boston Basher, rewarding the player for accuracy, but draining their *mortal soul* when not in combat. * Rework the Third Degree: *Minicrits targets connected by heal beams. Hitting bleeding allies ""extinguishes"" the bleed. +100% melee damage vulnerability on wearer.* Goal (3). Third Degree is the last straight upgrade in the game. Straight upgrades are bad, because they make TF2 more ""P2W"" and make stock reskins irrelevant, so this can be fixed. This rework makes Third Degree into a Medic-hunting weapon, with a small upside of extinguishing bleed. Since neither of these things are useful often, it has a corresponding small downside of melee vulnerability. * Nerf the Powerjack: *""20% damage vulnerability while active"" trait changed to ""-10% damage vulnerability on wearer.""* Goal (3). Nerfing Powerjack will make every other Pyro melee weapon, even including stock Fire Axe, a viable comparative choice. * Remove the hidden attribute [""While invisible, Spy has reduced timer on debuffs (fire, jarate, milk, bleed).""](URL Goal (1). A supposed reason for using Pyro in competitive is as a soft counter to Spy; but every other class can search for Spies almost as well, and Spy has a speed and range advantage on Pyro, and since Gun Mettle afterburn isn't even a very good way to track Spies. So, making this change will make Pyro a stronger counter to Spy (though Spy still definitely has the potential to kill him), making him a better choice when the enemy is running a Spy. Removing this hidden stat will also make the game simpler, as there is currently no in-game indicator that Spy has reduction on debuffs while invisible. * Reduce the coating time of Mad Milk/Jarate from 10 seconds to 7 seconds and Sydney Sleeper from 2-8 to 1-5 seconds. This change is so that we can do the above nerf to Spy's debuff reduction without making the Spy weaker against all classes. Also, these weapons are able to easily extinguish fire, weakening Pyro, so this ties into goal (1); and they (bar Jarate) are [considered overpowered in competitive 6s and banned in all leagues,](URL so they could do with a nerf anyway. This kills three birds with one stone. * Remove the afterburn damage immunity from Dead Ringer. Goal (1). [It's not even currently listed in DR's stats.](URL If Spies want to be fireproof, they should have to use the Spycicle. ____________ My hope is that these changes will help make Pyro viable more often in competitive play, with a higher skill floor and skill ceiling (and more counterplay), and with more balanced weapon loadouts."
247,vulnerability,tf2,Enforcer Resistance Pierce Stat Bugs / Problems Explained,43,55tyq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/55tyq8/enforcer_resistance_pierce_stat_bugs_problems/,2016-10-05 02:15:25,"Hello everyone. I believe that I have cracked the case on what is wrong with the Enforcer resistance pierce stat and why it only works on certain resistances. It works on The Natascha, the Brass Beast, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Vaccinator. It does not work on the Battalion's Backup, the Fists of Steel, the Wrangler shield on Sentries, the Invis Watch, the Cloak and Dagger, the Dead Ringer, and the Mann Power resistance Shield. I believe that the way it was programmed was that it will pierce resistances that have the stat as an upside with the specific word ""resistance"". This would explain why it does not work on something like the Dead Ringer despite it having the word resistance in its description it is because it is listed as a neutral stat. It only pierces things that are upsides in the weapon's description and has the specific words ""resistance"", which also explains why it doesn't work on the Fists of Steel, because it says less damage instead of resistance. The Natascha, Brass Beast, Darwin's Danger Shield and Vaccinator are the only weapons that have the word ""resistance"" and have it listed as an upside, which explains why they are the only ones that the stat works on. I still don't have an explanation as to why the Enforcer does not have extra damage against the Pain Train, but we'll see what happens. **Note:** I now have an idea of why the Enforcer bypasses the Pain Train's bullet damage vulnerability. The Enforcer stat says that it pierces damage resistances and bonuses. The key word here is bonuses, meaning that it may bypass damage vulnerabilities too. The Pain Train is the only weapon with a bullet damage vulnerability whilst all of the other vulnerabilities are global, fire or explosive. I don't know why it won't pierce global vulnerabilities as I now think that it is intentional, but this may somewhat explain why it bypasses the Pain Train's vulnerability. Hopefully this helps the TF Team and gets this issue fixed quicker. "
248,vulnerability,tf2,A case for the Darwin's Danger Shield,0,58nf7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/58nf7d/a_case_for_the_darwins_danger_shield/,2016-10-22 01:14:41,"*quick reminder* - +25 max health on wearer - +15% bullet damage resistance on wearer - 20% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer So a lot of people say the DDS is OP and personally, I've never really understood that. The sniper has two main counters: Other snipers and spies. So that sniper mains can keep practicing their aim and not have any game sense, There are 2 items to counter each of these: The DDS and the Razorback respectively. And here's where the OP argument comes in: The DDS stops an uncharged headshot or fully charged bodyshot from killing the sniper while the Razorback stuns the spy if they try to backstab the sniper once. Now here's what I think: The razorback stops one of the counters the DDS stops the other. Since you can only have one, you need to choose the one to counter the one who's picking on you the most. To me, That seems fine. Just as spies can shoot the sniper easily (unless they have l'etranger), Snipers can just charge up the shot, Not even fully, Just a bit. The only difference here is that the DDS actually has downsides. So really if any of them are OP, It's probably the razorback."
249,vulnerability,tf2,More weapon balance change ideas,0,4znr42,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4znr42/more_weapon_balance_change_ideas/,2016-08-26 19:27:57,"Decided to make another post tackling what I think should be changed with some of the weapons while providing personal reasons why such changes need to occur. Please be gentle. ----------------------- **Escape Plan** (+) Damage AND speed increases as health decreases (-) No healing from Medic sources while active (!) Weapon renamed to ""Equalizer"" The original Equalizer was perfectly balanced in its own right. After all, having the weapon out was the equivalent to flying a white flag while shouting ""I am almost dead!"" The problem here is Valve listened to salty babies who don't know how to counter a Soldier with 1 HP, and nerfed a great weapon. The best way Valve could've dealt with the Equalizer was by making the other melee options more popular with their own buffs, such as the Pain Train and Market Gardener. Speaking of other melee options... ------------------ **Equalizer** (!) Name changed to ""Nose Pick"" (!) Uses Kamikaze taunt (+) -100% damage to self while taunting NOTE: I went over a possible re-balance with this weapon in the other post, but I decided now would be a good time to show off an alternative of the Escape Plan is reverted to the original Equalizer's stats. This change transforms the useless Equalizer into a more useful version of the shovel, by reviving the feeling from the days when the Rocket Jumper and Equalizer worked together like butter and bread. ---------------------- **Quick Fix** (+) +100% healing rate (+) Mirrors blast jumps (-) No overheal (-) -25% Ubercharge rate (!) Ubercharge: Healing rate is quadrupled, healer and patient are immune to knockback, and healing aura is deployed around healer. Thanks to recent nerfs to the weapon, the Quick Fix is now outclassed by its cousins (including the Vaccinator). With this change, the weapon's signature ability to rapidly heal teammates is emphasized, while the Ubercharge is buffed and the weapon is given a couple more nerfs to balance it out. ----------- **Baby Face's Blaster** (+) On hit: Build Boost (600 damage required to be filled) (+) Speed is increased based on Boost (up to double normal speed) (-) Cannot double jump (-) -34% clip size (-) -33% movement speed The problem with the BBF is how fragile it makes Scout the moment he gets even a scratch and suddenly lose a great deal of his Boost. This tweak allows Scout to use the weapon to its full potential, compensating by removing his iconic ability to double jump and increasing the amount of damage needed to fill the meter. You can only lose Boost by dying. ----------- **Ullapool Caber** (+) Explosive damage dealt in area after successful hit (150 damage normally, 450 on crit) (-) -35% deploy time (-) User is instantly killed upon successfully hitting the enemy (-) No random critical hits This may be a more controversial suggestion, but hear me out. The buff makes the Caber what it should have been in the first place: a last resort weapon. No matter what, at the end of the day, you're essentially bitch-slapping people with a live grenade; neither side would've survived. -------------------------- **Axetinguisher** (+) 100% critical hit chance against burning targets (-) -35% damage penalty against non-burning players (-) No random critical hits (-) Weapon switch bonuses are ignored when deploying this weapon This weapon did not deserve the painful series of nerfs it went through. The stats are buffed back to its original form, with one more penalty to fix the issue that brought its decline: the weapon switch speed from the Degreaser. ---------- **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** (+) On hit: Target is engulfed in flames (+) On hit: Bleed applied for 10 seconds (-) -25% damage penalty NOTE: My other post had another suggestion for this weapon. I'm simply giving an alternative suggestion. I'll be frank with you, I have no absolute solution to this weapon's hopeless amount of issues, and I don't even know if this will change anything except make it less shitty. -------------- **Enforcer** (+) +50% damage against buildings (+) Attacks penetrate buildings (-) -20% firing speed (-) No random critical hits (-) Cannot use Sapper With this change (which hopefully would actually work, VALVE), the Enforcer can be used to take care of buildings from a distance and the Engies hugging their sentries. Of course, the inability to sap buildings would mean you would still be vulnerable to the sentry's overwhelming firepower, coupled with slower firing speed and lack of critical hits. The Enforcer can still be very reliable under these circumstances, but it won't be an upgrade to the Revolver. ---------- **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol** (+) Wearer never takes fall damage (+) Crits when it would normally mini-crit (-) -34% clip size (-) 20% damage vulnerability while active (-) No random critical hits The PBPP at present is nothing more than a shittier version of the Blutsauger. This buff gives the weapon more identity and viability for Scout while opening up more options for finishing off your foes. ----------- **Cleaner's Carbine** (+) +25% damage bonus (+) +30% more accurate (+) Dealing damage fills charge meter (+) Secondary fire when charged grants crits for 8 seconds (-) -20% clip size (-) -25% firing speed penalty while charge is not active (-) No random critical hits (-) Cannot switch weapons while charge is active (-) While charge is active and for a short period after it ends, you are marked for death The Carbine sucks, period. This buff turns you into Rambo. Unlike Rambo however, you're going to die in seconds if you're not cautious. ----------- **Bazaar Bargain** (+) +25% faster charge rate per head (+200% max) (+) Gain heads per headshot kill (-) Base charge rate starts at 0% The Bazaar Bargain has no significant downside aside from the base charge decrease that is negated after 2 headshot kills. This nerf forces the Sniper to choose his targets more carefully, as he is stuck with dealing 150 damage at best without heads. Working your way to 8 heads does make this a more rewarding experience, however. ------------ **Vita Saw** (+) On Hit Ally: Melee damage and melee firing speed of ally increases by 35% for 8 seconds (-) -35% damage done (-) -35% firing speed (-) No random critical hits The Vita Saw is a very special weapon in that it is questionable in pubs but overpowered in competitive. Rewarding the Medic for dying is unacceptable, so I've changed the stats completely into a support weapon. ------------- **Loch n Load** (+) +25% projectile speed (+) +50% damage bonus against buildings (+) 25% faster firing speed (-) 25% slower reload speed (-) -50% clip size (-) -25% explosion radius (-) Launched bombs shatter on surfaces The changes the weapon went through was completely unnecessary, but I figured reworking its original stats would work. With this tweak, the Loch n Load will become a more dedicated building buster. --------------- **Razorback** (+) Blocks a single backstab attempt (+) Razorback is restored after 60 seconds (+) While Razorback is intact, +25% non-crit damage resistance bonus from behind (-) +25% critical hit vulnerability Much like the Vita Saw, the Razorback has the ability to have the user be scoffed at for using it in pubs while pissing off all enemies in competitive. The stats have been tweaked so the Razorback would have a cooldown of 60 seconds, a resistance boost from behind, and have one particular nerf to satisfy those pissed off Spies: the ability to get killed by a well-aimed Ambassador shot to the head. ----------------- That's all I got for now.

I really dislike the weapon, not players that use it. I just find players that use it annoying, but I do not hate them. With that out of the way, on to the topic at hand. For me, The Darwin's Danger Shield is one of the most annoying weapons to play against (though not the most annoying). There are also situations that piss me off even more * Getting bodyshoted by an inexperienced sniper, who survives your headshot, who taunts after every kill. * Playing against someone you is good at sniper and uses this weapon making it hard as hell to kill them. * Playing against someone you is good at sniper and uses this weapon **AND** have a pocket medic with the vaccinator. Those are just a couple of situations that frustrate me about the DDS, overall it's just not fun to play against. I mean there is a reason it is banned in Highlander, like the vita-saw it forces the enemy sniper to use it as well or they are at a large disadvantage. Now onto my thoughts on how to make it less frustrating to play against: * Keep the health boost * Remove the bullet resistance * Add explosion and/or fire resistance or * Keep all current stats of the weapon, but disallow overheal and increase the explosion vulnerability to where one pipe can kill them * Maybe add fire vulnerability (I dunno maybe that's too much) or * Keep all stats of the weapon and just decrease weapon accuracy or increase the amount a player flinches when they take damage I dunno that is the best I can do, while keeping the survival tool that it is.

252,vulnerability,tf2,Some Medigun Ideas (long),17,5144zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/5144zk/some_medigun_ideas_long/,2016-09-05 00:15:03,"So the Medic secondary weapon library is...limited to say the least. Only four mediguns, including stock (and only 2 if you don't want to get flamed by your teammates). So I took it upon myself to create some ideas for new Mediguns. These aren't extremely thought out, so feel free to tweak my suggested stats or add your own ideas for Mediguns! First off, The Booster Beam. Level 23 Medigun - +15% healing beam length - Healing gives Medic and heal target a 10% boost in speed - +15% bercharge rate - -15% Overheal build rate - -10% speed when holding primary or melee weapons - bercharge: Gives a 60% speed boost to Medic and heal target, heal target gets a 50% faster firing speed. Right now, the Quick-Fix is the closest thing we have to a mobility based Medigun, and I thought a speed based ber would be an interesting idea. I also thought a boost in healing beam length for long range healing as a buff would be an interesting idea as well. Tell me what you think! Next, German Engineering. Level 15 Repair Device - Has the ability to repair buildings; buildings can be Overhealed - Holder can use Teleporters without consuming charge - Buildings become invulnerable when bered - Cannot heal classes - +30% damage vulnerability - Holds up to 3 bercharges - bercharge: When used on Sentry Gun - Gives Sentry unlimited ammo and gives Sentry +25% damage output - When used on Dispenser - Gives Dispenser unlimited metal output and gives the Dispenser +50% health output - When used on Teleporter - Negates teleporter cooldown and charge and gives classes +45% damage output for 5 seconds after leaving teleporter This may be the most unbalanced of my ideas, but it could get some thoughts going. The idea of beings able to heal and ber buildings has always been an inviting idea to me. The +25% damage vulnerability on the holder makes it easier to kill the Medic story avoiding building-camping. It would be an unorthodox choice, but a useful one at times (especially since it could be paired with another Medic). And finally, The Pocket Patient. Level 43 Medigun - Overheal now adds 175% of heal target's maximum as opposed to the normal 150% - +15% Overheal rate - +15% damage resistance to heal target - +25% resistance to flamethrower fire damage to heal target - -45% heal rate for 2 seconds after switching heal targets - +25% damage vulnerability on Medic - bercharge: Boosts Overheal to 225% of the heal target's maximum and gives heal target +50% damage resistance. Overheal slowly falls from 225% of maximum after ber, even while being healed. The idea of a pocketing based Medigun is not all that strange. In fact, the idea is similar to a scrapped Medigun called The Overhealer. The gun could have a very high strategic use, and I could see something like this being used in competitive play heavily. The gun makes the Medic weak in defense and the patient defense buffed to increase the pocket aspect (as well as making it easier to kill the Medic to avoid Heavy-Medic spawn trapping.) The healing lasts and falls slowly even after the ber, just to set it apart from the stock ber. The flamethrower resistance allows Medics to counter Pyros negating healing. EDIT: New Medigun idea. Credit to /u/Captain_Nesquick for the base idea. The Venom-Vacc Level 12 Vaccinator - Able to cycle through healing and venom with reload key - Healing heals teammates, venom slowly drains health away from enemy venom target - +15% bercharge rate - -20% healing rate - -25% healing beam length - bercharge: When running heal - healing rate tripled on heal target, both Medic and heal target get +20% resistance to explosive damage and 100% resistance to lasting damage (bleed and afterburn) | When running venom - venom rate tripled and leaves lasting poison effect after ber. The idea of a Medigun with venomous properties sounds like an interesting idea. Keep in mind that the venom rate is very slow, so tripling it isn't as intimidating and OP as it may sound. I tried making it seem more like a brother to the Vaccinator by allowing it to cycle through healing and venom and making its healing ber similar to the Vacc. EDIT: Another new Medigun idea. Credit to /u/palm_hero1 for the base idea. The Miracle Worker Level 5 Miracle Device - +15% heal rate - +15% firing speed on heal target - -15% damage vulnerability on holder - -15% bercharge rate - bercharge: Revives a dead teammate and makes then invulnerable for 2 seconds after resurrection. To revive a teammate, put your crosshair over their ragdoll or one of their bits. While the concept of reviving is in place in MVM, it's nowhere to be seen in normal play. The revive is it's main gimmick, as it's normal stats are not really anything to sneeze at. The ber controls could be a little shaky, so tell me what you think. So those are all the ideas I have. Again, these aren't extremely well thought out, and feel free to speak out if you see any glaring balancing issues with these. I'd like to see your thoughts about my ideas, or have any ideas of your own! EDIT 2: - Took out the German Engineering's ability to heal classes. - Bumped the 40% increase in healing beam length in the Booster Beam down to a 15% increase. - Gave Pocket Patient a 45% damage resistance increase to the heal target. EDIT 3: - Gave The Booster Beam and bercharge rate bonus and fixed formatting issues. P.S. Sorry if the formatting kind of sucks. Posting text is weird."
253,vulnerability,tf2,Heavy Lunchbox Rework,5,51c8ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/51c8ro/heavy_lunchbox_rework/,2016-09-06 09:25:20,"The other lunchbox items get shadowed by the Sandvich, unless you want to mess around with the Steak Sandvich. So here's my proposal for Dalokohs Bar and Steak Sandvich: Steak Sandvich gives a brief period of minicrits when consumed by an ally. Also remove the damage vulnerability so it doesn't suck to consume. Dalokohs Bar gives a brief (10 seconds seems fair) speed boost when consumed by allies, and a (maybe 15 second) speed boost when consumed. This would be great especially if lunchbox got its own weapon slot, make good for fatscout. Something to apply to both of these is the effects don't apply if thrown for a friendly heavy, because that'd remove the downside of taking time to consume it. So in summary: Sandvich is good to restore health, put out fires, and heal friendly Medics. Steak is good for giving allies brief minicrits, as well as mess around with melee. Dalokohs Bar is good for being faster in battle, and to speed up classes during rollout, as well as boost allies for general combat. Also if lunchbox becomes a separate weapon slot, assist in fatscouting. Also as a buff for Sandvich, lower cool down time if it's thrown for allies. Doesn't buff Heavy's self heal, but improves support role, which wouldn't be terrible for shotguns if lunchbox got a separate slot. I'm bringing that up often because I want it to happen. It's appropriate for the class. "

Even Call Of Duty is better than this. So I decided to write how I think competitive can be fixed * Most important and therefore first: Add an option ""max acceptable ping"". This is a MUST thing for both casual and competitive. You did it in csgo and it works great * Allow the selection of the maps we want to play * Add highlander gamemode with payload maps * Harsh the leaver penalty and make the match not cancel if someone rage quits. Also leaving a game should count as 2 losses (first leave will count as a single loss though so if your net crashed once it doesn't rek you) * Add 10 placement matches before getting your competitive rank. * Rebalance ALL the weapons (except stock and ones that are in a perfect state). This includes: Revert changes to Bison, rebuff the Cozy Camper (no flinching when on 50% charge or higher), nerf Darwin's Danger Shield (maybe add crit vulnerability or something) and everything. In my opinion you should also add custom stats to all the common reskin weapons (like Fortified Compound and the Original but NOT like Shard Dresser) * Casual rank xp should be earned in competitive too. Just a minor thing but I don't see any reason as to why you won't get any levels for the coin for playing comp"

Health added per hit would be fine if it was more accurate than a water hose. Firing speed is miserable. *How to fix it*- Increase accuracy tenfold, increase the firing speed by 5%, remove health on hit and add passive health regen at 2 hp/s while active. Would balance out debuffs nicely, and would once again pair with the BFB like originally intended. Switching out to eradicate fall damage is fine, but only if it rewards with another passive buff. **The Sun-on-a-Stick** *What's wrong with it*- Not as bad as it was before MYM, but still low on the Scout melee list. 25% fire damage resistance is not enough to make it appealing. *How to fix it*- Boost the fire resistance to 75%; add 5% damage vulnerability from all other sources (both stats apply only while active)."
257,vulnerability,tf2,Balance change ideas,4,4w01b7,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4w01b7/balance_change_ideas/,2016-08-04 04:33:15,"**EDIT**: I've had to make some changes because I'm unused to the format. It looked better on paper, but the finished product reminded me of that scene in The Simpsons where every attempt Homer made at breakfast burst into flames. ------------------------------------------------------------ After lurking on the subreddit for some time, I decided to give my own two cents about what new stats some of the weapons I feel need. Just note that there is no particular order in how these weapons are listed. **Third Degree** (-) -35% damage against players not connected by Medigun beam (-) 25% slower swing speed (-) No random critical hits (+) All players connected by Medigun beam are hit (+) Full critical damage against Medics connected by Medigun beam (+) +25% damage against players connected by Medigun beam This tweak turns a weapon that is considered a straight upgrade to stock into a situational sidegrade that focuses on its most valuable (and only) stat, which makes the Pyro a more significant threat. Admittedly, this may or may not be a broken concept that could get out of hand, but we *are* talking about a class that focuses on close combat, so it might be fine. **Righteous Bison** (+) Projectile penetrates players (65 base point-blank, 25 max fall-off) (+) Projectile can light arrows (-) -25% less damage against buildings Basically I want the weapon to be returned to its original condition, with the only notable change being that instead of the projectile hitting the player multiple times in a row, it instead hits them once and nothing more. To make up for this, it deals more damage. **Buffalo Steak Sandvich** While under the effects: (+) Attacks mini-crit (+) Move speed increased by 30% (+) Damage taken will be reduced by 25% (-) Can only use melee weapons (-) Marked for death for 5 seconds after effects last The Buffalo Steak Sandvich at present is useless due to the already slow movement speed of the Heavy and the damage resistance penalties. Giving this buff will give the BSS more use and make it more fun. For those that may say it would make the GRU useless: it won't. The GRU's abilities aren't restricted by cooldown and you can switch to your minigun or secondary and back whenever you want, while the BSS in either case forces you to stick with your melee weapon while the enemy tries to mow you down with guns. **Brass Beast and Natascha** (!) Nerf is rolled back Enough said. **Darwin's Danger Shield** (+) +26 HP (+) +35% non-critical bullet resistance (-) Body shots from enemy Snipers are taken as crits Yes, the 26 was intentional. People are pissed that Sniper, despite the fact that the weapon is designed this way because of an item set bonus that no longer exists, can survive headshots with this weapon. I'm still allowing that ability to exist, but with a twist: Snipers can kill DDS users more easily with body shots. The ability to survive non-crit bullets more easily would be used to compensate for this huge downside, with the blast resistance penalty removed since keeping it seems a bit much at this point. **Your Eternal Reward** (+) Disguise as the player you've successfully backstabbed (+) Silent killer: No attack noise from backstabs (+) Silent killer: Reduced cloak volume (-) Cannot use disguise kit (-) 0.5s longer cloak blink This change allows the YER to more closely resemble the former Saharan Spy set bonus, which will make it a more useful weapon overall and make playing Spy more interesting. **Classic** (+) Charge and fire shots independent of zoom (+) Can headshot players when unzoomed (+) +10% damage on body shot when unzoomed (+) +33% charging speed unzoomed (+) Full movement speed when charging unzoomed (-) Headshots mini-crit when zoomed and not fully charged (-) -80% damage on body shot when zooming (-) -50% movement speed when zooming and charging (-) 25% longer reload time The Classic as it stands is arguably the worst Sniper weapon in TF2, if not the worst weapon overall. This tweak rewards the Sniper for relying on skill while punishing them for using the scope. **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** (+) Players are ignited when hit (+) Afterburn duration and damage are doubled (-) -30% damage This tweak changes a shitty weapon into a less shitty weapon that can be used when you're out of ammo but still think that weenie named Scout needs to be roasted for a while longer. It's not a perfect solution, but it's a start. **Equalizer** (+) Damage increases as the user is hurt (-) -90% less healing from Medic sources (-) No random critical hits when above 50% HP. (!) Base damage increased to 65 at full health, with a maximum of 170 damage at 1 hp Guys, the Equalizer was fine before the split, even if it was overused. Ever since that split, however, the Equalizer just became that one weapon you use to make some scrap metal when you receive it from the drop system. Since the Escape Plan lets you go at base speed while at full health, why not do the same thing with the Equalizer, but with damage instead? Of course, much like how the Escape Plan marks the user for death when active, I suppose you shouldn't be dealing any crits when above half your health. **Pain Train** (+) +1 capture rate on point or payload (+) +20% movement speed when carrying intelligence (+) In MvM: Match speed of bomb carrier (-) +15% bullet damage vulnerability on wearer Pain Train is literally useless outside of ctf_ or pl_. This buff will allow players to use it in most other gamemodes. **Mantreads** (+) -75% reduction in push force taken from damage (+) Deals 5x falling damage on the player you land on (+) Fall damage not received on wearer (!) Can now be worn by Demoman Mantreads do not serve much purpose outside of Hightower, rarely used ever in any other map. The buff will allow those Trolldiers to use it by their leisure. By allowing Demoman to equip it as well, the class will be given even more diversity and provide some interesting plays. **Market Gardener** (+) Deals crits while wearer is rocket or sticky jumping (+) 25% more range when rocket or sticky jumping (-) 25% slower firing speed (-) No random critical hits (!) Can now be equipped by Demoman This buff will make the Trolldier play-style more interesting, with Demomen getting in on the action. I'd include more, but I think this is long enough. Express your thoughts down below, and tell me how much you would want to see them in the game or what needs to be changed. Thanks for reading."

I tried to formalize the three non-minigun primaries for Heavy that I've heard floating around. My goal with the stats I'm naming is to make them fun/interesting but not overpowered, though not necessarily competitively viable. I'll give base stats, then list some possible permutations and problems. I'm just theorycrafting/spitballing, so if you think a number could use a tweak, or a stat change should be added/removed, mention it in the comments. If I say anything particularly silly and somebody suggests a fix, I might edit it into the main post with credit. Finally, I'm not posting this to /r/tf2weaponideas because I'd like for this to be more generally read. Here goes: #Bearskin Cloak Level 1-100 Animal Hide Clothing &gt;+100 Max Health &gt;Larger melee reach &gt;+50% clip size &gt;+30% more accurate This is the most common idea I've heard--general stat boosts on a passive non-minigun. You get a fairly large health boost, a pair of bonuses for the shotgun, and a range bonus to aid punch heavy. Depending on how powerful Valve wants this item to be, they could either cap overheal at the regular 450 or increase it to a whopping 600. I tried to think of shotgun bonuses that wouldn't overlap too badly with the Family Business; while they share a clip size stat, using both together would still make sense, especially given the fairly unique increased accuracy (I'm not sure how the accuracy scales, so that number is especially wobbly). I tried to think of a stat to help melee Heavies, but there aren't many options. Extra knockback would make Punch Heavy's job harder, and melee firing speed and damage are rather generic and covered by other weapons already. Applying a slow to punched enemies would be useful and make sense thematically, but slows also have the potential to be annoying. I thought maybe an increased melee crit chance might be interesting--I always thought *melee* crits were interesting, as they give you an opportunity for a last ditch melee attempt, leading to a huge adrenaline rush (plus ""large damage at point blank"" in general isn't unreasonable, given that getting close to someone is rather difficult, especially with melee timing). On the other hand, though, crits are fairly well hated here, so I decided to leave it off my ""base"" stats. In the end I just went with ""range increase."" Finally, there's the obvious problem of ""Sitting on the last point with a massive amount of health."" I'm not entirely sure that would be a problem--Heavy's health pool is definitely a big part of his defense potential, but another part is minigun, which does ridiculous damage at point blank range. With the weaker shotgun, it wouldn't be as hard to get close and deal massive damage to Heavy. At any rate, if tanky Heavies sitting on last became a huge problem, Valve could add +33% damage from explosives, nullifying the health bonus for explosive classes. #Jump Boots Level 1-100 Functional Footwear &gt;+30% faster movespeed &gt;Grants Double Jump This one is the most literal interpretation of ""fat scout."" The speed boost is identical to that of the GRU, which feels just about right to me, and of course you need to have double jump if you're a Scout. Heavy's defensive power would be significantly handicapped by this item, so I can't foresee any problems with it. The reason to play Scout over Fat Scout with this item would be that Scout is significantly faster than Heavy *and* has greater damage potential. At any rate, if it turns out too powerful, Valve could reduce or remove the movespeed bonus. An interesting thematic variation I heard is to make them wings like the [Hussars](URL wore (Hussars originated as medieval Eastern European cavalry). #Riot Shield Level 1-100 Tactical Protection Device &gt;+70% damage resistance from the front This shield should probably be larger than an actual riot shield would be in order to facilitate it as a team protection item. It's worth noting that it would probably be a fairly hard counter to Sentries, and a fairly powerful offensive team item in general. If it ended up too powerful, a damage vulnerability from behind, a sensitivity reduction like that of a scoped sniper rifle, and/or a reduction for FOV could be put in place. This has three possible implementations: Passive: This is the listed base stats. It would simply be a passive item that always provides this bonus. This is the simplest implementation. Pseudo-Active: Right click to raise the shield with either your secondary or melee equipped, much like the Demo's shields can be activated while holding your primary or melee. This is certainly more interesting than the passive implementation, but it has the potential for weird interaction with melee and Sandviches. The raising time would probably be shorter than the regular minigun spinup time. Active: It would be a regular selectable weapon with a similar ""raise"" function to the pseudo-active variant. The question, then, is what to do with the primary fire. Thematically, a shotgun, grenade, or flashbang makes sense, but Heavy already has a Shotgun, grenades are Demo's domain, and slow/stun/blind functionality can be very annoying. (the only person I've heard mention this idea is /u/Deathaster, so props to you) So, that's my attempt to formalize non-minigun primaries and facilitate discussion. Thanks for reading! TL;DR stat-boost cloak, double jump boots, riot shield"
261,vulnerability,tf2,Can the Beefsteak be OP?,0,4pzlit,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4pzlit/can_the_beefsteak_be_op/,2016-06-27 06:38:38,"The answer to this is yes. Now for those of you for whatever reason don't know what The Beefsteak Sandvich does here are the stats. As a secondary it replaces the shotgun and regular sandvich. When consumed grants user 15 seconds of +35% speed and automatic mini crits, however during this time said heavy may only use melee and has +25% damage vulnerability. Now I hear you naysayers out there. All that ""can't use my minigun"" and ""why can't it just be crits"", and ""oh the damage vulnerability just isn't worth it,"" but before you bash it for the uptienth time, hear me out. Now most people answer that nasty damage vulnerability with fists of steel but at best it's gimmicky. Yes you get mini crits and a total ranged vulnerability of -10% (although your melee vulnerability is a staggering +125%), but you just don't have that massive damage output to change games and make the setup worth it. But I have a different setup that has taken a gimmick that doesn't really work and turned it into a utter beast. The KGBs (Killer Gloves of Boxing) First off yes you sacrifice the resistance you get with the Fists of steel but if you are doing this right that shouldnt be a problem. In return you get 5 seconds of pure crits after every kill. Crits that can ohko everything but a heavy (duh, he's only 3 hit ko) and an overhealed demo knight. While this tends to be better on smaller maps like koth, it can be devestating at choke points in payload as well. So here is how it goes. The key is to find the most indirect route to a spawn or choke point and nom that sandvich and get the jump on an unsuspecting enemy and suddenly instead of tiny little mini crits you now have a machine gun of uppercuts and a wonderful speed boost with which to wreak havoc. and if you manage to get a quick fix to Uber you, God help the other team because there is nothing in god's green earth to stop the massacre except a lack of a face to punch in. The highest chain punch I have managed as of yet has been 9 in less than 15 seconds as the blue team was about to make a push on the point in koth nucleus, and if you can math, with 12 people to a team that would be 3/4 of it and if that isn't game changing, your team really sucks at playing the objective. Of coarse this is not a suicide strat. You can have a surprising amount of longevity if you strike hard and fast enough to leave an opening for escape. I hope to post a video of this beefstesk awesomeness as soon as I can but I would love to see if you guys get the same kind of results I did. Keep in mind this is Not a plug and play strat and takes quite a bit of practice timing your surprise attacks to get the most effectiveness out of your beefsteak speed boost and figuring out when your presence is no longer appreciated and how to get the hell out.

263,vulnerability,tf2,Weapons that still need attention.,2,4rte8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4rte8a/weapons_that_still_need_attention/,2016-07-08 16:48:19,"So far, It seems there are upsides and downsides to this update. Here are some items that I really expected to have had something done to them and a few complaints about items that *were* changed for the worse imo. **Scout** Sandman is still a problem. Stunning a key target at no real cost is an issue. -25 health and no double jump to promote a very very passive playstyle. **Sniper** * Darwin's Danger Shield This item is flawed. You have a free advantage over any sniper you come across. That's why its banned in almost every 9v9 league. Simply remove the bullet resist and explosive vulnerability to promote an offensive playstyle. * Razorback The hardcounter to one of sniper's biggest counters. In highlander, the sniper becomes extremely tough to deal with when being overhealed, protected by a sentry and or other teammates. Remove the ability to be overhealed with this item on to promote a loaner playstyle. * Jarate No need to explain here. My idea is to only allow for 1 enemy to be covered at a time. * Cozy Camper I feel they took away what really made this item extremely useful. Why not decrease the movement speed of the player and or simply not allow the player to move while scoped. That would promote a defensive playstyle. **Soldier** * Cowmangler The cowmangler still has many hidden downsides that have not been looked into. They need to be fixed (example, hidden reload penalty) I personally would turn this item into a reskin of stock as this weapon promotes no specific or unique playstyle. **Pyro** * Base Pyro Mechanic I think pyro should be allowed a flare gun slot at the same time as a shotgun one. This has the potential to bump up pyro's skill ceiling as well as give him more combative options. Like how TFC Pyro has an incendiary cannon along with the single barreled shotgun. * Reserve Shooter Still a silly weapon. Slow the fire rate and reload maybe? * Axtinguisher Still has yet to see any action in the battlefield. **Spy** * Diamondback Still rewards spy full crits for doing what hes already suppose to be doing. I say make this item a reskin of the Amby or Stock. **Engineer** * Pomson Removing spy cloak and medic's uber is still an obnoxious low-skill mechanic. This item has potential to be something unique and interesting in the engineer's arsenal. **Medic** * Vitasaw Just like in the DDS, this item puts the enemy team's medic at an automatic disadvantage. Make it give health back on hit. 25hp on hit at the cost of 1hp of regen. Will pair nicely with the Blutsauger as the ultimate battle medic set. * Solemn Vow Information is a large part of a competitive game. Allowing your medic to simply see enemy health and uber percentage is quite broken. 30% more damage at the cost of 20% slower swing speed. Or turn into bonesaw/amputator reskin. **Heavy** * Brass Beast &amp; Natascha Can't say I like the nerfs. * Family Business I think this weapon should go multiclass. Engineer and Pyro can use it. Tell me what you think about these current weapons. Are they a problem? Do you have different balance ideas or other weapons that you feel still need change. "
264,vulnerability,tf2,My thoughts on the balance changes.,5,4ryb8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4ryb8e/my_thoughts_on_the_balance_changes/,2016-07-09 12:21:48,"Out of all the blance changes they have made in the 3 years these are some of the most bizzare and questionable. That being said let's jump right in.(Disclaimer: I have no idea how to formatt on reddit) **Scout** &gt;Crit-A-Cola &gt;Added Marked-for-Death debuff for 2 seconds after the buff effect expires This still doesn't solve the main issues with the weapon. For 8 secounds it gave scout extra mobility and damage with the small downside of a 10% increased damage vulnerability. Why would you ever use the pistol when you have this item? The mini-crit damage makes it less likely you'll need the pistol as a finisher and the lack of fall-off also negates the pistols superior range advantage. The speed boosts also help you evade incoming damage which makes the 10% damage vulnertability pointless. I don't see how the marked for death debuff helps. By the the time that effect kicks you'll either been killed already by the scout or he used the mobility buff to retreat to safety. Wouldn't be better to make the mark for death debuff last during the effect duration? That way you would have to conisder trading health for damage when you use this weapon, instead of it being a straight upgrade to the pistol. &gt;The Soda Popper &gt;Added ""On hit: build Hype"" &gt;Removed ""build hype by running around"" Another change I don't see the point of. When this weapon first came out it was essentially scouts phlog: an awful crutch weapon that didn't add anything intersting. As of 2013 it's a weapon that makes scouts trade damage for increased mobility when used. I'm not sure of the viability of that, but it's sure as hell fun to play with. It now builds hype as a result of damage done, but the weapon does significantly less consistent damage than a normal scatter gun would. Running to build hype was fine before because the weapon was built around mobility, not damage. If the weapons weakness is lack of damage, why would you encourage dealing damage as a way of achieving hype? &gt;Shortstop &gt;Added an Alt-fire attack -- reach out and shove someone! &gt;Removed +healing bonus &gt;Reduced pushback vuln to +20% (from +40%) This weapon is a hot mess. Before we even get into the stats I have to ask a question. What is the purpose of this weapon? My best guest is that it's designed to give scout a mid range option, but why? Scout is a close range class that uses superior mobility to get within effective range and evade damage. How does this weapon fit scouts MO? It would be better if it was a pistol, but how would you balance it that so it's no a boring ""stat+ stat-"" weapon. The shortstop suffers from being fundamentally flawed and while the new shove mechanic is fun what's the purpose of it? I don't think the devs have any clue what to do with this item. &gt;Sun on a stick &gt;Take 25% less damage from fire while deployed It went from being useless to a straight upgrade to stock. That's what happens when you don't rework fundementally flawed weapons. **Soldier** &gt;The Righteous Bison &gt;Fixed a bug causing players to be hit by the same projectile multiple times, causing the damage dealt to vary &gt;wildly This wasn't even a bug. That was how the weapon worked and dealt damage. This is a huge oversight that needs to be fixed immediately. &gt;Per-shot damage has been increased to compensate, resulting in slightly more damage on average &gt;Point-blank deals 54 damage (previously 20-80) &gt;Maximum range deals 24 damage (previously 14-56) &gt;Slowed projectile by 30% &gt;Projectile damage reduced by 25% for each enemy penetrated &gt;Updated projectile impact sound The new per-shot damage does not compensate at all. The weapon was supposed to deal 80 damage point-blank, and now that damage nerf alone makes the weapon completely useless. To add even more insult to injury is the slowed projectile speed. Why was this even needed? The Bison could have had 6 shots and it still would have a been a sidegrade due to it's slow easily avoidable damage. This weapon forced you to trade the realible rocket/shotty combo damage with this slow as hell projectile that functioned like a weaker rocket with no splash. This caps the skill on the weapon because good players can dodge all your shots since the projectile is too slow to be reliable. And then the final nail on the coffin is the projectile damage being reduced on penetration, another unnecessary change that only makes the weapon worse at what it's supposed to do. Everthing about this change is pointless, and needs to be reverted (except the sound of course). GG Valve, you killed the Bison. &gt;The Disciplinary Action &gt;Reduced duration of speed bonus on teammates to 2 seconds (from 3) For what reason? The whip is considered a viable weapon but not the best. &gt;The Rocket Jumper &gt;Updated model/materials and sound While this change is reasonable due to all the skins being added to the game, the new models just look horrible. **Sniper** &gt;Cozy Camper &gt;Now requires a full charge to gain flinch resistance I don't see a reason to ever use this item. A good sniper would know to charge a shot around a corner so that the he won't be shot at in the first place. An aggressive sniper might have use this weapon since you take more damage implementing an aggreesive playstyle, but the flinch resistance only apllies to a full charage, which is something you'd rarely do if you were playing aggresively. So this nerf just made the item useless. &gt;The Sydney Sleeper &gt;When fully charged, or when making a headshot, now applies Jarate in a radius &gt;Scoped shots now extinguish teammates Nobody like getting jarate'd and nobody liked getting bodyshot. I'll have to see it in action more to tell whether or not it's balanced. **Heavy** &gt;Natascha and Brass Beast &gt;20% damage resistance now only applies when spun up and below 50% max health Good, i'm sorry but giving natasha and BB damage resistance was a lazy way to make them viable weapons. Any weapon stat that allows you to nullify your hard counter (can't kill an overhealed heavy as sniper in one shot) for free is fundementally broken and should not be in the game. I know heavy needs to be buffed but that was a terrible, lazy way to do it. &gt;Huo-Long Heater &gt;Added -10% damage &gt;Added +25% increased damage vs. burning players &gt;Reduced ammo drain to -4/sec (from -6) &gt;Reduced pulse damage from Ring of Fire to 12 (from 15) due to increased damage vs. burning Have the current balance team never used this weapon before? This weapon was a terrible crutch to begin with but these changes makes it seem like no one at valve plays this game anymore. So you have a generic -10 damage stat that's supposed to be made up with a increased damage vs burning players, even though the only way for you to light players is to have them attack you in melee range. Nobody's stupid enough to melee a spun-up heavy to begin with, and if their that close the minigun would have shredded them to pieces with no negligible difference. Also, why must players be punished for being on fire (which is supposed to be punishment for allowing a pyro to get that close to you already) by a heavy? That's kinda the wrong class to have that atribute on. **Spy** &gt;Max speed increased to 320 (from 300) Who asked for this? I think most experienced players can agree that spy fundamentally underpowered due his effectiveness being determined by the incompetence of the enemy team rather than the skill of the player. However, this only applies to higher levels of play most pubbers don't care about. The spy already had the ability to go invisible which skilled players could use to make up for the lack of mobility. It still doesn't change the fact that communication and good gamesense can shut down spies. &gt;Enforcer &gt;Attacks pierce resist and absorb effects from all sources This reads like a patchnote from the joke thread of autogenerated ones. Buffing the enforcer is already a mistake. It's a ""stat+ stat-"" weapon that couldn't ever be balanced unless it's the same as stock or reworked. It took me a while to understand what ""attacks absorb effects from all sources"" even meant. It basically means that the enforcer ignores damage resistances such as vancinator sheilds, the darwins dargineer shield, and the dmg resistances of other cloaks. This seems like less of a balance change and more of a random reason valve is giving to use the enforcer. This item has absolutely no substance to it. The only reason why I'd ever equip this weapon is if theres a enemy medic on the other team using the vacinator. It doesn't add a new playstlye, it doesn't have an interesting mechanic, it isn't any more fun to use. It's just a random buff that gives that makes it a slight upgrade to stock if the enemy team has a vac medic. **Pyro** &gt;All Flamethrowers &gt;Added: Direct damage reduces Medi Gun healing and resist shield effects by 25% &gt;Medics hear a ""healing interrupted"" sound when this is happening to their heal target I was going to say this was a good buff to afterburn until I read the direct damage part. Out of all the the thing they could have fixed, buffed or reworked on pyro this is it. They could have fixed Flamethrower Mojo, They could have made flames hitscan, they could made afterburn a viable mechanic, but instead they just did this. They seem to want pyro to be able use the flamethrower as a viable weapon, but they don't want to do any of the reworks neccesaary for that to happen. The fact that they didn't even fix flamethower mojo before launching the heavy vs. pyro war is concerning. **Demo** &gt;Base &gt;All boots now require a shield to activate any move speed bonus listed on the item Why? Using boots are demoman was a fair trade of your secondary weapo-I mean granade laucnher for extra health and mobility. This was not needed at all. &gt;The Iron Bomber &gt;Decreased the fuse time to 1.4 seconds (from 2.0) This is the best balance change in this update so far. The Iron Bomber can now be used to grenade jump better and bouncing rollers is more consistent. I won't get into the details of the Iron Bombers design purpose but this change helps it fill it's niche better. &gt;The Quickiebomb Launcher &gt;Increased charge time reduction to -70% (from -50%) &gt;Increased damage bonus for (max) charged shots to +35% (from +25%) &gt;Increased clip size penalty to -50% (from -25%) &gt;Removed ""Stickybombs fizzle 4 seconds after landing"" I really don't know enough about this weapon to really judge whether or not it's balanced. I do know that getting sniped by demomen with this gun was frustrating as hell and this seems to enable that. &gt;Sticky Jumper &gt;Updated model/materials and sound MY EYES **ENGINEER* &gt;Base &gt;Level 1 teleporters now cost 50 metal (previously 125) I might be biased since my favorite class is engineer but-HELL YES. The teleporter can potentially be the most important tool in the toolbox as engineer. It allows a level of force projection (albiet situtaional) that is rivaled only by the medic. I don't really know why valve choose the metal costs they used before this update, but I don't really have anything bad to say about this. &gt;Widowmaker &gt;Damage increased +10% when attacking the same target as your sentry Another engineer buff that comes seemingly out of the blue. I guess this sort of rewards engineers for using DM to make up for the weakness off sentries (which is actually how engineer was designed to be played.) So nothing bad to say about this, Stock is still more reliable (especially if you don't have the pistol). This combined with the teleporter buff actually makes combat engie role more powerful. Teleporters are already a valuable tool, and being able get your metal back more easily when using is great. &gt;Eureka Effect &gt;Reduced ""50% less metal from Dispensers and Pickups"" to 20% &gt;Added ""Teleporters cost 50% less metal"" Well i'll be danmed, another Engie buff. Doing rollouts with the eureka effect is more useful. &gt;The Short Circuit &gt;Base projectile attack is -10 metal (hit or miss) and then add -5 metal for each projectile destroyed (sometimes a buff, sometimes a nerf) This is fine and all, but the biggest issue I had with the short circuit is that fact that you can track cloak spies with that. Engineer shouldn't really have the short circuit to begin with (Demoman is your hard counter after all) and I feel like adding the ability to auto track cloak spies is a bit too much. &gt;The Pomson &gt;Fixed an exploit with shooting through your own buildings &gt;Increased close-range damage to 72 (from 62) &gt;Reduced long-range damage to 32 (from 42) &gt;Updated projectile impact sound At this point they should just give the pomsom the cow mangler treatment. Make it a pratical reskin of stock that shoots lasers, with a minor special ability. This buff didn't make the pomson viable, but surely more fun to use because killing poeple with lasers as texas man is fun. I still think that the cloak and uber drain is a god awful idea though. Overall this update is really bizzare. I really don't like most of the changes (rip in peace bison) and overall I think who ever made these changes need more experience with the game first before they decide to try and balance it. It's a shame really because valve seems to have put alot of effort into this update. "
265,vulnerability,tf2,In light of the Pyro Vs Heavy WAR!! i thought i might share some possible Pyro weapon fixes I've been mulling over for some time,4,4s8icm,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4s8icm/in_light_of_the_pyro_vs_heavy_war_i_thought_i/,2016-07-11 11:36:05,"ok i'm not good at formatting so bare with me, but i think i have an idea of giving a bit higher skill ceiling to pyro as well as not making him as powerful in pubs **Primaries:** Stock: what is this about ""extinguishing allies gives pyro health""? he's PYRO, he wants things to BURN, burning makes pretty rainbows, so * changed +20 health on extinguished teammates to +40 primary ammo * +1HP per tic of afterburn damage per enemy (so 3 enemies lit would give 1HP each, so 3HP per tic total) * afterburn changed, instead of 3 damage every 0.5 second for 10 seconds, it's 5 damage every 0.6 seconds for 7.2 seconds (same 60 damage over all, but with more emergency feeling) Backburner: Ambush pyro is a thing, ambush pyro works well, lets make ambush pyro not as roll of the dice as he normally is * 'backburn' area of effect is same 180* location as backstabs * airblast costs +100% ammo instead of +150% (40 ammo a blast) * +25% bullet vulnerability (because you need to NOT be seen to do great damage) Degreaser: for when flame isn't enough, use the degreaser to combo everyone * -60% afterburn damage (2 damage every 0.6 for 7.2 total seconds, 24 damage total) * +50% flat switch to and from speed * Remove airblast extra cost * -50% damage Phlogistinator: because W+M1 might work, but shouldn't be god * -50% pushback from exploshions * no airblast * Mmmph can only be charged with damage from the Phlogistinator itself * Mmmph charged in 300 fire damage instead of 500 * Mmmph gives +50% HP (can overheal) and max ammo, no damage resistance or uber when casting * Given a 15 second cooldown after fully running out before Mmmph can start to be charged again **Secondaries:** Flare Gun: removed, and properties are put into the detonator and scorch shot Detonator: * flare fires with speed and trajectory of a solder's rocket, but with an arc half as sharp as a sandman ball * direct hit against a burning opponent will crit them and reset their afterburn timer * alt fire detonates * detonation creates an explosion the size of a stock rocket, mini crits flaming opponents and resets their afterburn timer * detonation can harm pyro, deals pushback equal to a soldier rocket jumping * attack interval changed to 1.5s from 2s Scorch Shot: * see first 2 of the detonator * on collision with a player or object, will create a non-damaging explosion radios of equal to stock rocket launcher * every floor, wall, or object in said radios bursts into flames, creating a fire trap that will put afterburn on enemy players * fire trap fizzles out after 5 seconds Manmelter: * attack interval changed to 0.5 seconds from 2.5 * -33% damage (20 base, 60 crit) Gas pack (NEW secondary) * +100% max primary ammo * -50% airblast cost * -50% airblast delay * no secondary weapon * +50% explosion vulnerability * reflected projectiles do 0 damage **Melees** Axtinguisher: * +25% switch to speed * -75% switch from speed * -50 damage against non burning opponents * deals 3x remaining afterburn damage to burning opponents * extinguishes burning targets Powerjack: * can overheal Sharpened Volcano Fragment: * -25% damage against non burning opponents * +25% damage against burning opponents * Resets afterburn timer on burning opponents * light targets on fire Third Degree: * hits everyone connected by medigun healing beam * Minicrits opponents if they are connected by medigun healing beam * if opponent was minicrit, applies a debuff preventing them from being healed by medigun healing beams (but not dispensers, healthpacks, or crossbow bolts) for 20 seconds * -20% damage Alright, i think that covers everything that could use a bit of a rework, feel free to give your own ideas EDIT1: fixed some slight mistakes, added new secondary idea i forgot about"
266,vulnerability,tf2,Let's talk about this patch's weapon balance.,2,4sfmuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4sfmuq/lets_talk_about_this_patchs_weapon_balance/,2016-07-12 16:33:07,"With the new shiny comp mode, heavy vs pyro and problems with casual mode, I haven't seen many discussions about the changes weapons got in this patch. To me this update felt a bit lackluster. After tough break and gun mettle they did good stuff, but still had tons of things to change, like the pretty boy's pocket pistol. But first, I'll comend them for these changes: -Teleporters cost 50 metal. Bravo, it saves engineers times and resources. They can put both a dispenser and teleporter with 50 metal to spare. -Spy being 1% faster still gives him an edge. He can eventually outrun 100% speed classes to back stab them rather than run for their backs forever, which is great. Also helps him do jumping maneuvers a bit easier. -Eureka effect was already great for ninja engineers, now it's cheaper than ever to do so. You can lay teleporters as obstacles and distractions now as well when caught by a single person. -Taking hidden mechanics from some weapons. Nice for the manmelter to finally feel good and the carbine without that weird 10% damage vulnerability. -Huo long heater feels better. Still not the best, but when defending you will have a pyro that burns everyone's (and probably die) and you'll finish his job with your new damage increase. You also eat spies for breakfast if they don't time their jump stab well. -You can certainly tell you're killing people faster even if they're being healed by a medic with the new pyro mechanic. -127% speed medic feels great, helps him escape, but at the cost of dropping his uber, so he needs to be careful, but the risk is worth it now. -Iron bombers feels better, you can surely throw bombs at sentries and expect the engineer trying to repair it to die, as well as shoot it on a wall and let it fall right into a sentry without it bouncing like crazy. You could do that before, but with the smaller timer the engineer won't have that much time to react or heal the sentry in time. Anyways, to start off, changes that barely did anything. -Sun on a stick -Shortstop (the shove is rarely useful other than to be friendly scoot) -Crit a cola is still powerful -Disciplinary action was mostly the soldier repeatedly hitting his target -Enforcer's new advantage is rarely useful (because it still shoots slow) -Widowmaker just got a tiny bit stronger for something that happened most of the time anyways Now for the changes I doubt anyone asked for: -Soda popper needs to deal a big chunk of damage for the 5 jumps. I get it that just moving shouldn't be rewarded, but the amount needed is ridicolous. -Shortstop: Who said ""man I wish I could do a weaker airblast as scout""? -Righteous bison's promoted use in the loading screen cataloged as a bug and along with the pomson, it got its close range damage increased and long range decreased. -Pomson deals more damage than regular shotgun at close range and you don't need to be a good shot. Why? -Natascha and brass beast were still not that great compared to the regular minigun and they got nerfed. -The already underused buffalo steak got even worse -The problem with the quickfix was that the medic could be present at the point faster than a non quick fix medic as well as charge uber faster. They reduced the uber speed, ok. Then they just made all mediguns make the medic get faster with a scout. Huh? -The QuickieBomb launcher is practically a better weapon to lay traps than to fight in direct combat now that they don't fizzle AND they got a reduced clip size. Nice going there volvo. And finally, weapons that needed change, but got nothing: -All pyro melees but the powerjack and backscratcher, they're weak. Specially the volcano fragment. -Machina is still complained about in comps and is banned on most yet it's untouched. -Vita saw is still untouched. Even a 5% faster uberchrge rate would be better than what it has now. They won't even touch it for some reason. -Darwin's danger shield is still untouched. Would've prefered it if the sydney sleeper had the bullet resistance and the darwin's shield had the 150 HP without vulnerabilities. -Pretty boy's pocket pistol is still not a good choice compared to the pistol. Maybe if it gave overhealed like the powerjack it could be good and to compensate the 20% damage vuln -Scottish resistance is barely used and now that the quickiebomb launcher is better at making powerful traps with the damage increase, it needs some actual aid and not faster firing speed. There are more things to list on what needed changes, but it would be even longer than it is. What are your opinions? Arguments on how some changes are actually good? We need some healthy discussion on this. Thanks. "
267,vulnerability,tf2,[Suggestion] The stock fire axe should give Pyro 107% speed while active,1,4sig2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4sig2k/suggestion_the_stock_fire_axe_should_give_pyro/,2016-07-13 04:08:15,"While Valve is planning an update to pyro, here's a small change I think would be very helpful for the class. The stock fire axe should increase Pyro's move speed from 100% to 107% when held. Stock fire axe is currently worthless. It pales in comparison to the Powerjack's 115% move speed, doesn't have the situational benefits of the Homewrecker or Back Scratcher, and has a direct upgrade in the Third Degree. The stock fire axe really needs some special extra feature to make it useful. Now that spy had his base move speed increased to 107%, newbie Pyros without the Powerjack cannot do their job and chase after him, if the spy has any sort of head start. It seems only fair that the stock pyro should be able match the spy's speed. Not exceed it. Only match it. And only while using their melee. Players with the Powerjack's 115% move speed can of course outrun spies if they want. But even they might choose to use the 107% stock fire axe instead sometimes. The fire axe would be useful for when you want a slightly faster speed, don't need +25 health on kill, and want to avoid that pesky 20% damage vulnerability. The Powerjack would still be better most of the time, because speed is king, but the fire axe would now be situationally useful. And being situationally useful is all the axe needs. It doesn't need to be the best weapon. It just needs to be useful sometimes, rather than never."
268,vulnerability,tf2,Suggestions for Pyro balances (x-post /r/tf2weaponideas),0,4st2z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4st2z0/suggestions_for_pyro_balances_xpost/,2016-07-14 22:49:42,"I'm x-posting these suggestions here so that they might get some visibility. Let me know what you think of them! **** I know I've been on here and posted various Pyro suggestions before, but today I want to bring up a full, concrete list of changes I believe would be beneficial to the Pyro and his full arsenal, what with an update for the Pyro in the foreseeable future. This will mostly focus on direct Pyro changes, however there will be a few non-Pyro changes here and there to help work around some issues with the class. **** **New Effect: Extinguished** ~~While under the effects, +25% afterburn and fire vulnerability. User is considered wet for the duration of the effect.~~ ~~Gained by extinguishing flames with Jarate, Mad Milk, Sydney Sleeper, Spycicle, Dead Ringer, Manmelter, or any body of water. This effect lasts for 10 seconds.~~ With this new effect, it becomes much easier for a player to fight fire with non-fire. The additional ""wet"" effect will also make the Neon Annihilator much more viable outside of the 2Fort sewers, so be wary! **** **Spycicle** *Level 2 Icicle* ~~**On hit by fire: Fire invulnerability for 2 seconds, Afterburn invulnerability for 7 seconds, and +25% Revolver damage**~~ ~~**Gains ""Extinguished"" status for 10 seconds**~~ ~~*Melts in fire, regenerating after a maximum of 15 seconds (without ammo)*~~ ~~*-15% movement speed for 3 seconds after melting*~~ ~~Victims are turned into ice~~ ~~Afterburn effect is still visible while invulnerable~~ **Dead Ringer** *Level 4 Invis Watch* ~~Cloak Type: Feign Death~~ ~~**+50% regen rate**~~ ~~**+40% cloak duration**~~ ~~**Upon activation: Leave a fake corpse and gain 1 second of speed, 3 seconds of afterburn invulnerability, 5 seconds of overall damage resistence, 10 seconds of ""Extinguished"" status, and invisibility for the duration of the cloak**~~ ~~*-50% cloak meter when activated*~~ ~~*-35% cloak from ammo boxes*~~ ~~*No cloak from ammo boxes when activated*~~ ~~Cloak is activated upon receiving damage~~ ~~After 2 seconds of activation, afterburn effect becomes visible if ignited while invulnerable~~ With the recent update, Spychecking has become next to impossible. The damage negation of the weapons was fine, however the Pyro's inability to catch up with and set on fire a Spy made it so that even an unskilled player could get away after a failed backstab unscathed, and return to try again later. The above changes should help counteract this. He should now be visible if ignited, even with the Extinguished status that both items provide. Each weapon also has individual changes. For the Spycicle, the Spy is now encouraged to stick around and fight with his revolver instead of running away giddily. The Dead Ringer still serves much of its original purpose, however players should be careful around Pyros as they will gain a visual afterburn effect if they don't get away in time. **** **All Mediguns** ~~*User and target gain increased fire vulnerability after healing a single target over time. 25% vulnerability at 10 seconds, 50% at 30 seconds, and 66% at 60 seconds.*~~ Instead of the recent ""buff"" to the Pyro's primaries, I believe this would be a much better means of deterring pocketing and instead encourage Medics to heal other teammates. **** **Effect: Afterburn** ~~Applied by flamethrowers, flare weapons, and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. Lasts for 18 seconds. During this time, the target takes damage every 0.5 seconds; this damage decreases over time. Damage is calculated as follows:~~ ~~4 damage per tick for the first 3 seconds~~ ~~3 damage per tick for the next 5 seconds~~ ~~2 damage per tick for the last 10 seconds~~ ~~While under the effects, target receives a visual ""fire"" effect that lasts for the duration.~~ There are a few things to go over about these changes to afterburn: * Total base damage is increased from 60 to 94. This may seem like much, but it shouldn't be enough to immediately kill low-health classes, plus if you can survive the initial damage you should be fine for a while. * The increased damage taken in the first few seconds should be enough to make enemies panic, especially those that are already injured. **** **All Pyro Primaries** ~~Extinguishing players with airblast returns 25 health to the user. This may overheal the user.~~ First and foremost: the bonus added in MYM has been removed, as the Medigun changes indicated. It was essentially pointless and encouraged little more than charging in blindly at a pocket, dealing next to no damage in the process. Next, airblast extinguishing can overheal the user. Just a little thing that should have been included in the first place. **** **Degreaser** *Level 1 Flamethrower* ~~**+45% holster speed**~~ ~~**+25% deploy speed**~~ ~~*-10% damage*~~ ~~*While active: -1 damage from afterburn ticks*~~ ~~*-40% health from extinguishing with airblast*~~ The Degreaser, as a utility tool, should be strictly reserved for switching between weapons. I think Valve missed the memo on this, as the last changes made to the weapon turned it into a really bad primary, with the switch effects made so that switching -to- the Degreaser was faster than switching -away- from it. Now, the Degreaser has a proper holster bonus for other items, and keeps a small deploy bonus for itself. It's nowhere as quick as before, but that should help to keep it from being too overpowered. As for the negative stats, the Degreaser won't be doing much in terms of direct offense. The old -10% damage stat is back to help deter W+M1 usage of the weapon. More importantly, however, is the -1 damage per tick on afterburn, which should require a bit more of an in-depth explanation. Instead of 4 damage per tick for 3 seconds, 3 DPT for 5 seconds, and 2 DPT for 10 seconds, Degreaser users deal only 3 DPT for 3 seconds, 2 DPT for 5 seconds, and 1 DPT for 10 seconds. This means that the total afterburn damage for a Degreaser user is 58, a staggering drop from the 94 damage of a regular user. It should be noted, however, that this applies only while the Degreaser is active, so switching to a different weapon should deal regular afterburn. This ties into the nature of the Degreaser as a switch tool. Lastly comes the negated health bonus from airblasting to replace the slight decrease in available airblasts. If the Degreaser is going to be a utility tool, it should be able to have as many airblasts as a Pyro normally has. To compensate, it receives less health from extinguishing teammates. **** **Backburner** *Level 10 Flamethrower* ~~**+100% critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**While active: +1 damage from afterburn ticks**~~ ~~*While active: Receive minicrits from behind*~~ ~~*-25% airblast*~~ ~~*No health from airblasting*~~ The Backburner retains its signature backside crits, remaining a very useful flanking tool. More importantly, it gains an increased damage per tick from afterburn (5 DPT for 3 secs, 4 DPT for 5 secs, 3 DPT for 10 secs) for a grand total of 130 afterburn damage - enough to kill some classes at full health, making this weapon a complete monster. Meanwhile, the user gains vulnerability from behind to minicrits, giving a bit of an ironic twist to the weapon's nature. Furthermore, while the airblast cost has been negated for the most part, the user does not gain any health at all from airblasting - instead, they'll want to focus on offense with this weapon. **** **Phlogistinator** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**Airblasting produces a large ""belch"" of flames that deal 30% more damage to enemies caught in them**~~ ~~**Airblasting deals knockback on the user**~~ ~~**Dealing damage builds an ""Mmph"" meter; pressing Reload while this meter is full activates a brief taunt that grants invulnerability to the user for that taunt's duration and increased speed, damage resistence, and minicrits for a few seconds afterwards**~~ ~~*+50% time between airblasts*~~ ~~*+50% airblast cost*~~ ~~*Airblast cannot reflect projectiles nor deal knockback to enemies*~~ ~~*-50% range for fire released from airblasts*~~ The lack of airblast really made this weapon suffer. As such, I have worked in a new mechanic: ""belching"", which, as the name implies, involves the user ""belching"" some powerful fire at a shorter distance. This ability can be used to help the user jump around thanks to the knockback added on it; think of how FaN Scouts utilize their weapons. The Mmph bonus, too, has been reworked to provide less of a bonus, but still keep the invulnerability from taunting. Overall, these changes should help make the Phlog less of a W+M1 weapon and a utility tool for maneuverability *a la* belching. **Flare Gun** *Level 4 Flare Gun* ~~**+100% critical hits on burning enemies**~~ ~~**Reloads automatically**~~ ~~*No knockback on user*~~ Nothing needs to be changed about this weapon (outside from fixing the projectile lag). Moving on. **** **Detonator** *Level 1 Flare Gun* ~~**Pressing M2 after firing the projectile detonates it in midair, creating a small explosion that ignites nearby players**~~ ~~**+100% guaranteed minicrits on burning players**~~ ~~**Increased knockback on user**~~ ~~**Reloads automatically**~~ ~~*+50% self-damage*~~ ~~*-25% damage*~~ The Detonator is decent as it is, however the height from flare jumps isn't equal to the damage dealt in return. As such, increased knockback than it has now would be good compensation. **** **Scorch Shot** *Level 10 Flare Gun* ~~**Flares knock back enemies and ignites enemies in a small radius**~~ ~~**+100% minicrits and guaranteed knockback on burning targets**~~ ~~**Projectiles can destroy stickies**~~ ~~**Projectiles fall to the ground briefly, igniting enemies that touch it**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-35% self-damage*~~ The Scorch Shot remains as it is, however, like the Detonator, it could use an increased knockback for the user in order to properly perform flare jumps. **** **Manmelter** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**+50% projectile speed**~~ ~~**May press M2 to extinguish allies, applying the ""Extinguished"" effect to the target and the user**~~ ~~**+5% movement speed for every target extinguished in any way, for a maximum of +30%**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Speed bonus from extinguishes only applies while this weapon is active~~ As the Flare Gun is already far superior at gaining critical hits, the Manmelter, as such, has been repurposed to help boost the Pyro's speed. Furthermore, as with the Mmph meter for the Phlog, the Manmelter now gets its bonus built with other weapons that extinguish - chiefly, either the Pyro's primary or extinguish items reflected by the user. **** **Reserve Shooter** *Level 4 Shotgun* ~~**Minicrits targets launched airborne from explosions, enemy attacks, grapple hooks, or airblasts**~~ ~~**+20% deploy speed**~~ ~~*-50% clip*~~ ~~*-50% max secondary ammo*~~ The Reserve Shooter can once again deal a great amount of damage to enemies caught by airblast. However, the amount of shots the user has is limited, so make sure every shot counts! **** **Fire Axe** *Level 1 Axe* ~~**On user: 50% of damage dealt from afterburn and reflects is returned as health**~~ ~~**+100% minicrits on burning enemies**~~ The Fire Axe has to be one of the worst weapons in the base game. It's just...well, it's really really plain. There's nothing special to it. In fact, it's one of the only weapons that has a straight upgrade in the form of the Third Degree (which will be addressed in a moment). Which is why I say it should get the above benefits. The health from afterburn and reflects will make it good as a utility on users, and the minicrits on burning targets - that is, 88 damage - makes it good for offense, or at least finishing opponents, turning it into a miniature Axtinguisher. Speaking of which.... **** **Axtinguisher** *Level 10 Axe* ~~**On hit: burning targets receive damage equal to a minicrit plus 40% of the equipped primary's total afterburn damage**~~ ~~**+100% critical hits on burning players from behind**~~ ~~*-50% damage vs non-burning players*~~ ~~*+20% bullet damage vulnerability while deployed*~~ ~~*Max 10% deploy speed from other weapons*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The new stats of the Axtinguisher may seem similar to the Gun Mettle version, but look closer and you'll find there's a pretty big difference. The base minicrit damage for the weapon is 88. This is practically worthless, even against low HP classes like Scouts and Snipers. Thus, 40% of your primary's total afterburn damage is added to hits against burning players from the front. Hence, a base attack against a burning player from the front would be 126 damage, enough to oneshot a low HP class. With the Degreaser, puff-n-sting gameplay comes back with a nice little 10% deployment bonus for the Axtinguisher (though nothing higher in order to prevent too quick of a kill). However, with the reduced afterburn for the Degreaser, the total amount of damage against a burning player with the Axtinguisher should be 111, a high amount for a finisher but not enough to oneshot a low HP class. Meanwhile, the Backburner's additional afterburn damage should grant the Axtinguisher's front bonus a total of 140 against burning players at the front, once again proving how monstrous it can be. From behind, the Axtinguisher receives regular critical hits, for a total of 195 damage. The weapon also receives bullet vulnerability while active, in order to give some classes - i.e. Scout, Sniper, Heavy, etc. - a better chance to survive against a Pyro that doesn't swing carefully. **** **Homewrecker** *Level 2 Sledgehammer* ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**-25% damage from sentries while active**~~ ~~**No knockback from sentries while active**~~ ~~**Damage removes sappers**~~ ~~*-33% damage vs players*~~ The Homewrecker is great for the Pybro, but terrible for anything else. The building bonus is great against sappers, but can't do anything against real buildings like sentries - hence, the damage resistance and lack of knockback from sentries to encourage Pyros to go and take out nests. To compensate, the damage penalty vs players has been increased to 33%. **** **Powerjack** *Level 4 Sledgehammer* ~~**On kill: restores 50 health**~~ ~~**+15% movement speed while deployed**~~ ~~*While active: +20% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*No health from airblasting*~~ ~~Health gained from kills may overheal user~~ The Powerjack is already the best Pyro melee at the moment, and simply needs a bit of tweaks to make it the best it could possibly be. With 50 health from melee kills this makes the Pyro a daunting enemy to face in combat - not to mention, the added overheal ability from melee kills means that the user can even bolster themselves up without a Medic. In contrast, the user cannot gain health from extinguishing allies, so for HP it's gonna be a melee-only focus. **** **Back Scratcher** *Level 1 Gardening Tool* ~~**+25% damage**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs**~~ ~~**Pick up ammo packs to fill a rage meter; when full, press M2 to gain guaranteed melee crits for several seconds**~~ ~~*-50% ammo gained from ammo packs*~~ ~~*-75% health from Mediguns and Dispensers*~~ ~~*Cannot switch weapons while melee crits are active*~~ The Back Scratcher currently works best in medieval mode, or when Pyros want to roam alone. However, I think we can do better than that - hence, the melee crit function, added to give additional usage of the weapon. It should go nicely with the weapon's already increased damage bonus. **** **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 Volcanic Fragment* ~~**On hit: target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**While active: +100% damage from afterburn is returned as health**~~ ~~*-20% damage*~~ ~~May perform the Armageddon taunt~~ The SVF now does something! Much like the suggested buff to the Fire Axe, the SVF gains not just 50%, but 100% of afterburn damage dealt as health. This effect is only active while the weapon is deployed of course, but that's only a small price to pay for the benefits this could reap. As a small aside, the weapon now performs the Armageddon taunt as well, which would fit the theme of the weapon dealing fire damage. It would only be fitting for an axe that looks this cool B) **** **Third Degree** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**If target is overhealed, damage dealt will be a minicrit**~~ ~~**Damage transfers to players connected via mediguns**~~ ~~*-33% damage vs players with &lt;33% health*~~ ~~*+20% explosive vulnerability*~~ ~~Damage penalty against players with low health does not apply to players on the other end of a medibeam~~ And now the Third Degree has some downsides! Firstly, the weapon can be used to lower the health of a pocket - much more so than the recent flamethrower buff - so long as said pocket is overhealed. The damage - including the minicrits against overhealed players - can still be transfered either to the pocket or to the Medic. Users should be careful though - against players with low health, the Third Degree grows weaker, so instead a primary or secondary would be good to finish off the target. There's also added vulnerability against explosives - rockets, stickies, grenade pills - while the weapon is active. However, since the Pyro can use their primary to reflect projectiles like these, they shouldn't be too much trouble. **** **Neon Annihilator** *Level 4 Electric Sign* ~~**+100% critical hits vs wet players**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Being coated in liquid applies the Extinguished effect for 10 seconds to the user~~ The Neon Annihilator, again, would get an extreme benefit from the introduction of an ""extinguished"" status, and since that's been mostly covered I won't regurgitate it here. The user now also receives the Extinguished status if they get coated with Jarate, Mad Milk, etc., making them vulnerable to another Neon Annihilator wielder. **** And that, ladies and gentlemenn, is my list of recommendations for balance changes to the Pyro, his weaponry, and his adversaries' tools. Not all need to be applied, but many weapons would certainly benefit from the changes above."

271,vulnerability,tf2,"Why Heavy is boring, and what Valve can do to fix it",3,4th57g,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4th57g/why_heavy_is_boring_and_what_valve_can_do_to_fix/,2016-07-19 06:13:14,"Heavy's minigun is *treated* like the most powerful gun in the game, bestowing massive nerfs on its wearer (77% movement speed, not being able to respond to ambushes), but it isn't. It can't damage multiple targets, except for 5 damage each at very long range, and doesn't merit the compensation Valve has saddled our poor Russian friend with. So Heavy should receive some changes: * Since Heavy has a weakish primary and no mobility options like rockets, he should go faster, at 85% movement speed. The eviction notice would boost him to 100%, and the GRU would boost him to Medic and Spy speed at 107%. This would make getting to the front less boring. AND * Miniguns should spin up faster, and the Tomislav should spin up instantly. The Tomislav is the fun pub weapon because you can play actively with it, and not just have to keep your gun revved whenever enemies might be around. Having all miniguns spin up faster would make all miniguns more active. Either that OR * Heavy should move faster when spun up. This allows him to get around within the battleground without being such a sitting duck. AND * Heavy should have a non-minigun primary to encourage shotgun play. Just to spice him up. TO BALANCE THIS: * Heavy's miniguns should do slightly less damage, to encourage him to use the shotgun occasionally. Fights against Heavies would last longer, and Heavies would need to keep the crosshair on enemies for longer. VALVE SHOULD NEVER: * Make a minigun that takes *longer* to spin up. That doesn't make the game more interesting, it just makes Heavy a sentry. The Brass Beast should have increased damage vulnerability when firing, but no spin up penalty or movement penalty, and Natascha should give Heavy a speed boost on hit, but no slowdown or spin up penalty."
272,vulnerability,tf2,The Southern Hospitality is OP,0,4tvbjm,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4tvbjm/the_southern_hospitality_is_op/,2016-07-21 14:47:55,"Now, first I would like to address what I mean as OP. I think that anything that is a direct upgrade to stock is qualified as OP. I will also be talking in terms of competitive 9s, and I will touch a bit upon pubs. I am also an Engineer main in HL, so I am not some Spy main thinking that the Southern Hospitality is OP because I got killed by it. Now first things first, the stats. On hit: Bleed for 5 seconds. No random critical hits. 20% fire damage vulnerability on wearer. Now I will be explaining on why the ""downsides"" are not bad at all, and why the up side is way better. The bleed for 5 seconds, this is amazing for an Engineer in both HL, and pubs because it allows you to track a Spy. In HL, if a Spy is trying to take your gun out, then you hit him, call your Pyro over (and your Pyro shouldn't be that far from your gun), and by the time he is there, the Spy is still bleeding, making the Pyro's life 100% easier, making the Spy die. In pubs, this is a bit different, you hit the Spy, unsap your sentry, and track the Spy, killing him with your primary. Or if they don't cloak away, 2 hits will kill them. With the stock wrench, you would hit the Spy, they would cloak away, and you would be paranoid. I will not put getting a random crit as an option, because if you rely on crits to kill someone, then you might want to choose another class. What I just said counters the ""No random critical hits"" part. Finally, the 20% fire damage vulnerability isn't big at all. There are only a few times that you should ever be in an encounter with an enemy Pyro. One, they are spamming flares at you, trying to pick you from across the map. Two, you are flanking, and a Pyro catches you. And three, a Pyro is ubered into your gun. Here is what will happen if you have either the Southern Hospitality, or the stock wrench. A Pyro spamming your gun: You have a dispenser, or healthkits, or a airblasting Pyro, or cover. But if that Pyro lands 2 flares on you, either way, you would die. A Pyro flanking you: In close range, an Engineer with meta last set up, should never live a Pyro encounter, with either wrench. And finally, an ubered Pyro. The Pyro is going to win that 1v1. So in those scenarios, 1 out of the 3 times, you will live, with either wrench. So what I have shown, the real stats of the wrench are: On hit: Bleed for 5 seconds. That's it. Also, yes, the Jag is a worse wrench then the Southern Hospitality, but it is a lot of different stats that go into that, and if a lot of people cry out about the Southern Hospitality not being the Jag, I will make a separate post on why the Jag is bad for defensive Engineer. TLDR: The Southern Hospitality has no downsides, and a big upside."

However, considering the support that [this good thread](URL has gotten, as well as the fact that valve **might** be paying attention to this subreddit, I have chosen to post these suggestions again for your consideration. **** **New Effect: Extinguished** ~~While under the effects, +25% afterburn and fire resistance. User is considered wet for the duration of the effect.~~ ~~Gained by extinguishing flames with Jarate, Mad Milk, Sydney Sleeper, Spycicle, Dead Ringer, Manmelter, or any body of water.

The damage negation of the weapons was fine, however the Pyro's inability to catch up with and set on fire a Spy made it so that even an unskilled player could get away after a failed backstab unscathed, and return to try again later. The above changes should help counteract this. He should now be visible if ignited, even with the Extinguished status that both items provide. Each weapon also has individual changes. For the Spycicle, the Spy is now encouraged to stick around and fight with his revolver instead of running away giddily. The Dead Ringer still serves much of its original purpose, however players should be careful around Pyros as they will gain a visual afterburn effect if they don't get away in time. **** **All Mediguns** ~~*User and target gain increased fire vulnerability after healing a single target over time. 25% vulnerability at 10 seconds, 50% at 30 seconds, and 66% at 60 seconds.*~~ Instead of the recent ""buff"" to the Pyro's primaries, I believe this would be a much better means of deterring pocketing and instead encourage Medics to heal other teammates. **** **Effect: Afterburn** ~~Applied by flamethrowers, flare weapons, and the Sharpened Volcano Fragment. Lasts for 18 seconds. During this time, the target takes damage every 0.5 seconds; this damage decreases over time.

This may seem like much, but it shouldn't be enough to immediately kill low-health classes, plus if you can survive the initial damage you should be fine for a while. * The increased damage taken in the first few seconds should be enough to make enemies panic, especially those that are already injured. **** **All Pyro Primaries** ~~Extinguishing players with airblast returns 25 health to the user. This may overheal the user.~~ First and foremost: the bonus added in MYM has been removed, as the Medigun changes indicated.

Instead of 4 damage per tick for 3 seconds, 3 DPT for 5 seconds, and 2 DPT for 10 seconds, Degreaser users deal only 3 DPT for 3 seconds, 2 DPT for 5 seconds, and 1 DPT for 10 seconds. This means that the total afterburn damage for a Degreaser user is 58, a staggering drop from the 94 damage of a regular user. It should be noted, however, that this applies only while the Degreaser is active, so switching to a different weapon should deal regular afterburn. This ties into the nature of the Degreaser as a switch tool. Lastly comes the negated health bonus from airblasting to replace the slight decrease in available airblasts. If the Degreaser is going to be a utility tool, it should be able to have as many airblasts as a Pyro normally has. To compensate, it receives less health from extinguishing teammates. **** **Backburner** *Level 10 Flamethrower* ~~**+100% critical hits from behind**~~ ~~**While active: +1 damage from afterburn ticks**~~ ~~*While active: Receive minicrits from behind*~~ ~~*-25% airblast*~~ ~~*No health from airblasting*~~ ~~Unlisted: Backside crits are available at a 150 degree range, compared to the Knife's 180 degree range~~ The Backburner retains its signature backside crits, remaining a very useful flanking tool.

Meanwhile, the user gains vulnerability from behind to minicrits, giving a bit of an ironic twist to the weapon's nature. Furthermore, while the airblast cost has been negated for the most part, the user does not gain any health at all from airblasting - instead, they'll want to focus on offense with this weapon. Finally, the 90 degree range on the backside crits has been changed to 150 degrees to offer more availability for ambushing and crit damage; I can't tell you how many times the wonky state of hotboxes plus the narrow range of backside crits has denied me crits on the targets back, even when they were *directly in front of me.* This should help combat that problem. **** **Phlogistinator** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**Airblasting produces a large ""belch"" of flames that deal 30% more damage to enemies caught in them**~~ ~~**Airblasting deals knockback on the user**~~ ~~**Dealing damage builds an ""Mmph"" meter; pressing Reload while this meter is full activates a brief taunt that grants invulnerability to the user for that taunt's duration and increased speed, damage resistence, and minicrits for a few seconds afterwards**~~ ~~*+50% time between airblasts*~~ ~~*+50% airblast cost*~~ ~~*Airblast cannot reflect projectiles nor deal knockback to enemies*~~ ~~*-50% range for fire released from airblasts*~~ The lack of airblast really made this weapon suffer.

As such, increased knockback than it has now would be good compensation. **** **Scorch Shot** *Level 10 Flare Gun* ~~**Flares knock back enemies and ignites enemies in a small radius**~~ ~~**+100% minicrits and guaranteed knockback on burning targets**~~ ~~**Projectiles can destroy stickies**~~ ~~**Projectiles fall to the ground briefly, igniting enemies that touch it**~~ ~~*-35% damage penalty*~~ ~~*-35% self-damage*~~ The Scorch Shot remains as it is, however, like the Detonator, it could use an increased knockback for the user in order to properly perform flare jumps. **** **Manmelter** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**Does not require ammo**~~ ~~**+50% projectile speed**~~ ~~**May press M2 to extinguish allies, applying the ""Extinguished"" effect to the target and the user**~~ ~~**+5% movement speed for every target extinguished in any way, for a maximum of +30%**~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Speed bonus from extinguishes only applies while this weapon is active~~ As the Flare Gun is already far superior at gaining critical hits, the Manmelter, as such, has been repurposed to help boost the Pyro's speed. Furthermore, as with the Mmph meter for the Phlog, the Manmelter now gets its bonus built with other weapons that extinguish - chiefly, either the Pyro's primary or extinguish items reflected by the user. **** **Reserve Shooter** *Level 4 Shotgun* ~~**Minicrits targets launched airborne by explosions, grapple hooks, and enemy attacks**~~ ~~**+20% deploy speed**~~ ~~*-50% clip*~~ ~~*-50% max secondary ammo*~~ This weapon is, apparently, hated by the entire community - and seemingly overnight. Not once did I ever hear complaints about minicrits on airblasted opponents until suddenly a few weeks ago. Has it always been like this with the Reserve Shooter? Have I been purposely kept in the dark about the seething hatred that this item receives? Or am I just blind to the truth, that being able to corner and minicrit an enemy is bad gameplay? ...well, in any case, I honestly don't know how exactly this weapon could be changed, beyond decreasing the available clip and ammo for it. Any suggestions below would be great, I guess. ... Maybe I just suck at the game. **** **Fire Axe** *Level 1 Axe* ~~**On user: 50% of damage dealt from afterburn and reflects is returned as health**~~ ~~**+100% minicrits on burning enemies**~~ The Fire Axe has to be one of the worst weapons in the base game. It's just...well, it's really really plain. There's nothing special to it. In fact, it's one of the only weapons that has a straight upgrade in the form of the Third Degree (which will be addressed in a moment). Which is why I say it should get the above benefits. The health from afterburn and reflects will make it good as a utility on users, and the minicrits on burning targets - that is, 88 damage - makes it good for offense, or at least finishing opponents, turning it into a miniature Axtinguisher. Speaking of which.... **** **Axtinguisher** *Level 10 Axe* ~~**On hit: burning targets receive damage equal to a minicrit plus 40% of the equipped primary's total afterburn damage**~~ ~~**+100% critical hits on burning players from behind**~~ ~~*-50% damage vs non-burning players*~~ ~~*+20% bullet damage vulnerability while deployed*~~ ~~*Max 10% deploy speed from other weapons*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ The new stats of the Axtinguisher may seem similar to the Gun Mettle version, but look closer and you'll find there's a pretty big difference. The base minicrit damage for the weapon is 88. This is practically worthless, even against low HP classes like Scouts and Snipers. Thus, 40% of your primary's total afterburn damage is added to hits against burning players from the front. Hence, a base attack against a burning player from the front would be 126 damage, enough to oneshot a low HP class. With the Degreaser, puff-n-sting gameplay comes back with a nice little 10% deployment bonus for the Axtinguisher (though nothing higher in order to prevent too quick of a kill). However, with the reduced afterburn for the Degreaser, the total amount of damage against a burning player with the Axtinguisher should be 111, a high amount for a finisher but not enough to oneshot a low HP class. Meanwhile, the Backburner's additional afterburn damage should grant the Axtinguisher's front bonus a total of 140 against burning players at the front, once again proving how monstrous it can be. The weapon also receives bullet vulnerability while active, in order to give some classes - i.e. Scout, Sniper, Heavy, etc. - a better chance to survive against a Pyro that doesn't swing carefully. **** **Homewrecker** *Level 2 Sledgehammer* ~~**+100% damage vs buildings**~~ ~~**-25% damage from sentries while active**~~ ~~**No knockback from sentries while active**~~ ~~**Damage removes sappers**~~ ~~*-33% damage vs players*~~ The Homewrecker is great for the Pybro, but terrible for anything else. The building bonus is great against sappers, but can't do anything against real buildings like sentries - hence, the damage resistance and lack of knockback from sentries to encourage Pyros to go and take out nests. To compensate, the damage penalty vs players has been increased to 33%. **** **Powerjack** *Level 4 Sledgehammer* ~~**On kill: restores 50 health**~~ ~~**+15% movement speed while deployed**~~ ~~*While active: +20% damage vulnerability*~~ ~~*No health from airblasting*~~ ~~Health gained from kills may overheal user~~ The Powerjack is already the best Pyro melee at the moment, and simply needs a bit of tweaks to make it the best it could possibly be. With 50 health from melee kills this makes the Pyro a daunting enemy to face in combat - not to mention, the added overheal ability from melee kills means that the user can even bolster themselves up without a Medic. In contrast, the user cannot gain health from extinguishing allies, so for HP it's gonna be a melee-only focus. **** **Back Scratcher** *Level 1 Gardening Tool* ~~**+25% damage**~~ ~~**+50% health from packs**~~ ~~**Pick up ammo packs to fill a rage meter; when full, press M2 to gain guaranteed melee crits for several seconds**~~ ~~*-50% ammo gained from ammo packs*~~ ~~*-75% health from Mediguns and Dispensers*~~ ~~*Cannot switch weapons while melee crits are active*~~ The Back Scratcher currently works best in medieval mode, or when Pyros want to roam alone. However, I think we can do better than that - hence, the melee crit function, added to give additional usage of the weapon. It should go nicely with the weapon's already increased damage bonus. **** **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** *Level 10 Volcanic Fragment* ~~**On hit: target is engulfed in flames**~~ ~~**While active: +100% damage from afterburn is returned as health**~~ ~~*-20% damage*~~ ~~May perform the Armageddon taunt~~ The SVF now does something! Much like the suggested buff to the Fire Axe, the SVF gains not just 50%, but 100% of afterburn damage dealt as health. This effect is only active while the weapon is deployed of course, but that's only a small price to pay for the benefits this could reap. As a small aside, the weapon now performs the Armageddon taunt as well, which would fit the theme of the weapon dealing fire damage. It would only be fitting for an axe that looks this cool B) **** **Third Degree** *Level 2 Particle Smasher* ~~**If target is overhealed, damage dealt will be a minicrit**~~ ~~**Damage transfers to players connected via mediguns**~~ ~~*-33% damage vs players with &lt;33% health*~~ ~~*+20% explosive vulnerability*~~ ~~Damage penalty against players with low health does not apply to players on the other end of a medibeam~~ And now the Third Degree has some downsides! Firstly, the weapon can be used to lower the health of a pocket - much more so than the recent flamethrower buff - so long as said pocket is overhealed. The damage - including the minicrits against overhealed players - can still be transfered either to the pocket or to the Medic. Users should be careful though - against players with low health, the Third Degree grows weaker, so instead a primary or secondary would be good to finish off the target. There's also added vulnerability against explosives - rockets, stickies, grenade pills - while the weapon is active. However, since the Pyro can use their primary to reflect projectiles like these, they shouldn't be too much trouble. **** **Neon Annihilator** *Level 4 Electric Sign* ~~**+100% critical hits vs wet players**~~ ~~**Damage removes Sappers**~~ ~~*-20% damage*~~ ~~*No random critical hits*~~ ~~Being coated in liquid applies the Extinguished effect for 10 seconds to the user~~ The Neon Annihilator, again, would get an extreme benefit from the introduction of an ""extinguished"" status, and since that's been mostly covered I won't regurgitate it here. The user now also receives the Extinguished status if they get coated with Jarate, Mad Milk, etc., making them vulnerable to another Neon Annihilator wielder. **** And there you have it folks. A large, expansive list of changes (as well as that one new feature!) that would really help Pyros. Of course, none of this will make Pyro good to play if the class's bugs - Degreaser switch not registering for a second, primaries sometimes not dealing damage, flamethrowers not reaching far enough as a result of ping and other factors, flamethrower hit particles and airblasts being completely unreliable and seemingly random...the list goes on. Valve, if you *are* listening to us, then you have a duty to fix these bugs, as well as implement some of these changes - they might just make Pyro fun to play again."

I have gotten sick of all the underpowered and broken weapons in TF2, and I made this list to fix it. Please support it if you like it, tell me what you think, and help get this thing to Valve. Remember that I would love feedback to improve these stats. I have included a link that is more updated AND has reasons on it as to why these changes should happen. However, if you are too lazy to click the link or something :P, I listed a version here which is not as recent as the docs version.

If you want to know why a change is happening click why in the docs version. If there is no why button one will be appearing soon. ****REMEMBER THE DOCS VERSION IS ALWAYS UP TO DATE, BUT THIS ONE IS NOT ALWAYS.

Short Circuit -Added +20% extra metal collected from metal sources (including widowmaker metal return) -Note that when paired with Eureka effect, metal intake stats negate each other Melee Stock Wrench -No changes Southern Hospitality -Added +100% damage bonus against buildings -This allows it to break a sapper in one hit. -Changed 20% fire vulnerability to 20% all-around vulnerability.

Medic Primary Syringe gun -No changes Blutsauger -Health regen penalty is now active whether it is deployed or not Crusader's Crossbow -No change. Overdose -Speed boost is always active, whether the weapon is deployed or not. -Base speed decreased by -5% when weapon is not active. Secondary Stock Medigun -No changes. Kritzkrieg -No changes.

Melee Bonesaw -No changes Uber saw -No changes Vita-saw -Now holds 50% ubercharge on death (passive effect) -Removed health penalty -Added -50% damage penalty -I would also consider finding a new model that isnt copyrighted or getting copyright permissions, because if there is no strange variant, its use rates will still stay pretty low, since a lot of people will insist on having a strange one (myself included XD) Amputator -Increased health regeneration to +4 health per second (from +3 per second, now a passive effect, and amount is lower if user was recently damaged.) -Increased damage penalty to -33% (from 20%) Solemn Vow -No changes. Sniper Primary Sniper Rifle -No changes Huntsman -No changes Sydney Sleeper -No changes. Bazaar Bargain -No changes Machina -No changes Hitmans Heatmaker -No changes Classic -Increased body shot damage penalty to 50% (from 10%) -Can shoot teammates to give them a 3 second speed boost -When an enemy is shot they are knocked back 32hu (this is under consideration on how much knockback it should have) -Each body shot also has the stun effect of a Natascha bullet; brief speed reduction. -This weapon is now more like the TFC counterpart, and now actually has a purpose in TF2.

277,vulnerability,tf2,PSA: The Definitive Noob's Guide to Mann Versus Machine (part 1- Scout),5,4m6x90,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4m6x90/psa_the_definitive_noobs_guide_to_mann_versus/,2016-06-02 22:33:32,"It's happened to the best of us: We get a great team, with an experienced Engie, Heavy, Scout, Soldier, and Demo, and we're waiting for a sixth. Then he/she joins, has zero tours, and chooses Scout with all stock. This public service announcement is not just for you veterans; it's for you new players as well. If you're intelligent, and want to actually read some fucking guides on how to play MVM **BEFORE** doing so, this is the *essential* guide for you. (And no, I'm not bitter.) ***SCOUT*** *Special Ability*: Collecting Credits from Long Range *Primary Responsibility*: Collecting Credits *Secondary Responsibilities*: Marking Enemies for Death, Slowing Super Scouts, Providing Last-Second Support Scout is easily the most important class in MVM. Basically, if you don't have a Scout, you're as good as dead. Your team may be able to make it to the last wave, but without sufficient credits for upgrades, you're guaranteed to fail. If you collect all possible credits from a wave, you'll provide your team with a much-needed bonus. Additionally, having mini-crits is an enormous advantage. Couple that with Mad Milk, and giants can be taken down easily. A good Scout needs to use his movement to his advantage, and collect credits at any cost. *Recommended Upgrades*: Movement Speed, Jump Height, bercharge Canteen, -25% Movement on Doused Targets (Mad Milk), Ball Marks for death (Sandman) *Recommended Weapons*: **Primary**: Scout rarely uses his primary in MVM; as his team needs his secondary and melee more. Any Scattergun can be used, though some work better when used in tandem with other weapons. Try to pick weapons that have positive passive stats. SCATTERGUN: Recommended- The classic choice -- high damage, no negatives, and highly versatile. Can be used with any other weapons. FORCE-A-NATURE: Recommended- Extremely useful when defending the hatch; allows for extra jump, so Jump Height can be placed at a lower priority. SHORTSTOP: Not Recommended- Extra health on hit is irrelevant when credits give health; knockback vulnerability does little to help. SODA POPPER: Recommended- Jump boost is extremely useful; also lowers Jump Height priority. BABY FACE'S BLASTER: Not Recommended- Speed boost will be constantly depleted when flanking. This has no business being in MVM. BACK SCATTER: Recommended- Extra mini-crits are always useful. However, since melee weapons enable marking for death, this weapon should only be used when one such melee is not equipped. **Secondary**: The meta is to use Mad Milk or BONK! Atomic Punch when playing Scout. Really, any weapon that prioritizes the team over the Scout is sufficient. PISTOL: Not Recommended- No passive effects, does nothing to assist team. Scattergun is much more useful. MAD MILK: Recommended- Douse Super Scouts with the movement penalty and they'll be slowed to a crawl. Douse giants and your teammates will be immortal. The best option. BONK! ATOMIC PUNCH: Recommended- Use only when Mad Milk and ber canteens are unavailable. Invincibility is a huge plus when it comes to collecting credits in dangerous locations. WINGER: Not Recommended- Jump boost is unnecessary when Force-A-Nature and Soda Popper provide this. Takes up an otherwise useful slot. PRETTY BOY'S POCKET PISTOL: Not Recommended- Fall damage immunity and health on hit are irrelevant when credits give health. FLYING GUILLOTINE: Not Recommended- Only pertinent when a Spy is on the team; using the Sandman will already mark for death. CRIT-A-COLA: Not Recommended- Not recommended for the same reason the Back Scatter is recommended. **Melee**: The most important weapons in the Scout's MVM arsenal. Choose wisely. BAT: Not recommended- Can easily be substituted for infinitely more useful weapons. SANDMAN: Recommended- The classic mini-crit method. Use interchangeably with the Fan O' War. HOLY MACKEREL: Not Recommended- Technically not a reskin, but still just as useless. ATOMIZER: Recommended- Extra health from credits complements the weapon perfectly. Use only when improvising. FAN O' WAR: Recommended- The up-close-and-personal version of the Sandman. Use interchangeably with it. CANDY CANE: Not Recommended- A puny little fucking health pack when you could have used Mad Milk. BOSTON BASHER: Recommended- See Atomizer. WRAP ASSASSIN: Not Recommended- Sandman is vastly superior.

We understand, Demoknight was really OP back then, but I'm pretty sure the pre-tough break demokight weapons were already balanced. Here's my proposal. The clademor (or whoever the fuck you spell it) I never understood why they removed a stat that was unique to one weapon. I know this was talked about a lot, but I'm just going to give my opinion on this. Before they nerfed it, it had a +0.25 second charge time. That was amazing to some players. The extra charge time made trimping even more fun than before. Then December happened. The community was very confused by this change. Ok enough with the fuckery here's my stat change proposal: The clademor +15 vulnerability while active +0.25 second charge time This weapon deploys slower and has an increased melee range. No random crits There mates The shields Let's first start with the chargin targe. Tough break added a removal of debuffs when charging and added shield bash damage to it. I don't know why they gave a shield bash to it when it did 10-20 base damage. This can't kill jack shit and messes up crit swings (for me that is). I say we remove the shield bash and add a slight addition of turning control while charging. The tide turner is only good for mobility and finishing off targets. Not effective at direct combat. After tough break the explosive and fire resistance are barley noticed. So here is my change proposal. Make the charge refill on kill 50% reduced from 75% And bring back the crit swing in the end of the charge. And buff the damage resistances to 25. I rest my case."

In return, it reveals cloaked spies, and anyone covered in it takes Mini-Crit damage. They also take full crits from fire weapons, and afterburn lasts twice as long. This would be an interesting weapon to increase soldier/pyro synergy. * Sniper secondary: Ranger's Ray Gun: The Dr. Grordbort Sniper primary. Instead of firing a single shot, fires a laser that can be held on a target to do DPS, maybe like 100 DPS. Holding the narrow beam on a target would be difficult, but rewarded with high damage. Carries enough ammo for four seconds of burst damage, after which it would need to be reloaded. This weapon would be terrible against other snipers, but deadly against slow targets. It would need some balancing, though. * Scout Melee: IDK about a name, some play on ""Chain"": Does more damage with each consecutive melee hit, starting at 20, then rising to 35, 50 and maxing out at 65, with the same swing rate as the bat. The total could be stored while using another weapon, but would be lost if you missed a swing or hit a teammate. This would be to provide a decent scout melee without the high risk of the Basher. * An engineer pistol that worked like the Widowmaker, only at 10 metal per shot instead. * An engineer PDA that gave buildings 50% more health but made them take twice as long to deploy. * And a strange part for the Sandvich that counts MLG Sandvich tosses. What weapon concepts have you guys been sitting on? Edit: Formatting. Thanks for the help!"

284,vulnerability,tf2,"Pyro is unarguably UP, but I'm tired of seeing people trying to buff him the easy way.",9,4ct2p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4ct2p1/pyro_is_unarguably_up_but_im_tired_of_seeing/,2016-04-01 11:58:19,"A lot of people want the Pyro, as an offense class, to be as good offensively as Scout and Soldier. People usually say something to the effect of some direct damage increase or anything to give a flat benefit to the overall offensive potential Pyro gets with default weapons. Now this might be all well and good for some, but I think a lot of people would see Pyro as worse off, since an overall buff means that skilled *and* brainless tactics are buffed. Which is something most of us can agree would be a bad thing. Pyro is often regarded as a Jack-of-all-Trades, reflecting projectiles, pushing back players, extinguishing teammates, whatnot. It's time to accept that the reason behind this is because Pyro is meant to be helpful in a variety of situations more for the team than just himself/herself. Let's face it, Pyro is basically meant to be the support side of offense. What a shame it is that a character's namesake would end up being a misnomer! Supposedly people don't use the Flamethrower for the flames! It's fine if a character is non reliant on the supposed primary weapon they wield, like for Medic or Spy, but surely we should keep the name relevant to the role they fill! After countless hours throwing it back and forth in my mind, with nearly 2K hours of non-idling, community server experience at medium skill levels, I think I may be onto something here. By no means do I claim it to be perfect, but I'm confident that this is the direction Pyro should go. Base Flamethrower damage, both direct and afterburn, is lowered slightly, but the more non-fire damage a target has taken more recently, the stronger it becomes so that its damage, again, both direct and afterburn, would be slightly *stronger* than now. A similar concept to crit heals, essentially. Wanna try mindless W+M1 to get a few cheap kills? I don't think so. You'll be shredded to bits before you can even do much of any damage at all. Wanna actually be stealthy right up to the part where you perfectly time your strike with your team's push? Congratulations! You're a team player! You get to cause massive chaos on the enemy team! And naturally, the Degreaser gets a buff by comparison, since it's afterburn can't go any lower, it just goes up to the corresponding damage it would have if it *could* have done any less damage to start. Also, this helps out Pyros who try for combos with something other than flares! As for the other weapons, I'd say bring Axtinguisher back to Love'n'War state, make Powerjack's speed and vulnerability stats passive, do the opposite of the last Phlog change (only HP, no crits), give Phlog an ""airblast"" that consumes projectiles instead of reflecting them, like the Short Circuit does, buff Manmelter so *all* extinguishes give it crits, give Manmelter normal reload/recharge time, give *only* stock Fire Axe a slight damage increase/swing rate increase, give Sharpened Volcano Fragment a passive, slight fire damage resistance, and as for the Neon Annihilator, add a ""Flamethrower"" that marks Jarate instead of afterburn that has a big damage reduction to account for self-fueled mini-crits. Other than that, I say give the Pyro a full ammo return for extinguishes *instead* of restoring 20 HP. **TL;DR** - Make Pyro's damage scale with how much a target has taken non-fire damage and how recently, change other weapons so their stats make more sense, return ammo instead of HP for extinguishes. Pyro = Support-type Offense Got something to add, or you think my idea is shit? Please offer your own suggestions, no matter how small or vague! **EDIT**- Forgot to mention this, but of course we need to have better visualization of flame particles, have some *actually decent* flame particle physics, probably reduce airblast rate, and make it so pushing players is actually directional and adds a vector instead of overriding the old one. Like how it used to be a while back. Then *actually* fix ground-locking people so you don't get free mini-crits by getting an airblast into the ground. **EDIT 2** Also, make it so reflected grenades don't mini-crit the Pyro anymore. Please, dear GOD. :("
285,vulnerability,tf2,[Suggestions] Small But Meaningful Weapon Changes,128,4dhqtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4dhqtx/suggestions_small_but_meaningful_weapon_changes/,2016-04-06 04:23:32,"I don't want to make any suggestions about weapons that most people agree need work, because Valve already knows about them. Valve is going to rework those weapons when they get a chance, and that's good. Instead, I want to provide some feedback based on my experiences and suggest some small (but meaningful) changes to some specific weapon unlocks. These are weapons which I think are *almost* at a pretty good place, but not quite, and I think that these are the weapons that are most likely to fly under the radar and go unnoticed by Valve in future weapon balance changes. Here are my suggestions: - **Force-a-Nature**: make *both* shots cause knockback, at least to the user, and increase the knockback they deal to the user. The Soda Popper currently outclasses the FaN in terms of both raw DPS and added mobility. I think the FaN would have a much cooler and more useful niche if its self-knockback feature was stronger and more versatile. - **Shortstop**: make the extra healing actually work for ""all healing sources"" (as currently falsely advertised in its description) and make the extra healing a passive effect again. It's part of an item set with the Mad Milk, yet its extra healing doesn't actually affect milked enemies! Also, by making the healing a passive effect and making affect medigun heal rate, the Shortstop would have good synergy with the Boston Basher in Highlander for helping the Medic build ber, potentially making it a better weapon in comp. - **Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol**: remove the damage vulnerability. That damage vulnerability makes people less likely to want to use this weapon, but its upside of a small amount of healing on hit is only really noticeable if you use it almost constantly! With said vulnerability, you end up dancing about in a corner, firing this pistol at enemies from a distance while praying that no one is sneaking up behind you, instead of just grabbing a nearby small health pack and returning to the battle to be useful for your team. - **Wrap Assassin**: increase the radius for the broken glass shards when the bauble misses. Obviously, players shouldn't be rewarded for missing, but the current radius for that effect is so annoyingly tiny that the majority of close misses don't register any damage. That's just silly when you consider that the shards only cause a tiny amount of chip damage when they *do* occasionally land. - **Liberty Launcher**: make the reduced self-damage more noticeable. The extra rocket is nice, and the faster rockets are alright, but the reduced self-damage from rockets is only really impactful when used with the Gunboats, and so the LL isn't really worth using unless you're using it alongside those metal boots. A small buff to the reduced self-damage from rockets could make the LL more popular for use alongside a non-Gunboats secondary so that you can have greater mobility without giving up your secondary slot. - **Cow Mangler**: remove the slower reload speed on the first rocket. Reduced damage against buildings is reason enough to use this weapon situationally; the slower reload speed just makes the Cow Mangler less used than it deserves to be. - **Panic Attack**: reduce the maximum bullet spread by like a third. Once you have only 1/3 health or less, you can't deal consistent damage *even at point-blank range* to any class other than a Heavy, and that's only because of the Heavy's size. It's an okay weapon right now, but it would be nice if you could use it in a clever ambush-y way at low health instead of being forced to pull out your melee instead. - **Equalizer**: add faster run speed at lower health, but only at somewhere between 2/5 and 1/2 the rate of the Escape Plan. It wouldn't be a terrific ""escape"" weapon like the Escape Plan, but it would help towards the issue of the Soldier having trouble relying on close-range melee weapons to deal damage to enemies because of his slow movement speed. - **Neon Annihilator**: add faster movement while holding if user is wet and/or significantly faster movement speed while holding if user is underwater. This is just a feature that would make the NA more justifiable on the few maps that have water features of some kind. For example, on Well and Freight, where there are underwater flank routes, the Pyro could make use of those flank routes to traverse the map faster using the Neon Annihilator. - **Iron Bomber**: add -15% self-damage from grenades, and add a Strange version. The reduced self-damage from grenades would encourage using the Iron Bomber's static grenades for explosive jumping, a likely unintended feature which is currently one of its most interesting applications. These two changes would address the two most common reasons why so many people don't use the Iron Bomber over Stock: it's too similar to Stock and there's no Strange version. - **Dalokohs Bar**: significantly reduce the loss rate on its overheal. The potential 50 additional health as overheat that was added in Gun Mettle sounded great on paper. By the time you actually round the corner and rev up your minigun after eating the Dalokohs Bar, though, it's more like 30 extra health, and unless people immediately spot you and start shooting at you, you'll only end up actually using maybe 10 of that bonus health to protect yourself from damage if you're lucky. That buff honestly didn't actually end up changing the Dalokohs Bar in any meaningful way, which is a shame. - **Pomson**: fix three of the weapon's annoying bugs: it has no world view reload animation visible to other players, its projectiles turn invisible when shot through allies or friendly buildings, and its crit projectiles are identical to its normal projectiles (making getting killed by crit projectiles really annoying). If the easiest way to fix the crit projectile problem is to remove its ability to crit like with the Cow Mangler, then I think most people would be fine with that. - **Eureka Effect**: remove the annoying side effect that you only get half metal with the Widowmaker. If it weren't for this side effect, then the Widowmaker and the Eureka Effect could potentially have terrific synergy and make for a fun combination in a pub setting. - **Southern Hospitality**: remove ""no random critical hits"" and replace it by giving the weapon a small damage penalty and reducing the damage done by bleed. ""No random critical hits"" is a massive downside in pubs for melee weapons (because of the significantly higher random melee crit rate) for classes like the Engineer that actually use their melee in combat, which is why the Half-Zatoichi was so annoying on Demoknight, and is why so few people currently use the SH in pubs. - **Ubersaw**: add ""no random critical hits"". This weapon is really good in a competitive setting, but it's even *better* in a pub setting, in which you tend to be able to get away with using your melee more often as a Medic. No random critical hits on the Ubersaw would give a solid reason for Medics to use other melees in pubs more often without making the Ubersaw less fun to use in pubs, weaker for use in berchains, or less powerful in competitive, so this would be a relatively non-controversial change to a beloved weapon unlock that would encourage variety in weapon usage. - **Cleaner's Carbine**: make it so that kills done with it fill half of the CRIKEY bar. As it currently stands, this weapon's stats encourage players to use it at a distance dealing chip damage to enemies instead of trying to kill said enemies with their primaries. There's much less motivation to use it as a ""finisher"" weapon instead because (a) it's kind of tough to use it to finish off enemies, and (b) you get rewarded for total damage dealt with it, not kills with it, so using it effectively as a finisher would only fill a small percentage of your CRIKEY bar. Adding a big benefit on kill would make the Cleaner's Carbine more like the Hitman's Heatmaker, rewarding you for using the weapon while also rewarding you *more* for using the weapon *well*. - **Your Eternal Reward**: give it a small passive upside to sneakiness like slightly quieter decloak (emphasis on ""slightly""), slightly faster cloaking speed, or something else along those lines. It's a fun weapon to use in pubs, but a small buff wouldn't hurt. What do you think about these proposed changes? "
286,vulnerability,tf2,PSA/Tip about the Buffalo Steak Sandvich,3,4e23ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/4e23ya/psatip_about_the_buffalo_steak_sandvich/,2016-04-10 03:21:25,"I see people complaining a lot on /r/tf2 about how weak the BSS is in regards to promoting a ""charging Heavy"" playstyle. The real niche for the Buffalo Steak, though, and the way it should mainly be used, is as a replacement for the Gloves of Running Urgently. It sacrifices the ability to self-heal using your secondary (while still retaining the godsend ability to heal *others*) to shift the ""damage vulnerability and faster movement speed while using your melee"" statistic normally associated with the GRU from your melee slot to your secondary slot. This can be used well, for example, for rushing to the midpoint at the start of a round on a 5CP map. The reason that you take less damage than you do with the GRU (25% vulnerability instead of minicrits) and that you can also mini-crit enemies is so that you're not *completely* helpless if you run into an enemy while under the BSS's effect. This actually somewhat gives it an advantage over the current version of the GRU, which leaves you marked for death for a couple of seconds when you switch away, making getting ambushed while using the GRU disastrous. So, the BSS is a secondary replacement for the GRU that lets you get away with running a different melee from the GRU (which, if you're playing seriously, will probably be the Fists of Steel) while retaining the ability to run the long distance to your objective, but at the cost of your self-healing ability. It's not ideal if you don't have a Medic, but with 6v6 Matchmaking in beta and with no item restrictions, I thought it was worth making a post to remind players that the primary intended use of the BSS isn't necessarily to go on a crazy meat rampage (although what you do in pubs on your own time is your own business). Now, if you have a Soldier who's willing to whip you all the way to midpoint, then you don't need to run either the BSS or GRU, but if your teammates aren't particularly fond of teamwork (as does happen from time to time in MM), then remember that you can always run the BSS every once in awhile.

Sorry about that. So, here's my try at giving more variety and playstyles to the pyro while keeping it balanced. Sorry about the formatting, not used to big posts. ***General:*** * **+Airblasts can now be charged!** Following the ""charged airblast"" attribute that's already in the game,you can charge airblasts by keeping the M2 button pressed. A non-charged airblast has the same knockback than the current airblast, but has slightly more range and is less ""stunlocking"", letting the enemy have some decent air control. However, the more you charge your airblast, the more the range, the airblast zone, the stunlock amount on enemies and the speed of reflected projectiles increase. (I don't have the exact numbers for how much each of these 4 mechanics should increase, but the airblast itself should be fully charged after ~1.5 second and would cost 30 ammo instead of 20.) So basically, in close encounters, the well-known ""puff and flare"" mechanic and apparented would be slightly easier to avoid if the pyro just ""clicked"" M2 since you wouldn't be as much stunlocked as you currently are, while you would be more screwed if the pyro had predicted the encounter and charged the airblast. A charged airblast is also good against projectile classes, if you can the timing in both the projectile prediction and the airblast charge, you're more likely to hit back the attacker with his projectiles. * **+Grenades and sticky bombs fuse time resets on airblasts** * **+-50% self damage taken from reflected projectiles** More effective against sticky spammers but also a great buff to reflected grenade jumping. * **+Afterburn damage deduction from healing sources**~~~~ Flamethrowers now applies an afterburn damage deduction from healing sources making the afterburn a bit more of a nuisance. So, basically, if a pyro just ignited you and you take a small health pack immediately after, you will be extinguished as usual but will only get about 10 health. When a medic tries to heal you with a medigun, the health dispensed in the first seconds will be used to wear off the remaining afterburn and won't be given to you as health.

Subclasses, like the Demoknight or Combo-Pyro, add a lot to the gameplay in my opinion - they bring in variety and a degree of unexpectability (is that a word?). Therefore, I'd personally welcome the addition of more of them - and one of those would be turning the Sniper into a Ranger-type deal. The reason for this is that so far, the Huntsman isn't really viable, and most people simply spam groups of enemies at a mid-long range with it, hoping for an occasional headshot (""Lucksman""). I'd like to bring the Sniper closer to his enemies, allowing him to actually lead his shots, thus increasing his skill ceiling. Those of you who've read fantasy books, especially Tolkien, or played RPGs probably already know what I mean. I'd like to make the Huntsman-Sniper faster, more precise, but also much more punishable in his mistakes with the addition of the following two items: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^a ***Quivering Quiver*** (yes, I know, it's a crappy name so far) * Increases primary ammo by 50% * Increases movement speed and jump height by somewhere around 15% * Decreases health by 25 * Increases fire vulnerability by ~25% * Burns down if it comes in contact with fire (comes back after a cooldown. Once it's burned down, only it's negative effects stay) At first, I thought about adding those stats to the Huntsman itself, but the SMG might be too powerful in combination with them, which is why I think a secondary would be better. Essentially, those changes allow the Sniper to be much more mobile and allow him to dodge more, but also heavily punish taking damage - especially from fire, since Pyros are much easier to avoid at increased speeds. He'll have to rely more on health kits (which are more easily accessible at higher speeds), but will also be able to aim his shots more easily. The recent addition of the ability to charge and fire arrows while jumping also makes the +15% jump height much more interesting. I've also thought of a melee weapon to go with the set: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^a ***Survivor's Knife*** (another name that probably isn't here to stay) * ~~Swing speed increased by 10%~~ * ~~Allows for minicrits on backstabs~~ * ~~Damage decreased by 15%~~ Would probably look like one of [those](URL Haven't thought much about the addition of this item yet (feedback is very welcome), but essentially, it'd make ambushing (especially already hurt) enemies from behind more rewarding, which goes well with the increased mobility of the Quivering Quiver - however, it's also more lacking in direct combat. Essentially, you'd use it to ambush an enemy by shanking them 1-2 times from behind, then running away again and waiting for your next opportunity. Not as viable on small maps, but it sounds like fun to play around with. **EDIT: Yeah, backstab bonus damage probably still wouldn't work too well for this. However, how about more health from health kits but less damage altogether, or a faster swing speed and run speed when equipped in return for less damage?** Of course, these are only my ideas. What do you guys think? Would Sniper work as a Ranger-subclass, do you like the weapon stats, do you have ideas for things that might work better? I'm excited to read your feedback!"
295,vulnerability,tf2,A Simple Pyro Buff: Give the Powerjack's speed to all the melees,0,45ce93,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/45ce93/a_simple_pyro_buff_give_the_powerjacks_speed_to/,2016-02-12 12:56:03,"So as we all know, pyro has LOADS of problems, and it feels like every other balance post is just some guy ranting about how sorry of a state pyro is in. But I feel people are focusing too much on huge reworks to the class, like changing how flames work, making afterburn prevent healing, and stuff like that. I think we should first look at the little things we can fix, quality of life changes that make pyro much better without making too much of an impact on gameplay. So I'm gonna suggest a fix to pyro's melee weapons, specifically concerning the powerjack and its relation to the other melee weapons like the axtinguisher and the backscratcher. Anyone who's played pyro for more than 10 hours knows that the powerjack is the best melee, and it's the most used melee, with 42% of people that own the powerjack equipping it (according to TF2stats.net). But why? Why is the powerjack so overused, and why are weapons like the backscratcher so underused? The answer is actually very simple: speed. The powerjack gives pyro speed, and none of the other melees do so. That's it. Think about it for a sec: pyro has the shortest range out of all the classes, so anything that increases his terrible mobility is a godsend. Who cares if the backscratcher gives extra health from packs? It's not gonna help if you're trying to close the gap between you and the enemy. It's not gonna help you on rollouts. It's not gonna help you while retreating. The powerjack's speed automatically makes it 10 times better than the other melees. This is why the nerf to the powerjack's health on kill during gun mettle changed nothing about the weapon's use: people use it for the speed, not for the health on kill. So if the powerjack will always be the best melee as long as it has the speed, then what can we do to encourage more variety with the pyro's tertiary slot? If you read the title, then you know exactly what I'm suggesting: **-All pyro melees now allow the pyro to move at 115% speed while active** This very basic change is all that is needed to fix the pyro melee conundrum. Now all melees have access to that sweet, sweet speed, putting all of them at the same level of the powerjack. Now choosing between the axtinguisher and the backscratcher isn't just choosing between the least bad weapon (although the ax definitely needs a buff, but that's a topic for another day); you aren't forced into the powerjack every time you play pyro. In fact, the axtinguisher could actually be reverted back to its state before tough break and not be complete trash, because the problem with that iteration of the ax was that you were choosing between always-useful speed and getting +23 damage. This change may even make people use the fire axe/third degree if you just want the speed and no fancy stats. But now that the speed is passive to all melees, what should we do with the powerjack? Well, I think it should be similar to how it when it originally came out: THE POWERJACK - **On kill: restore 75 health and gain a speed boost for 3 seconds** - *20% damage vulnerability while active* Now the powerjack is not the ubiquitous choice, but a gimmicky, fun side grade that allows you to go on hammertime rampages if you get a kill with it. In the end, this simple change would give pyro some much needed mobility, without making it OP (since you only gain the speed while the melee is active, so it doesn't really encourage w m1). What do you guys think of this idea? Is it exactly what we need? Or could it use some tweaking? Please share your thoughts down below. **TL;DR: Make faster speed a passive on the pyro melees, and put the powerjack's focus on its ""on kill"" stats.** EDIT: Downvotes for disagreement....goddamn reddit really disappoints me sometimes.

Being a direct upgrade isn't saying much when the fire axe has the negative attribute of not being the powerjack. It seems like it could create an interesting niche for pyro by being anti medic pair if it got some extra positive attribute and a negative attribute. I thought it would be interesting if it could deal mini crit damage to players who are overhealed; it wouldn't do extra damage to the med unless the med is being healed by another medic and it would be sorta like a weapon for taking down shields which could be helpful for your team. Perhaps a negative could be damage vulnerability to encourage surprising a medic combo or maybe it could just deal less damage to non overhealed targets.
300,vulnerability,tf2,Just a some balance ideas,0,46m0y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/46m0y8/just_a_some_balance_ideas/,2016-02-20 05:29:24,"With the gun mettle update and now the tough break update its obvious valve intends on making this game balanced for the sake of the new competitive match making without having to ban there own weapons. These ideas are completely based off of competitive, not pubs. The Solemn Vow/ Bonesaw: ---------------------------------- I think that the bonesaw should be buffed so you are able to read enemy health like the Solemn vow. This will give medics the task to call out enemy health and finally give medics a reason to use the bonesaw over the uber saw, which every competitive medic (including myself) will say is simply the best medic melee. The Diamondback: -------------------------- I think the base damage should be lowered to 30 a shot, so that the crits that you earn through backstabs and sapping do 90 damage, so its very much possible to 2 shot 125-175 health classes but no longer allow for 2 shot to a soldier or 3 shots to a heavy. I thought that the ambassador should receive this nerf as well, but earning headshots are much more difficult and the decay time slows down the rate at which you can headshot significantly making it a much harder and skillful weapon to use in comparison to simply earning them through backstabbing or sapping. This should give more incentive to use the stock revolver or if you really want consistent -105 damage, use the amby. Machina: ------------- In a competitive scenario, the noscoping removed isn't much of a nerf. The extra damage upon being fully charged is a direct upgrade. I think this weapon's base damage should be increased to 60. (Will be able to 3 shot body shot demo's and pyro's) -15% or 20% charge rate. Still be able to penetrate players. Maybe make noscoping to 30 or 40 damage? The classic: --------------------------- Take away body shot damage penalty. Increase the charge 10% to give this gun a reason to be used beside being able to charge unscoped. Stock smg: --------------- Increase the base damage to 10. It sucks for the most part compared to these useful backpacks. Lower the spread too. Its an rng canon. Darwins Danger Shield: ---------------------------- Take away bullet resistance and explosive vulnerability. +25 health on wearer. Right now the strongest backpack is the cozy camper, the razorback is very common in highlander. I don't really understand what play style they are trying to encourage with the DD, the increase in health and bullet resistance suggests to be a more aggressive and beefier sniper, but at the same time you are much more susceptible to explosives. Which should hold you back. This change should encourage an all around more aggressive and mobile play style. Pomson 6000: The engineer has no business removing uber from a medic. Take the feature away. Keep the decrease of clock on hit however. Increase the particle speed. (I don't know how much would be balanced) Take away the infinite ammo property, its stupid and encourages spam. Increase the base damage to 50 instead of 48. The panick attack ------------------------------- Its still gimmicky even with its recent buff. Take away the spread on lower health. Maybe then it will be useful. That's all I have, I can't wait to see this game grow in the esports catagory. "

This makes it so you don't have to go into battle without having the crits ready beforehand. You can stick back, shoot a Scorch Shot pellet into a crowd, and farm tons of flame damage. Sollution: Make the Phlog's MMMPH Meter charge up when only the flame damage is done by the **phlog itself**. This will force players to actually get in close. 2. When the MMMPH meter is full, the pyro is forced to taunt on the spot, meaning Pyros will have to judge how when and where to do more fire damage, or the crits could just be wasted. This also makes it so the Pyro can't activate it whenever they please to save themselves. 3. Faster Ammo Consumption when firing while having Crits. 4. Damage Vulnerability on wearer 5. Less Starting ammo These are just some suggestions. I'm looking to make the Phlog take a bit more planning and skill, not cripple it entirely and make it a shit weapon."

The original name and damage boost were assigned to a bloody, silver version of the weapon, while the other half with the original look and speed boost was re-titled the Escape Plan. The idea back then was that by splitting the benefits of what was clearly the best Soldier melee by a wide margin, we'd end up with two balanced ones. Unfortunately, only the Escape Plan retained any real usefulness after this and Valve - being the infinite boneheads that they are - nerfed it further by adding a minicrit vulnerability while wielding it. So now we have two fairly weak weapons... however, that vulnerability might just be what we need if we were to re-merge the two again, so that you once again get a damage and speed boost based on how low your health is, at the risk of even further vulnerability. Compared to the other melees that Soldier has access to these days, I don't think it would outclass them anymore. All Escape Plans could be converted back into Equalizers, and its look - along with that of the ""halved"" Equalizer - could become skins for the weapon, akin to the Splendid Screen. The original look can retain the name of 'An Escape Plan', while the newer skin could be titled 'Bloody Murder'."

305,vulnerability,tf2,An attempt at fixing the pyro,0,41zlfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/41zlfe/an_attempt_at_fixing_the_pyro/,2016-01-21 22:46:28,"Before we start, I want to make special note that I am not a pyro main. Pyro isn't even one of my most-played classes, I've just seen the discussion surrounding the pyro and wanted an attempt to throw my hat into the ring. I am only making suggestions and I am not saying this is what needs to happen. Alright, so I wanted to do three things when thinking about this. First is to make the pyro more effective at high levels of play and second is to make the pyro take more skill across ALL levels of play. Finally I wanted to keep the theme of ""fire"" with the pyro as that is what the class is about, after all. FLAMETHROWERS My main idea with flamethrowers is to greatly reduce the horizontal size of the flamethrower while greatly increasing the distance that the flamethrower has. Ideally I'd want the flamethrower to be more akin to a stream of water from a hose, so it would be something like using the Medic's syringe gun, only more damaging and lights things on fire. I feel like this would increase the amount of skill needed while giving the pyro some usability at mid-range allowing him to pull off defensive and support roles more easily. AFTERBURN Now I feel like afterburn as a whole can be changed. I have two possible suggestions here. First is to make afterburn do less damage but work into what the pyro is doing. For example, the flamethrower can do more damage to a player who has been inflicted with afterburn for a longer amount of time. I also have an idea with the shotgun I will go into later. Second is to make afterburned players take slightly more damage from all sources while they're on fire in addition to the now smaller damage-over-time. Nothing like minicrits, more like a 10% damage vulnerability. SHOTGUNS Now I was thinking of completely changing the pyros shotgun from the other stocks. The pyro's shotgun could be more unique like the scattergun in that it does increased damage on burning targets but does less damage than the normal shotgun on non-burning targets. With the new flamethrower length this should pair nicely together and give the pyro a nice way to deal with enemies that both requires a bit more skill and is more efficient than what he can do now. The reserve shooter can stay as it is. FLARE GUNS My suggested change with the stock flaregun is a simple one. Slow down the flare to around rocket speed. The upside to this? Give the flare higher damage. The detonator can have a very simple change. Drastically reduce self-damage and increase jump distance and speed. I can't think of any changes for the scorch shot. AIRBLAST Finally I feel like with these changes we can also change the way airblast works. Allow airblast to work like rockets, you can surf an airblast away and how hard it moves you is affected by how close to your feet the pyro was aiming when he did it. Additionally give it slightly more supportive use via removing jarate and mad-milk. Ideally I'd also like to see mini-crits on reflect removed unless the pyro was under the effects of a buff banner. With these changes I feel like you could also change some of the melees, like buffing the axtingisher since airblast is now less annoying and the pyro has to actually aim his airblast to get the best effects from it. Now I'm sure these changes aren't perfect and some people will hate them, but I'm just trying to think of ideas that can make the pyro more effective and require more skill to use. I'd like to hear other thoughts on the matter as well. "
306,vulnerability,tf2,Fixing demoknight and bringing the tide turner back,2,42k6q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/42k6q3/fixing_demoknight_and_bringing_the_tide_turner/,2016-01-25 18:05:24,"Ever since the changes after tough break, demoknight has been pretty much shit. Tide Turner aka the only good shield got nerfed to shit and is now almost worthless despite being the only viable shield against good players. let me explain: No ones gonna watch you charge in a straight line and get bashed + critted only the dumbest of f2ps will die to that. The Tide Turner let you outplay people by juking the shit out of people and pulling off sick manuevers. Not only was it the best shield **even after** the nerf where taking damage stopped your charge, but it was the most **fun**. I mean ok valve, you made it so that a soldier that just watches me charge at him can shoot a rocket and completely ruin my charge. Thats fine, thats what the turning is for. You juke out the opponent and hit them from behind, dodging their rockets etc. But now, you can't even deal more than minicrits on a successful blow? Even if I juke someone out and hit them from behind, I can only slap them with a 88 damage attack. The kill potential is COMPLETELY gone. I only came back to TF2 because I heard a bunch of new weapons came out, and one of them was the tide turner. I was convinced that it would be garbage like the other 2 shields (back in the day I used the turning scripts which made demoknight more viable, he could sort of turn in a ghetto way. People also used xbox 360 controllers which gave better looking control for demoknight), but to my surprise, it was everything I ever wanted. I immediately crafted one, name tagged it etc, and fell in love with TF2 again. But now I feel like almost all of the fun of demoknight is gone now, I can't enjoy him anymore. **My Suggestion:** Please revert the most recent Tide Turner change, and rework the Chargin Targe + The Splendid Screen to function more similar to the Tide Turner. Many of the swords were buffed and nerfed. Overall they were nerfed. So why also nerf the only good shield? The claideahm mor was changed to give you full health now but a 15% damage vulnerability on wearer. It is actually BETTER to have 160 HP (the old claideahm) than the new 175 HP + 15% extra damage. You were actually tankier last patch. In addition, the claideahm had a really unique stat: it let you charge longer distances, and with the tide turner that meant you could run circles around people for even longer, or they would have to spend more ammo trying to ruin your charge since damaging you depletes charge (a fair nerf to the tide turner that im ok with) And now thats gone too! 25 HP on kill!?!?! Getting a head with the eyelander actually restored 15HP already, so this weapon is literally a straight downgrade. Your effective health aka EHP is actually worse than just going eyelander demoknight except eyelander demoknight gets the ability to earn heads. Persian Persuader also kind of got worse. The extra charge from hits didn't matter because you got full charge on kill with the tide turner + booties, so getting HP off of dropped ammo was more useful. **Full turning control should be a staple in all of the shields, and they should be balanced around that.** All of the shields should get full turning control. Each of them should have different drawbacks and bonuses to differentiate themselves. Ex: Tide Turner gives full turning control, doesn't deplete charge if you take damage, BUT takes bonus fire damage and things like airblast and explosives that could always stop a charge will still stop your charge. Chargin Targe: full turning control, fire and explosive damage resistance, but damage taken depletes charge. Etc etc etc *TL;DR demoknight kind of died after the last patch with the final nerf to the Tide Turner. you can barely kill anyone anymore and its sad because it was a really fun weapon to use and required skill as well. Maybe if valve sees this they may reconsider their change and revert the last nerf they applied to the Tide Turner, and hopefully make the other two shields more similar to the Tide Turner. Pls volvo, getting 9 heads streak with the booties/tideturner/eyelander was the most fun thing ever for me*"

Basically, I think it could be a fun weapon to help a flanking Heavy go unseen while taking side routes on certain maps. Sentries would still have no problem seeing and targeting a shrunken Heavy, and any attentive player could also easily spot him if he's not making good use of the environment and/or side routes, but I think this melee would just make flanking easier and more fun for the Heavy, who is normally pretty bad at being sneaky because of his massive frame.

Stock melees on most classes are a joke, except Sniper, Spy, and Demo. Like, you guys think Sharpened Volcano Fragment is bad, but at least that can be used to combo with the Flare Gun. Fire Axe is one of the most outclassed weapons in the game. Damage melees have a fatal flaw: If you have your primary and secondary, and you're not a Demoknight, most of the time it's simply more efficient to use your ranged weapons to kill someone than use your melee. Why bother picking a damage melee if you're not going to use it for damage? And so many people only use the powerful utility melees instead. This means many weapons are just *pointless*. So here is my list of how to fix all melees, apart from hitboxes, which are a lost cause. Apologies for the length. * **Buff all melee weapons by 10 damage, both stock and nonstock.** Might not sound like much, but now an average melee is able to kill a Medic in 2 hits where before it would have taken 3. A butterknife can now kill Med in 3 hits rather than 4. Makes picking melees for damage more feasible. * Rework Atomizer: Grants triple jump. Each midair jump costs 5HP [adding up to 10 if you triple jump]. -25% firing speed. -25% damage against players. * Nerf Boston Basher: On top of other attributes, user can only be overhealed to 125%. * Nerf Disciplinary Action: Damage penalty changed from 25% to 50%. * Escape Plan: ""-90% less healing from Medics while wielded"" changed to ""50% less healing from all sources on user."" * Nerf Gloves of Running Urgently: Increase the mark for death duration after swapping to 5 seconds from 3 seconds. * Nerf Ubersaw: Increase 0.16s swing penalty to 0.25s. * Rework the Third Degree: Mini-crits all enemies connected by heal beams. User takes melee crits. Hitting allies extinguishes them and cancels bleed effects. * Rework Powerjack: +75HP on kill. 20% damage vulnerability while wielded. * Rework Sharpened Volcano Fragment: +15% movespeed while out. 2HP/sec drained on user. On hit, engulfs target in flames. * Buff Sun on a Stick: Now ignites target on third consecutive hit. Damage penalty reduced by 5%. * Buff Eureka Effect: Metal pickup penalty reduced by 25%. * Buff YER: +5% movement speed on user. [This tiny buff allows you to gain on classes who run at the same speed as you over distances.] * Rework Ullapool Caber for a happy medium between pre-nerf and post-nerf. * Though it is not a melee, Buff the Buffalo Steak Sandvich's movement speed bonus by 10%. This will synergise with the GRU nerf: If you take Buffalo for the speed boost you don't need GRU, and can use a melee that actually lets you defend yourself, such as the Eviction Notice, Warrior's Spirit, or KGB. Edit: Changed based on Valve's changes in Tough Break. They did the Jag and Fists changes, neat."
310,vulnerability,tf2,How the Tough Break Update Skill-Capped the Pyro,1290,3xe0vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3xe0vt/how_the_tough_break_update_skillcapped_the_pyro/,2015-12-19 07:53:27,"*Or how ~~w + m1~~ fire is for noobs (but we can change that!)* When it comes to classes and weapons Valve have the difficult job of finding good balances for public gameplay (Pubs) and, as they build up to matchmaking, competitive gameplay (Comp). Comp gameplay is traditionally one of two types: highlander, where 1 of each class is used to field a team of 9 players; and 6s, where a team is generally made up of 1 Medic, 1 Demo, 2 Soldiers, and 2 Scouts (other classes can be swapped in if desired). Although Valve have not yet revealed how matchmaking will breakdown in terms of classes, its highly likely that they will seek to include all 9 classes one way or another. So, for the sake of this discussion, Im going to refer to two types of players: Pub and Comp. Prior to the Tough Break update Pub Pyros were able to get away with a lot of low skill playing, most notably the infamous w + m1 playstyle. Meanwhile, Comp Pyros (used almost exclusively in highlander) would usually end up in the middle of the stats page (Comp uses stats sites such as [logs.tf](URL as they are better indicators of performance than the scoreboard). When playing against players of equal skill, Comp Pyros usually perform equally or at a slight disadvantage. Aspects of the Airblast mechanics were considered overpowered by some, but, generally, Comp Pyros themselves have been viewed as slightly *underpowere*d for high level play. **What the Tough Break update has done is to further encourage Pub Pyros to w + m1 and made it incredibly difficult for Comp Pyros to compete against other classes played by players of a similar skill level.** ##How this happened The stock Flamethrower has long been considered underpowered, and, as a result, most Comp Pyros and many Pub Pyros preferred to use the Degreaser. **The mistake, however, is in assuming that this meant the Degreaser was overpowered.** It wasnt. Really. No one in Comp (or Pubs for that matter) was saying *Oh no, here comes the Degreaser Pyro, run!* It was more of *This could go either way, but I think I can take them* scenarios. Now Comp players facing Comp Pyros will just be thinking *Why hello there, easy kill. Shame whats about happen to you and your little Medic friend.* Well, except when two enemy Comp Pyros meet; theyll just be thinking, *Welp. Its almost impossible to flare punch each other these days. Guess Im ready for a long, drawn-out, nearly pointless 1v1.* (Flare punches are skilled maneuvers which involve hitting an on-fire enemy that has afterburn immunity [such as another Pyro] with a flare before the fire extinguishes) Much of Tough Breaks flamethrower changes resulted in it making it harder and less rewarding for Pyros to use anything but fire. Pub Pyros who enjoy running into enemies spraying fire everywhere are now going to be able to get away with doing that even more. Unfortunately, higher-level Comp Pyros rarely find themselves in situations where relying on fire alone will work. Despite the many changes to the various flamethrowers, the Degreaser will still be the flamethrower Comp Pyros need to use, as Comp Pyros need to guard against Spies, protect their teammates from jumpers (bombs) and spam, keep Scouts off their combo, and deny ubers. Only now, however, Comp Pyros will be much more ineffective in contributing to the game and will be mostly forced to run only Shotgun (or Reserved Shooter, if allowed) and Powerjack. The changes to the Degreasers switch speeds have made the Flare Gun and any melee that isnt the Powerjack all but useless in games against skilled players. (It has also made them less viable against Pub players as well.) ##Improving the Pyro Situation **Airblasts** * **Valve changes:** *Consecutive Airblasts will no longer prevent enemies from air-strafing until they touch the ground. Extinguishing a teammate will now return 20 health to the Pyro.* * **Thoughts:** Both of these changes are fair. The air-strafing mechanic wasnt fun for a lot of players to play against, and giving players a small reward for extinguishing teammates will encourage newer players to become better teammates. * **Suggested changes:** Extinquishing via Airblast a teammate would be more accurate, as the Manmelter doesnt gain this buff from extinguishes. Adding it to the Manmelter could help better balance this underused weapon. **Stock Flamethrower** * **Valve changes:** *The base Flamethrower's damage fall off over distance has been decreased, resulting in higher damage output at range.* * **Thoughts:** Coupled with the base weapon switch speed changed from 0.67 seconds to 0.5 seconds change, the Stock Flamethrower is now a more viable weapon to use. Newer players and players who wish to focus on a w+m1 playstyle will no longer be underpowered compared to Pyros using other flamethrowers. * **Suggested changes:** None. **The Degreaser** * **Valve changes:** *No longer boosts all-around switch speed. Instead, boosts switch-to speed by 60% and switch-from speed by 30%. Removed damage penalty. Increased Airblast cost by 25%. Increased afterburn penalty to from 25% to 66%.* * **Thoughts:** The increased Airblast cost and increased afterburn penalty serve mostly to make the stock Flamethrower less underpowered than the Degreaser. Although the Degreaser did not need these nerfs, its probably best for the Stock Flamethrower that they stay in. The changes to switch speed, however, robs the Degreaser of much of its versatility, especially when paired with the Flare Gun or any melee weapon. * **Suggested changes:** Revert the switch speed to the speed it was using the old 65% weapon switch speed. The recent base weapons switch speed should be accounted for, as the Degreaser shouldnt have a switch speed faster than it did prior to the Tough Break update. **Phlogistinator** * **Valve changes:** *Removed 10% damage penalty. When activating 'MMMPH', the taunting Pyro gains temporary invulnerability and immunity to knockback effects.* * **Thoughts:** The ultimate w+m1 weapons new temporary invulnerability and increased damage makes it THE flamethrower for whats known in the comp community as pub stomping. Although the immunity to knockback ensures MMMPH wont be lengthened for the Phlog Pyro, its new buffs will reward low skills with high rewards. * **Suggested changes:** Add a -25 max health on wearer drawback. This change would force Pyros to be more cautious about running into groups of enemies and expecting their MMMPH to fill in time to get them out. **Axtinguisher/ Postal Pummeler** * **Valve changes:** *100% Chance to crit against burning targets. 33% Damage penalty. 20% Slower attack speed. 75% Slower switch-to speed.* * **Thoughts:** The poor Axtinguisher has gone from being the best Pyro melee to being nearly unusable to utter garbage. Everything from the slower attack speed, to the slower switch-to speed, to the 33% damage penalty (44 normal damage, 131 crit damage) makes the Axtinguisher a nonviable weapon. * **Suggested changes:** Reduce the damage penalty to 25% (49 normal damage, 146 crit damage). Remove the slower attack speed and slower switch-to speeds. Add a 20% damage vulnerability on wearer when active drawback. This would then make the Axtinguisher useful for key picks, without making it overpowered. **The Third Degree** * **Valve changes:** *No changes during the Tough Breaks update.* * **Thoughts:** As much fun as I have with the Third Degree on pubs, its unfair that its a straight upgrade over the stock melee (Im looking at you, Holy Mackerel). * **Suggested changes:** Add a 20% damage vulnerability on wearer when active drawback. **Projectile Reflection** * **Valve changes:** *No changes during the Tough Breaks update, although the Degreaser will now be able to do less of it per 200 ammo.* * **Thoughts:** On February 7th, 2014, Valve released a patch for Team Fortress 2 which included in its patchnotes the change, ""Fixed deflected projectiles not affecting Strange and Killstreak counts"". This had the undocumented effect of causing Pyros to take minicrit self-damage from projectiles they reflect (all other classes are immune to their own crits and minicrits). This change was most likely not intended by Valve, as on June 11, 2014 they fixed Pyros from taking mini-crit self-damage from rockets. Unfortunately, this issue still affects all grenades as well as Sentry rockets. When dealing with grenade spam Pyros have been forced to choose between saving their team and likely dying, or trying to escape on their owna playstyle which runs contrary to the lets work together as a team mentality the Tough Break update is promoting. * **Suggested changes**: Remove mini-crit self-damage to Pyros from all grenades and Sentry rockets. ##Improving Future Updates Through Better Feedback Im a Pyro main. Ive been playing Pyro in Competitive since [ETF2Ls](URL Highlander Challenge in 2010, and Ive been playing in [UGCs](URL highest highlander division (Platinum) since 2012. I love playing both Competitive highlander and random Pubs, and I enjoying dabbling in MvM, Mannpower, and other interesting takes on TF2. I also love fairness and balance. I think its important that all 9 classes balance together well in both Comp and Pubs. So it worries me a great deal that Valve seem to be taking most of their community input from players who favor Competitive 6s over any other type of gameplay. Many in the 6s community dislike classes, weapons, or playstyles that interfere with the 6s meta, and, even those might try to be less biased in their opinions often dont have much experience playing classes that arent Scout/Demo/Solly/Medic. Although I doubt Valve is listening to only one person, Im going to use b4nny as an example as its been made clear that hes been working with Valve in regard to matchmaking. As of this writing, b4nnys Steam-recorded stats are as follows: Soldier: 2499.1 hrs; Demo: 2227.9 hrs; Scout: 1579 hrs; Medic: 325.3 hrs; Sniper: 190.2 hrs; Engineer: 87.1 hrs; Heavy: 41.4 hrs; Spy: 22.3 hrs; Pyro: 17.1 hrs. 17.1 hours on Pyro, and yet b4nnys [Pyro rant](URL ) from last week managed to magically align with many of the changes Valve gave the Pyro this week. I love that Valve are still improving our 8-year-old game, and I think its great they are listening to the community. Their working with Comp players to prepare for matchmaking is a very smart move. However, I think its a big mistake for them to only communicate with the top 6s players. Adding top Highlander players (preferably from across the globe) to their feedback pool will go a long way to insuring that Pyro, Engineer, Heavy, Spy, and Sniper voices arent being drowned out by the wants of the Demomen, Scouts, Soldiers, and Medics. b4nnys opinions are good ones to consider, but he and other 6s players shouldnt be dominating the conversation. All the classes and all the players of popular gamemodes should work together to be heard. For instance Engineers, speak out about how unnecessary the new Sapper changes are, especially given the other recent nerfs Engineer has seen. Spies, talk about how the new outlines give you away. Discuss if having them not show up for disguised Spies would be better. Bring up which cosmetics also give you away (that no legs Demoman sure looks sketchy) Competitive players, let Valve know how much having a server option to disable weapon pickups would benefit your league. Pub players, explain how frustrating it is that people being voted off a server (usually hackers) can disconnect mid-vote and then rejoin without issue when the vote is over. Bring up how players who change their alias to an alias already on the server should gain a [1] before their names to prevent the wrong person from being kicked. Everyone, give your feedback on the new scoreboard changes. Why is the charge bar being favored over the actual ping numbers? Does anyone like it? Why is there no longer an easy count of the number of players on each side? *And the list goes on* **Team Fortress 2 belongs to all of us. It shouldnt be changed to mostly cater to any particular group, skill level, or gamemode.** Work together, speak out, and get Valve listening so that each us can enjoy our time spent playing this wonderful, crazy, utterly unique game. Together. Because were a team, you know? "

A lot of people (Including me) do not like the changes made to pyro in this latest update. Here are some changes I thought of that would give the pyro more fun, more defined weapon choices and a higher skill ceiling. **removed health gain on extinguish** **gain 10 ammo on allied extinguish** &gt; * **Stock Flamethrower** * 10 Health gained on allied extinguish * Airblast cost reduced to 15 * Damage model remains the same This gives the flamethrower a more support oriented and defined role, giving the pyro more reason to stay with its team mates and assist, as well as punishing people who stray too close. &gt; * **Degreaser** &gt; * Switch to speed 30% faster &gt; * Switch away speed 60% faster &gt; * Damage reduced by 33% &gt; * Airblast cost heightened to 25 &gt; * Afterburn damage penulty of 33% &gt; * no random critical hits This punishes the pyro for using M2 spam and W+M1 tactics, while rewarding partnering primary weapons with an array of secondary and melee weapons, allowing for a more combo orientated offensive role. The Ol' Puff &amp;amp;amp;amp; Sting. &gt; * **The Backburner** &gt; * 20% lower base damage &gt; * 100% Critical chance from behind &gt; * Airblast cost increased to 30 &gt; * fully charges airblast cost increased to 50 &gt; * Airblasts take 20% longer to fire &gt; * Airblasts can be charged up to deal up to ~50% additional knockback to enemies &gt; * Charge up time for max power is 1.25 seconds, and can be held for a max of 3.75 seconds before auto-firing. This defines the Backburner as its own weapon, rather than a niche version of the stock (That nobody really ever used). The charge mechanic for Airblast opens up a more timed approach at pushing enemies further, either into your team to clean them up or away, leaving time for a handy escape (Or even off a well placed cliff...). The crits from behind promote flanking and stealth, allowing the pyro to deal a lot of damage before pushing the remaining enemies away and retreating safely. &gt; * **The Phlogistinator** &gt; * No Airblasts &gt; * Ammo capacity reduced to 125 &gt; * Deal damage to gain Mmph! &gt; * On full Mmph! charge, right click to activate Mmph! with a taunt and gain a 75% damage reduction whilst taunting &gt; * While Mmph!-ing, receive 100% mini-crits and +50% movement speed for a short time. &gt; * no random critical hits Full invulnerability and crits for the phlog is not fun to go up against, and I honestly feel bad when using it. A one button win is not fun for any game, especially this one. Changing full crits to mini-crits gives the enemy a chance at stopping the on-coming storm of death, while the movement speed allows the pyro do duck and weave rockets and other projectiles, as well as allowing for escapes and ambushes. &gt; **Reserve Shooter** &gt; * +30% faster firing speed &gt; * -33% clip capacity &gt; * Minicrits airborne targets &gt; * +33% faster deploy speed &gt; * no random critical hits &gt; * **Weapon can no longer be used by Pyro** The reserve shooter is not fun. It is horrible to go up against a pyro using the weapon, even moreso if you are a pyro yourself. With the faster weapon switching across the board, the shotgun is a more versatile and effective weapon for pyro to be using, and is not nearly as cancerous. Giving this burst shotgun to the soldier gives him a weapon that's unlike any in his arsenal and rewards him for defending team mates from bombing soldier/demos and also rewards knocking people up with rockets and quickly finishing them. Reserve shooter is now fun to use and go up against. &gt; **The Axtinguisher** &gt; * 100% mini-crits when facing the front of a target &gt; * 100% crits when facing the back of a target &gt; * Damage on non-burning targets reduced by 33% &gt; * Holster time increased by 33% &gt; * no random critical hits The Axtinguisher has lots of sharp bits, and therefore takes longer to put away. These stats give the weapon a ""Put you on fire and punish you for staying in melee range"" role, as well as allowing for ***sketchek's soul to live on***. &gt; **Sharpened Volcano Fragment** &gt; * Ignites players on fire when hit &gt; * Grants a decaying movement speed bonus on hit &gt; * Mini-crits burning players &gt; * -20% damage These stats might actually lead to people using this weapon. Think of it like the equaliser VS the escape plan. &gt; **The Homewrecker** &gt; * +100% damage to buildings &gt; * Can Damage enemy Sappers &gt; * -50% knockback when equipped &gt; * +15% movement speed when damaged by sentries &gt; * -50% damage to players This gives pyro a tool against their hard counter, sentries, as well as giving them the ability to help out friendly engies. Unfortunately because this is such a helpful tool, the Pyro doesn't swing it as hard at players, on fear of damaging it. &gt; **The Powerjack** &gt; &gt; * +40 Health on kill &gt; * Can over-heal up to 50% bonus health &gt; * +15% movement speed while active &gt; * +20% damage vulnerability when active Just a slight fix. &gt; **The Third Degree** &gt; &gt; * Deals Damage to everyone connected by a heal-beam &gt; * Attack can be wound-up to deal bonus damage &gt; * Wind-up time is 1.25 seconds, but can be held for up to 3.75 seconds until the pyro gets tired and needs a rest. &gt; * 20% slower swing speed &gt; * -20% damage on no wind-up &gt; * +35% damage on full wind up &gt; * no random critical hits This allows the pyro to deal damage to the combo in an interesting and fun way.

I'm not a super active member of this community either, so feel free to take everything with a grain of salt. As an additional note, this is all coming from a pub player who's only seen competitive stuff in videos. I rarely top-score, but all the same I've watched the videos and been in-game for this update as much as many of you. Enough rabble about me. You're here because of the title: The Phlogistinator is a bad weapon. Not in the sense that the Sun-on-a-Stick is a bad weapon, no. The Phlog is bad because it promotes stupid playing on the part of the user and induces rage on the other team. Moreso, it is a broken weapon. It is glitchy, exploitable, and the recent update has only fixed a few of those problems. Worst of all, it commits the cardinal sin of multiplayer PVP games: It makes things unfun. Let's break it down. To start off, let's look at playing against a Phlog Pyro. While W+M1 is certainly a major part of the annoyance against the Phlog, since it rewards the most mindless playstyle of Pyro, running at people spraying flames in a hope to set everyone alight and maybe kill some. In addition, this is only compounded by the fact that afterburn in general is honestly an unfun mechanic. Can you really say that it's rewarding to have fairly been beaten by an opponent, a Scout or Soldier perhaps, only for them to drop dead a few feet from a health pack because of a mechanic that deals damage over time? That's a whole different debate, however. So, Phlog Pyros are hated for W+M1ing. Sadly, there's more. With the MMMPH meter filled up, a taunting Pyro gets full uber for the duration of the taunt, a full heal, and then Critical Hits for a good 5-10 seconds afterwards. This is *insane*. A Phlog Pyro, just for burning people, gets a mini-Uber, mini-Quick-Fix, and pretty much a full Kritz. I'll put it simply. For doing nothing more than burning people, with or without the Phlog itself, and using the Flamethrower that lacks airblast and thus removing any reason for teamwork whatsoever, a Phlog Pyro gets mini versions of 3 different Ubercharges. And the MMMPH meter fills up fairly fast, too, especially with a Scorch Shot or Detonator, to a lesser extent. All of this alone might've not yet made the Phlog a bad, unfun weapon. The problem is, there's really no way to escape from a Phlog Pyro if he gets in range of you during the Critical Hits. And it's far too easy for him to get in range. To quickly list a couple of things that a Phlog Pyro can easily do: *Stand around a corner *Stand in an enclosed space *Stand behind a choke point *Run up behind a team completing an objective Need I say more? ""Oh, just walk backwards and shoot him!"" you might say. That's a great idea in theory, but unless you have an inner sense of exactly where an obstacle will be behind you and how to move to get around it, you've made your only mistake. The Phlog's Crits will eat you for supper if you get caught on one thing. So the Phlog is unfun to play against. Great. How is it glitchy and broken? Well, let's look at this perspective. If a Phlog Pyro fires a Scorch Shot down a choke point, getting 2-3 hits each time, how long do you think it'll take to fill up that MMMPH meter? Not as long as it should, that's for certain. Just to blatantly compare things, the Kritzkrieg requires at least ~30 seconds of constant healing to achieve Ubercharge, 8 seconds of Critical Hits for your healing target. Makes sense. Heal with the Kritzkrieg, get rewarded. A Phlog Pyro could never need to pull out his Phlog to fill up the MMMPH meter. He wouldn't even need to kill someone. All he would have to do would be shoot flares down a choke, or even just into a populated battlefield. With the Phlog, you can be rewarded for doing nothing at all helpful other than giving the enemy team afterburn, which as was already noted, a fairly unfun mechanic in the first place. Things don't stop there. I've seen Phlog Pyros taunt, run into a group and kill, say, half of them, and then pretty much have another taunt ready because as soon as it ended, the MMMPH meter said 'Hey, look, you set all these people on fire! Good job! Have more MMMPH!' *No other weapon does this.* The Soldier's Backpacks work on damage &gt; Reward mechanics, yes. At most, the Buff Banner, which gives *no* benefits other than the Rage Meter's filling and usage, gives Mini-Crits. Sure, it's not a fair comparison since the Phlog only grants the user Crits and isn't an area-of-effect, but at the same time the Buff Banner doesn't count damage dealt during the effect towards the Rage for the next blowing of the horn. And for getting all this, a damage meter that doesn't require the use of the weapon itself or even for it to be out, mini-versions of 3 Ubercharges, and relatively free Critical Hits, what does it lack? Random Critical Hits and Airblast. Valve is saying that Airblast *is just as powerful as* getting fully healed, becoming invincible, and getting free Critical Hits on command. And this is all without mentioning the fact that the Phlog encourages nearly dying, running into fights you wouldn't normally win, and basically gives the Pyro area-denial power to almost the level of a Sentry Nest. Sure, it's easier to kill a Phlog Pyro than a Level 3 Sentry with Engie keeping it up, but which one comes back with a vengeance faster? Which one is able to drop into the middle of your team and instantly gain full health and Critical Hits? Just for fun, I'll toss out a few things that I think would 'fix', or at least 'unbreak', the Phlog. *Either invincibility while taunting -OR- a full heal for taunting *Instead of 'Fire Damage', MMMPH is filled by direct burn damage from the Phlog only *20% damage vulnerability while active I've babbled on long enough. Go ahead and refute all of my points if you so wish, I'm more than open for discussion here. And again, I don't claim to know the intricate ins-and-outs of the metagame. I'm just sharing my thoughts and opinions. "
314,vulnerability,tf2,"A re-balanced Phlogistinator concept: ""Glass Cannon"" support Pyro",0,3y1e95,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3y1e95/a_rebalanced_phlogistinator_concept_glass_cannon/,2015-12-24 13:50:14,"Alright, I honestly doubt I need to say much of anything about the Phlogistinator. It's silly. 100%. I can't entirely tell where Valve was going with the weapon, so here's my concept for a rework. First of all, Mmph serves a totally different function. It still charges through fire damage, but instead of filling it and taunting to activate free crits and full heals, alt-fire now shoots a different type of fire that heals the pyro for ~50% of damage dealt, while draining from the Mmph meter instead of your ammo count, and applies a Mad Milk-like debuff that causes all damage dealt to victims covered in the ""Phlog juice"" to heal ~25% of damage done. The Phlogistinator pyro can't get health from his own Phlog-juice though, as the alt-fire vampire fire will be what provides him with health. This change allows the Pyro to provide a different type of support that the Airblast doesn't, creates a totally different niche for the Pyro, and falls in line with what I assume are Valve's design goals with the Phlogistinator and the Pyro as a whole. Other changes include doubling the ammo consumption of the Phlogistinator's primary fire, to encourage use of Mmph as needed. Also, while the weapon is active, the Pyro takes ~15% more damage, once again making the alt-fire important to the Pyro's survival. In the end, the weapon should look something like this: (+)Build ""Mmmph"" by dealing fire damage. (+)Alt-fire to drain ""Mmph"" and shoot health-draining fire, and cover enemies in a liquid that heals 25% of damage done to the victim by teammates (-)+100% ammo consumption rate (-)+15% damage vulnerability while active (-)No airblast The details are, of course, subject to change to create a truly balanced and interesting weapon, as this post is more about the concept then the exact end result. Thanks for reading."

I might possibly change or add some features for balancing purposes. I know that Tf2 already has a lot of content and to add this would be very difficult and time-consuming, but this could add so much more variety to gameplay and would be harder to tell when you see an engineer if he has a sentry or forcefield (Even though this wouldn't follow the style of tf2 of being able to tell what you're up against the moment you see an enemy, it'd pretty obvious to tell). Engineer could be really fun because instead of constantly babysitting your buildings you can shoot alongside your fellow teammates (Added bonus if you like playing medic and keeping your team alive)!

In HL, Sniper is the second most important class and he's often considered way too strong by this sub and many other players. He causes too much stalemates in HL and he is very popular off - class in 6s. He is generally just unfun to play againist. So, here the thing, this game soon will get an MM, and I thought, that it would be good to competition to lower Sniper's power. So, first thing is Quickscopes. Currently, they deals 150 damage. They also can be charged up, we all know this stuff. So, here is 2 characteristics, that I want to use, to change Quicks. Zoom-in charging delay - 1 s. and Zoom-in headshot delay - 0.2 s. So, my suggestion is: after headshot delay and before charging up, headshot will do 125 damage. When 1 s of charge delay ends, it's IMMEDIATLY scales back to 150 and will rise as charge rising. This can still dispatch light classes. But it is essential to lower Sniper presence in HL and for Darwin's rework. Razorback - this item in high level play counter Spy VERY HARD, because you can't just shoot Sniper, that stand with Pyro, Heavy, Demo, Sentry, have a perma 185 hp AND can turn around and Quickscope you. This cause the situation, where only counter to Sniper is another Sniper, and if you Sniper not as good as they're, so it's GG in most situation. The solution, in my opinion, is: Razorback Snipers cannot recieve overheal. You can't just tank Quick AND be unstabbable, y'know. And last - the Darwin's Shield. Here is idea: this weapon will reward skill to counter Quick. Stats: +20 explosive vulnerability, cannot recieve overheal. After a kill, Sniper will be rewarded with +25 overheal hp, up to 225 (just like max overheal with current Shield). So, r/tf2, and, hopefully, TF2 team, what do you think about my ideas and why they are bad? (Go butch me for my poor English and stoopid ideas, c'mon)."
320,vulnerability,tf2,Idea for Engineer PDA,35,3uehbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3uehbq/idea_for_engineer_pda/,2015-11-27 10:07:43,"So basically, the concept is, the Engineer and his buildings share a health pool. Example: Engineer: 125 hp. If he puts down a level 3 sentry, The engineer and the sentry gets 125 + 216 hp = 341 hp. If he puts down more buildings, then he gains more maximum health. Yes, this concept needs to be put through testing and needs to be adjusted. Some downsides for this item may include: * repair penalty for all buildings * healing received penalty * Engineer damage vulnerability * construction speed penalty so that the engineer can't just throw down a ~800 hp level 3 sentry in the middle of the enemy cap point. The implications of this item may sound ridiculously overpowered at first, but after proper adjustments and balancing, I think it will change a lot of the ways how people play AGAINST and AS the Engineer. I'll just talk about the possibilities I can think of off the top of my head. For one, buildings don't take critical damage, but the Engineer himself does. So, using that weakness vs. The Engineer may change how people engage sentry nests. (kritz as opposed to stock uber being the only viable option) What about backstabs? The backstab does 200% of the victim's current health and crits (so 6x current health), so a skilled spy may be able to get a backstab and instantly kill all the buildings along with the engineer. Additionally, a careless engineer may leave a single building in a place where enemies can take potshots at it outside of sentry range: leading to the downfall of the entire nest. Skilled snipers will also be able to deal massive damage to the nest as a whole by headshotting the engineer for 450/518 (with machina). Usually, even if a sniper lands a headshot on an engineer that wandered out of the 'safe zone' of his sentry, he is usually hard pressed to destroy the nest itself. This can change how snipers interact with engineers and vice versa. On the flip side, a more skilled Engineer may be able to go for risky sentry placements using the health of his other buildings as a buffer, leading to more interesting engineer plays as opposed to sitting in one entrenched position for the entire game. Also, Medics and dispensers will be able to indirectly heal an engineer's buildings by healing the engineer himself. By no means I am an expert in TF2's balance, but I think this is an interesting idea, given we do not have any options for the PDA slot of the Engineer. "

Those miniguns are *supposed* to provide a 20% damage resistance when spun up. However, this calculation bugs out on critical hits. A fully charged headshot on a Natascha Heavy should deal 360 damage. However, it actually deals 420 damage in-game. This is because the damage resistance is calculated as follows: [150 - 20% damage] + [300 damage] = 420 damage ^ Base ^ ^ Crit ^ ^ Total ^ The damage resistance is only applied to the base damage number. The crit damage is done in full to the Heavy. This is also evident with an uncharged headshot dealing 140 damage instead of 120, and crit melee hits dealing 182 instead of 156. The same issue applies in reverse to users of the Pain Train (10% bullet vulnerability). An uncharged headshot will calculate incorrectly as follows: [50 + 10% damage] + [100 damage] = 155 damage TL;DR: Faulty programming will cause crits to deal more damage than intended against players with damage resistance, and less damage against players with damage vulnerability.

326,vulnerability,tf2,A useful chart displaying the Synergy between Soldier Rocket Launchers and Secondary weapons,132,3f9mlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3f9mlz/a_useful_chart_displaying_the_synergy_between/,2015-07-31 18:19:10,"I'm supposed to be writing a 3 page essay on the contrast between the Agrarian and Foraging era of human history but instead I am writing a charge on Soldier Primary and Secondary weapon synergy. Anyways, this is a chart attempting to display on an unbiased level, what primary weapons pair best with what secondary weapons for Soldier (as my bias with Melee weapon design would interfere here). Secondary Weapon | Shotgun | Reserve Shooter | Righteous Bison -|-|-|-|- Rocket Launcher | The Shotgun provides a stable backup weapon in case you are either low on ammo, in range of self-damage, or fighting Scouts | The Reserve Shooter provides a more stable backup against Scouts and bombing enemies, as the Mini-crit damage from this weapon encourages the enemy to not be in the air. Otherwise this weapon has a lower clip size, thus making it less reliable against other enemies | Due to the spammability of the Rocket Launcher itself, the Righteous Bison's crowd control function is not as useful for maintaining harassment. Direct Hit | Due to the lack of crowd-control capabilities of the Direct Hit, a Shotgun is an extremely useful weapon to have as a last resort. | Due to the Direct Hit's faster rocket speeds, you are more likely to hit an enemy into the air for juggling. Though often times simply shooting another rocket is far more reliable than switching weapons and then firing the Shotgun. | The Righteous Bison allows for more crowd control-based option for medium/long range harassment. As the penetrating hits allow for more potential damage output against multiple players. Black Box | The Shotgun can be a stable weapon to countervent the Black Box's -1 clip size, especially as you are likely to have more health gained back by the 3rd rocket to allow for weapon switch in combat. | The lower clip-size of the Reserve Shooter makes it a risky choice to pair with the Black Box as opposed to the Shotgun. Though the ability to take down Scouts and Bombers is extremely viable for a Black Box user. | Due to the Black Box's lower clip size and lower return healing from lower damage, the Righteous Bison provides a stable long range crowd control alternative. Liberty Launcher | Due to the large clip size of the Liberty Launcher, alongside less self-damage, the Shotgun is slightly less favorable of a secondary with this weapon. As you can often be dead before the time when you need to switch to it. | Due to the faster projectile speed, you are far more likely to launch enemies into the air. Which means this weapon's upside can be forced more often. It makes a stable backup weapon for the Liberty Launcher. | The Liberty Launcher's large clip size and faster projectile speed makes it already extremely useful for long range harassment. Thus making the Righteous Bison a somewhat undesirable secondary in this situation. The lower damage output of both weapons also makes you rather weak at taking down buildings. Cow Mangler 5000 | The shotgun becomes a far more reliable last-resort with the Cow Mangler due to a hidden slower first reload speed penalty. | The Reserve Shooter provides a far more stable counter to Scouts and Bombers, which is where a Cow Mangler is likely to suffer due to the slower reload speed. | The Cow Mangler is already extremely spammable at long ranges due to infinite ammo, thus making the Righteous Bison a less desirable secondary weapon to have. Beggar's Bazooka | As the Beggar's Bazooka can functionally have an infinite clip, the Shotgun is less useful of a secondary. Though the Beggar's projectile deviation can make the Shotgun useful to have at close range. | The Reserve Shooter provides a stable burst alternative to the Shotgun with the Beggars when fighting against classes such as Scout, thus making it more preferable of a secondary weapon. | Due to the Beggar's absolute inability to deal accurate crowd control damage at long range, the Righteous Bison is favorable with this weapon for long range harassment. Air Strike | The Air Strike's (possibly) large clip size makes the Shotgun less desirable of a secondary | The large clip size of the Air Stike provides more chance of knocking an enemy into the air, thus making a combo with the Reserve Shooter more likely to occur. Somewhat more desireable than the Shotgun. | The Air Strike's reduced splash and damage can make the Righteous Bison a good long-range alternative. Though the possible clip size for the Air Strike can make this rather weak. **Overall** | The Shotgun is a stable alternative for weapons that provide little self-defense for the user. | The Reserve Shooter is better than the Shotgun versus Scouts and aerial enemies, but worse against grounded enemies. The Combo feature of the Reserve Shooter is always a possible feature | The Righteous Bison is useful as an accurate lane denial tool at long range, allowing for stable harassment against (multiple) enemies. Secondary Banner | Buff Banner | Concheror | Battalion's Backup ------|---|----|---- Rocket launcher | The stable damage output of the Rocket Launcher makes the Buff Banner an entirely viable banner. | The stable damage output of the Rocket Launcher allows for constant Concheror charges, which in turn allow for greater survivability and increases the chance of survival after a bombing attack. | Unless the Soldier has healing backup from some other source, the Rocket Launcher does not pair well with the Battalion's Backup, as you are extremely likely to be focused down and die when it is active. Direct Hit | Due to the higher damage output of the Direct Hit, the Buff Banner is far more likely to attain charge. When active, the Mini-crit function paired alongside with the Direct Hit's bonus damage allows for the user to 1-shot classes at 151 health or below at any range or up to 181 health classes at close range. | The faster projectile speed and damage output makes the Concheror likely to be charged at nearly all times. This allows for massive team sustain. If not at the cost of constantly being vulnerable as the banner needs to be reactivated. | The higher damage output of the Direct Hit allows for this banner to be charged often. But due to the lack of self-defense capabilities of the Direct Hit, the Battalion's Backup does not pair well with the weapon. As you are extremely likely to be focused down when the banner is active. When the Banner is active, you are an extremely capable anti-sentry nest class. Being able to 2-shot buildings from any range alongside massive resistance to sentry damage (-50%). Black Box | The self-healing from the Black Box means you are far more likely to survive until, and during the banner charge. The mini-crit damage output of the Buff Banner can be used to off-set the -1 clip size of the Black Box. | The healing from the Concheror (both passively and from the charge) allows for huge self-sustainability. And the smaller threshold of damage required for charges makes it far easier to attain a charge with the -1 clip size of the Black Box | The Battalion's Backup only properly synergizes with the Black Box. The self-healing of the Black Box means the user is far more likely to survive until the banner is active. The passive +20 health paired up with up to +20 health per Black Box rocket allows for up to 280 health per clip for the user (effectively 378 health under the banner effect). Allowing for huge tankability options. While under the effect of the Banner, the Black Box's self healing allows for the user to make up for huge portions of the damage taken from the enemy. This in turn means that the user is far less likely to die while the banner is active. Liberty Launcher | Due to the longer range capabilities of the Liberty Launcher, you are likely to reach the banner charge for this weapon by using suppressive fire. The mini-crit of the banner can be used to counter-vent the -25% damage attribute of the Liberty Launcher.| Due to the lower damage threshold required for a charge from this banner, you are far more likely to be able to activate it. The self-healing provided from the charge can allow for extremely fast bombing runs when paired with the Liberty Launcher's lower self damage. It also extends the likeliness of being able to fire the 5th shot before dying. | The Battalion's Backup's +20 health attribute can provide an extra rocket jump with the Liberty Launcher, and similarly to the Buff Banner the Liberty Launcher's projectile speed makes the banner far more likely to be charged. Cow Mangler 5K | Due to the CM5K's infinite ammo feature, you are more free to spam to gain the charge for this weapon. The Buff Banner is the only way for a Cow Mangler to gain (mini)crits aside from the alt-fire feature, which by itself negates some of the need for the Buff Banner. The slower reload also means your damage output is somewhat lower. | The Concheror's lower damage threshold before gaining charge can be used to bypass the slower reload speed. And the bonus suvivability of this Banner means the user is far more likely to live until they reload more shots. Due to the nature of having infinite ammo and the Concheror's healing, this combo allows for the user to be entirely self-dependent, not relying on ammo packs or health packs. | The Cow Mangler's extremely reduced damage to buildings makes it less desirable of a pair with the Battalion's backup, of which a good potion of the charge is useful for taking down sentry nests. The weapons do not synergize well. Beggar's Bazooka | The constant damage output of the Beggars can be used to allow for massive output with the mini-crits provided by the Banner Charge. | The passive self-healing alongside with the charge healing from the Concheror can allow for a Beggar's Soldier to stay in combat longer to deal more damage with the weapon. The faster movement speed can also allow for the Beggar's Soldier to close in distance, thus making the Beggar's more effective of a weapon. | The Beggar's can be used with a Battalion's charge to deal burst damage to sentries, hopefully taking them down. Not a very reliable combo. Air Strike | The Air Strike allows for huge burst damage, the Buff Banner could be used to augment this burst damage to assit in clearing a large ammount of enemies fast. | Due to the Concheror's lower damage threshold for a charge, you are far more likely to have it availible. Under the effects your bombing with the Air Strike can fully heal the user, or allow for the user to reload post-bomb while either retreating or dodging enemy fire.| If aerial space allows, the Air Strike could be used as a massive bombing source for damage for a sentry. The Battalion's resistance is negated in this regard. Though in closed in spaces the large clip size could be used to constantly take down a sentry as an engineer runs out of metal. An unstable combo. **Overall** | The Buff Banner pairs best with direct damage dealing rocket launchers | The Concheror pairs best with the Rocket Launchers that are not based on dealing direct damage, or that have overall lower damage output. The healing and mobility of this weapon also encourages bombing. | The Battalion's Backup +20 health allows for one free rocket jump compared to the Gunboats (220hp-40=180. 200hp-20=180). But the weapon only works if the user has some stable source of healing. Secondary Tool | Gunboats | Mantreads | B.A.S.E. Jumper ------|---|----|---- Rocket launcher | Due to the stable clip size of the Rocket Launcher, the Gunboats allow for far more self-movement without coming at the cost of too much damage capability. | The Mantreads only pair with the Rocker Launcher in scenarios where the user must destroy multiple high-knockback sources such as sentries. There is not much use otherwise | The B.A.S.E. Jumper works well with the Rocket Launcher in scenarios where being vertical is more likely to be a stable option. Direct Hit | The Gunboats can be used as a method to counter-vent the vulnerability of the Direct Hit, but it does not function as well as using a Banner. Not a prime choice. | The Mantreads can pair well with the Direct Hit in cases where the knockback of enemies or sentries is likely to interfere in your ability to take the enemy down. Pairs best with an Uber to take down nests. | As the Direct Hit is rather weak for bombing, the BASE Jumper does not pair well with it. Though it can be a more stable option as opposed to the Gunboats. Black Box | The Black Box's self-healing can be used as a sort of ""free rocket jump"" fuel when the Gunboats are equipped, as the self-damage taken can be entirely negated by the +20 health from a rocket. But due to the -1 clip size of the Black Box, bombing is far more risky. | The Black Box itself does not function well against sentries, which is the primary place where the Mantreads are useful. And the lower potential for bombing reduces the likeliness of dealing damage with the stomp effect. There is a lack of synergy with this option. | This weapon far more viable than the Gunboats for a Black Box soldier. The self-healing of the Black Box allows for the user to counter-vent the rocket jump cost, while the ability to stain in air can be used to countervent the -1 clip size for bombing. Liberty Launcher | The Gunboats can make you take nearly no damage when paired up with the Liberty Launcher, thus granting an extremely large amount of movement capabilities. | The Mantread's stomp feature can be more viable due to the better rocket jumping capabilities of the Liberty Launcher. There is not much else synergy otherwise. | The Base Jumper reduces the requirement to jump as much, but due to the reduced self-damage of the Liberty Launcher, the Base Jumper's upside is not quite as applicable. Cow Mangler 5K | The Cow Mangler's slower reload makes bombing more risky with the Gunboats, as you are more likely to be vulnerable after you rocket jump. | As you are far less likely to be rocket jumping or taking down sentries, the Mantreads have no synergy with the Cow Mangler. | The ability to remain in air with the BASE Jumper can be used to counter the Cow Mangler's slower first reload speed, thus allowing for more stable bombing with the weapon. Beggar's Bazooka | The Gunboats pair extremely well with the Beggars as the bottomless-clip feature along the multi-rocket feature allow for the user to make massively long chain jumps before healing. Which in turn also makes bombing with the Beggars even more powerful. | The Mantreads could be used to allow a Beggars Soldier to get close enough to a sentry to fire multiple rockets at it. Otherwise, not much synergy. | The BASE Jumper can allow for a Beggars Soldier to provide constant damage from the air, as opposed to in burst as the Gunboats would allow. It is a stable alternative if a map has more aerial space as opposed to traverse space. Air Strike | The Gunboats allow for the user to rocket jump more often, thus allowing for more bombing chances with the Air Strike's bonus attack speed. | The Mantreads have no noticeable synergy with the Air Strike aside from the anti-sentry bombing feature. | The Base Jumper allows for an Air Strike Soldier to not have to jump as often, and allows for a larger window of time for the Air Strike to accurately take down enemies. This can be a more viable alternative to the Gunboats. **Overall** | The Gunboats pairs well with hit and run scenarios, where you want to jump in, get damage done, and jump out. Also useful for cycling through map health packs. | The Mantreads serve little purpose outside of allowing a larger window of aiming against sentries. It is worth nothing that the Knockback resistance of this weapon does not apply to Airblast. | The Base Jumper is primarily useful in scenarios where you need more vertical movement as opposed to traverse movement. The time in air can also be used to allow for recovery of ammo expedited from a rocket jump, or for shooting down (which is always desirable as a Soldier). This weapon can also be used to negate fall damage if used correctly. The chart does not include the Rocket Jumper for obvious reasons. Neither does it include the Panic Attack, as that weapon seems to still have identity issues regarding it's role. If any data here is incorrect, please inform me and I will change the post accordingly. Please note that this is in no way specifically telling users to use any loadout above the other, the chart is simply here to provide some more insight into the synergy between different weapons. Always use what works best in a situation, even if it goes against what design sense would imply. Edit 1: I've split the one chart into three different charts to make reading easier.

327,vulnerability,tf2,When will Valve realize that most Pyro unlocks are grossly overpowered?,0,3fbtuw,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3fbtuw/when_will_valve_realize_that_most_pyro_unlocks/,2015-08-01 05:42:08,"Normally, I am not at all annoyed by Pyros. I am a Heavy main, after all. Even when I am playing Soldier and Spy, and am dominated by a skilled Pyro, I can normally accept that in large part I have a lot to learn as those classes. But every so often, there comes along a reminder of how grossly (yes, I mean grossly) overpowered Pyro's unlocks are. All of this needs to be said. # Degreaser I almost don't need to talk about this. These days, everyone knows that this is the best flamethrower. A ridiculous 65% faster weapon switch allows for deadly combos with the secondary and melee weapons. It doesn't help that Pyro's other unlocks give bonuses against burning players  which is also ridiculous, since anyone a Pyro is fighting except other Pyros will be burning. Stock simply cannot compare to the Degreaser; it is leaps and bounds ahead, and it is grossly overpowered. This weapon needs a much slower weapon switch bonus, say, only 20-30%, and needs a severe damage penalty, such as 25%. (As a matter of fact, due to the 10% damage bonus given to all flamethrowers in the Pyromania update, this weapon's damage is the same as the old Stock.) # Flare Gun There's a post somewhere on this subreddit showing an email exchange where the Flare Gun critting burning players was suggested. The reason it was considered balanced was that ""there are lots of counters to afterburn now"", with the introduction of airblast. The problem is that those counters won't save you if the Pyro is at close range. And at long range, it is infinitely more effective than the Shotgun, since it suffers no damage falloff. The Flare Gun and Wrap Assassin are the only ranged weapons that can deal random critical hits and crit through a particular situation. Have I ever been killed by a random crit from either? Probably not. But it breaks with the general rule of crits. Weapons with a means of scoring crits through the user's skill should not have random critical hits. Since a skilled Pyro can flare crit other Pyros, it is leaps and bounds ahead of the Shotgun and is grossly overpowered. Crits against burning players should be removed from this weapon. # Detonator / Scorch Shot One of Pyro's biggest weaknesses is his lack of mobility. A weapon that allows him to counter this is grossly overpowered. # Reserve Shooter For the Soldier, the Reserve Shooter is a completely fair and balanced weapon. Having executed several combos recently where I bounced people into the air and Shotgunned them before they landed, I considered using the Reserve Shooter, but decided that I liked having 6 shots too much, and I couldn't force people into the air reliably. It's a difficult choice versus stock. That last reason is why the Reserve Shooter is grossly overpowered for Pyro. The Soldier requires skill and practice to force people into the air. All the Pyro has to do is right-click. ""Airborne"" doesn't even have to have a specific cause; no weapon should deal 60 damage at long range just because the target jumped. Steam Workshop guidelines state that items must match the personality of the character. The Reserve Shooter does not at all match Pyro's personality; the star on its side and military colouring make it an all-American gun suited only to the Soldier. There is no fix for this weapon other than not to allow Pyro to use it. # Axtinguisher A 50% damage penalty versus non-burning players is not a downside at all when everyone a Pyro is fighting will be burning. This weapon is grossly overpowered, dealing 88 or 195 damage just because the Pyro clicked and pressed 3. It needs a 50% damage penalty versus all players. # Third Degree Stock weapons should always be the best choice. The Third Degree is a direct upgrade to the Fire Axe, and is therefore overpowered. While I am very pleased with the Gun Mettle Update's nerf of the Powerjack, I saved the worst for last, the weapon I hate with every fibre of my being, the most overpowered weapon in the game now that the Dead Ringer has been nerfed: # Phlogistinator The other day, my team was making a push on pl_goldrush, stage B, point 2. I was playing Heavy and arrived on the tail end of the push; I saw my team fighting near the cart, which was very close to cap. They were doing well, and I knew the win would be in the bag once I came to their aid. I was on the ground just in front of the archway in the middle of [this picture](URL when I saw a Pyro taunting with the Phlogistinator in the window just above me. I was admittedly not at full health, about 200, having had to fight off an enemy before arriving. Even so, I spun up straight away and kept firing at him non-stop, but he still killed me and everyone on the cart, and we lost the round. If that Pyro had been using any other flamethrower, I would surely have killed him, and my team would have won. What spectacular skill was required for him to gain team-wiping flamethrower crits? He had to deal 225 points of fire damage. This is **ridiculously little damage**. You could kill two Snipers, or you could kill a Soldier and hit someone with a flare, or you can just sit at a safe distance and spam flares. And what did he give up compared to Stock to get this wonderful weapon? The Phlogistinator has no random critical hits. Once you get beyond the W+M1 stage, random flamethrower crits are not useful. The Phlogistinator has no airblast. Although this is a significant loss to the weapon, the positives far, far more than make up for it. I haven't actually said it yet: **the Phlogistinator taunt restores the Pyro to full health and gives him crits for 10 seconds**. Those are some huge positives. So what kind of detriment to this weapon is there to actually reduce its power during the crits? A 10% damage penalty! That's it! Compare some other buff weapons. The Buff Banner gives only mini-crits, and its meter requires a significant 600 damage to fill. Crit-a-Cola gives the Scout mini-crits, but he has a 10% damage vulnerability, and it deprives him of the Pistol. That's fair. The Buffalo Steak Sandvich causes the Heavy to deal only mini-crits, and gives him a 25% damage vulnerability while doing so  and he is restricted only to melee weapons! But the Pyro is restored to full health, he gets full crits with his primary weapon, and not a trace of vulnerability! The Phlogistinator is grossly, ridiculously overpowered. I am having trouble expressing how angry I am that it exists in written words. I would mark the Pyro for death during the buff, give the weapon a 30% damage penalty and a 50% afterburn damage penalty, and possibly remove the health refill. **TL;DR** Stock Pyro is fair and balanced, but his unlocks are not."
328,vulnerability,tf2,Idea for Razorback and Danger Shield nerf,0,3fhnge,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3fhnge/idea_for_razorback_and_danger_shield_nerf/,2015-08-02 17:26:13,"I've recently read a post that discussed why the Darwin's Danger Shield and Razorback are unbalanced and it's because they protect against the sniper's main counters, the sniper and the spy. I have an idea that will possibly balance these two weapons out. Razorback stats: (+) protects against a single backstab (-) -25% damage vulnerability against bullets This downgrade will teach spies to, instead of drive their knives against the razorback, draw their revolvers and shoot the sniper in the back. Darwin's Danger Shield stats: (+) enables the sniper to survive a single uncharged sniper rifle headshot (-) all health picked up returns as ammo (-) -75% heal rate from healers If the sniper does survive the uncharged headshot, he will not be able to pick up health kits as they will only return back to ammo. He will have to run back to his resupply closet or call a medic, who also heals him for less health per second, thus keeping him out of action for a longer period of time."

I'm not sure if people just don't understand that valve doesn't intend for the boost on the baby face's blaster to be something permanent. If someone can hit a scout going at the speed of sound, it is only fair that they are slowed down. And all you are sacrificing with no boost is 10% less movement speed, and 2 less shots. You can just go at the speed of sound again with one meatshot. Also, with the pretty boy's pocket pistol, ALL YOU ARE SACRIFICING IS 25% LESS FIRING SPEED, and 20% damage vulnerability while it is active. I could understand if it was 20% damage vulnerability even when the weapon isn't active, but seriously?

Sadly I havent learnt C++ yet so i cant make the mod yet. But I'll like to share with you the ideas i have, and get some feedback. Not all weapons have changes, you can discuss this. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Scout** ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Primaries** Scattergun --&gt; Remains the same Force-A-Nature --&gt; Attacking with the gun wont have any knockback, but using the secondary attack your shot will have the regular knockback at the expense of both loaded shells (no more messed up movement while shooting airborne). Shortstop --&gt; Changed reload speed from 1.52 seconds to 1 second Baby Face's Blaster --&gt; Changed required damage to fill 100% the boost from 99 damage to 300 damage. On air jump : -33% boost. No boost lost when hit. Back Scatter --&gt; -10% damage on players hit on the front. +25% damage on players hit in the back at any range. No minicrits from behind. No ammo clip penalty. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Secondaries** Pistol --&gt; Remains the same Winger --&gt; Remains the same Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol --&gt; Increased health on hit from 3 to 5. Removed 20% damage vulnerability. Reload time changed from 1.25s to 1.75s. Flying Guillotine --&gt; Changed recharge time from 6s to 10s. +75% damage on marked for death targets and in Long distance hits. No longer crits stunned players. Bonk --&gt; Remains the same Crit-a-Cola --&gt; No longers gives minicrits, instead it provides a +25% damage buff. Weapon will still shine so you can tell the scout is under those effects. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Melees** Bat --&gt; Remains the same Sandman --&gt; No longer stuns the target. Intead it marks it for death. The amount of time the target gets marked depends on how long the ball travelled. Escaling from 1 second in point blank to 12 seconds if the victim is hit with the ball being the maximum amount of time posible in the air without it being a moonshot. If a moonshot is aquired, the target will be marked for death for 20 seconds. Candy Cane --&gt; Drops a small medkit when hitting an enemy with it. Still drops another one when getting a kill with any other gun (So a kill with the cane will drop 2 kits). -20% Firing speed. Boston Basher --&gt; Remains the same Sun-On-A-Stick --&gt; Ignites the enemy on hit, the afterburn will deal 40 damage as time goes by. Minicrits Burning targets. -45% firing speed. -50% damage on non-burning targets. Fan'O'War --&gt; Remains the same Wrap assasin --&gt; Has 3 balls loaded instead of 1. +150% recharge delay.

From 1.04 seconds to 1.404 seconds) Air Strike --&gt; Changed Damage penalty from -15% to -20%. Changed Explosion radius penalty from -10% to -15%. Uses normal projectile models. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Secondaries** Shotgun --&gt; Remains the same Reserve Shooter --&gt; No longer minicrits airborne targets. +40% faster weapon switch. -50% clip size. Buff Banner --&gt; Remains the same Concheror --&gt; Health leech lasts 10 seconds instead of 8. Speed boost only lasts for the first 5 seconds. Battalions backup --&gt; Remains the same Mantreads --&gt; Negates Fall damage. -25% Damage taken from Rocket Jumps.

No longer increases the bullet spread as health decreases. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Melees** Shovel --&gt; Remains the same Equalizer --&gt; Now affects all of the soldiers weapons instead of just melee. At full health all soldier weapons deal 5% less damage. At 1 Hp all soldier weapons deal 15% more damage. Damage ranges depending on health. At 150 Health you would have no damage bonus/penalty.

Market Gardener --&gt; +20% Damage vulnerability while weapon is deployed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Pyro** ------------------------------------------------------------------------- +10% Speed bonus. +25 HP. Airblast no longer stuns airblasted targets. Airblast push force reduced significantly (-66% force) on players. No change on airblasted proyectiles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Primaries** Flamethrower --&gt; Remains the same BackBurner --&gt; +50% Airblast push force (-16% because the previous -66% is applied to everything) Degreaser --&gt; Increased damage penalty from -10% to -30%. Increased Afterburn penalty from -25% to -66% (20 damage, 2 per second). Airblast cost increased from 20 Ammo to 25. Phlogistinator --&gt; Changed 8s of crits after MMPH to 16 seconds of Minicrits. Can airblast at the cost of 75 ammo. Damage required to fill the MMPH cant be done by flares. ------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Secondaries** Shotgun --&gt; Remains the same Reserve Shooter --&gt; Can't be used by pyro Flare gun --&gt; -20% reload speed. Detonator --&gt; Remains the same. Manmelter --&gt; Extinguishing gives 2 crits instead of one. Has ammo (16). Scorch Shot --&gt; Increased damage penalty from -35% to -45%.

Effective hit points are modified by resistances and weaknesses. A couple of notes: * If you have a 20% damage vulnerability, that means you take 100+20=120% normal damage, or 1.2x normal damage. * If you have a 20% damage resistance, that means you take 100-20=80% normal damage, or .8x normal damage. * If there are multiple damage modifiers, they are multiplied together. If you have a 20% damage vulnerability and a 25% damage vulnerability (Scout w/PBPP &amp; Candy Cane), then you take (100+20)%*(100+25)%=1.2*1.5=1.5x damage. * I only calculated effects that are self-applied. Battalion's is only for soldier and Vaccinator is only for medic. * I didn't calculate minicrits since they ignore falloff. * The Buffalo Steak Sandvich actually gives you only 10% damage vulnerability, same as the Crit-a-Cola. The 25% on the tooltip is wrong. * I didn't feel like calculating EHP for all 5 levels of eyelander head count, so there is only 0 heads and 4 heads. * Graphs are on the last page. * Demoknights are freaking OP. They have as much health as a heavy vs. Blast and Fire damage. * I still don't know how crits or crit resistance works. Anyway, enjoy the data overload. **EDIT**: Remembered that Demoman can equip Pain Train. Man, he has so many things that alter his health or give him resistances... Also made a min/max plot."

It's a weapon I initially grew to hate as Heavy, but then discovered I hate it on every class. It's not just slow fat fuck Heavy who's susceptible to this, but everyone. Why Valve decided to give a weapon that provides a safe, ranged knockback to the class with the best damage output in the game coupled with his severe vulnerability to close quarters fights...? That's beyond me. Still, I'm in a drastic minority here. Everyone on this subreddit will complain about the Loch n Load. Furthermore, a lot of the time some of the most loathed weapons are very difficult to use. People who hate demoknights for example must surely be able to admit there is a degree of timing to master with Demoknight, and those who hate the Beggar's Bazooka must confess it requires a degree of gamesense, prediction and proper ammo management to get the most out of. So I know many people have in the past told me ""stfu dun bitch about that weapon, it's one of the few weapons in the game that demand some degree of skill to use!"" Maybe they're right! There's timing to it, right? Maybe it's time for me to put my money where my mouth is and try it out. ***15 minutes later...*** In one life: 71 points, 45 kills, 6 dominations (8 total, but 6 in one life; only 5-6 deaths total) 17 assists, and 10,338 damage dealt. If you were to judge my experience with classes based on my all-time bests, Demo is now my third best class, all because of this weapon. I broke every record I had as Demoman, and it legit took less than half an hour. Very few stickies were used or neccesary; of my 45 kills, 38 were with loose cannon. (happened to have a killstreak for it, so that's how I know) **This.** **Shit.** **Is.** **Broken.** I must admit I was ignorant of it's mechanics and thought double donks required proper timing with the charge shot mechanic, but no, that mechanic is more about control over when the cannonball explodes, with double donks resulting more from proper distance+charge used when firing the shot. I ended up just spamming uncharged shots from a decent distance and the donks came naturally. The closer targets wouldn't get donked, but would undoubtedly die as the knockback effect had them stuck bouncing in place as easy prey for me. What I quickly found though was that the hitbox for the stupid cannonball is stupidly large. I think most people must think it might be hard to use because for many people, aiming pills as demoman is difficult. The cannonballs however are....really odd. What might look like a clear miss to you might still be close enough that the cannonball automatically blows itself up. This also means the knockback effect is more frequent. The saddest (or most hilarious) part had to be a Pyro who was very much capable of reflecting. He reflected multiple rockets, sentry rockets and indeed some of my cannonballs....and yet he was helpless versus this thing. I dunno if I just fired too frequently or what, but he couldn't get these things. He'd get one, but somehow I found them insanely easy to dodge once reflected (seemed slow), it didn't seem like they became crits at all (looked like normal cannonballs) and at worst I kept firing at him after taking 37 damage or so. A single cannonball hit on him usually meant he took 67 damage from the impact, then another 30 or so from the explosion, which always seemed to happen close by. The result was always that he'd end up trying to run away, which half the time he couldn't because I was fully in control of where he was going. The definitive knockback/reflect class could do nothing versus this thing. And moreover, groups. I think what makes this thing so stupid is....with a typical grenade launcher, if you hit one guy in a group of guys, then holy moly everyone's gonna take like 100 damage! Sweet right? But the cannonball does less damage, so surely it falls behind here! NOPE. Again I don't know what exactly the mechanics are at works here, but it felt like any time I shot someone in a group, a double donk was practically guarenteed. A double donk means you hit just as hard as the grenade launcher (if not harder), and more importantly, nobody effected by it is going ANYWHERE. They're gonna bounce, so your next incoming shot is gonna hit them right in the mouth, finish them off, and everyone nearby is gonna die or take severe damage. The only possible ""no it's k it's balanced"" counter-point I can offer to this is that I just grabbed the nearest server to test it, which happened to be Turbine. No, I didn't go through those tunnel-vision vents cause results would be obvious there, but it's still a relatively closed-in map. Not the worst in that regard, but it's not exactly open-ended like Badlands for example. Still, I hardly consider that an issue, because if you find yourself in a situation where you don't feel you can land shots with it (which is again, easier than expected cause the hitboxes on those damned things are insane)....you're a demoman. You have a sticky launcher. It's not as though you're helpless; hell, a lot of experienced demomen just spam the sticky launcher and rarely ever touch their primary. You think the grenade launcher is the main damage source? Hell no, if anything, trading it for the Loose Cannon just means you have insane damage output (sticky launcher) alongside a utility weapon (knockback from Loose Cannon) that still does really heavy damage on direct hits. (67 from impact on average, and then often this results in the target being hit by a 30 damage explosion aswell) So I challenge you r/tf2, to explain to me how on earth this weapon is considered balanced, and if you've never tried it? I urge you to equip it and give it a shot, just to see how you *really* feel about it. Me? I personally just got within ~18 kills of my all-time record for most kills in a single life, and *the round ended before I died.* So yeah, I gotta say I feel dirty. I feel like this thing is such easymode it puts all the other easymode weapons to shame. And yet, I'm tempted to buy a strange version of it and just spam the living daylights out of it until the damned thing catches on enough that people are calling for a Loose Cannon nerf, and the outcry is too large for Valve to ignore."
339,vulnerability,tf2,Scout DM Tips &amp; Clarification?,4,3brkk6,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3brkk6/scout_dm_tips_clarification/,2015-07-02 02:05:44,"Apologies if this has been covered before, I wanted to get some specific questions answered and get some other advice if possible. Any help is appreciated. &amp;nbsp; ## (1) Aiming with WASD instead of/more than the mouse Using strafing for aiming. Is this something that is used as a 'crutch' (for lack of a better term) by, or against lower level TF2 players or is it something Scout players in higher competitive divisions also use? I'm probably overthinking this, but... wouldn't doing this (especially combining this with mirroring your opponent's movement) make you extremely predictable to your opponents? First time I tried this for a bit I didn't notice any increased accuracy or comfort from normal mouse aim. Although after hearing Clockwork recommend it in a [tutorial](URL I started wondering if I just wasn't doing it right. (About the vid, is Clockwork recommending it as something every scout should try or is he advising people with bad mouse aim to give it a go? Because my mouse/twitch aim isn't godly or anything FYI.) I seem to find it more comfortable to stutterstep/dodge a lot randomly while using my mouse for most of my aiming. &amp;nbsp; ## (2) Spamming double jumps Is there a reason not to do this? You can usually find instances of more experienced players advising newer ones not to jump needlessly when playing most classes since it momentarily makes your movement extremely predictable (I found this out the hard way early on trying to dodge good Snipers by jumping). The Scout, with his ability to change direction in mid-air and (unless I'm mistaken) the ability to do a bit more airstrafing due to extra height gain, is an exception to the 'don't jump spam' rule right? I find double jump spam handiest when fighting Soldiers, combined with actually trying to predict where their rockets will go of course. I haven't really mastered/completely fail at predicting exactly where they'll shoot by looking at their player model, all I can (sometimes) get is the general direction and a vague idea of where the rocket will go (on the ground, directly at me, etc.) &amp;nbsp; ## (3) Hitboxes How many of you guys actively try and [compensate](URL (link from a Sniper guide, may apply to other classes to a lesser extent) for hitbox lag for hitscan weapons like the scattergun? Is it something you never think about when playing on less than 80 ping? Also for some reason when playing on 200+ ping server my hitscan aim actually seems *better* due to what I'm assuming is lag compensation. With lag comp do you only really need to worry about hitbox/model discrepancies when playing Sniper or Ambassador Spy? Also about tweaking net settings, is there a reason for me to set cl_smooth to anything other than 0 when playing on less than 80 ping? (I have it off all the time... ) &amp;nbsp; ## (4) Difference in Scattergun and Pistol accuracy? The firing interval being larger for the scattergun might be the cause of this. I find it oddly easier to hit the vast majority of my pistol shots compared to the scattergun and I'm not sure why. Also while I completely miss less often, I find I sometimes do single-sigit damage with the scattergun even closer than medium range. Is it because only some of my pellets are hitting because I'm not aiming dead center at my opponents? The hitbox issue may contribute somewhat to this. With my scattergun I use a single button tap when I line up a shot. With my pistol I hold down the fire button while tracking. Is it more effective to do the same with the scattergun as well? I do the single tap mostly out of habit and partly due to the greater firing interval and slower reload punishing spamming and missing more than the pistol does. &amp;nbsp; ## (5) Loadouts I started using full stock a while back. Melee I practically never use in a fight unless I can sneak up on a Fists Of Steel Heavy or something, so I tend to use Boston Basher, Atomizer or much more rarely the Fan O' War for the utilities they provide. I occasionally switch out the pistol for Bonk which can be a must sometimes (spawncamping, excessive spam or sentries blocking an open control point, etc.). I used Soda Popper when starting out and got fairly good with the Force A' Nature on 5CP maps later on. After using stock for a while I kinda suck with them now. Mind you I'm not saying they're worse, I just feel less effective with them now and it's hard to say if I've actually improved overall after I stopped using them, but I certainly feel more comfortable with stock now, is this a good thing? Things that I haven't tried out much but pique my interest are: &amp;nbsp; * The Shortstop - Does the increased effective range and better damage than the pistol (plus increased healing combined with mad milk) and increased rocket surf ability allow for 'safer' combat? Can this make make you more effective? &amp;nbsp; * Mad Milk - Heh... heh... I get it... It's like Jarate! Man Mi- *gets bitch slapped* &amp;nbsp; * Baby Face's Blaster (Extra Long Section. Skip first paragraph to avoid ramble.) - First a sorta but not really touching and ultimately pointless caffeine-high induced anecdote: I got this weapon a while back shortly before playing an MGE match. I didn't even look at the stats and just wanted to screw around a bit with my newfound weap. I was losing badly to FaN Scout on the Granary mid arena and had pretty much called 'gg' after I lost twice and was lagging behind 4-12 on our third match. Thing is the guy was pretty supportive before despite curb-stomping me. After I pulled out this thing though... there it began... an odd silence. It felt... odd... I moved slower, and the only other differences I noticed were 2 less shots in my clip and a ""Boost"" bar. 'Okay' I thought, 'It's not like this game can have *another* weapon as pointless as the Sun On A Stick'. So I perservered and noticed something, the bar went up as I did damage, and as it did to my shock I noticed something else. I, a Scout was moving *faster* than normal. 'Ah, so this has a Crit-A-Cola like effect! Awesome!' I ignorantly mused. Then I saw with my eyes going slowly going bloodshot in excitement that 'the bar'... was at 50%. *No...* *No* *way...* *Could* *Gaben* *have truly created this? Could even his mad genius have created this beautiful abomination? Everything was a blur. I felt *everything*. I *knew* *everything*. The FaN Scout had fired over half his entire reserve... And missed every shot. Then he died. Once. Then twice. Then thrice. He was on his mic now, his words were a semi-coherent explosion of *righteous* outrage as seemed to put in more and more effort to up his game by the second. I struggled hard, harder than I had ever before to understand micspam. I managed to make out a word he kept repeating, a madman's desperate mantra: OP. Then it hit me: *I'm* *not* *a* *Scout.* *The* *Scout* *is* *dead.* *The* *Scout* *is* *history.* *A* *relic* *of* *a* *bygone* *era*, *soon* *to* *fade* *from* *memory.* *'I',* *am* *the* *GODDAMNED* *FLASH!* Then I took a double meatshot to the face. And proceeded to repeate my method of demise until I lost the match. My opponent's last words were: ""TAKE THAT PEOPLE WHO USE OP WEAPONS!"". I Googled ""OP"" later. &amp;nbsp; In all seriousness, stat-wise, this weapon seems like a direct upgrade over stock. I've seen a number of 'God-Like' killing sprees (25+ kills without dying) on pubs I was in. One time it was Loch n' Sticky pocket Demo. Another time it was a Beggar's Bazooka + Concherer pocket Soldier (this one was unexpected since I don't see many people use the Beggars' effectively on pubs). Every single other time (3 from recent memory, 2 more I remember hazily) it was a BFB Scout (for some reason). Granted I see plenty (read: the vast majority) of baby Scouts use this... and still die as easily as always. However whenever someone competent gets a hold of this, *it* *kicks* *ass*. Yet, despite this I find myself not using this much, partly due to air jump spam addiction, partly because it seems to mess with my muscle memory and make me (somehow) *less* effective (I've probably been using stock for too long... ). My main question is, is this allowed in competitive TF2 or will it be allowed in it's current state for 6v6 or Highlander in UGC Asia or Asiafortress (those are the leagues I'm eligible for based on my location). Scout is a class I'm getting more competent at, but mainly I find the class fun and want engage in a more organised form of play with people I know intead of random strangers on lobbies or getting into a stale mate with an enemy team with 12 engineers on pubs. Last I checked this weap was banned in all leagues except CEVO Highlander and ozfortress Highlander if I remember correctly. I'm planning on only putting a lot of hours with stock. It feels silly but I'm worried this thing might give me some bad habits, the same might be said of any unlock but none do something as drastic as altering your movement speed by 40% so yeah... If there's no chance of this getting allowed on the aforementioned leagues I won't bother practicing with this. I'm just worried that if it suddenly becomes allowed again I'll be forced to run this to not be at a serious disadvantage and get curbstomped by someone with more experience using this... &amp;nbsp; * Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol - Does the extra HP (especially with this combined with standard overheal) plus fall damage immunity really make a difference, even when using BFB and trying to conserve boost? * Candy Cane - Can one's dodging ever get good enough that they can reliably dodge the vast majority of explosive spam put out by the average pub player and mostly negate the explosive vulnerability downside? I find the health kits handiest when going against (W+M1) Pyros. Since it drops instantly I can immediately extinguish after burn and regain a bit of health without resorting to Mad Milk after killing Pyros that try ambushing me at close range. * Sandman + Flying Guillotine Combo - *Seems* like a nice source of burst damage... You can replensih the ball instantly by picking (AFAIK only other Sandman Scouts can pick up your ball for ammo and screw you over) it up so you only really have to wait 6 seconds for the cleaver to cool down. But even assuming you can get top notch projectile aim, is it worth it to give up your pistol and 15 HP for around 180 burst damage + bleed damage every 6 seconds as Scout? Especially considering how you can be one-shotted by explosives. You *can* theoretically one shot every class except heavy (not counting overheal) at any range (within reason)... while also having the Scout's speed, dodging and scattergun for CQC. Is this one of those things that sound neat and plausible in theory but turn out to be an impractical gimmick in practice? &amp;nbsp; What are your 2 cents on each Scout unlockable? (Come on now don't be shy, let it all out... ) &amp;nbsp; On a related is anyone out there looking for a sometimes sorta available sparring partner/practice dummy/ego booster/virtual doormat who mainly plays Scout for MGE? &amp;nbsp; Typed this in a hurry, sorry for any formatting or grammatical errors."

343,vulnerability,tf2,RANT: My views on the current nerfs.,0,3c80bd,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3c80bd/rant_my_views_on_the_current_nerfs/,2015-07-06 05:30:42,"Okay, so wow. After waiting close to 200 days, volvo has finally delivered the game an update. Yes, a real actual update. While my opinion on this update is somewhat mixed due to the weapon nerfs and the addition of CS:GO mechanics, there was some great things about this update such as the new maps, the box-trot, and the Heavy buffs along with the Family Business. Anyways, these are just my opinions on the current nerfed weapons. Enforcer (Useless. RoF is still as slow as it was, and still no random crits. I could agree that it needed a nerf as it could two-shot light classes at point blank easily, but this is way too harsh. Now it needs a complete rework. The Damage bonus is still the same +20, and that's the problem. You have to be disguised in order to utilise this bonus, and that is just downright ridiculous. In order for a revolver to do max damage, you need to be no more than 3 meters away from the target. Anything further than that, 18-45 damage. Why not use the Ambassador instead? Or you know, ANY OTHER REVOLVER. As soon as the first shot is fired, your disguise is voided and there goes the damage bonus. The max it'll do is a pitiful 70 while disguised. This was generally very powerful on the pre-nerfed variant, but it sounds pitiful on this current variant as you need to be disguised, and you only get one shot before disguising again which leaves you very vulnerable. Direct downgrade from the stock. Valve was smoking g-smack when they nerfed this.) Vaccinator (This and the Enforcer are the most heavily nerfed and borderline useless now weapons in this update as the alternatives are superior in every way. Combating Hackers is now more difficult than ever. Along with the Heavy buffs, the 20% damage resistance whilst spun up, the extra minigun damage towards sentries, it seems that Valve is encouraging hackers to ruin the game even further. Some would argue that it's viable still, but it really isn't. It's garbage just like the Enforcer. It's a tad bit more useful than the original one from the smissmas 2012 update. That's not really saying much though. That's like saying this piece of shit is a bigger than that piece of shit. This nerf was completely unecessary as it's back to square 1. Either return the pre-nerf stats, or remove it from the game. Pre-nerfwise, this was a good medi gun sidegrade, and filled a good niche. It saved many of an ass.) BFB (Not as badly nerfed as the aforementioned, but it's somewhat usable. Still can be used effectively if you ""pray and spray"" and are good at dodging projectiles. Stay away from skilled Soldiers and Sticky Spamming Demos.) PBPP (The +15 health bonus was the main thing going for it, and the zero fall damage. Now it requires you to be using it in order to protect you from fall damage. Still has the nerfed ROF, and zero crits. Damage Vulnerability is worse than ever now as the 20% now effects all incoming attacks. +3 health per shot is not enough to counter its downsides. It's just a bad version of the Blutsauger. Use the stock Pistol or anything else.) Loch 'n Load (It's main purpose is to ""nuke"" buildings. Still, not as badly nerfed and somewhat viable. Lobbing nades is easier than the stock launcher, and sometimes one-shots Scouts if their health is -25. It's fairly usable. Sidegrade? Maybe.) Spy-cicle (It's not really that good anymore. Removing the afterburn immunity has fucked it entirely, and the fact that it still melts ruins it even further) DR (It can still be used, but it's nowhere near as good as the pre-nerfed variant. Was nerfed pretty hard. Normally a Spy would use his DR on low health. That idea is now gone as he will not survive a thing. While the speed bonus and the ""glitched"" Spy-cicle afterburn protection is useful, you cannot survive a crocket/critky/critnade nor can you survive a backstab/quickscope. It's worse than the original in almost every way. Not too viable, but many Spies will continue using it) Powerjack (This was completely unnecessary. A pitiful +25 health on kill? You've got to be kidding me. Remove the +20 damage from all sources and we'll talk) Gunslinger and Mini Sentry (First we'll talk about the Gunslinger. I thought that 3 Punch crit was pretty useful and did not need to be nerfed at all. I honestly thought it was an official feature that Valve knew about, sadly that is not the case. They removed it. Still, could be worse. As for the Mini, Yes we all know this thing was annoying. That's because you never paid attention to it, and now it's nerfed. Being able to repair it is hot. What's not though is that it builds up to 100 health leaving it very viable when building. To make this worse, they nerfed it's building speed by .5 seconds. It's outclassed by the Jag now) Pomson 6000 (Wasn't really nerfed at all. It's still fairly OP if the user can aim properly. Still shreds through Spies and Medics at mid-range, and to make things worse killing DR Spies is pitifully easy now.) Eureka Effect (Oh dear. They screwed the pooch big time on this one. This nerf was entirely pointless. Why did they have to nerf it? It's shit now. Utter shit like the Enforcer. Use the stock wrench or the new mini sentry replacement, The Jag.) Short Circuit (Hey look! It's 2011 again! Let's go and play Deus Ex: HR! 'Ol shorty here is back at square one, aka, 2011. Useless once again) Black Box (Eh, it's usable I guess. Point blank Solly wars and large groups of enemies, it will easily win. Anything else, eck..) Ullapool Caber (We're all going to miss this thing dearly. It was fun, and it was suicidal. This nerf was completely unnecessary. The whole point of this thing was to insta-kill light classes or injured players whilst risking your life (It drains more than half of your health leaving you highly vulnerable) It's bad now. Really bad.. As I was saying earlier, the nerf was completely unnecessary. Needs a rework or better yet to be unnerfed) Solemn Vow (I guess it's now an excuse to use the stock Bonesaw now, but like the P3000, this wasn't too much of a nerf. It's still usable, and being able to see enemies health is a very good upside) Bushwacka (Was fine how it was. Cover the target in urine, and then beat the said target down with it. Pyro's would decimate you however. Unnecessary nerf.) Detonator (Blatantly outclassed by the new useful Scorch Shot. It's pretty bad now. Use the SC instead) Wrangler (Unnecessary nerf. Still usable, but now you have to be aware of it's annoying downsides) That took a while. These are my opinions, feel free to view them differently or argue about them. A lot of the nerfs have destroyed some of these weapons entirely. Still shocked to see that Valve did not buff the Classic."
344,vulnerability,tf2,[Wall of text] Further balance changes suggestions,0,3ca88r,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3ca88r/wall_of_text_further_balance_changes_suggestions/,2015-07-06 19:06:04,"Now hold your horses. I know it looks like a lot, but i'd appreciate feedback on just a few of those, if you can spare some seconds. I can't expect everybody to be a stats nerd like me and read all of it. I am a videogame developer aspirant, and I value balance a lot, so i get quite focused on fixing issues about unbalanced items. I am the one who suggested valve the BFB change, the snipe stickies on QBL doing more damage, and a bunch of other ideas before the last update (the core idea for panic attack for example, even if that ended up miserably; also no random crits on bushwaka, thank me later) I'd like to present a few changes that would affect the game positively (too bad most people will downvote the entire thread because they disagree with one or two ideas), and if even 2 or 3 ideas will make it into the game, then my job is done. #Scout **Backscatter** * Remove clip size penalty; Give it a 8 clip size (drum barrel yo) * Add 25% damage penalty * Remove accuracy penalty Scout's liberty launcher. Shooting from behind not only negates the damage penalty, but also the slight falloff. Bigger clip making for more forgiving plays. **Atomizer** * 5 HP drained on both doublejumps and triplejumps * -10% jump height on wearer (negated by winger - set synergy) **Sun on a shtick** * Alt fire launches a ball that ignites enemies for 8 seconds * Add ""40% slower swing rate"" **Wrap assassin** * +30% faster ball recharge **Candy cane** * Remove explosive vulnerability; Replace it with bullet vuln * Add -50% max overheal on wearer **Winger** * Increase the damage bonus to 35% * Give it to engineer (there are a few spots i'd love to try with the winger as engie) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #Soldier **Cow mangler** * Remove hidden reload penalty * Remove ""cannot be crit boosted"" attribute * Add ""Shoots special shots whenever it would crit"" and ""No random crits"" (special shots sap, ignite and minicrit ftw) **Air strike** * Increase splash penalty to 25% (10% is irrelevant) * Add 25% faster reload **Reserve shooter** * Increase weapon switch speed to 30%. If panic attack can have 50%, RS can too. This would barely affect the reserve greaser combo (still almost instant) * Make it a shared weapon - Give it to engineer and heavy too (combat engies would love to glitchcrit those jumpy scouts) **Bison** * Projectile can now penetrate payload * Maybe give it to pyro, engie and heavy too **Mantreads** * Pressing space while blast jumping (similar to BASE jumper) will send you downwards at great speed * Landing with big speed will create a splash zone beneath your feet (radius of prenerf stickies) * Wearer never takes fall damage **Equalizer** * Add ""damage resistance scales inversely with health"" (below 25 HP you will have 50% damage resistance from all sources) **Panic Attack** * Allow the PA to hold shots * Remove accuracy penalty scaling with health; Replace it with a penalty that comes in if you hold the shots for more than 2 seconds --------------------------------------------------------- #Pyro **Degreaser** Boy will i get flak for this * Add ""50% knockback penalty"" to degreaser's airblast * Change the item description to ""-34% afterburn penalty"" (last time i checked, 40 was 66% of 60 not 75%) They nerfed axtinguisher and soon will nerf reserve shooter, without realizing that degreaser is the problem in fact... With this change, stock would probably be more useful to deny ubers and such **Manmelter** * Remove reload penalty * Give a proper reload animation like other flareguns * It can now absorb other debuffs like jarate, mad milk, bleed and non-self marks for death too **Axtinguisher** * Remove everything * Add -25% damage penalty * Crits on burning targets * 35% slower swing rate **Volcano fragment** * Penetrates resistances and immunities * Make the initial 52 damage count towards phlog meter Basically, you can ignite targe demos and spycicle spies **Phlog** * Add alt fire that shoots a short circuit arc (consumes 50/225 phlog juice) **Powerjack** * Revert health gain to 75 * Remove damage vulnerability * Add -15 Max HP on wearer (like claid) **Third degree** * Minicrits on healing medics or healed targets * 20% more damage taken from all grodbort weapons --------------------------------------------------------------- #Zemoman **Iron bomber** * Add 25% shorter grenade fuse * 15% slower reload speed **Loch** As happy as i might be that the damage bogus is gone, this weapon isn't fine yet * Remove third grenade; Give it clip-based reload **Scottish resistance** * Remove arm time penalty * Apply the love and war nerf (stickies have max falloff while in airburst mode, leading to 20-50 damage stickies) **Skullcutter** * Add 20% slower weapon switch speed on wearer You know it's an upgrade right now. **Caber** Why valve? You ruined the most fun melee weapon in the history of gaming. * Add ""crits while blast jumping attribute"" * Increase the damage to 100 from 75 * Add ""15% explosive vulnerability on wearer"" **Splendid screen** * Full turning while charging * Remove previous resistances * Add ""30% bullet resistance on wearer"" **Persian persuader** * Replace all metal becomes health with ""-75% ammo from sources"" (health gain stays the same) * Remove 100% faster recharge (put it on eyelander or something) -------------------------------------------- #Heavy **Brass beast** * Lower movespeed penalty to 33% from 66% * Increased knockback resistance while revved up **Family business** * Give it to engineer as well * But not soldier (it might be overpowered on him) **Buffalo steak** * Now heals for 80 HP when eaten (amount can overheal) **Warrior's spirit** * Add ""35% faster lunchbox recharge on wearer"" * Replace the -30 HP attribute with ""15% bullet vulnerability on wearer"" (-30 means 10% vuln to all kinds of damage) **Holiday punch** * Add ""25% faster weapon taunt animation"" (applies to all slots - you will consume lunchbox items 25% faster as well; it just doesn't affect taunts like conga or hi5) **Eviction notice** * Switching TO this weapon causes the wearer to take 30 damage * Remove speed bonus on hit * Alternatively, a faster weapon switch speed on wearer would be good --------------------------------------------------------------------- #Engineer **Engineer class** * Allow engineer to equip pocket pistol (now that 165 HP slingers aren't a danger anymore) and winger **Jag** It's OP now. Superior in almost every way to stock. * Add ""25% damage penalty against buildings"" - now you need 3 hits to remove a sapper (remember the 15% faster swing speed please) * Increase repair penalty to 30% - build and upgrade faster, but your buildings will go down faster as well. A fair trade. * Add ""no random critical hits"" **Southern hospitality** * Replace fire vulnerability with bullet vulnerability; Engie hard counters pyro, it's hardly a downside **Pomson 6k** * Remove uber/cloak drain mechanic * Can now drain everything else that has a bar: bfb boost, soda popper hype, critacola/bonk, sandman/wrap assassin, mad milk/jarate, all banners, all shields, heatmaker focus, phlog juice, sandvich and other consumables, spycicle * Exceptions: Cloak, uber, sticky charge, huntsman charge, grodbort clips You hate me yet? **Short circuit** * Primary fire can now heal buildings. Consumes 5 metal and restores 5 HP. ----------------------------------------------------- #Medic! **Vaccinator** * Reduce the number of resistances to just 2: melee/bullet and fire/explosive **Vitasaw** * Remove EVERYTHING OH GOD * Add: ""On kill assist *while ubercharged*: +20% uber"" * Add 25% faster uber consumption * Add 10% slower uber build rate **Solemn vow** * -90% damage done (do not harm yo) ------------------------------------------------------------------- #Sniper **Cleaner's carbine** * 20% more accuracy **Bushwaka** Just as ""overpowered'' as skullcutter now. * Remove damage vulnerability * Add 25% damage penalty on non-crit attacks * Revert the fire vulnerability - it made a real difference against flares **Razorback** * Now negates melee crits from behind and reduces their damage by 75% (so a backstab will deal about 60-70 damage instead of 0) * -25% max overheal on wearer (can be quickscoped even if overhealed) **Shashashshaca or whatever** No idea, please leave yours ------------------------------------------------------------------------- #Spy **Enforcer** * Remove free damage bonus mechanic * 25% faster disguise on wearer * 33% faster uncloak on wearer * 25% slower cloak regen on wearer (synergy with mann of honor) "

Because of this, I was expecting some new weapons with the gun mettle update, but was disappointed when there weren't any. For this reason, I was thinking of what new weapons would be neat in the next update, so I came up with the Hit 'n Run Watch. Its stats are: Cloak Type: Speed Responsive + +50% move speed when cloaked + Can make an attack when cloaked, but still reveals, just as with a disguise + +20% weapon switch speed + Almost instant cloak and de-cloak - Reduced cloak when stopped or moving slowly (Like with no charge on Cloak and Dagger) - Ammo crates give -50% metal when cloaked - +30% damage vulnerability The main focus of this watch would be to quickly move through a dangerous area to take out a high-priority target. The speed makes you move slightly faster than the scout, but slightly slower than he would with Crit-a-Cola. The downside is you have to keep moving quickly, or risk being spotted, making it harder to be precise with movements. The 1st attack ability may seem OP, but consider that a backstab would be difficult to get while moving quickly, and slowing down would leave you very vulnerable. Combined with the reduced metal, you'd have to get in and out very fast, with no time to stop, or chain cloak. The weapon switch speed was added in to make getting out of tricky situations easier, but might be OP. An obvious choice for a knife would be the Big Earner, especially with its new speed boost, but would make backstabs even riskier. The Diamondback or L'Etranger would also be useful. So what you you guys think? Would it be a cool watch to use, or would it make the Spy into something he shouldn't be? Would it be to OP or would it need buffs? "

352,vulnerability,tf2,The Heavy Variation Situation,26,39sjpm,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/39sjpm/the_heavy_variation_situation/,2015-06-14 20:00:41,"##I added a change to the KGB and redid some of the weapons. As we all know, The Heavy is extremely bland when it comes to Variation in TF2. Almost all Heavies run Stock/Sandvich/GRU or FoS, with almost nothing else. This is not necessarily a terrible thing, it just doesn't give the Heavy options like the rest of the classes. The alternatives to aforementioned weapons are considerably worse and don't allow for better alternative play styles. Let's go through each of them and see how we could fix that. *** #Natascha Natascha is okay in pubs, but in reality it is just a bad weapon that doesn't help the ""Support"" archetype it is supposed to fulfill. Here is my suggestion on how it can be a Support Minigun, but still fit the Heavy. * Bullets destroy in-flight Rockets and Grenades. * +50% maximum primary ammo on wearer. * 60% slower spin up time. I know what most of you are about to say. *""Short Circuit is a terrible gimmick weapon, and you're giving that ability to Heavy? That sounds like a horrible idea!""* Destroying projectiles by just running forward at them is one thing, but aiming at them with a slow huge Minigun is in a different world. It takes so much more skill to do that than the Short Circuit. Also this only destroys Soldier's Rockets, and the Demoman's Pipes and Stickies in mid-air. So it actually doesn't destroy things like the Medic's syringes or the Sniper's Arrow. This new version of Natascha allows for a supportive style Heavy that shoots down Rockets and Grenades to protect your allies. However you lose considerable amounts of offensive ability. *** #Brass Beast The Brass Beast feels like the quintessential defensive Minigun, however it doesn't actually fulfill that purpose. All it does is give you more damage, which honestly does matter against a Heavy v Heavy fight. However, it is negligible against the other classes and all you get is extremely gimped mobility. * -20% damage from explosives and fire while deployed. * +100% maximum primary ammo on wearer. * -50% slower spinup time. * -60% slower move speed while deployed. With this, you swap out the damage bonus with a defensive bonus against fire and explosives while deployed. As another bonus you get 400 bullets in your Minigun, that's a ton of extra ammo! You practically never run out with that much. You fulfill the defensive tank role that the Heavy could lean towards, being able to stand in the front and defend against the heavy artillery. However you still take that heavy mobility penalty. **** #Tomislav How I look at the Tomislav is that it is for the sneaky cunning Heavy that slips behind the back line and takes enemies down when they least expect it. Obviously the current build doesn't really supposed that ideal playstyle, so let's see what can we do. * On Hit: Gain +50% move speed while deployed for 0.5 seconds. * Mini-crit targets when fired at their back from close range. * Silent Killer: No barrel spin sound. * -30% maximum primary ammo on wearer. * 25% less bullets per shot. On this take of the Tomislav, unlike a bunch of other suggestions there isn't a flat movement speed buff when deployed. The only time when you go faster (55.5% compared to 37%) is when you are currently hitting someone with the Tomislav. This movement speed bonus goes away the instant you stop revving up. The mini-crit targets from behind rewards those risk/reward heavy plays when you somehow sneak your big body behind the enemy team. This will catch them off guard and deal serious damage. The downsides are that you only have 140 bullets in your gun, so you run out fast. You also have -25% bullets per shot, normally the heavy shoots 4 bullets each time you shoot with the stock minigun. However with this version of the Tomislav you only shoot 3. This makes it deal -25% less damage ONLY if you would have hit the enemy with all 4 shots. *** #Sandvich The Sandvich is incredibly strong, and there is no reason to use the Shotgun over it. So a small nerf should be put into place. * You take mini-crits while eating. It isn't a huge nerf, you still gain the full amount of health when eating and you can still share it with your medic. However if your positioning is bad, or a scout catches you snacking, you will most likely not make it out alive. I think it is a fair change. *** #Dalokohs Bar The Dalokohs Bar is so terrible and is very negligible in effect. The original purpose for this item was give a slight benefit to solo-heavies that do not have a friendly medic to pocket them. Let's take that same concept, and move it to another direction while keeping the same focus. * Eating the Dalokohs Bar gives you a healing over time effect for the next 30 seconds. It heals you for 5 HP for every 0.5 seconds, which means 300 health will be regained in the full 30 seconds. * Same cooldown as the Sandvich, and shares the same ""Takes Mini-crits while eating"" negative attribute. Now the Dalokohs Bar has a new flavor that helps out combat heavies. It's incredibly strong if you do not have a Medic, as when you are in combat you gain that new heal overtime which helps you stay alive in the midst of battle. However the cooldown and new negative attribute are equal to the Sandvich, and also remember you cannot share. If you are being healed by a Medic, the effect is basically gone because you'll be near or above full health for the duration. *** #Family Business The Family Business has always been kind of a mundane shotgun that isn't really interesting or unique. Sure, it is a decent sidegrade when compared to the shotgun, but it doesn't feel great to use. So here is my suggestion. * On Kill: Gain +40% movement speed for 5 seconds. * -35% clip size. * 25% slower reload speed. If you get a kill with the Family Business, you will move faster than a medic for 5 whole seconds. However to get that kill, you only have two shots. So you better make those two shots count. This works very well with the Killing Gloves of Boxing, as you get a very good boost of speed which allows you to punch your enemies with ease. The movement speed bonus doesn't affect your deployed movement speed, or stacks with GRU or Buffalo Steak. *** #Killing Gloves of Boxing My main goal for melee Heavy items is to make the stock viable. If an unlockable weapon is better than stock in most situations, then it has failed as an item and has become a direct upgrade. This includes the KGB, if the GRU or FOS weren't in the game they would just be using KGB. * On Kill: 5 seconds of 100% critical chance. * On Miss: Mark yourself for death for 5 seconds. Killing Gloves of Boxing now rewards Heavies that are able to hit their melee attacks, but if you miss you take Minicrits for 5 seconds instead of dealing 5 seconds of full crits. Good trade off I say. *** #Gloves of Running Urgently Oh GRU, so many controversial opinions about you. However it is true that you are incredibly strong, so you need to be changed around a bit so you are side grade. * When this weapon is active, gain +30% movement speed. * -50% damage penalty. * +15% vulnerability to explosives and fire on wearer. This version of the GRU makes it so that you aren't marked for death while you have it equipped. But you ALWAYS have a +15% vulnerability to explosives and fire. This means you sacrifice your defensive capabiliteis for extra mobility, which I believe is a fair trade. The damage penalty is also larger, from -25% to -50%. *** #Fists of Steel I think the Fists of Steel is a good and balanced weapon. However when compared to Stock it is still a no brainer to pick it over stock. So a very slight nerf is in order. * -40% damage from ranged sources while active. * 25% longer weapon switch. * +100% damage from melee sources while active. All I changed was that the weapon switch attribute is 25% longer than 20% longer, just means you will need to be more mindful when switching weapons is all. *** #Eviction Notice We all love the Eviction Notice, the ability to punch faster is so fun. But since it doesn't have a decent passive it is pretty much worthless. Let's see what we can do about that. * 65% faster weapon switch. * +50% faster firing speed. * -60% damage penalty. * -30% health from packs and healers on wearer. The weapon switch means a lot for the shotgun heavies, now it is actually a viable alternative to switch to your shotgun rather than revving up your minigun. However to balance that you get -30% health from packs and healers (medics, payload, dispensers). So it might not be a good plan if you intend to get healed a lot. *** #Holiday Punch The Holiday Punch is great, but it is basically a direct upgrade since getting the enemy to laugh basically kills them anyway. * Critical hit forces victim to laugh. * Always critical hit from behind. * On Hit: Force enemies to laugh who are also wearing this item. * -50% damage penalty. * Critical hits do no damage. When you use the Holiday Punch you aren't really fishing for Melee kills, so this should be fine for those who actually use it. "
353,vulnerability,tf2,"""No Random Critical Hits"" - Why It's Used",145,3ay7a8,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/3ay7a8/no_random_critical_hits_why_its_used/,2015-06-24 23:28:12,"I've heard a lot of people joke about Valve fixing OP weapons by giving them ""no random critical hits."" The running joke seems to be that Valve is under the false impression that that's a serious downside to using a weapon. However, under closer examination, it seems that Valve actually usually has very good reasons for removing a weapon's critical hits. Now, there are two types of ""no random critical hits"" weapons: the ones that have situational crits and the ones that don't. Most weapons capable of situational crits, including the Market Gardener, Backburner, Bushwacka, and more, have random critical hits removed, which makes sense. However, most of these weapons have other downsides as well to properly balance them out; the Frontier Justice has a smaller clip size, the Bushwacka comes with greater damage vulnerability, and airblasts cost more with the Backburner. The only exception to this rule is the Market Gardener, since melee crits are incredibly common, and it's both incredibly risky and difficult to take advantage of its situational crits, so no random critical hits already makes it fairly well-balanced. Now, there are three types of weapons that have no critical hits but *don't* have situational crits: melee weapons, the Cow Mangler, and the Enforcer. * Most of the Demo's swords have no random critical hits, because the intention was that you'd use them in conjunction with a shield to get guaranteed critical hits. * The Half-Zatoichi is the one exception to this rule, most likely because it's the only sword that the Soldier can use as well, and the Soldier doesn't have a shield. * The Ullapool Caber has no random critical hits, and I think we all know why. * The Southern Hospitality and Gunslinger don't have random critical hits, which is actually a significant downside for the Engineer, notorious for always getting a lot of random melee crits. However, Valve felt like the S.H. still needed more (I personally don't think it does), and added +20% fire damage vulnerability...for some reason. * The Cow Mangler doesn't randomly crit presumably because its special attack has guaranteed mini-crits, and in a sizable radius. * Finally, the Enforcer doesn't randomly crit. Why? Well, if we look at the critical damage for the other revolvers, we can see that none of them are capable of doing more than 120 damage in a single shot, even with critical hits. This is speculative, but it seems that Valve decided when balancing the classes in TF2 that a Spy should be unable to use his primary to one-shot any full-health class (randomly or otherwise), probably to discourage players from trying to play Spy like the Sniper. And, indeed, the same is true of both the Diamondback and the Ambassador; both require at least two shots to kill a full-health light class, even with guaranteed critical hits. I'd like to close off the topic of random critical hits by examining two melee weapons with situational crits that can ALSO get random crits: the Sun-on-a-Stick and the Killing Gloves of Boxing. Despite melee having a high random crit rate, both weapons are given a minor DPS reduction but are allowed to randomly crit, because the situations in which these weapons get their situational crits are rare enough to not warrant the removal of random critical hits. This allows both weapons to function as mildly interesting sidegrades to stock melee. _______________________________________________ TL;DR: Valve adds ""no random critical hits"" as a downside to a weapon... 1. ...if it's capable of dealing *situational* crits (unless it's a melee weapon *and* that situation is fairly uncommon, such as with the Sun-on-a-Stick) 2. ...if it's a melee weapon (in which case, ""no random critical hits"" is a significant downside) 3. ...if the random critical hits are capable of randomly one-shotting certain full-health classes that Valve deems inappropriate (the Enforcer)"

Same applies for direct damage, degreaser deals 4.7 on close range while stock deals 6, game converts 4.7 to 5.0. As you can see in terms of damage, Degreaser **almost** doesn't have it's drawbacks. It has a very strong ability while having **Almost non-existant drawbacks** **Powerjack**: This weapon is just extremely OP. You can't prove otherwise, it's impossible. Let's look at it's stats. It gives %15 increased movement speed, gives +75 HP on kills AND CAN RANDOM CRIT, at the cost of %20 bullet vulnerability. This isn't enough to make it balanced. Especially on pubs a decent pyro can go on a killing spree. This weapon also makes Axtinguisher completely useless. Axtinguisher deals 88 damage on minicrits, Powerjack deals 65 but we all know how often melee weapons crit. In my honest view, Degreaser should have %25 decreased afterburn and direct damage and Powerjack shouldn't overheal and ability to random crit should be removed. What are other Pyros thoughts about this? My loadout is Backburner, Reserve Shooter and Backscratcher, I never feel bad while using it, because it's balanced and I like fair fights."

The weapon is good for chain stabbing and spy rampages and provides an alternative damage soaker to the dead ringer (which people mostly use to just walk through chokes) that discourages overuse of the claok. The visual would be a tiny little watch and on each backstab a tiny visual upgrade happens until you have this massive PDA on your wrist."

363,vulnerability,tf2,So let's talk about the airstrike,42,31qxsh,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/31qxsh/so_lets_talk_about_the_airstrike/,2015-04-07 23:55:03,"I believe that the airstrike has so much more potential that it could be reaching, and here's why. I remember I just decided to try it out after the love and war update with the parachute and I found myself very quickly being killed because I couldn't deal damage as fast as my enemy was. So I put it aside and just let it sit in my inventory. However, recently, after becoming a better soldier, I decided to try it out again on hightower, and I had so much fun. There really is nothing quite like shooting it at your feet, flying 20 metres into the air and saying ""What's up motherfuckers? The recent new is you're all fucking dead"". Of course, the initial three rockets is still a challenge to get by but can be done. However, despite this, my happiness is usually short lived as I have to keep running off to grab health packs. This is my problem and is likely the reason why the airstrike is barely used. It just stops being fun and completely breaks the flow of gameplay if you can only make three or four jumps before looking at your health and realising that you're fucked unless your restock. I know it can be used with the gunboats but nothing short of Arrayseven's rocket jumping can get sufficient airtime to let off all 7 rockets. So, to fix this, I propose the following buff; 50 health per kill. It can't be per hit because then it becomes a straight upgrade to the black box. To balance this with a nerf, something like, say, 20% damage vulnerability while in air ought to do it. This would allow people to just keep jumping and shooting without having to run off for health every 40 seconds and, what's more, would reward skillful gameplay. The airstrike may become a more commonly used weapon. So, what'd you say?"
364,vulnerability,tf2,So you want to design a weapon.,68,32w78v,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/32w78v/so_you_want_to_design_a_weapon/,2015-04-17 15:36:35,"With the recent influx of weapon-design threads, I've decided to give a few personal thoughts on the process of creating new items. This might be very scattered, but I hope to cause some discussion or help some of you out. I've done a bit of thinking on this recently, and have been trying to figure out a formula for designing new weapons. However, I have found that you simply can't. Instead, there are a few rules that you can apply every time which I've found helpful. The rules are as follows: &gt; * Keep it simple. * Don't remove counters. * Change the play style. * No stupid downsides. Pretty easy to remember. 4 Rules, 3 words each. Now let's break it down a bit. **Keep It Simple** For this rule, I'll use the Black Box as an example. It's widely regarded as being a great side grade to stock, although a bit annoying sometimes. It's stats are easy to remember and easy to use. &gt; On hit: +15 health -25% clip size Incredibly simple, intuitive, and fun. There are no meters, passive effects, or hidden stats. The reason it's so simple is not just because of the fact that it's only got one buff and one debuff, but also because it rewards you for doing what soldiers do all the time. Doing damage. Even if you didn't know the stats at all, you'd be able to figure out within the first 30 seconds of using it what it does, and you'd be good at using it right away provided you're good at soldier. This weapon gets an A+ on the simplicity scale. Now let's look at a weapon that is decidedly *not* simple. The Air Strike. This is regarded as being a pretty ""meh"" weapon by soldier's standards. It's fun to use, but is almost a straight downgrade if you don't couple it with another item. This alone makes it harder to use than say, The Black Box. It's not even in an item set with the B.A.S.E Jumper, yet it's obviously meant to be used with it. Now let's look at the stats. &gt; Increased attack speed while blast jumping Clip size increases on kill -25% damage penalty -25% clip size -15% explosion radius Look at that slew of negative attributes. It makes the weapon look bad right off, giving you a bad feeling about using it. It also doesn't say how much your clip size increases, or how much faster you fire in the air. This could easily be remedied, but it for some reason wasn't specified. It's definitely not easy to compare to other weapons, and it feels a bit over-balanced. Here's an idea for better stats. &gt; Clip size increases by 1 every kill Rockets fire 50% faster while rocket jumping -30% damage while not rocket jumping It's not perfect, but it's certainly better. At least in my opinion. It's easier to use, understand, and it doesn't seem so watered down and gimmicky. It's not over reliant on it's ability, and it rewards you for proper soldier gameplay. It makes you stronger at doing your job, and weaker at engaging in combat in less than opportune scenarios. You don't even need to couple it with the B.A.S.E jumper as much, since it's still capable of dealing damage on it's own. You can even remove all it's negative attributes by preforming a normal soldier activity! Isn't that much nicer? **Don't Remove Counters.** Just don't do it. It's not fun for anybody. For this rule, we'll look at the Spycicle and the Razorback. Spycicle: &gt; Silent Killer: No attack noise from backstabs On Hit by Fire: Become fireproof for 2 seconds Backstab turns victim to ice Melts in fire, regenerates after 15 seconds Honestly, this one is not fun to use or play against. A good pyro will just spray his flamethrower and catch the spy after the 2 seconds are up, or track him by listening for the sound it makes when his fire hits the spy. All this weapon does is provide a momentary invulnerability to one of spy's main counters. That should never happen. There is a reason why we have counters in this game. If we gave heavy a weapon that made head shots do no damage, snipers would be almost useless against him, and he would have no long-range counters. The spycicle is a horrible example of balancing, and all it does is make the spy worse at being a spy, and pyros worse at being pyros. I'm not even sure what we could do to make this one better. Razorback: &gt; Blocks a single backstab attempt While it does abide by the first rule, it's still a travesty of an item. You're sacrificing Jarate, two SMGs, the Darwin's Danger Shield, and the Cozy Camper, for a single blocked backstab. Why? I understand it's useful in some places, but for all the wrong reasons. A good spy will just shank you or gun you down with his pistol in seconds, and it's useless against any other class. I never use this weapon, and I hate seeing people use it. It makes both the spy and the sniper's jobs a bit more inconvenient, and causes him to become a much larger annoyance to everybody involved. It ruins Your Eternal Reward chainstabs, forces spies into awkward pistol/rifle no scope duels that detract from other combat, and worst of all, makes snipers think they don't have to spy check. If you don't use this item, you get used to turning around or spy checking often. This carries over to every single other class. But this weapon, right here, makes all that both insignificant and laughable. As stated before, a spy will just shank or shoot you, and if you had your SMG or Jarate you might be able to defend yourself from this better. This concludes my Razorback rant. Thank you very much. This is largely the reason why we hate the Targe'n'Charge so much. Pyros should be demoman's counter, but nope, let's make him immune to fire. Soldier is another of demoman's counters. The close-range damage soldier outputs is more than demoman can keep up with. Nope. 40% explosion resistance. So uh... I guess that leaves scout and heavy as his counters? But not any more so than before. See what I mean? This all gets really messy and ruins the flow of gameplay. **Change The Playstyle** This one goes a bit against the other rules, but let me explain. Changing the playstyle does not have to mean making another Persian Persuader. It doesn't have to be a Huntsman to do this. Now, there is nothing wrong with adding subclasses that serve different purposes. These can be the most fun and ridiculous load outs, such as Soda Popper scout or Eureka Effect Ninjaneers. But not every weapon has to or should be this drastic. Instead, give players a reason to use it. If every weapon was just a slight variation on stock, and only changed damage, firing speed, and clip size, there wouldn't be much reason to use one over the other aside from personal preference. Say we didn't get the Sandvich for heavy, and instead got a shotgun that has a larger clip size and does less damage. Oh wait. There's a reason why so many weapons go unused. They're just boring. Plain old stats changes are almost never fun. Give your weapon some personality. Let's take a look at the Detonator. &gt; +25% damage to self Alt-Fire: Detonate flare This is a very fun and useful pyro weapon. If it was just a flare gun with more damage but a slower projectile, it'd be boring and not give much reason for using it over the normal flare gun. Instead, it makes your secondary a great mobility tool, and a way to dish out some damage to multiple opponents. **No Stupid Downsides.** Ah yes. The infamous ""+10% bullet damage on wearer"" stat. This is what people, Valve included, like to resort to when they can't think of a good downside for a weapon. It's mostly melee weapons that have it bad, although some others, such as the Pretty Boy's Pocket Pistol, have some pretty weird stats slapped onto them. Let's look at a bad and a good example. The Candy Cane: &gt; On Kill: A small health pack is dropped 25% explosive damage vulnerability on wearer Where'd that second stat come from? Scouts are already a counter to demoman, so this is getting close to breaking the second rule. Plus, it's not like you should be taking explosive damage as a scout regardless. This ends up with it hardly having a downside, but having it be a really sucky one when you are forced into scenarios in which it can be used against you. Also, it's just really random and doesn't make sense. A much better stat would be that the weapon simply does 20% less damage, since it's not really meant to be a weapon of it's own. This would encourage using it properly, as a hit and run tool, not a run-at-3-snipers-holding-left-click weapon The Boston Basher: &gt; On Hit: Bleed for 5 seconds On Miss: Hit yourself. Idiot. This weapon is an example of perfect design and balancing. It's beautiful. It's stats are completely self-contained, un-reliant on outside forces in any way. It's easy to understand, and once again, using it with no previous knowledge of the weapon would not be a problem after 30 seconds of use. It rewards good gameplay and skill, and punishes miss use and bad tactics. The upside is the downside. Simply perfect. **Final Thoughts** So, this concludes it. I hope you took something away from this, and I hope you continue to design good weapons. If you have anything to add, please say so. I know this got a bit ranty at some parts, but with any luck I managed to convey my thoughts on this manner effectively. Thank you for reading, and best of luck in creating weapons that will never be added. "

366,vulnerability,tf2,Shaking up the meta. A crazy idea.,18,2yrdmq,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/2yrdmq/shaking_up_the_meta_a_crazy_idea/,2015-03-12 15:06:56,"Suppose every class's roll was switched to something different just based on the loadout. Let's talk about that. **What the heck is this?** This is an idea I've had about completely changing the current meta for tf2 gameplay, with only using currently existing items and gameplay mechanics. This would take place in a Highlander style match, with one of each class. I will talk about each class individually, and explain how their load outs change their rolls majorly. **Pyro** &gt;Primary: phlogistinator. Secondary: shotgun. Melee: axtinguisher. This one gets changed a lot in my opinion. Pyro goes from a support class to a pocket class. With absolutely no support capability, he is forced to rely on his teammates to help him survive longer. The tradeoff is increased damage, but only at short range. Since he cannot extinguish, others must take this roll. The lack of reflecting means demomen will become a much larger problem for you and your team. **Scout** &gt;Primary: shortstop. Secondary: mad milk. Melee: sun on a stick. If you can't figure it out, scout needs to be near the pyro. The massive crit damage means the scout will want to stick close and then finish off opponents who are running away. The mad milk gives him the ability to put out fire on enemies, and help the pyro get health if his medic dies. His shortstop simply gives him the ability to get extra health, meaning the medic won't have to take his medigun off the pyro for too long if the scout is damage, and that health kits are much more effective if the medic dies. You will also be adding to the point-capping ability of the combo by a lot, making your pyro-scout-medic combo capable of taking points extremely fast. **Medic** &gt;Primary: crusader's crossbow. Medigun: quickfix. Melee: solemn vow. The medic works with the scout in many ways. The quick fix lets the medic pocket the scout to the front lines to let him get back into battle faster. It also means the scout gets healed *hellah* fast. The Solemn Vow means he can spot enemies with low health for the scout to pick off. This also works well with the pyro, since you can tell how much health an enemy has before the combo engages them in combat. The Crusader's Crossbow is only used here because the medic is meant to be more susceptible to close-ranged attacks, since that's where the pyro's action will be at. You can also use it to heal teammates who are further away, since you won't want to stray for long from the pyro and scout. **Engineer** &gt;Primary: Frontier justice. Secondary: Wrangler. Melee: southern hospitality. This one is hard to balance. The Southern Hospitality is chosen only for the vulnerability to fire damage, making being near the combo a very bad idea. This forces engineer to play more defensively. The Frontier Justice seems like a bad idea if this is the goal, but this is mainly to balance the engineer's roll in this type of game. If your sentry goes down, you'll need firepower to clear the area quickly, but you're very bad at running around shotgunning people. The wrangler is good for both the building health and the range. Since your shotgun is weak while your sentry is up most of the time, having extra firepower at any distance doesn't hurt. The defensive bonus of it means that the combo can't as easily run in on an uber and destroy your gear quickly. **Heavy** &gt;Primary: huo long heater. Secondary: family business. Melee: the warrior's sprit. Why? Because. Heavy takes the traditional roll of guarding the engineer away from the pyro, who has already lost it anyway. The fire ring protects the engineer from spies, but means the heavy needs a constant ammo output. The lower health from your gloves means that going out in the open and fighting among the offensive side of your team is ill advised. This creates a symbiotic relationship between the engineer and the heavy. The shotgun is here simply so you don't have to waste as much of the engineer's ammo to defend his nest while he's setting it up Why can't the medic still pocket the heavy, though? You could, but with the pyro being almost useless without being pocketed, it's best that job be left as it is. The quick fix's lower over heal rate combined with the lower health of the heavy's melee makes pocketing this fellow not the best idea. The gloves do have the upside of being great for spy checking, though. They can two-hit spies who are at full health. **Spy** &gt;Primary: diamondback. Knife: spycicle. Watch: stock. Sapper: red tape recorder. Alright spy, your days of trickstabs and ambassador no scopes are over. In this crazy meta, the spy's job is mostly focused on crippling the defense. Seeing as the combo has two of spy's worst enemies, fire and mad milk, you won't want to go near them. Since the red tape recorder takes twice as long to destroy buildings, the engineer has twice as long to fix them. But it severely weakens them at least. Spy's job is very interesting, though. The heavy will almost certainly be sitting spun-up on the dispenser once the nest is complete. Your spycicle is not very useful in this case. Since you can't use it for 15 seconds after getting caught on fire, you would probably want to wait for the heavy to either get severely weakened and have to go for health or die, or wait for the engineer to go off on his own. Then you can go for the nest and attempt to sap everything before attacking the heavy, who you can finish off with 3 crits. It's a big shift in the mindset of a spy, though, since you have both a problem and a goal all in one package, for both the medic and the sentry nest. **Sniper** &gt;Primary: machina. Secondary: cozy camper. Melee: bushwhaka. Yes, it sucks. I know. But it works for doing your job. Your goal as a sniper stays relatively the same, but is a bit more dangerous now. Your spot will be easily revealed once you pull the trigger, and you will die almost instantly to the pyro. You are highly advised to take as few shots as possible, to avoid drawing the attention of either the combo or the demoman. Since you are basically screwed if anybody gets close to you, your job will take place mainly at the back of the maps, away from danger. But aside from that, carry on as normal. **Demoman** &gt;Primary: B.A.S.E jumper. Secondary: quickiebomb launcher. Melee: ullapool caber. Demoman takes the roll as the main jumper. Your job is to keep the spam on the enemy team. The combo is very vulnerable to your attacks, which is something you should take to mind. Your general job though is to try to deal damage to people when they won't see it coming. The caber is there if you get stuck basically. **Soldier** &gt;Primary: direct hit. Secondary: reserve shooter. Melee: pain train. Soldier is meant to be the anti-air cannon in this meta. With demoman being very dangerous to the combo, soldier will want to jump in to defend them when he can, but not stick with them constantly. Your job is mainly to protect the combo when they're trying to cap the point, a time in which they are very constricted movement wise. Aside from that, taking down the sentry nest also falls under your command for the most part. Working with the spy to attack when the sentry is being sapped is one way to take it down, as is getting ubered by the medic and two-shotting it at point blank range. Your job is not as prevalent as it is in the normal meta, but it is still important. **Closing notes** Thank you for reading. This is extremely unfinished, but is a fun idea. Please join in the discussion and give any ideas you have. The point of this is not to reform the meta but to make a new one, and I think it would create some interesting matches. Especially with the limitations provided. Most of the classes are simply weakened to the point where they are forced to try alternative strategies to succeed, but if you think something can be done another way, please say so. Goodbye!"

This is a major drawback if you're even 10 degrees off to the side in your aim, crits will not hit even if they should have. ##Degreaser (Nerf) (-) Airblast reset timer only counts down when the weapon is active All other stats remain the same or (-) Switch speed back to degreaser is 65% slower All other stats remain the same The degreaser has an action-based downside, with a passive-based upside. This is bad game design, and the M2+q+M1+q (AKA stunlock) strategy that exists because of it is a perfectly highlight of the issue. By using any one of the above suggestions, the faults described by /u/Kairu927 in [this comment](URL might be alleviated. ##Phlogistinator (Rework) The Manmelter and Phlogistinator have reversed item properties. Each weapon's abilities would fit better with the other weapon. Ignore any previous stats (+) Reflecting projectiles adds 1 to Mmmph meter (+) Airblasting allies adds 3 to Mmmph meter On taunt: Drains Mmmph meter &amp;gt;Heals (medigun/dispenser fashion) the user and gives mini-crits for &amp;lt;Mmmph #&amp;gt; seconds (-) -10% damage penalty (-) Airblast that do not hit allies or projectiles cost 100% more ammo This weapon would add a different playstyle to the pyro, one that relies on supporting the team (Manmelter style) and reflecting projectiles. From there the weapon is built to still maintain the ""M1"" playstyle of the current phlog. This weapon overall would actually reward skillful play, unlike the current design. Edit: There'd be a limit on how many seconds of mini-crits of course. ## Reserve Shooter (Buff/Nerf/Rework) (Only for pyro) Ignore any previous stats (+) 20% damage against airborne targets (nerf from Mini-criting targets in the air) (-) 10% damage against targets on the ground (+) 30% weapon switch speed The weapon now has the sole design for being for airborne targets without being overtly powerful. Yet with a buff to the switch speed overall so that the weapon can be used with other Primaries aside from the Degreaser. If the 2nd degreaser nerf option was put in place, this weapon would become rather balanced. ##Manmelter (Buff/Rework) The Manmelter and Phlogistinator have reversed item properties. Each weapon's abilities would fit better with the other weapon. Ignore any previous stats (+) Meter fills based on fire damage done (100 for a full meter) On alt-fire with full meter: Crit shot is fired Now the weapon can be on somewhat even terms with the Flare Gun, by filling in a niche of being a more controlled/specified version of the Flare, this weapon would be primarily used against Snipers, or as a last resort (where the Flare Gun would likely crit regardless). It allows for users that do not use the Degreaser to have a weapon that provides them with burst damage. ##Scorch Shot (Buff) (+) 50% more after-burn damage (+) 25% longer afterburn duration All other stats remain the same The Flare Gun deals burst, the Detonator provides mobility, the reworked Manmelter provides burst, the Scorch Shot could be used to fill the role of prolonged damage. ##*~~Axtinguisher (Buff)~~* *~~(+) 120 to 180 degrees of detection for crits on the back of enemies (up from current 90)~~* *~~All other stats remain the same~~* *~~The weapon suffers from the same issue as the Backburner. Too small a redius for such a high risk attack.~~* ##Powerjack (Nerf) The +75 health on kill attribute does not match the weapon. It blurs this weapon's role in the same fashion as the Pre-Split Equalizer. +75 health on kill is an attribute that would be fitting for the Back Scratcher. Ignore any previous stats (+) 15% movement speed when active (-) 20% damage vulnerability when active ##Back Scratcher (Buff) (+) 75 health on kill All other stats remain the same The backscratcher is purely a lone roaming/surviving weapon. The reduction in healing from allies is a major drawback, while the bonus health from health packs is not a large enough bonus. Adding health on kill would be fitting for the specific role of being a damage dealing weapon. RIP DeGroot Keep ##Sharpened Volcano Fragment (Buff) (+) Afterburn deals 100% more damage (+) Afterburn lasts 100% longer All other stats remain the same The weapon's afterburn simply does not deal enough at the moment. At 52 damage per melee hit, with negligible burning, the current weapon is a joke. By bumping up the afterburn to a more serious level, the weapon will serve as a last resort 'you're going down with me' weapon. ##Third Degree (Buff/Nerf) (+) Deals 150% more damage if target has been healed in the last 5 seconds (=) Deals standard damage to players otherwise connected by medibeams (-) Deals -50% if a target hasn't been healed in the last 5 seconds The T.D. now becomes a more specialized, and more powerful version of the old Axtinguisher. Now it can actually serve a functional role if the weapon is needed. Instead of the current state that is practically useless unless you get a random crit. ---- Hopefully this set of buffs and nerfs would help pyro have more actually viable weapon loadouts. Instead of simply being reliant on the current Stun+Crit combo."
368,vulnerability,tf2,Invisbility Uber?,4,30phoh,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/30phoh/invisbility_uber/,2015-03-30 02:54:09,"A lot of medigun suggestions have involved ammo and firing rates, and I've brainstormed 2 ideas recently; **Idea 1:** &gt;25% Less Uber Duration (6 seconds, from 8) &gt;Can Uber at any time, for as long as alt-fire is held &gt;-25% slower healing rate Encourages medics to pop more openly, like the vaccinator, as they can end the uber and start another as soon as they like. This would be worse for pushing nests, but better for taking out individual targets or for shutting off the uber in the event that you accidentally pop on an already-destroyed nest. Probably better in pubs than comp, but I suppose it could work to save the medic over a period of time. **Idea 2:** &gt;You and your heal target gain a speed boost proportional to 10% of your Uber - this is not in effect when you are currently ubered, however (Like the overdose, but with a medigun - so slightly more practical) &gt;+25% Uber Duration &gt;Ubercharge renders you and your heal target invisible for the Uber's duration, with a permanent +25% movement speed. Shooting creates a temporary visibility. No cloak bumping silhouettes, no footstep noises, immediate effect. &gt;25% damage vulnerability while healing a target This one would be for bizarre and surprise strategies and probably not a great deal else - much like Kritz + Widowmaker on maps like cp_process. I can see this being used to quickly get your Engineer, demo, or Heavy behind them and pincer them about a point or choke. The obvious downside is that any carpet-damage class spots you before or bumps into you, they can immediately end your life with an effective +25% damage and then your heal target's as his invisibility ends. There are no immediate downsides to the healing other than the vulnerability, but paired with the Overdose and Amputator, the Medic can escape and heal at the cost of greatly lessened damage output than that of the Saws and Crossbow. The uber itself could be great for subtle strategy, but would not suit most forms of offense, and would benefit from transporting more easily spotted combo-classes behind the defence and surprising them from behind. Thoughts? Balances?"

I feel sort of odd now that I don't have the room to write the reasons for each change here. This is something I've been working on for a while, feel free to discuss each change after reading the entire list. I know that their aren't that many people working on tf2 right now, so even if this is a resounding success I wouldn't see it all getting implemented at once. It's a pretty large list. I would hope that we may agree on a few things that could be implemented. I've tried my best to promote unused weapons and roles, and give a reason for why I have chosen each change in the steam users forum mirror above. **Scout** Baby Face's Blaster - Boost lost from airborne jumps increased from 25% to 40% Fan O'War - Damage reduction removed -40% swing speed Atomizer - -10% movement speed to user You no longer take damage for triple jumping No longer deals less damage No longer has a slower swing speed **Pyro** Afterburn - Critically charged (kritz/banner/phlog) weapons now inflict critical afterburn This means that damage from a criticaly boosted afterburn source will cause afterburn that also deals triple damage This does not affect crit damage from non-boosted weapons (flare gun/random crits/etc...) Air blast - Air-blasting sticky bombs sets their arming time to 0.2s This means that for 0.2s after being air-blasted, the sticky bombs cannot explode Phlogistinator - Afterburn inflicted during Mmmph crits (as stated above) Damage penalty removed Resistance while taunting increased from 75% to 90% Can now get random crits Mmmph charge is reduced by 4% per second that no enemies are inflicted by users afterburn Mmmph cannot be activated if no enemies are inflicted by users afterburn Detonator - Self-damage vulnerability changed to only be in affect while weapon is active Scorch Shot - Now deals mini-critical damage to burning targets No longer has a damage penalty Manmelter - No longer has a faster projectile speed Extinguishing teammate charges no longer grants guaranteed critical hits Extinguishing teammate charges now grant mini-crits against enemy pyro's +50% damage (but still doesn't crit burning targets like the other flareguns) Third Degree - +25% health gained from healer sources (medic medi-gun) -35% health gained from packs **Demoman** Scottish Resistance - Max charge time decreased by 50% Shield Charges - Turning speed increased slightly (except Tide Turner stays the same) You can now jump while charging on the ground (you continue charging) Now grants mini-crits instead of full crits while charging Shield damage on impact increased from 50 to 65 You can now receive charge from ammo boxes You can now alt-fire at any time to end the charge prematurely (without a melee weapon swing) Charge-n-Targe - No longer grants afterburn immunity Resistances removed Grants +35 health Grants +20% melee vulnerability Splendid Screen - Resistances removed Grants +20 health Grants +20% melee vulnerability Tide Turner - Resistances removed Grants +20 health Grants +20% melee vulnerability Half-Zatoichi - Honor-bound ends with assists So if you hit someone with this weapon out and another player kills that enemy, you can switch weapons It's a quality of life change. **Heavy** Natasha - No longer slows enemies hit No longer has a slower firing speed Grants +10% movement speed while not spun-up Spin-up time increased from 30% longer to 50% longer (this affects the time it takes to prepare the mini-gun) Tomislav - 25% faster spin-down time So you now can put the Tomislav down after firing 20% faster Dalokohs Bar - Healing increased from 100 to 350 (full healing) Fists of Steel - No longer has a slower weapon switch speed +35% critical damage vulnerability while active (so fists have slightly less affect against kritz or head shots) Gloves of Running Urgently - Movement speed bonus does not stack with Natasha's movement speed bonus So you will only move at standard GRU speed even if your primary weapon is the Natasha with my above buff Eviction Notice - Damage done increased from -60% to -35% (dps is now similar to fists) **Engineer** Wrangler - Sentry Gun Bullet knock back is now affected by fall-off So firing at enemies out of typical sentry range will have reduced knock back applied to that enemy Dispenser - The metal contained in a newly built dispenser increased from 25 to 40 (the dispenser starts with this much metal) Maximum metal held decreased from 400 to 200 (the dispenser can't store as many packs of metal for you) Teleporter - You can now select to build an entrance when you already have one, same for the exit Building an existing teleporter building destroys the old one, and begins to builds the opposite end in its place **Medic** Vita-Saw - Completely reworked (all current stats removed) On Hit: Enemy deals 50% less damage to you for 2 seconds -30% damage **Sniper** Huntsman - You can now jump while drawn You can now fire while airborne, but doing so fires an inaccurate arrow All inaccurate arrow have slightly better accuracy than the old inaccurate arrows from aiming too long As a reminder inaccurate arrows have no charge, cannot head shot, and have poor accuracy **Spy** All primary weapons - Spread recovery time reduced from 1.25s to 0.95s This is the time it takes for the revolver to ensure that if you have not fired for a short time, the next shot will have perfect accuracy. Big Earner - Cloak gained for back stabs increased from +30% to +100% Kunai - +100% healing from kits **Game Modes** Attack/Defense and Payload - ""Time to Beat"" added to the scoreboard, it displays the other teams time to capture during the last round. The MVP list now displays whether or not the attacking team has won in less time than the ""Time to Beat""."
