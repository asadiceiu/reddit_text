At least I could see on Ledger and Bitcoin subs, that people think, they are safe if they do not download some malware on their pc/laptop. But this is wrong. The issue can be exploited also when you use only standard applications on your Ledger which are affected (BTC and its derivates) The attack vector here is, if some tricks you to interface with the malicious **web wallet** with your Ledger. (so no you do not need to install anything to lose your coins) As an example: 1. the attacker sends you a link for LTC web wallet (he says it is a new really great wallet and want you to try or whatever other reason) 2. you think you are safe, after all, Ledger protects your private keys and everything has to be confirmed. So you connect and will try to send out some LTC to the attacker just as a donation or anything else. 3. The web wallet sends spoofed transaction to your Ledger, so you think you are confirming LTC transfer, instead your BTC is sent out There are many scenarios like this. You are affected anytime you interact with your Ledger and any web service. (not only if you use fake sw wallets) I explicitly asked about it and this attack vector was [confirmed](URL by Ledger.

July 9 (King World News)  Alasdair Macleod: So far, the current economic situation, together with the response by major governments, compares with the run-in to the depression of the 1930s. Yet to come in the repetitious credit cycle is the collapse in financial asset values and a banking crisis. When the scale of the banking crisis is known the scale of monetary inflation involved will become more obvious. But in the politics of it, Trump is being set up as the equivalent of Herbert Hoover, and presumably Joe Biden, if he is well advised, will soon campaign as a latter-day Roosevelt. In Britain, Boris Johnson has already called for a modern new deal, and in his Hundred Days his Chancellor is delivering it. In the thirties, prices fell, only offset by the dollars devaluation in January 1934. This time, monetary inflation knows no limit. The wealth destruction through monetary inflation will be an added burden to contend with compared with the situation ninety years ago. Introduction Boris Johnson recently compared his reconstruction plan with Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal. Such is the myth of FDR and his new deal that even libertarian Boris now invokes them. Unless he is just being political, he shows he knows little about the economic situation that led to the depression. It would not be unusual, even for a libertarian politician. FDR is immensely popular with the inflationists who overwhelmingly wrote the economic history of the depression era. In fact, FDR was not the first something must be done American president, a policy which started with his predecessor, Herbert Hoover. But the story told is that FDR took over from heartless Hoover who had failed to step in and rescue the economy from a free-market catastrophe, by standing back and letting events take their course instead. Nothing is further from the truth: Hoover was an interventionist to his fingertips. The last of the laissez-faire presidents was Calvin Coolidge, Hoovers predecessor. A few years ago, the BBC broadcast a programme extolling the virtues of FDR and his new deal. Stephanie Flanders, at that time the BBCs economics correspondent, reiterated the myth about Hoover being a non-interventionist and FDR having all the correct reflationary policies. In a piece to camera at the Hoover Dam, no less, she recounted how it was an example of FDRs new deal stimulus. While it wasnt completed until 1936, building started in 1931 as a project by the eponymous Hoover, pursuing the same interventionist policies as FDR before FDRs landslide election. It was never FDRs project, the clue being in the dams name. Research by Flanders and the BBC was either biased, deficient, blind or all three. The myth that has even drawn in Boris is so powerful it has intelligent people swearing the earth is flat. The FDR fairy-story is fundamental to the modern states interventionist stance; the very reason for its existence and its welfare commitments to the electorate. Wishful thinking about FDRs pioneering role is now the pervasive theology. But the way the world is viewed cannot change the facts, and to quote FDR and his new deal as the template for economic policy is to repeat the errors that led to the longest and deepest depression in American history. If in a few words one was to sum up why the state fails in its interventionist quest, it would be its inability to understand change. Free markets change all the time. Businesses and whole industries evolve and disappear in a natural process of selection driven by the consumer. The states response to a crisis is always aimed at a return to normality; normality being an unchanged state from before the crisis. The state protects yesterdays jobs and yesterdays businesses. Worse, by preventing evolutionary change at the heart of a dynamic economy it deprives it of the resources required to evolve. And thats why the depression lasted into the Second World War. The back-story to the depression Before Hoover, US presidents understood a hands-off policy would let the economy rapidly fix itself. The post-war 19201921 depression in America was allowed to run its course. It lasted just eighteen months and was the prelude to a period of technological revolution that gave enormous benefits in the quality of life for all Americans. Following President Hardings death in 1923, Coolidge was elected the new president. While Coolidge enforced a strict laissez-faire policy, he was either unaware of or ignored the monetary policies of Benjamin Strong at the Fed, which, to be fair to Coolidge, was only a decade old. The Feds monetary policy was the cause of an inflationary boom which ended in a stockmarket bubble in 1929. In 1927, Coolidge announced he would not be standing for a second term, and Herbert Hoover was elected President in 1928 nearly a year before the stock market crisis occurred. Fuelled by a free market approach and the stimulus of unbacked credit, when Hoover took office in March 1929 the economy was, in the epithet of historians, roaring. We can now begin our comparison with the present day. Boris Johnson became Prime Minister after a similar inflation-fuelled period; but the more important correlation is with Republican Donald Trump, whose interventionist policies imitate Hoovers from his time as Secretary of Commerce in Hardings administration onwards. Hoover deported immigrants and Trump builds a wall, both reasoning they take American jobs. And like Hoover, Trump uses tariffs to protect farmers and businesses from foreign competition deemed unfair. The combination of a massive credit expansion in the 1920s and the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed by congress in October 1929  the month of the Wall Street Crash  serves as a template for the condition of Americas economy today. Apart from some differences in timing, the most significant difference is in the money. Before April 1933 the dollar was freely exchangeable by the public for gold at $20.67 to the ounce; today the dollar is unbacked. Prices were stable, today they rise. By passing the Smoot-Hawley Act at the top of the credit cycle, Congress ensured a sharp downturn in the economic outlook, persuading bankers to call in their loans. The economy began to contract, and interventionist Hoover went to work. To quote from his memoires; the primary question at once arose as to whether the President and the Federal government should undertake to investigate and remedy the evils No President before had ever believed that there was a governmental responsibility in such cases. No matter what the urging on previous occasions, Presidents steadfastly had maintained that the Federal government was apart from such eruptions . . . therefore, we had to pioneer a new field. Hoover called a series of White House conferences with industry leaders and bankers to persuade them to invest and maintain wages in order to keep consumer spending going. Like the neo-Keynesians of today, Hoover believed consumer spending was vital for the economy, but failed to make the connection with production, which is always first in temporal order, and provides the product for consumption without which it cannot happen. Hoovers view on maintaining wages is reflected today in minimum wage rates, which innocuous though they may seem render certain activities uneconomic. As is the case today, the Fed was ready to inflate. According to Murray Rothbard, the Fed was just as ready to try to cure the depression by inflating further. It stepped in immediately to expand credit and bolster shaky financial positions. In an act unprecedented in its history, the Federal Reserve moved in during the week of the crashthe final week of Octoberand in that brief period added almost $300 million to the reserves of the nations banks. During that week, the Federal Reserve doubled its holdings of government securities, adding over $150 million to reserves, and it discounted about $200 million more for member banks. Monetary policy was a doppelganger for the Feds policies today. In todays money, $300 million is about $26bn, using gold as the conversion factor. Todays stimulus is a thousand times greater in real terms  so far. In 1932 Roosevelt won a landslide against Hoover, and as was the custom at the time he took office the following March. Only a week before, an assassination attempt on Roosevelt struck the wrong man who died shortly afterwards. Banks were failing. Farmers were in revolt. The numbers of unemployed were increasing alarmingly. Hoovers reflationary policies had failed, and he was said to be the least popular man in America on inauguration day. Fast-forward eighty-eight years and we see President Trump following in Hoovers footsteps in this election year; and we can be pretty sure Joe Biden  if he is not asleep at the wheel  will cast himself as the new FDR with his version of the new deal. Roosevelt then delivered his inaugural address, which included the famous line, So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. His speech was followed by the Hundred Days, the first time a president had set such a schedule. In Britain, Rishi Sunak, the new Chancellor, is now pursuing his version of a Hundred Days announcing subsidies and new support as the occasion demands, financed by monetary inflation. Admittedly Sunak remains a free marketeer but has yet to prove his measures are temporary. Meanwhile, President Trump is destroying his administrations finances in an attempt to contain the economic fallout from the coronavirus in his election year. They say that repeating a failed action in search of a different outcome is a sign of madness. Hoover and Roosevelt were pioneers of todays failed economic policies and it is their post-war successors who are arguably certifiable. But the problem is deeper than that, with the public voting for the same failed policies, so even an economically literate politician has to deliver solutions in that context. It is what makes history repetitious. Instead of economics, psychological factors drive politics, including the public desire for the state to provide easy solutions to economic and personal difficulties. But the lesson from the Hoover era is that we stand on the precipice of an economic collapse as a result of a combination of excessive credit creation in the years before and the introduction of trade tariffs. And that was before the coronavirus was added to this lethal mix. The psychology suggests that this time the politicians and the monetary authorities will pursue much the same course as before, even more aggressively. So far, the evidence supports this thesis, and it allows us to anticipate mistakes yet to be made. The credit cycle and the banks A notable feature of the Wall Street crash and the onset of the depression were bank failures. Not only had the 24,000 American commercial banks extended unbacked credit throughout the 1920s, but their reserves were to an extent, fictitious. This arose from double counting cheques in the process of clearing, remaining in the cash reserves of the bank upon which it was drawn while being immediately credited to the receiving banks cash reserves. But when the public began to withdraw cash in increasing amounts this false liquidity was exposed. The initial banking panic began in November 1930 in Tennessee when a correspondent network in Nashville collapsed after the Bank of Tennessee closed its doors, forcing over 100 institutions to suspend operations. And as the contraction in bank credit continued, additional correspondent systems imploded. That was only the start of it. The Bank of the United States in New York in December was followed by a new banking crisis in Chicago the following June, this time involving real estate. In 1932 over 2,000 banks closed, and in 1933 a further 4,000.[iii] The banking scene is very different today. Instead of many thousands of small one and two-branch banks the system is dominated by large international behemoths, global systemically important banks  the G-SIBs. They operate under the rules and regulations of the Basel Committee, currently Basel III, administered by national regulators. Aping the crookery of double-counting floating cheques, todays banks game the system, this time aided and abetted by the regulators, who, so long as the forms are correctly filed, are happy to look the other way. Indeed, as their stress tests have shown they would rather gloss over the issue of inadequate capitalisation. The full weakness of the global banking system is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the leverage between total assets on the G-SIB balance sheets and their market capitalisation. The regulators persist in using the relationship between total assets and balance sheet equity instead, despite the market valuing a typical banks equity at considerably less than book value.  Bank equity valuations on 8 July have benefited from the liquidity-driven rally in global stock markets, with Deutsche Banks shares, for example, almost doubling from a low of 4.50 in mid-March. The recovery is not a sign of new-found strength but merely reflects the severe disconnection between rising financial asset values and a collapsing economy, which will almost certainly lead to a substantial adjustment to the detriment of financial asset values. The full weaknesses of the current system are described in a paper on the big UK banks, jointly authored by Dean Buckner and Kevin Dowd. Figure 1 was constructed using the methodology in that paper. It is a strongly recommended read for anyone seeking to understand the severe risks associated with not just the UK banking system, but the G-SIBs in all jurisdictions plus other significant banks not on the G-SIB list. With a fundamentally weak global banking system, over-leveraged and virtually guaranteed to collapse as current financial and economic conditions deteriorate, a new banking failure could make the first wave of bank failures in 1930 Nashville look like a vicars tea-party. The failure of just one major bank anywhere in the world is likely to degenerate into a widespread panic, because global regulation has ensured they all game the system similarly and they all share the same weaknesses to greater or lesser degree. In another potentially fatal error, following the Lehman crisis the G-20 agreed new rules designed to ensure that the costs of future bank failures are to be carried by bond holders and large depositors as well as shareholders, and not governments. Fortunately, this bail-in route is intended to be optional, but there is a risk that in a widespread banking crisis one or more of the G-20 members will go down the bail-in route, probably for banks not on the G-SIB list but smaller and no less significant banks. With some bailing-out and some bailing-in, simple nationalisation and preservation of all customer deposits becomes less likely, prompting a collapse not just in the banks bailed in, but a panic in all bank bonds and major deposits which would otherwise be protected in a clean bail-out. Putting the bail-in uncertainty to one side, instead of a series of bank failures between 1930-33 todays global banking interdependence suggests one major crisis is more likely, which arguably has already started given the liquidity injections that have taken place since last September, commencing in the repo market. A difference from the thirties is that cash money today is a lower proportion of overall money supply, payments being overwhelmingly electronic. Depositors queueing up to withdraw their funds in old fashioned bank runs cannot be ruled out, but today failing banks find funds transferred from them far more swiftly by electronic means, particularly from larger account balances lacking depositor protection. One reason that central banks have encouraged the abandonment of cash is to lessen banks vulnerability to old fashioned bank runs. Instead, by acting as back-stop liquidity provider, even when other banks reduce credit lines to a stricken bank, the intention is that no bank need fail. By the creation of bank reserves through QE and using the repo facility to provide overnight liquidity, commercial banks are already drawing on this support, without which there would almost certainly have been a banking crisis already. On this basis, bank failures are already here, only they are hidden from public view. All thats needed is for bank bond holders and large depositors to wake up fully to the risks to their capital for the banking crisis to become public. And thats why the values of financial assets cannot be permitted to slide, because if they were to do so the whole financial system would rapidly collapse. Money differences In the 1930s the dollar was exchangeable for gold until one month after Roosevelts inauguration, when he signed an executive order banning the ownership of gold and gold certificates. It was a prelude to the devaluation of the dollar to $35 to the ounce the following January, the rate at which US citizens were forbidden to own gold. Apart from that devaluation, and despite its demonetarisation from gold the dollar retained its objective exchange value, while the depression led to falling prices for traded goods and commodities. Falling prices were the natural consequence of the contraction of bank credit, the imposition of trade tariffs and failing price support operations. Instead of inflationary unbacked bank credit contracting, it was sound money in the form of a gold-backed dollar that took the blame. The inflationists were in control in both fact and of the narrative, but they couldnt quite discard gold altogether  that didnt happen until 1971. Today there is no backing for government currencies, being entirely fiat. There is therefore no restriction in the deployment of an inflationary tax to balance the governments books. Measured in gold, the dollar has already lost 98% of its purchasing power since the late sixties, and now its supply is being increased at an unprecedented rate. The mistake being made by central banks is to not understand that money is merely the mechanism for converting an individuals labour into consumption. It is the means by which we compare one good against another. It is not, as modern economists seem to think, a means for individuals to evaluate the cheapness or dearness of a good in isolation. If that was the case, then current and prospective prices would broadly have the effect they expect. The failure of monetary policy, therefore, is in large measure due to the error of not understanding the true role of money in the economy. It wasnt the increased purchasing power of the dollar in the 1930s which contracted the economy, but the withdrawal of bank credit combined with trade tariffs. Similarly, the falling purchasing power of the dollar today will not, on its own, stimulate consumption. This is not to merely dismiss the distortions in the market from changes in the quantity of money, which are damaging in many other respects. But above all, the debasement of the currency impoverishes the creative economy, the exact opposite of the effect intended. It remains to be seen how far the destruction of fiat money will go, but as Figure 2 shows, M1 money has already jumped sharply  by 104% annualised between 24 February to 22 June.  Conclusion Unfortunately, governments in the developed nations are making the same mistakes dealing with the current economic crisis as they made ninety years ago. As was the case between 19301933 we can be almost certain of a banking crisis. This time it will be global and almost certainly will require banks to be taken into public ownership. The cost will be immense, and it will be paid for by inflationary means. The scale of it will mean an unprecedented destruction of wealth  hardly the basis for economic recovery. At the same time statist preservation of existing production for fear of unemployment will hamper, not help economic recovery; and, so long as fiat currencies retain any exchange value, there can be no economic revival. Indeed, the most important difference from the 1930s is the money, which could well collapse entirely. Guided by the pre-Keynesian economic theory of the Austrian school, of the economic consequences we can be certain. The political consequences in the long run can only be guessed"

There's been talk since a few days about a major (as in: really huger than huge) security vulnerability affecting Windows. Big players got the patch before everyone else but couldn't speak about it. Now the work is out all over the net. The vulnerability is related to ECC and I know next to nothing about except that Bitcoin it is using ECC curve secp256k1. Is which way is or is not Bitcoin affected by this major vuln? Is secp256pk1 simply not affected? Here's some info: (and for those on Windows boxen at home or at your...

17,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"Earned Bitcoin with Lightning Network, don't you want to know it?",1,exm85b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/exm85b/earned_bitcoin_with_lightning_network_dont_you/,2020-02-02 20:48:16," For now, choosing the Lightning Network seems to be the right path. After the Lightning Network launched the Bitmain network, it has indeed achieved very low-cost instant payment, which is being adopted by more and more merchants. This article is divided into four parts to introduce the past, present, future and detailed principles of Lightning Network in detail. First, the lightning torch movement; Second, the current status of the lightning network; Third, the development history of the lightning network; Fourth, the detailed explanation of the lightning network principle. **I. Lightning Torch Movement** A lightning network reward relay is in full swing among Twitter users. This viral campaign is now known as the Lightning Torch Campaign. Just like the Ice Bucket Challenge campaign on social media in 2016, this caused a lot of spread and attention on the Lightning Network. On January 20, 2019, twitter user u/hodlnaut tweeted that he sent 100,000 Satoshi (100k satoshis, 1 BTC equals 100 million Satoshi) to the first selected user through the lightning network rewards application tippin.me, An additional 10,000 users will be issued to the next user. And so on, until the last user is unwilling to add another 10,000 Satoshi and take the bitcoin accumulated by the previous owner as his own, the game is over. Hodlnaut wanted to see how many Satoshi the reward relay game would end. Enthusiastic netizens have specially created a website to track in real time which Twitter user the lightning torch has reached. According to the website information, as of press time, there have been 215 users participating in the delivery, and recently one person needs to send 3.15 million Satoshi Bitcoins. The cumulative total of Bitcoin sent has reached 4.56 BTC. If no one actively terminates the game, the torch transfer will automatically end when more than 0.168 bitcoins are passed. Because the current maximum capacity of the Lightning Network payment channel is set at about 0.168 Bitcoin. Developers are currently developing to increase the capacity of payment channels. Many celebrities in the digital currency industry have participated in the delivery of the lightning torch, including Andreas Antonopoulos, author of Mastering Bitcoin, Anthony Pompliano, founder of Morgan Creek, Roger Ver, Bitcoin Jesus, Joost Jager, Lightning Lab engineer, and Zhao Changpeng, founder of Binance , Tron founder Sun Yuchen, Twitter founder and square CEO Jack, BitMEX Research. Hodlnaut, the initiator of the Lightning Torch, has ordered a Tesla to promote Musk's participation in this event. Tippin.me developer Sergio Abril said that the Google Chrome extension for Tippin.me has been released on February 17. After installing the extension, a Lightning Network reward button will be displayed under each tweet, which can directly reward twitter users. But you need to open Tippin.me first, otherwise it will show that this user does not exist. &amp;#x200B; URL The picture below is a screenshot of someone giving a tweet to the golden financial reporter on February 20th. &amp;#x200B; URL At present, the lightning torch is only available among twitter users, and you can log in to tippin.me with a twitter account and create lightning network invoice information (invoice). Twitter and tippin.me are closely related because Twitter CEO is one of Tippin's investors. **Status of Lightning Network** Lightning Network has grown rapidly since October 2018. According to the 1ml data of Lightning Web Browser, as of press time, Lightning Network has 6,473 nodes, a total of 28,783 payment channels, and a total network channel capacity of 708.34 Bitcoins. Both the payment channel and the total network capacity have increased by nearly 30% within 30 days. &amp;#x200B; URL It is worth noting that another layer of the 1ml name means that the goal of Lightning Network is to reach 1 million Lightning Network nodes, which currently only achieves 0.6% of the goal. &amp;#x200B; URL According to p2sh.info statistics, the capacity of Lightning Network Channel is more than 8 times of half a year ago, and 157 times of a year ago. Golden Finance estimates that at the current growth rate of 30% per month, the lightning network capacity can reach 10,000 BTC in 10 months, and the lightning network capacity can reach 100,000 BTC in 19 months. On February 11, Twitter, Square CEO Jack Dorsey, and Lightning Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark participated in the Stephan Livera podcast. Jack announced that the Lightning Network was not a question of integration into the Square Cash App, but a question of when to integrate. Because of the low-cost (or even no-service) small-amount instant payment feature, Lightning Network Payment has been integrated into various applications such as sports event prediction, betting, knowledge payment, rewards, and payment on behalf of others. These integrated apps are called Lapps. &amp;#x200B; URL Y'alls is a paid reading website that uses the Lightning Network to pay, and paying a small amount of bitcoin can read the articles inside the website's pay wall. Zigzag is an exchange that can exchange other cryptocurrencies to Lightning Network Bitcoins at a low cost and high speed, or exchange Lightning Network Bitcoins to other cryptocurrencies. Australian cryptocurrency payment gateway livingroomofsatoshi provides various services such as payment of credit cards, bank bills, and rent with the Lightning Network. Satoshi's place, similar to EOS Pixel Master, people can spend a bit of smart Bitcoin to occupy pixels in the picture. The gold financial reporter spent 1890 Satoshi writing the word ""golden"" in the lower right corner of the canvas (red circled in the figure below). &amp;#x200B; URL Competition is fierce, as of press time, pixels have been covered by other users Event prediction and sports betting website microbet.fun currently provides event prediction and betting functions for four sports: football, rugby, basketball and ice hockey. NBA, Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga, Serie A and other famous sports leagues are predicting the bet list. Golden Financial reporters tried several Lapps and found that Lightning Network truly achieved at least two of its stated goals: extremely low fees and instant payment. In terms of fees, several payments initiated by Golden Financial reporters have no fees, and the amount can be as low as 1 Satoshi. In terms of payment speed, it is indeed within seconds. The payment experience is not lost to Visa. There are currently several Lightning Network clients, the three most popular of which are Lightning Labs' Ind (Lightning Network Daemon, Go implementation), ACINQ's eclair (Scala implementation), and Blockstream's c-lightning (C implementation). Lightning Network gives users / merchants a great deal of freedom. Any user / merchant can set up their own Lightning Network node by themselves, and can directly use third-party node services such as lightninginabox and Casa Node to own the node out of the box, as well as open source third-party payment services, such as the open source project lndhub, BTCPayServer sets up nodes and develops wallets for users to use your nodes, and everyone can open a bank freely. In terms of wallets, similar to Ethereum's Metamask wallet, Lightning Network also has Google's extended wallet Lightning Joule, as well as light wallets provided by third parties and ToB payment service providers such as OpenNode and Lightning Network POS system NanoPos. How does Lightning Network achieve the fast payment experience? Bitcoin analyst JP Thor research pointed out that because the layer-2 lightning network payment does not need to go through a third-party intermediary, the payment between two points can be as fast as the TCP / IP connection, so the lightning network payment speed will exceed Visa. At present, the processing speed of a channel of Lightning Network can exceed 250TPS, and there is no upper limit for network expansion. Visa's current payment peak is 50,000 tps, with an average value of about 24,000 tps. Bitcoin's processing speed is only 7 tps. In this way, real-time payment is truly realized, and the vision of the Bitcoin white paper cash payment function becomes a reality. **Third, the development of Lightning Network** The prototype of the Lightning Network can be traced back to the first version of Bitcoin software Bitcoin 0.1 released by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin 0.1 includes a draft of the original code, allowing users to update transactions before they are broadcast on the blockchain to confirm transactions. This may be the prototype of the payment channel concept. Satoshi Nakamoto explained in detail to how the payment channel will work in a personal communication with the then Bitcoinj developer Mike Hearn. In 2014, Alex Akselrod proposed a two-way payment channel, and he is now an engineer at Lightning Labs. Prior to the publication of the 2015 Lightning Network White Paper, in order to address the Bitcoin scalability vulnerability, PeterTodd designed and implemented a new type of time lock timelock, CheckLockTimeVerify (CLTV) in the Bitcoin protocol. In February 2015, Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon published a Lightning Network white paper-Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable off-chain instant payment. That same month, they elaborated on their ideas in public for the first time at a Bitcoin developer seminar in San Francisco. For almost a whole year in 2015, the Bitcoin community focused on issues such as Bitcoin expansion and block size issues. Two expansion conferences: Scaling Bitcoin Montreal in September, and Scaling Bitcoin Hongkong in December. Soon after the Hong Kong Expansion Conference, Bitcoin core developer Gregory Maxwell proposed a Bitcoin expansion roadmap in the Bitcoin-development mailing list. This roadmap includes the Lightning Network. This roadmap has the support of most Bitcoin technology communities and became the Bitcoin Core roadmap. In May 2015, the blockchain development company Blockstream hired Russell, the core Linux developer, and hoped that he would implement the Lightning Network in C: C-Lightning. In January 2016, two authors of Lightning Network, Poon and Dryja, and Elizabeth Stark and Olaoluwa Laolu Osuntokun co-founded a new company LightningLabs to develop the Lightning Network. LightningLabs will develop lnd in Go language. In October 2016, the third Bitcoin expansion conference was held in Milan. A few days after the meeting, the main developers of Lightning Networks such as ACINQ, Amiko Pay, BitFury, Blockstream, Lightning Labs and Purse held their first LightningSummit. This conference discussed how to make all different Lightning Networks compatible and interoperable with each other, and form the Lightning Network Protocol Specification BOLT (Basis of Lightning Technology). BOLT became the basic specification of Lightning Network. The idea of the Lightning Network white paper is incompatible with the Bitcoin protocol and requires some protocol upgrades to Bitcoin. CLTV time lock requires that the payment channel be closed regularly, and the use of relative time lock Lightning Network will perform better. In the summer of 2016, the Bitcoin network implemented a soft fork upgrade called CheckSequenceVerify (CSV). Before Segregated Witness is activated, Lightning Network based on Segregated Witness is continuously tested. In May 2016, the fourth version of Blockstream segregated witnessed the ""SegNet 4"" Lightning Network c-lightning test online. In October of that year, Christian Decker of Blockstream purchased a photo of a cat from his colleague Rusty Russell on the testnet, which is considered to be the first breakthrough of the Lightning Network. &amp;#x200B; URL In January 2017, lnd released an alpha version. More and more developers are starting to develop various applications based on Lightning Network, including desktop, mobile wallets, small knowledge payment platforms, gaming, browsers, and other Lapp applications. In August 2017, Segregated Witness was activated, and obstacles to the deployment of Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet were cleared. In November 2017, Blockstream first announced that the beta version of the c-lightning Lightning Network was launched on the Bitcoin mainnet and completed the first transaction. Then, Lightning Labs announced that Lightning Network completed the first cross-chain transaction between Bitcoin and Litecoin. In December 2017, Blockstream, Lightning Labs, and ACINQ announced that the three implementations of Lightning Network are compatible with interoperability. Although the Lightning Network on the Bitcoin mainnet is still in beta, users can't wait to trade with real Bitcoin. In December 2017, Lightning Network ushered in its first transaction. Lightning network developer Alex Bosworth and payer Bitrefill established a payment channel and paid their phone bills with Bitcoin. In January 2018, Lazlo Hanyecz, a legend in Bitcoin history, announced that he had successfully purchased pizza again through the Lightning Network. Lazlo Hanyecz was famous for buying pizza with 10,000 Bitcoins. In March 2018, Lightning Lab released the ind beta version and received a $ 2.5 million seed round investment including the twitter CEO. Since then, nodes, wallets, payments, and applications have been continuously developed, and merchants and services connected to the Lightning Network have continued to increase, and the Lightning Network has begun to explode. **Interpretation of the working principle of Lightning Network** This part is a hard core understanding of Lightning Network, mainly from the Lightning Network White Paper by Thaddeus Dryja and Joseph Poon. To understand the Lightning Network, you need to understand several concepts: 1. Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO); 2. Multi-signature; 3. Two-way payment channels; 4. RSMC  Revocable sequential expiry contracts Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract, 5) HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract. **1.Unspent transaction output UTXO** The Bitcoin model is not a common account model, but uses unspent transaction output UTXO. Except for mining rewards, there are no inputs and only outputs, and all other Bitcoin transactions have corresponding inputs and outputs. UTXO specifies the number of Bitcoins that can be spent and the owner. You can only spend Bitcoins at this address if you prove that you are the owner. Prove that you are the owner by unlocking a ""ScriptPubKey"" which is stored in a field in ""Output"". When UTXO is spent and used as the ""input"" of a transaction, a ""ScriptSig"" needs to be provided, and the ""Unlock Script"" and ""Lock Script"" are combined to run. The verification is successful. Allowed and generate new ""output"". We use the famous digital currency Alice, Bob, Carol transfer to illustrate. Assuming Alice transfers 0.5 BTC to Bob, the ""output"" of this transfer transaction will be set as the following ""lock script"": &gt;OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG The effect of this lock script is that if you can't prove that you are Bob, you can't spend 0.5 BTC. When Bob wants to transfer the money from Alice to Carol, Bitcoin will first find the UTXO from Alice, then create a new transaction and generate the ""output"" of this new transaction. This output also contains ""Lockdown Script"" for Carol. At the same time, an ""unlock script"" is generated in the input of this transaction, and it is arranged by &lt;Bob digital signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt;. Then broadcast the transaction into the memory pool and wait for the miner to verify that Bob's transaction is legal and not spent. The specific method for the miner to verify is to take out the ""unlock script"" in the ""input"" of this transaction and run it together with the ""lock script"" in UTXO that Alice transferred to Bob. The specific form is as follows: &gt;&lt;Bob signature&gt; &lt;Bob public key&gt; OP\_DUP OP\_HASH160 &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; OP\_EQUALVERIFY OP\_CHECKSIG The verification steps are as follows: 1. Take out the &lt;Bob signature&gt; and push it onto the stack; 2. Take out the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it onto the stack, and now the &lt;Bob public key&gt; is on the top of the stack; 3. OP\_DUP copies the &lt; Bob public key&gt;; 4, HASH160 instruction to hash the &lt;Bob public key&gt; and push it into the stack, and now at the top of the stack is the hash value of Bob public key; 4. Take out the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; And push it into the stack, where the &lt;Bob public key hash value&gt; comes from the output of the previous transaction; 5. EQUALVERIFY instruction: take out the two public key hashes at the top of the stack and continue if they are equal, otherwise the verification fails 6. CHECKSIG instruction: Take out &lt;Bob public key&gt; and &lt;Bob signature&gt; for signature verification. If it is true, the transaction is legal. In the above example, a private key unlocks the corresponding UTXO, also called a pay-to-pubkey hash (P2PKH, Pay To PubKey Hash). For asset security and transaction expansion, Bitcoin also has multi-signature technology. Multi-signature requires multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO. **2.Multi-signature technology** The technology that uses multiple private keys to unlock the corresponding UTXO is called multi-signature technology. The general form of multi-signature is M-of-N multi-signature. There are N public keys (2 &lt;N15) in the ""lock script"". A digital signature generated by at least M private keys is required to unlock UTXO. Multi-signature technology only relies on the OP\_CHECKMULTISIG instruction to verify the legitimacy of the transaction. This instruction reads the M signatures and N public keys and the M and N values, and then uses the public keys to verify the signatures in sequence, and the successful matching counter is incremented by one. Finally, the counter is equal to M and the operation is successful. The following uses 2-of-3 multi-signature as an example. Lock script in the 2-of-3 case: &gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG Assuming that only private key 1 and private key 3 are used, the unlock script is: &gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; The composite instruction is: &gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG Run successfully. However, the multi-signature lock script uses all public keys, and the amount of data is too large, which will increase transaction costs. So now multi-signature uses a payment to Script Hash P2SH (Pay to Script Hash) transaction, introduces a Redeem Script concept, and moves N public key information from the lock script to the unlock script. The locking script in the new scheme has become concise: &gt;OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL The hash of the redemption script here is only 160 bits, or 20 bytes, which is much shorter than the previous N public keys. Original text of ""Redemption Script"": &gt;2 &lt;Public Key 1&gt; &lt;Public Key 2&gt; &lt;Public Key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG The unlock script is: &gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt; Synthetic instructions: &gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 2&gt; &lt;redemption script&gt; OP\_HASH160 &lt;hash of redemption script&gt; OP\_EQUAL Based on the characteristics of the stack, this instruction first performs a hash operation on &lt;Redemption Script&gt;, and then compares with &lt;Hash of Redemption Script&gt;. If the original script is run like this: &gt;0 &lt;signature 1&gt; &lt;signature 3&gt; 2 &lt;public key 1&gt; &lt;public key 2&gt; &lt;public key 3&gt; 3 OP\_CHECKMULTISIG **3.Two-way payment channel** With the understanding of multi-signature technology, the first step of Lightning Network is easy to understand. The Lightning Network interacts with the Bitcoin network through a payment channel. Users first establish a two-way payment channel, and the core transfers the user's Bitcoin to a multi-signature address. This is called Funding Tx in the Lightning Network white paper. We also take Alice and Bob as examples. If Alice buys breakfast or coffee from Bob every day, they only need to pre-store a part of their money in a third-party common account. After each transaction, the two parties agree to update their account allocation. The transactions between them are paid on Lightning Network. The peer-to-peer expansion in the channel (also known as the Commitment Transaction Commitment Tx), the whole network broadcast is not on the chain, and the peer-to-peer instant payment is truly achieved. Only after one party decides to stop using the other party's service and close the payment channel, the final channel status is broadcast on the Bitcoin network, and Alice and Bob unanimously sign the agreement and settle the chain. In theory, as long as the number of Bitcoins recharged when the payment channel is opened is sufficient, the number of transactions in the channel can be unlimited. **The essence of the payment channel is that Alice and Bob transfer their bitcoins into a 2-of-2 multi-signature address.** But how to prevent Alice or Bob from cheating when closing the payment channel and not broadcasting the final status on the Bitcoin network? Lightning Network uses RSMC to ensure that both parties are honest and not cheating. If the payment channel is closed, the latest channel status is broadcast to the Bitcoin network. **4. RSMC-Revocable Sequence Maturity Contract** The Lightning Network white paper page 19 describes how RSMC works: If the user does not broadcast the latest channel status, it will be punished, and the other party will take all the funds in the channel. Because the funds of both parties are kept in RSMC, he has to wait for 1,000 blocks to confirm (Note: Timelock) before he can get the funds, while the other party has two signatures and he gets all the funds in the channel before him. If the user broadcasts the latest channel status, there will be no revocable transactions. After a period of time (1000 block confirmations), both parties to the transaction will get their own funds. We also choose Alice and Bob to deposit 0.5 bitcoin each to a multi-signature address to open a payment channel as an example to illustrate how RSMC actually ensures that people pay honestly. &amp;#x200B; URL In the picture above, Alice and Bob are mirror-symmetric. It is enough to study one person clearly. Alice and Bob will create a Commitment Transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a and C1b, respectively. Commitment transaction (Commitment Tx) C1a has two outputs, one is 0.5BTC in the RSMC address signed by Alice and Bob, and the other is 0.5BTC of Bob (output 1 in the figure). Below C1a, there will be a Revocable Delivery Transaction (RD1a) and a Delivery Transcation (D1a). RD1a uses BTC in RSMC. Because RSMC is a multi-signature address, both Alice and Bob's signatures are required. The RD1a output is paid to Alice 0.5BTC, but only if the C1a transaction is broadcast and confirmed by 1000 blocks. D1a indicates that Bob can consume this 0.5BTC at will. As long as C1a is broadcast, Bob can immediately broadcast D1a to get 0.5BTC. The essence of the final result of the whole mechanism is that if Alice wants to terminate the transaction with Bob, he can choose to broadcast C1a, Bob can get 0.5 BTC immediately, and Alice needs to confirm to get 0.5 BTC after 1000 blocks. The same is true for Bob. Consider again the transaction between Alice and Bob. For example, Alice spends 0.1 BTC to buy a cup of coffee from Bob. Now the allocation of funds in the payment channel needs to be changed to Alice (0.4 BTC) and Bob (0.6 BTC). This requires two steps. One is to create a new committed transaction, and the other is to invalidate the previous transaction. **Create new committed transaction** Below is the left side of C1a and C1b (the RMC and subsequent transactions are omitted for the sake of illustration); the middle column is the new transaction created by Alice: C2a, RD2a, D2a; the rightmost column is the new transaction created by Bob: C2b, RD2b, D2b. &amp;#x200B; *Processing img 57kmkconehe41...* C2a and C1a have the same structure. From Alice's point of view, the number of BTC in the RSMC address that Alice and Bob sign together is 0.4 BTC, and Bob's is 0.6 BTC. Bob will also create the corresponding C2b, RD2b and D2b, and then the two parties will exchange the promised transaction and the RSMC transaction to complete the signature, and the new transaction will take effect. **Obsolete old commitment transactions** At this time, the old and new transactions (C1a / C2a, C1b / C2b) exist simultaneously and are valid at the same time. How to abolish the old promise transaction? Lightning Network abolishes the old committed transactions C1a and C1b through two methods: one is to exchange private keys between the two parties; the other is to create a ""Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a / BR1b)"" instead of the RSMC revocable transaction (RD1a / RD1b). &amp;#x200B; *Processing img nei5s55rehe41...* As shown in the figure above, the input of the new Breach Remedy Transaction (BR1a) is 0.5BTC in the multi-signature RSMC, and the output is 0.5BTC paid to Bob. Therefore, if Alice signs and broadcasts the old channel state C1a in violation, the funds in the Funding Tx multi-signature will be transferred to the multi-signature RSMC and Bob addresses, each 0.5 BTC. At the same time, in addition to owning the private key of 0.5BTC in RSMC, Bob also received Alice's private key, so Bob can broadcast BR1a to the entire network. The RD1a created by Alice needs to wait for another 1,000 block confirmations to take effect. In this way, Bob has all the funds in the payment channel. The multi-signature RSMC firstly delays the acquisition of funds by the person who closed the payment channel, and secondly, it can provide economic incentives to invalidate the old transaction without cheating, because broadcasting the channel status of the old transaction will have penalties, and the Bitcoin in the payment channel will be fully Be owned by the other party. Through this mechanism, it is ensured that Alice will not broadcast C1a, and C1a will naturally become invalid. Subsequent new commitment transactions D, E, F in the payment channel are also processed according to the above process, ensuring that Alice and Bob always broadcast according to the latest channel status when they want to close the payment channel. The above discussion is the payment process of Alice and Bob, which cannot be turned into a lightning **network** . If there is no direct payment channel between two nodes, they can be indirectly connected through other nodes to form a lightning network. The payment between them is called Multihop payments. The Lightning Network can make multi-hop payment between nodes through HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract. **5. HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract** &amp;#x200B; *Processing img le30h85xehe41...* What if Alice wants to pay Dave 0.1 BTC, but there is no direct payment channel between them? Dave will generate a random number R as a secret, and then send the hash value of R to Alice. Alice will tell Bob: If you tell me the preimage of H within three days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Bob tells Carol in the same way: If you tell me H's preimage within two days, I will pay you 0.1 BTC. Carol can tell Dave the same thing, but time is within a day. And Dave does know R. Remember the case where someone gave a reward to a golden reporter via tippin.me? At the beginning of preparing this article, the golden financial reporter experienced Lightning Network Payment with Lightning Network Wallet, and transferred 1000 Satoshi to his tippin.me. In fact, there are multi-hop payments in this process. The golden financial reporter's wallet was jumped to tippin.me through Indhub. The above is the overall picture of multi-hop payment. Let's take a look at the specific transaction between Alice and Bob. In multi-hop payment, although Alice and Bob use the established payment channel between them, the transaction between them is not the same as direct transaction, and HTLC-Hashed Timelock Contract is introduced. Through the detailed explanation of Lightning Network above, the essence of Lightning Network is to link the nodes into a network through a payment channel, and then use the mechanism design and technical methods of RSMC, HTLC and other methods to avoid the moral hazard of the counterparty in the payment channel, so as to avoid the need to trust the other party and For third-party point-to-point payment, because there is no need to go online, the bottleneck of payment speed lies in the speed limit of the network, so it can be paid instantly. According to the characteristics of the Lightning Network, such as payment channels and multi-hop payments, although the Lightning Network now basically achieves the user experience of instant payment at very low fees, there are also some problems, such as the centralization of payment channels, liquidity, and payment collection. People online, routing, etc. **Conclusion** Looking back at the development of Bitcoin and Lightning Network, maybe Bitcoin as a value storage currency and payment currency do not conflict at the same time. Bitcoin acts as a clearing network and Lightning Network acts as a payment network. The widespread use of payment functions will increase the transaction volume of the Bitcoin clearing network, increase the transaction fee of the Bitcoin network, and increase the security and decentralization of the Bitcoin network. Positive feedback makes each other. The only problem left is the problem of large price fluctuations. Lightning Network payment is based on Satoshi. If the price of Bitcoin is high enough, its volatility may be low enough to become a daily payment tool. Bitcoin investor Tim Draper recently stated that the world will use Bitcoin to buy coffee in two years, and by 2023 baristas will laugh at those who are trying to buy coffee in fiat currencies. Maybe one day this will come true. **References:** The History of Lightning: From Brainstorm to Beta The Bitcoin Lightning Network: Scalable Off-Chain Instant Payments An analysis of on-chain Lightning Network transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain Understanding the Lightning Network (3 parts)"

A growing market in **forged credentials** and the vulnerability of certification documents in the face of man-made and natural disasters meant a solution was increasingly necessary. Given UNICs early immersion in the blockchain world with the launching in 2014 of the first Masters degree globally in Digital Currencies and Blockchain technology, it was clear to them that blockchain technology was best suited to fulfil that role. Why? We had to find a solution with certificates that would be **vendor independent** and without a central point of potential attack/hacking, and that would outlive the issuing institution itself, explains Block.co CEO, Alexis Nicolaou. So, in 2014 UNIC became the first university globally to experiment with the deployment of blockchain in [the issuance of academic certificates](URL They were confident there was no safer or more **secure application** than that of blockchain technology and particularly no safer blockchain than the Bitcoin blockchain. It quickly became clear that it was not solely academia that could benefit from the **reliable credential authentication** that blockchain technology offered. Block.co was born with the objective of taking the initial learnings and expanding the product beyond education to other industries as well as government  indeed to any organization or sector that issued certificates whose authenticity and immutability they wanted to secure. Look at the potential of **blockchain in the shipping sector** for example, says Nicolaou. Imagine youre a shipping company and you employ a crane operator that stacks up the containers on the deck. The **certificate** he is furnishing however is a **fake** and he is not qualified to do the job. During the journey the ship gets into rough seas and an accident happens, with the containers going overboard. There would be millions in damages that could have been avoided had there been an easy way for the company to verify the **authenticity** of that **certificate**. **Powered by Industry Recognition and Community** Block.co leverages product innovation and cutting-edge cross-collaboration through partnership with the [Institute for the Future (IFF)](URL and UNIC.

After they stole flag of the president from the castle, they cut it into 1152 pieces and divided price of the flag into 1152 BTC addresses. Then they gave it away to random people on the streets. So person got piece of flag with description of the project with public and private key so they could withdraw their BTC. However they did security mistake in generating addresses. They used deterministic generating so you need just xpub - master public key and one of the private keys to find all other private keys. This xpub was shown on the conferences where people from SatoshiLabs - Trezor attended. Slush, founder of Trezor, was having conflict with of the main members of Ztohoven. Slush decided to exploit this vulnerability and steal BTC from all the addresses. 14 people already withdraw their coins so 1138 addresses were ""robbed"". His plan was send it to prime minister of Czech rep who is huge hater of Ztohoven group and embarrass them. Of course people noticed that Bitcoins are gone and after few days of investigation they accused Slush. They told him to send the money to charity which he did.

I have very bad news for you. 17/07/2019 - on this day I hacked your OS and got full access to your account akaPABLO1@email.co.uk. You can check it - I sent this message from your account. So, you can change the password, yes.. But my malware intercepts it every time. How I made it: In the software of the router, through which you went online, was a vulnerability. I just hacked this router and placed my malicious code on it. When you went online, my trojan was installed on the OS of your device. After that, I made a full dump of your disk (I have all your address book, history of viewing sites, all files, phone numbers and addresses of all your contacts). A month ago, I wanted to lock your device and ask for a not big amount of btc to unlock. But I looked at the sites that you regularly visit, and I was shocked by what I saw!!! I'm talk you about sites for adults. I want to say - you are a BIG pervert. Your fantasy is shifted far away from the normal course! And I got an idea.... I made a screenshot of the adult sites where you have fun (do you understand what it is about, huh?). After that, I made a screenshot of your joys (using the camera of your device) and glued them together. Turned out amazing! You are so spectacular! I'm know that you would not like to show these screenshots to your friends, relatives or colleagues. I think $926 is a very, very small amount for my silence. Besides, I have been spying on you for so long, having spent a lot of time! Pay ONLY in Bitcoins! My BTC wallet: 15yF8WkUg8PRjJehYW4tGdqcyzc4z7dScM You do not know how to use bitcoins? Enter a query in any search engine: ""how to replenish btc wallet"". It's extremely easy For this payment I give you two days (48 hours). As soon as this letter is opened, the timer will work. After payment, my virus and dirty screenshots with your enjoys will be self-destruct automatically. If I do not receive from you the specified amount, then your device will be locked, and all your contacts will receive a screenshots with your ""enjoys"". I hope you understand your situation. - Do not try to find and destroy my virus! (All your data, files and screenshots is already uploaded to a remote server) - Do not try to contact me (you yourself will see that this is impossible, I sent you an email from your account) - Various security services will not help you; formatting a disk or destroying a device will not help, since your data is already on a remote server. P.S. You are not my single victim. so, I guarantee you that I will not disturb you again after payment! This is the word of honor hacker. I also ask you to regularly update your antiviruses in the future. This way you will no longer fall into a similar situation. Do not hold evil! I just do my job. Good luck."

If this problem occurs, Bitcoin could of course hard fork to address the issue, however, wouldn't it still be too late? Even if the community nearly 100% agreed to fork from a time in the past before the first attack occurred, how could a fork possibly allow for new private keys that somehow everyone would be able to know based on their current private keys without those being compromised as well? And asking every single Bitcoin holder to move their funds immediately after a fork seems unfeasible. Isn't the time to fork for quantum resistance now, before a successful attack occurs? Can anyone explain to me definitively how my Bitcoins are protected if Quatum computers become widely available?"

Often, people are willing to pay to keep information secret, yet the information is in the public interest. I propose a mechanism whereby an individual could monetize their valuable secret at the expense of those who wish it to remain secret for longer while ensuring it is eventually released to the public. A simple script can be developed, configured with a PAYLOAD (secret data), a STARTTIME and an ADDRESS. Using a simple scheduler like cron, it would be set to run every X minutes doing the following steps: - Read blockchain state to determine ADDRESS -&gt; BALANCE - ENDTIME &lt;- calculateEndTime(BALANCE, STARTTIME) - specific curve should be tailored to the target, but the cost to extend should increase exponentially over time to ensure eventual publishing. - Check if the calculated ENDTIME is in the past: if so publish - Publish step should consist of multiple modules, each of which posts the PAYLOAD to a different provider. Ideally, should create modules for various social media platforms, pastebins, blogs, etc. No single point of failures. - This software should be deployed on multiple devices, each publishing to different platforms to reduce chance of failure. By using this system, the information holder can complete the action of releasing information before offering the mechanism for altering the timing of the release. In situations where the information is in the public interest, I believe this significantly changes the moral (and legal?) calculus of the situation. Threatening to reveal information unless you are paid is extortion. However, if after making publishing a certainty, the publisher informs those that may wish it stay secret for a while longer of the address that will delay publishing... it seems a bit different. Would the use of this be ethical? Legal? Potential Applications: - Negotiation of ""Responsible Disclosure Periods"" for cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Researchers often face legal and professional intimidation in attempting to schedule a date for releasing information about a security vulnerability to the public. Set it in this mechanism, let the company know. Wash your hands. - Wikileaks-type whistleblower funding mechanism - Pretty self explanatory. Might want to add a mechanism for the public to accelerate delay-cost increases by paying into an alternate 'speedup' address. - News? Modern news doesn't really have a business model anymore. Could this potentially be the funding model for the journalists/news agencies of the future? Do what you will with this idea, hereby in the public domain. Make our dank cyberpunk future my friends.

Bitstamp $5.3 mln (BTC), January 4th, 2015** On January 4, 2015, the operational hot wallet of Bitstamp announced that it was hacked by an anonymous hacker and 19,000 Bitcoins (worth of $5 million) were lost. The initiation of the attack fell on November 4, 2014. Then Damian Merlak, the CTO of the exchange, was offered free tickets to punk rock festival Punk Rock Holiday 2015 via Skype, knowing that Merlak is interested in such music and he plays in the band. To receive the tickets, he was asked to fill out a participant questionnaire by sending a file named Punk Rock Holiday 2015 TICKET Form1.doc. This file contained the VBA script. By opening the file, he downloaded the malware on his computer. Although Merlak did not suspect wrong and has opened the ""application form"", to any critical consequences, this did not open access to the funds of exchange. The attackers, however, did not give up. The attack continued for five weeks, during which hackers presented themselves as journalists, then headhunters. Finally, the attackers were lucky. On December 11, 2014, the infected word document was opened on his machine by Bitstamp system administrator Luka Kodric, who had access to the exchange wallet. The file came to the victim by email, allegedly on behalf of an employee of the Association for computer science, although in fact, as the investigation showed, the traces of the file lead deep into Tor. Hackers were not limited to just one letter. Skype attacker pretending to be an employee of the Association for computing machinery, convinced that his Frame though to make international honor society, which required some paperwork. Kodric believed. By installing a Trojan on Kodri's computer hackers were able to obtain direct access to the hot wallet of the exchange. The logs show that the attacker, under the account of Kodric, gained access to the server LNXSRVBTC, where he kept the wallet file.dat, and the DORNATA server where the password was stored. Then the servers were redirected to a certain IP address that belongs to one of the providers of Germany. There are still no official reports of arrests in this case. Obviously, the case is complicated by the fact that the hackers are outside the UK, and the investigation has to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in other countries. **2. GateHub $9.5 mln (XRP), June 1th, 2019** Hackers have compromised nearly 100 XRP Ledger wallets on cryptocurrency wallet service GateHub. The incident was reported by GateHub in a preliminary statement on June 6. XRP enthusiast Thomas Silkjr, who first noticed the suspicious activity, estimates that the hackers have stolen nearly $10 million worth of cryptocurrency (23,200,000 XRP), $5.5 million (13,100,000 XRP) of which has already been laundered through exchanges and mixer services. GateHub notes that it is still conducting an investigation and therefore cannot publish any official findings. Also, GateHub advises victims to make complaints to the relevant authorities of their jurisdiction. **3. Tether, $30.9 mln (USDT), November 19th, 2017** Tether created a digital currency called ""US tokens"" (USDT)  they could be used to trade real goods using Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether. By depositing $1 in Tether, the user received 1 USD, which can be converted back into fiat. On November 19, 2017, the attacker gained access to the main Tether wallet and withdrew $ 30.9 million in tokens. For the transaction, he used a Bitcoin address, which means that it was irreversible. To fix the situation, Tether took action by which the hacker was unable to withdraw the stolen money to fiat or Bitcoin, but the panic led to a decrease in the value of Bitcoin. **4. Ethereum, $31 mln (ETH), July 20th, 2017** On July 20, 2017, the hacker transferred 153,037 Ethers to $31 million from three very large wallets owned by SwarmCity, Edgeless Casino and Eternity. Unknown fraudster managed to change the ownership of wallets, taking advantage of the vulnerability with multiple signatures. First, the theft was noticed by the developers of SwarmCity. Further events deserve a place in history: ""white hackers"" returned the stolen funds, and then protected other compromised accounts. They acted in the same way as criminals, who stole funds from vulnerable wallets  just not for themselves. And it all happened in less than a day. **5. Dao (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) $70 mln (ETH), June 18th, 2016** On June 18, 2016, members of the Ethereum community noticed that funds were being drained from the DAO and the overall ETH balance of the smart contract was going down. A total of 3.6 million Ether (worth around $70 million at the time) was drained by the hacker in the first few hours. The attack was possible because of an exploit found in the splitting function. The attacker/s withdrew Ether from the DAO smart contract multiple times using the same DAO Tokens. This was possible due to what is known as a recursive call exploit. In this exploit, the attacker was able to ""ask"" the smart contract (DAO) to give the Ether back multiple times before the smart contract could update its own balance. There were two main faults that made this possible: the fact that when the DAO smart contract was created the coders did not take into account the possibility of a recursive call, and the fact that the smart contract first sent the ETH funds and then updated the internal token balance. It's important to understand that this bug did not come from Ethereum itself, but from this one application that was built on Ethereum. The code written for the DAO had multiple bugs, and the recursive call exploit was one of them. Another way to look at this situation is to compare Ethereum to the Internet and any application based on Ethereum to a website: if a website is not working, it doesn't mean that the Internet is not working, it simply means that one website has a problem. The hacker stopped draining the DAO for unknown reasons, even though they could have continued to do so. The Ethereum community and team quickly took control of the situation and presented multiple proposals to deal with the exploit. In order to prevent the hacker from cashing in the Ether from his child DAO after the standard 28 days, a soft-fork was voted on and came very close to being introduced. A few hours before it was set to be released, a few members of the community found a bug with the implementation that opened a denial-of-service attack vector. This soft fork was designed to blacklist all the transactions made from the DAO. **6. NiceHash, 4736.42 (BTC), December 6th, 2017** NiceHash is a Slovenian cryptocurrency hash power broker with integrated marketplace that connects sellers of hashing power (miners) with buyers of hashing power using the sharing economy approach. On December 6, 2017, the company's servers became the target of attack. At first, Reddit users reported that they could not access their funds and make transactions  when they tried to log in, they were shown a message about a service interruption. In the end, it became known that the service had undergone a major cyberattack and 4736,42 Bitcoins disappeared without a trace. Despite heavy losses, NiceHash was able to continue working, but CEO and founder Marco Koval resigned, giving way to a new team. The company managed to maintain the trust of investors and began to strengthen the protection of its systems. **7. Mt.Gox, 850000 (BTC), June 19th, 2011** The Hacking Of Mt.Gox was one of the biggest Bitcoin thefts in history. It was the work of highly professional hackers using complex vulnerabilities. A hacker (or a group of hackers) allegedly gained access to a computer owned by one of the auditors and used a security vulnerability to access Mt.Gox servers, then changed the nominal value of Bitcoin to 1 cent per coin. Then they brought out about 2000 BTC. Some customers, without knowing it, conducted transactions at this low price, a total of 650 BTC, and despite the fact that the hacking hit the headlines around the world, no Bitcoin could be returned. To increase investor confidence, the company has compensated all of the stolen coins, placed most of the remaining funds in offline storage, and the next couple of years was considered the most reliable Bitcoin exchanger in the world. However, it was only an illusion of reliability. The problems of the organization were much more serious, and the management probably did not even know about them. CEO of Mt.Gox, Mark Karpeles, was originally a developer, but over time he stopped delving into technical details, basking in the rays of glory  because he created the world's largest platform for cryptocurrency exchange. At that time Mt.Gox handled over 70% of all Bitcoin transactions. And, of course, there were those who wanted to take advantage of the technological weakness of the service. At some point, hackers made it so that Bitcoins could be bought at any price, and within minutes millions of dollars worth of coins were sold  mostly for pennies. World prices for Bitcoin stabilized in a few minutes, but it was too late. As a result, Mt.Gox lost about 850,000 Bitcoins. The exchange had to declare bankruptcy, hundreds of thousands of people lost money, and the Japanese authorities arrested CEO Mark Karpeles for fraud. He pleaded not guilty and was subsequently released. In 2014, the authorities restored some of the Bitcoins remaining at the old addresses, but did not transfer them to the exchange, and created a trust to compensate for the losses of creditors. **8. Coincheck, $530 mln, January 26th, 2018** The sum was astonishing, and even surpassed the infamous Mt.Gox hack. While Mt.Gox shortly filed for bankruptcy following the hack, Coincheck has surprisingly remained in business and was even recently approved as a licensed exchange by Japans Financial Services (FSA). Coincheck was founded in 2014 in Japan and was one of the most popular cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. Offering a wide variety of digital assets including Bitcoin, Ether, LISK, and NEM, Coincheck was an emerging exchange that joined the Japan Blockchain Association. Since Coincheck was founded it 2014, it was incidentally not subject to new exchange registration requirements with Japans FSA  who rolled out a framework after Mt. Gox , and eventually was a contributing factor to its poor security standards that led to the hack. On January 26th, 2018, Coincheck posted on their blog detailing that they were restricting NEM deposits and withdrawals, along with most other methods for buying or selling cryptocurrencies on the platform. Speculation arose that the exchange had been hacked, and the NEM developers issued a statement saying they were unaware of any technical glitches in the NEM protocol and any issues were a result of the exchanges security. Coincheck subsequently held a high-profile conference where they confirmed that hackers had absconded with 500 million NEM tokens that were then distributed to 19 different addresses on the network. Totaling roughly $530 million at the time  NEM was hovering around $1 then  the Coincheck hack was considered the largest theft in the industrys history. Coincheck was compelled to reveal some embarrassing details about their exchanges security, mentioning how they stored all of the NEM in a single hot wallet and did not use the NEM multisignature contract security recommended by the developers. Simultaneously, the NEM developers team had tagged all of the NEM stolen in the hack with a message identifying the funds as stolen so that other exchanges would not accept them. However, NEM announced they were ending their hunt for the stolen NEM for unspecified reasons several months later, and speculation persisted that hackers were close to cashing out the stolen funds on the dark web. Mainstream media covered the hack extensively and compared it to similar failures by cryptocurrency exchanges in the past to meet adequate security standards. At the time, most media coverage of cryptocurrencies was centered on their obscure nature, dramatic volatility, and lack of security. Coinchecks hack fueled that narrative considerably as the stolen sum was eye-popping and the cryptocurrency used  NEM  was unknown to most in the mainstream. NEM depreciated rapidly following the hack, and the price fell even more throughout 2018, in line with the extended bear market in the broader industry. Currently, NEM is trading at approximately $0.07, a precipitous fall from ATH over $1.60 in early January. The extent of the Coincheck hack was rivaled by only a few other hacks, notably the Mt.Gox hack. While nominally Coincheck is the largest hack in the industrys history, the effects of Mt.Gox were significantly more impactful since the stolen funds consisted only of Bitcoin and caused a sustained market correction as well as an ongoing controversy with the stolen funds and founder. Moreover, Mt.Gox squandered 6% of the overall Bitcoin circulation at the time in a market that was much less mature than it is today. Despite the fallout, Coincheck is now fully operational and registered with Japans FSA. As practice shows, people make mistakes and these mistakes can cost a lot. Especially, when we talk about mad cryptoworld. Be careful and keep your private keys in a safe place."

I was used to the idea that any address that hadn't been spent from was considered quantum-safe. But this isn't true for any coins that were mined and not moved prior to 2012. What this means is that all of Satoshi's coins are theoretically stealable by anyone who can pull off a successful quantum attack on bitcoin. In fact, we must now consider them the canary in bitcoin's quantum coalmine because they will likely be the first to fall. Anyone who can pull off a successful quantum attack on these early unmoved coins will make over **$500 million dollars**. Today. Everyone will think Satoshi is moving his coins, but in fact it will more likely be a quantum attacker, and that is a shame, unless Satoshi himself wizes up and acts soon. Beyond that, a successful quantum attack may allow someone to masquerade as Satoshi by giving them the private key to these original coins. The day is quickly approaching where even if someone were to sign a message using Satoshi's known coin hoard addresses, we should think twice about whether this person actually is Satoshi or not, since it may not be long before a successful quantum attack will make his early addresses vulnerable to exposure. Now this vulnerability changed in 2012, so current mining to an unspent address is, thankfully, safe. And if you have an address with coins in it that has never been spent from, you are also quantum safe. I just fear we are in for more Satoshi-hoaxing and drama due to these old addresses. And if Satoshi's coins ever move, we should consider it likely that the quantum nut has finally been cracked by someone and we'll need to be more careful about address reuse. There may be one other issue. There may be a lot of 2012 mined coined that has never been spent. Right now we consider much of this coin to be simply lost. But in the near future, quantum cryptographers may be able to recover much of this coin and make perhaps another $500 million or so. A billion dollar prize for the quantum researchers out there. Not a bad plum if you ask me."

47,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Safety Tips on Cryptocurrency Usage,1,a6e9l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/a6e9l4/safety_tips_on_cryptocurrency_usage/,2018-12-15 21:26:58,"Cryptocurrency has exploded into the marketplace, and more and more people are using it. The cryptocurrency market has been strongly established, and it has become more important now to protect crypto assets and follow secure transaction practices. There have been numerous instances of targeted attacks on cryptocurrency wallets and accounts. While most cryptocurrencies have built-in security features that protect them from these attacks, the investor is ultimately responsible for his/her capital. If the user of the currency themselves become the vulnerability, then it is easy for cybercriminals to gain access to wallets. Keeping this in mind, there are certain secured transaction practices which when followed can keep crypto wallets safe from attacks. Mentioned below are some of these tactics that can be used by investors. * Ensure that the PC has been properly fortified with proper firewall and the latest anti-malware software. Crypto users should switch to secure operating systems such as Qubes or Linux. * It is always a good idea to have a dedicated device and network for all crypto operations. This means that investors are encouraged to use just one mobile or computer and a single internet connection for all of their cryptocurrency transactions. This simple practice lowers the chances of attacks significantly. * Encrypt data and communication. Encryption of data is one of the most successful ways of keeping crypto wallets safe from attacks. Encryption can be easily set up on Linux systems. Added to this, two-factor authentication is always recommended, and one should only go for those cryptocurrencies that provide this feature. * One of the most vital things to do is to create a backup of all important data. In case of loss of hardware or computers getting attacked, one can easily rely on the backup. Added to this, one should always be very careful with any authentication done through cellphones."

A web wallet by definition is on the internet where the communications happen through servers and http protocols, it has limitless vulnerabilities: URL If you want the luxury of just signing in on the internet and using your coins, use a custodial service like Coinbase. Of you have serious money in crypto, a hardware wallet is literally the only option you should consider. This electrum fix might be patched, but there's always gonna be another vulnerability that'll be discovered/concocted by the hackers and more people will fall for it. Always follow the safest route possible when we're talking significant sums of money, and for now that is the hardware wallets. I hope no more people fall victim to this electrum fiasco."

Concerning Ledger, they presented 3 attack paths which could give the impression that critical vulnerabilities were uncovered on Ledger devices. This is not the case."" URL TREZOR's manufacturer SatoshiLabs responded to the vulnerabilities on [Twitter](URL saying ""With regards to #35c3 findings about @Trezor: we were not informed via our Reponsible Disclosure program beforehands, so we learned about them from the stage. We need to take some time to fix these and we'll be addressing them via a firmware update at the end of January."" SatoshiLabs also responded in their subreddit with slightly more detail, ""Per my latest information (I am not present at the conference), we were not informed about this vulnerability via our Responsible Disclosure process, and therefore we are working with the information as it arrives. We will address this vulnerability as soon as possible, though we will need some time. Until then, you can mitigate it by using a passphrase (make sure to learn how it works first, as in case of passphrase-loss your funds are irrecoverable), or by making sure you do not lose physical access to your device. To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs to have physical access to your device  directly to its board."" Of interest, neither manufacturer was notified of these vulnerabilities prior to it's disclosure on stage at CCC through their responsible disclosure programs so have been caught unaware. SatoshiLabs and Ledger will both be patching their devices by the end of January. "

I'd love to hear the details of current preparation for the worst case scenario. &amp;#x200B; In addition - two ideas below (focused on a client software): * The old signaling system was removed from Bitcoin, because it was a security risk. But wouldn't be useful to have a signaling two-states flag in the client software, which can be activated when rapid upgrade is recommended? The only information sent would be represented as a binary state: 0 (normal state) or 1 (severe risk, upgrade your client ASAP). Which is something totally different from the old messaging option. This way you have no way of sending to users anything that could guide their actions. * Another (well known...) idea is to support and promote the development of alternative clients, which of course agrees on the same set of network rules. &amp;#x200B;"

57,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Large sum of crypto currency stolen by someone on the same exchange as me,1,9oydvu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9oydvu/large_sum_of_crypto_currency_stolen_by_someone_on/,2018-10-17 23:53:12,"# The Situation I am a software engineer, but sometimes a very stupid one. I made a mistake and accidentally committed my API key and Secret key to a public repository, where I was developing a trading app, free for the general public. This key is used to make trades and view account balances on a crypto-currency exchange (no password required). &amp;nbsp; After committing it, I realized my mistake and logged onto my my crypto-exchange account, to amend the mistake. I deleted the keys, or so I thought and logged off and that's that. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to me, a thief developed a script, which would transfer my funds from my account, to his account, by executing rapid fire transactions within the spread of the chosen crypto-currency. ______________________________________________________ #The Thieves Technique Sounds complicated? It's not. Here's how it works; The attacker will write a script which sends buy and sell commands to the cyrpto exchange API. First he gets my account to sell at the price just below the current lowest sell price of a crypto, then he will get his account to buy at the same price. The transaction is completed. Now he gets his account to sell at the price just above the current buy price, and gets my account to buy at the same price. Again the transaction is completed and the thief is now a little richer, while I'm a little poorer. &amp;nbsp; For example, if BTC was selling for $501 and the lowest buy order was $500, the thief would get my account to sell at $500.01, then he would buy at this value. Then he would sell at the higher price of $500.99 and get my account to buy at this price. Each transaction in this example would transfer 98c across. &amp;nbsp; Of course Bitcoin is not the best crypto to use in this attack, rather cryptos with larger spread were used instead. This way the amount transferred was maximize for each iteration of the 4-step sequence. I call this technique the *Crypto Spread Attack*. &amp;nbsp; The follow chart shows 4 transactions, out of over a thousand transactions that occurred. Transaction #| User | Exchange | Type | Quantity | Limit | |:-----------|:-------|:----------:|----------:|---------:|----------:| |1 | Me | BTC-NXC | LIMIT_SELL| 4900 | 0.00000279| |2 | Thief | BTC-NXC | LIMIT_BUY | 4900 | 0.00000279| |3 | Thief | BTC-NXC | LIMIT_SELL| 4900 | 0.00000287| |4 | Me | BTC-NXC | LIMIT_BUY | 4900 | 0.00000287| &amp;nbsp; ______________________________________________________ #The Aftermath Now the technique used is not super important, but what is is his transactions are completely trackable and the exchange will know with 100% certainty who performed the attack. Every user on the exchange is verified, in other words they have had to submit many copies of different forms of ID. So he has stolen this money in full daylight. &amp;nbsp; I have contacted the Exchange and the Repository host, for information about the thief. My repository wasn't very popular, so it was only visited a few times within the vulnerability period. The Repository host should be able to tell who looked at what files and when (by IP). Also they may even be able to tell which user account looked at these files - if the thief was logged in at the time. &amp;nbsp; Now I am waiting for the information from the two parties, but I thought I would let you guys know, just in case I have missed something. Is there anything else I can do here? Should I try to contact the thief, by leaving him a note on my repository? Should I try to track the transactions in the block chain? Please if someone has any information that might be of use, please share. &amp;nbsp; __________________ #Note to the Thief If you are the thief, please know you are in trouble and will not get away with this crime. I will pursue this until I find you and I will make sure justice is served. What you did was wrong and I hope you feel even a fraction of how broken I feel. I am not even rich, you have stolen half of my entire life's savings. Many years worth of savings that I have been investing for the future. Now my future is unknown. **You can make this right**. Please do the right thing. *BTC Addr: 34okmWfnKUm6JKwxe5d8R1YBVBcYwaJbo4* "
58,vulnerability,Bitcoin,FAQ about Chinas only Blockchain Security Technology Testing Center (BSTTC),1,9ri45c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9ri45c/faq_about_chinas_only_blockchain_security/,2018-10-26 16:53:50,"&amp;#x200B; ![img](3emakh3pygu11) **1.** **What is Chinas Blockchain Security Technology Testing Center (BSTTC)?** It is the only testing center in China that is jointly established by The National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team (CNCERT) and Changsha Economic Development Zone to serve the blockchain security.

Blockchain related companies are mainly located in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Why does BSTTC choose to settle in Changsha Economic Development Zone?** Changsha Economic Development Zone initially established Xingsha Blockchain Industrial Park, issued blockchain industry support policy, and successfully held China Xingsha Blockchain Academician Summit Forum, which clearly defined the blockchain positioning in Changsha Economic Development Zone. The policy support accelerates BSTTC settled in Changsha Economic Development Zone, and the blockchain technology, as an emerging technical framework, has high professional requirements for developers. It is difficult for the general development team to independently undertake the code audit work, who may also require an external professional team to assist in the formal verification and penetration testing of the original code of applications or blockchain smart contracts. The excellent blockchain technology enterprise in Changsha Economic Development Zone has become the cornerstone of BSTTC. At present, a high-quality enterprise Tianheguoyun, located in Xingsha Blockchain Industrial Park, has accomplished the development of the code audit platform. **5. How does BSTTC operate?** In order to ensure the professionalism, fairness and authority of the testing work, BSTTC unites the excellent blockchain security testing teams to carry out the testing work and services at the technical level. Through ""the blockchain security testing technology platform"" of the testing center, the blockchain project can operate online testing tasks, double-blind random testing, online inquiry of test results, and online evaluation. The blockchain security testing team will evaluate the code quality provided by the project, give test results and opinions, and BSTTC will perform technical certification and issue a formal test report. **6. What is the key audit of blockchain security technology testing?** a. Smart contract security audit Smart contracts are the basic important features and foundations of blockchain, while code audit is aimed at the full range of white-box security audits of smart contract sources. b. Public blockchain security audit For the key modules such as blockchain node configuration, node communication, consensus algorithm, and contract virtual machine, combined with source code, security audit is performed from the application layer, contract layer, incentive layer, consensus layer, network layer, and data layer to solve the core security issues of the public blockchain. c. Wallet security audit For each type of wallet (APP hot wallet, PC client hot wallet, browser extension hot wallet, full-node wallet), by analyzing the source code of the current application system, the audit will surpass the traditional private key architecture security and business logic security. d. Penetration testing Simulate hacker attacks to perform security tests on business systems, and discover vulnerabilities that lead to enterprise data leakage, asset damage, and data tampering to help enterprises to fix them earlier than hackers. e. Security audit of the blockchain related information systems For the blockchain related information system, such as various types of exchanges, the audit will surpass the traditional private key architecture security and business logic security. Tan Lin, member of the testing center, head of Hunan Tianheguoyun Technology Co., Ltd. said, Once a security breach occurs in a blockchain project, it may lead to serious system risks. We use the most effective formal verification method and expert team to provide audit services such as security contract code audit, contract security verification, and public chain code audit to avoid these security vulnerabilities."" **7. What are the blockchain security testing teams and their relevant technical capabilities?** The domestic excellent teams that jointly carries out blockchain security testing has a high-quality enterprise Tianheguoyun, which is located in the Xingsha Blockchain Industrial Park.

For practitioners: eliminate financial speculation projects and staffs; provide practitioners with a safety barrier to eliminate loopholes, enhance their business risk prevention capabilities, and reduce possible losses; give confidence to industry staffs. b. For investors: solving the problem of blockchain security will enable investors to more clearly and specifically understand the content of projects they invest in and the risk indicators they face to make more rational investment judgment decisions and reduce investment uncertainty. c. From a macro perspective: in terms of social benefits, it will improve the safety of blockchain operations, standardize the development of blockchain industry, and maintain social stability; in terms of political benefits, its monitoring data and reports will become the basis for national policy development to support Chinas related work in the field of Internet finance regulation; In terms of economic benefits, the project will also drive the development of blockchain security industry in Central and South China and even the whole country to create huge economic benefits. It is expected that in the next five years, BSTTC will drive the annual output value of the blockchain software testing service to reach 500 million RMB. **9. How to ensure that the results of security testing are credible?** BSTTC provides business guidance from The National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team (CNCERT), and has developed a rigorous testing workflow to ensure the authority, professionalism and fairness of testing through systems and technologies. First, the testing agencies are strictly audited, and the agencies that meet the requirements can be granted the qualification for safety testing and become the working unit. Second, the security testing of each project is to randomly select two testing institutions to conduct a double-blind review: that is, the applicant and the testing institutions do not know each other. Only the consistent conclusions of the two institutions are to produce a final conclusion. Finally, testing requests, task assignments, and results queries for all projects are automated through a specially developed online platform. Through the strict work system and advanced technical support, the credibility of the test results is guaranteed. "

65,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Limitation on security issues in blockchain technology,1,9kvyji,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9kvyji/limitation_on_security_issues_in_blockchain/,2018-10-03 09:49:07,"Presently, there are two mainly parts of the technical threats on the digital currency exchange and cryptocurrency exchange. &amp;#x200B; **1. Traditional vulnerabilities on the information system security** Intuitively, digital currency exchanges are not much different from traditional financial institutions. The entire information system incorporates web servers, back-end databases and other elements. Users use browsers, mobile apps, and APIs, which provided by exchange platform, to do the daily transaction. We can see that the security threats lie mainly in server software vulnerabilities, improper configuration, DDoS attacks, server-side web application vulnerabilities (including technical vulnerabilities and business logic defects), and malicious attack after social engineering. For those large-scale exchanges with a large number of users, there are problems that the attackers use a phishing website to obtain authentication information of users. According to the official statement, the attackers used fraudulent scams to defraud users' authentication credentials, and then use the credentials to generate a large number of transactions, and other kinds of cryptocurrencies in the user's account. The transaction became bitcoin, and the currency was found to be abnormal in time, and coin-withdraw request was hold. Interestingly, although the attacker can't raise the coin, they came up with another clever way of profiting. Using a large amount of bitcoin controlled by them to manipulate the market, affecting the price of other currencies, and then trading in another digital currency futures. The short-selling operation resulted in a profit of even more than $100 million without withdraw bitcoin. Theoretically, they did not steal the digital currency, only changed the currency. Because a large number of short orders were scattered in hundreds of exchange platforms, hardly can they be detected. Last month, a security team said that they found a zero-day vulnerability, which is a logical loophole in the entire station of a cryptocurrency exchange application. There are hundreds of small and medium-sized exchanges using the application. Although the public generally believes that large exchanges will not buy and use the whole station program developed by third-party developers, the fact that cryptocurrency industry has high profits and rapid development does attract much flood in. Actually, there are many people who want to enter the market quickly. In the digital currency industry, some individuals and teams engaged in this type of development have limited ability to guarantee product quality, which is not surprising. For the solution to this kind of security threat, it can be prevented through the penetration service, code audit and other security services. By mining and repairing the security vulnerabilities in the system, you can greatly mitigate the threat. &amp;#x200B; **2. Smart Contract Security Vulnerabilities** Ethereum is known as the ""blockchain 2.0"" technology because it supports the operation of smart contracts. First, lets take a quick review on what is Smart Contract. Smart contracts provide a chance that you can exchange money, property, shares, or anything of value in a transparent and conflict-free way while avoiding the services of a middleman. The best way to describe smart contracts is to compare the technology to a vending machine. Ordinarily, you would go to a store, wait in line for checking out, and get what you want. With smart contracts, you simply drop a bitcoin into the vending machine for something, and it will drop what you want into your account. Moreover, smart contracts not only define the rules and penalties basing on an agreement in the same way that a traditional contract does, but also automatically enforce those obligations without the interference of human beings. On the other hand, The Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM provides a runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is not only a sandbox but also completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem or other processes. In this way, a smart contract has limited access to the other smart contracts, which ensure security to some degree. Ethereum bases on the Bitcoin system plus a ""contract"" that defines the rules for reward distribution. The emergence of Ethereum provides a ready-made network of underlying blockchains on which developers can use their programming language, such as Solidity, to develop and deploy their own smart contracts, including simulating a bitcoin-like product. Due to the fact that Solidity is a complete programming language, it can theoretically be used to implement various distributed systems. After finishing the smart contract code, the code is deployed to the blockchain system and the program is executed on the EVM virtual machine of the Ethereum node. After the code is deployed to the blockchain, each node performs the consensus and synchronizes the data state. Like traditional programs, there are inevitably security vulnerabilities in smart contracts. The difference is that due to the unchangeable nature of blockchain, once the contract is deployed, it is difficult to fix the potential problem on the blockchain. For example, when token distribution contracts with vulnerabilities such as integer overflow are deployed, the vulnerability is triggered to be exploited. In a short period of time, a large number of tokens will affect the market value, which will cause huge losses for both the exchange and the users. This part of the security threat is very different from the traditional information security loophole. Similar attacks have occurred in traditional financial markets, such as the operation of Soros against the Hong Kong dollar during the Asian financial crisis of the late 20th century. The difference is that in the traditional financial market, in order to launch such an attack requires a huge amount of financial support to achieve. In the field of cryptocurrency, people with the ability to exploit potential vulnerabilities are theoretically able to achieve such an attack. The actual threat situation may be much more serious than this. The reason why smart contracts are ""smart"" is that once the chain is deployed, the execution process is transparent, can't be falsified, and no human intervention is needed, which naturally solves the trust problem in the execution process. This is also the fundamental problem we want to solve when blockchain technology appears. On the other head, if smart contract itself has a loophole and is used after the execution is started, which deviates from the original intention, the excellent characteristics of the blockchain technology will become an obstacle to save the loss. In response to this kind of security threat, the smart contract security audit work should be carried out to prevent the possible attack threats. &amp;#x200B; See more details, please find on our **Brix** Blog: [URL"

I've found about lnd, eclair, zap and other wallets but every scenario I tried to use it failed because of critical issues: * eclair does not really constitute a wallet, it's more like a credit card - you can send money but not receive it * lnd is okay, but requires a server and tons of resources for maintaining a full node, can't be used securely, efficiently and mobily at the same time * zap offers some cloud wallet (in testnet!) by default, this is a serious misunderstanding of my cryptoanarchy needs * web wallets - ah, forget it So I've decided to use my Raspberry Pi with a very old laptop HDD attached (200GB) to create a backend wallet service and zap desktop (temporarily!) as my frontend control panel. &amp;#x200B; URL Setting up Pi is easy, lots of tutorials over the internet, not gonna discuss it here.

You can generate this value with the ./share/rpcauth/rpcauth.py script in the Bitcoin Core repository. This option can be specified multiple times. rpcauth=xxx:yyy$zzz Whooaa, this online config generator is really helpful, but still had to manually correct a few things. The last line is obviously generated by rpcauth.py, I disabled the wallet functionality as lnd is going to take care of my funds. ZMQ is not available to the network so only my LND can use it, RPC usage I still have to think through a little, in general I would like to have my own block explorer some day but also be safe from any hacking attempts (thus I would need at least 2 RPC ports/user accounts - one for lnd, one for block explorer frontend). No ports open on firewall at this time, only UPnP is active and gently opens 8333 for block/tx transfers. Now, synchronizing the blockchain took me time from mid-July to the early September... The hard drive is really slow, also my external HDD drive has some trouble with its A/C adapter so Pi was getting undervoltage alerts all the time. Luckily, it is just downclocking when it happens and slowly but steadily synchronized the whole history. After all, I'm not paying even $5 monthly for a VPS, it is by design the cheapest hardware I could use to set up my LN wallet. When bitcoind was ready (I've heard some stories about btcd but I don't trust this software yet, sorry), it's time to configure lnd.conf: [Application Options] debuglevel=trace rpclisten=0.0.0.0:10009 externalip=X.X.X.X:9735 listen=0.0.0.0:9735 alias=X color=#XXXXXX [Bitcoin] bitcoin.active=1 bitcoin.mainnet=1 bitcoin.node=bitcoind [Bitcoind] bitcoind.rpchost=127.0.0.1 bitcoind.rpcuser=X bitcoind.rpcpass=X bitcoind.zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:28332 bitcoind.zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:28333 Here I've had to XXX a little more fields, as not only the bitcoind RPC credentials are stored here, but also my node's public information (it should be illegal to run nodes specifically selected color and alias!). It is public, but not necessarily connected to my reddit account for most of the adversaries, so let's keep it this way. In fact, I also see a security vulnerability here: my whole node's stability depends on the IP being static. I could swap it for a .tk domain but who can tell if the bad guys won't actively fight DNS system in order to prevent global economic revolution? As such, I would rather see node identification in LN based on a public key only with possible \*hints\* of last-known-ip-address but the whole discovery should be performed by the nodes themself in a p2p manner, obviously preventing malicious actors from poisoning the network in some way. For now, I consider the IP stability a weak link and will probably have to pay extra Bitcoin TX fees when something happens to it (not much of a cost luckily!). &amp;#x200B; URL Okay then, lnd is up and running, had to create a wallet and give it a night for getting up to speed. I don't know really what took it so long, I'm not using Windows nor 'localhost' in the config so the issues like #1027 are not the case. But there are others like #1545 still open so I'm not going to ponder much on this. I haven't really got any idea how to automatically unlock the wallet after Pi restart (could happen any time!), especially since I only tried to unlock it locally with lncli (why would I enter the password anywhere outside that host?), but let's say that my wallet will only be as stable as my cheap hardware. That's okay for the beta phase. Finally, zap-desktop required me to copy tls.cert and admin.macaroon files to my desktop. If my understanding of macaroon (it's like an authentication cookie, that can later be revoked) is correct then it's not an issue, however it would be nice to have a ""$50 daily limit"" macaroon file in the future too, just to avoid any big issues when my client machine gets stolen. Thanks to this, I can ignore the silly cloud-based modes and have fully-secure environment of my home network being the only link from me to my money. URL Aaand there it is. The IP took some time to advertise, I use [1ml.com](URL to see if my node is there. The zap interface lacks lots of useful information so I keep learning lncli syntax to get more data about my new peers or the routes offered. The transactions indeed run fast and are ridiculously cheap. I would really love to run Eclair with the same settings but it doesn't seem to support custom lnd (why?). In fact, since all I need is really a lncli wrapper, maybe it will be easy to write my own (seen some web gui which weights 700MB after downloading all dependencies with npm - SICK!). I made a few demo transactions and now I will explore all those fancy t-shirt stores as long as the prices are still in ""early investor"" mode - I remember times when one could get 0.001 BTC from a faucet... URL If you find any of the facts presented by me false, I am happy to find out more in the discussion. However what I did I did mostly for fun, without paying much attention to the source code, documentation and endless issue lists on github. By no means I claim this tutorial will work for you but I do think I shared the key points and effort estimations to help others decide if they want a full-node LN client too. I'm also interested in some ideas on what to do with it next (rather unlikely that I will share my lnd admin.macaroon with anyone!) especially if it gives me free money. For example, I can open 1000 channels and start earning money from fees, although I no longer have more Bitcoins than the LN capacity yields... I will probably keep updating the software on my Pi until it leaves beta phases and only then will pour more money inside. I'm also keen on improving the general security of my rig and those comments I will answer more seriously."

69,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Dont buy shitcoins like IOTA. Heres why:,1,9buzek,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9buzek/dont_buy_shitcoins_like_iota_heres_why/,2018-09-01 02:16:52,"In early October 2017, the iota foundation froze over 1,000 iota accounts over a vulnerability to brute force hacks. I was one of the people who had his account frozen. Im not an especially technical person, but my understanding of the vulnerability is this: When you create an iota seed, it has 81 characters. There are a total of 27 possible characters for each individual character. Therefore, to accurately brute force a wallet, you would need to guess on average 27 to the power of 81 times, which is a huge number. The issue is that for whatever reason, when you send an iota transaction you broadcast half of the private key, which is derived from this seed somehow. No one talked about this at the time, and it certainly wasnt widely talked about by anyone associated with the foundation and there were no warnings on the GUI wallet. Still, even if half of the key is exposed, it would require quite a lot of computing power and time to brute force the rest of the key, and only with two or more spends would a key really likely be compromised. In my case, I watched a video on YouTube, thought IOTA sounded interesting, bought some from a friend who was in another country (it was only listed on bitfinex at the time, and I didnt have access.) I sent him a little bit of iota back as a tip and he said naw, I dont need your stupid tip and sent it back. It seemed like a normal crypto experience and I figured my coins were reasonably safe in what felt like a desktop wallet and I didnt think about it. 3 months passed and iota went on a crazy pump to roughly $5 and I was up thousands of dollars. I looked at my portfolio and decided to sell it. I logged in with my seed and began a long and shitty process. I couldnt see my balance. I read that I should try to reattach 100+ times to get it to reappear (due to tangle pruning). I did so, but only recovered a few miotas out of about 1.5k (the worthless tip that I sent my friend). Then I learned about the reclaim process. I learned that my account was frozen. I tried to complete it but I couldnt get a transaction through. The network was basically collapsed under spam and only full nodes could process transactions. I wasted a full day trying to figure this out and finally gave up and decided to wait. I was working 60 hour weeks at my day job and didnt have time to fix this. I missed my opportunity to sell. Months passed and I tried again. I couldnt get a transaction through. I figured that my laptop was shit, so I bought a desktop for the purpose of processing this reclaim transaction and for other crypto purposes. I still couldnt get a transaction to confirm. Baffled, I said fuck it and gave up for a few more months. Finally I discovered that there was a website to make these transactions actually process. In June or July, with the help of a community member (not the Iota Foundation who seized my money), I was able to get my reclaim transactions submitted. Since then, I have been waiting. It has been almost a year since I bought my iota. I should have been able to sell my iota at $4-5, but wasnt able to because the iota foundation seized my funds, along with those of many other investors who also could have sold at a high price. Heres where the question of fraud comes in. Did Foundation insiders sell during this period of restricted supply? I dont have access to the full tangle to try to find their addresses due to the nature of how the tangle is pruned. That information is stored by the foundation. I have asked foundation members if they were selling during this period, and have received no reply. Those of us who lost money because of this reclaim debacle deserve to be made whole. If the foundation cannot do this, it should disbanded. This potential fraud needs to be investigated. This is why decentralization matters. TLDR: Dont but centralized shitcoins like iota, even if they sound good and have corporate backing or whatever. The Iota foundation might have committed fraud by freezing potential sellers accounts while insiders were dumping."
70,vulnerability,Bitcoin,FAQ about Bitcoin(3),3,9d3o83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/9d3o83/faq_about_bitcoin3/,2018-09-05 16:13:03," **Transactions** [FMZ](URL **Why do I have to wait for confirmation?** Receiving notification of a payment is almost instant with Bitcoin. However, there is a delay before the network begins to confirm your transaction by including it in a block. A confirmation means that there is a consensus on the network that the bitcoins you received haven't been sent to anyone else and are considered your property. Once your transaction has been included in one block, it will continue to be buried under every block after it, which will exponentially consolidate this consensus and decrease the risk of a reversed transaction. Each confirmation takes between a few seconds and 90 minutes, with 10 minutes being the average. If the transaction pays too low a fee or is otherwise atypical, getting the first confirmation can take much longer. Every user is free to determine at what point they consider a transaction sufficiently confirmed, but [6 confirmations](URL is often considered to be as safe as waiting 6 months on a credit card transaction. **How much will the transaction fee be?** Transactions can be processed without fees, but trying to send free transactions can require waiting days or weeks. Although fees may increase over time, normal fees currently only cost a tiny amount. By default, all [Bitcoin wallets](URL listed on [URL add what they think is an appropriate fee to your transactions; most of those wallets will also give you chance to review the fee before sending the transaction. Transaction fees are used as a protection against users sending transactions to overload the network and as a way to pay miners for their work helping to secure the network. The precise manner in which fees work is still being developed and will change over time. Because the fee is not related to the amount of bitcoins being sent, it may seem extremely low or unfairly high. Instead, the fee is relative to the number of bytes in the transaction, so using multisig or spending multiple previously-received amounts may cost more than simpler transactions. If your activity follows the pattern of conventional transactions, you won't have to pay unusually high fees. **What if I receive a bitcoin when my computer is powered off?** This works fine. The bitcoins will appear next time you start your wallet application. Bitcoins are not actually received by the software on your computer, they are appended to a public ledger that is shared between all the devices on the network. If you are sent bitcoins when your wallet client program is not running and you later launch it, it will download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about, and the bitcoins will eventually appear as if they were just received in real time. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend bitcoins. **What does ""synchronizing"" mean and why does it take so long?** Long synchronization time is only required with full node clients like Bitcoin Core. Technically speaking, synchronizing is the process of downloading and verifying all previous Bitcoin transactions on the network. For some Bitcoin clients to calculate the spendable balance of your Bitcoin wallet and make new transactions, it needs to be aware of all previous transactions. This step can be resource intensive and requires sufficient bandwidth and storage to accommodate the full size of the block chain. For Bitcoin to remain secure, enough people should keep using full node clients because they perform the task of validating and relaying transactions. **Mining** [**FMZ**](URL **What is Bitcoin mining?** Mining is the process of spending computing power to process transactions, secure the network, and keep everyone in the system synchronized together. It can be perceived like the Bitcoin data center except that it has been designed to be fully decentralized with miners operating in all countries and no individual having control over the network. This process is referred to as ""mining"" as an analogy to gold mining because it is also a temporary mechanism used to issue new bitcoins. Unlike gold mining, however, Bitcoin mining provides a reward in exchange for useful services required to operate a secure payment network. Mining will still be required after the last bitcoin is issued. **How does Bitcoin mining work?** Anybody can become a Bitcoin miner by running software with specialized hardware. Mining software listens for transactions broadcast through the peer-to-peer network and performs appropriate tasks to process and confirm these transactions. Bitcoin miners perform this work because they can earn transaction fees paid by users for faster transaction processing, and newly created bitcoins issued into existence according to a fixed formula. For new transactions to be confirmed, they need to be included in a block along with a mathematical proof of work. Such proofs are very hard to generate because there is no way to create them other than by trying billions of calculations per second. This requires miners to perform these calculations before their blocks are accepted by the network and before they are rewarded. As more people start to mine, the difficulty of finding valid blocks is automatically increased by the network to ensure that the average time to find a block remains equal to 10 minutes. As a result, mining is a very competitive business where no individual miner can control what is included in the block chain. The proof of work is also designed to depend on the previous block to force a chronological order in the block chain. This makes it exponentially difficult to reverse previous transactions because this requires the recalculation of the proofs of work of all the subsequent blocks. When two blocks are found at the same time, miners work on the first block they receive and switch to the longest chain of blocks as soon as the next block is found. This allows mining to secure and maintain a global consensus based on processing power. Bitcoin miners are neither able to cheat by increasing their own reward nor process fraudulent transactions that could corrupt the Bitcoin network because all Bitcoin nodes would reject any block that contains invalid data as per the rules of the Bitcoin protocol. Consequently, the network remains secure even if not all Bitcoin miners can be trusted. **Isn't Bitcoin mining a waste of energy?** Spending energy to secure and operate a payment system is hardly a waste. Like any other payment service, the use of Bitcoin entails processing costs. Services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks, credit cards, and armored vehicles, also use a lot of energy. Although unlike Bitcoin, their total energy consumption is not transparent and cannot be as easily measured. Bitcoin mining has been designed to become more optimized over time with specialized hardware consuming less energy, and the operating costs of mining should continue to be proportional to demand. When Bitcoin mining becomes too competitive and less profitable, some miners choose to stop their activities. Furthermore, all energy expended mining is eventually transformed into heat, and the most profitable miners will be those who have put this heat to good use. An optimally efficient mining network is one that isn't actually consuming any extra energy. While this is an ideal, the economics of mining are such that miners individually strive toward it. **How does mining help secure Bitcoin?** [**FMZ**](URL Mining creates the equivalent of a competitive lottery that makes it very difficult for anyone to consecutively add new blocks of transactions into the block chain. This protects the neutrality of the network by preventing any individual from gaining the power to block certain transactions. This also prevents any individual from replacing parts of the block chain to roll back their own spends, which could be used to defraud other users. Mining makes it exponentially more difficult to reverse a past transaction by requiring the rewriting of all blocks following this transaction. **What do I need to start mining?** In the early days of Bitcoin, anyone could find a new block using their computer's CPU. As more and more people started mining, the difficulty of finding new blocks increased greatly to the point where the only cost-effective method of mining today is using specialized hardware. You can visit [BitcoinMining.com](URL for more information. ![img](q6krsohm3dk11 ""URL **Security** [**FMZ**](URL **Is Bitcoin secure?** The Bitcoin technology - the protocol and the cryptography - has a strong security track record, and the Bitcoin network is probably the biggest distributed computing project in the world. Bitcoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. Bitcoin wallet files that store the necessary private keys can be accidentally deleted, lost or stolen. This is pretty similar to physical cash stored in a digital form. Fortunately, users can employ sound [security practices](URL to protect their money or use service providers that offer good levels of security and insurance against theft or loss. **Hasn't Bitcoin been hacked in the past?** The rules of the protocol and the cryptography used for Bitcoin are still working years after its inception, which is a good indication that the concept is well designed. However, [security flaws](URL have been found and fixed over time in various software implementations. Like any other form of software, the security of Bitcoin software depends on the speed with which problems are found and fixed. The more such issues are discovered, the more Bitcoin is gaining maturity. There are often misconceptions about thefts and security breaches that happened on diverse exchanges and businesses. Although these events are unfortunate, none of them involve Bitcoin itself being hacked, nor imply inherent flaws in Bitcoin; just like a bank robbery doesn't mean that the dollar is compromised. However, it is accurate to say that a complete set of good practices and intuitive security solutions is needed to give users better protection of their money, and to reduce the general risk of theft and loss. Over the course of the last few years, such security features have quickly developed, such as wallet encryption, offline wallets, hardware wallets, and multi-signature transactions. **Could users collude against Bitcoin?** [**FMZ**](URL It is not possible to change the Bitcoin protocol that easily. Any Bitcoin client that doesn't comply with the same rules cannot enforce their own rules on other users. As per the current specification, double spending is not possible on the same block chain, and neither is spending bitcoins without a valid signature. Therefore, it is not possible to generate uncontrolled amounts of bitcoins out of thin air, spend other users' funds, corrupt the network, or anything similar. However, powerful miners could arbitrarily choose to block or reverse recent transactions. A majority of users can also put pressure for some changes to be adopted. Because Bitcoin only works correctly with a complete consensus between all users, changing the protocol can be very difficult and requires an overwhelming majority of users to adopt the changes in such a way that remaining users have nearly no choice but to follow. As a general rule, it is hard to imagine why any Bitcoin user would choose to adopt any change that could compromise their own money. **Is Bitcoin vulnerable to quantum computing?** Yes, most systems relying on cryptography in general are, including traditional banking systems. However, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. In the event that [quantum computing](URL could be an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use post-quantum algorithms. Given the importance that this update would have, it can be safely expected that it would be highly reviewed by developers and adopted by all Bitcoin users. [FMZ](URL"

I have some questions regarding the potential for an attacker to obtain a developer's commit access to the Bitcoin software. I'm not a software developer so I may not understand the way that the process works. Be gentle... So my theoretical scenario is as follows. As Bitcoin grows and becomes a significant financial force in the world it becomes a high value target for a terrorist organization that wants to disrupt the financial system. Said organization waits until a release of a new version of Bitcoin is imminent. They compromise a core developer, obtain commit access and insert malicious code just prior to the release of the new software. The software is put in production by nodes, miners etc. and has a significant negative effect on the network or stops it from functioning altogether. While I'm sure that there are people out there that test the newly released software in isolation prior to putting it in production one would also think that there are people that simply upgrade and run it without looking at it or testing it. Is this not a likely scenario because more than one developer with commit access has to authorize a final software release and would notice the malicious code? If not is this a potential problem? If it isn't a potential problem why not? If it is a potential problem is there something being discussed that would make it unlikely or impossible?"

74,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Bitfi Hardware Wallet,0,8ueumf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8ueumf/bitfi_hardware_wallet/,2018-06-28 10:33:50,"I posted a link to a website on the Bitcoin and Monero subreddit last week on a new type of cryptocurrency hardware storage. My post was criticized heavily by its readers, most providing little to no information to back their opinions. Rather than to argue blatantly I decided to construct my own due diligence to hopefully create an open conversation about crypto wallet security on this subreddit. Therefore I will provide an in-depth analysis of the Bitfi hardware wallet based on all information publicly available. As a disclaimer, I am not an affiliate with Bitfi, and all related references used in this post will be added below. Despite all the negative headlines Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have received over past decade these digital assets have increased in tremendous popularity and price. Its usability revolutionized the way value is stored, transferred, and exchanged. The intrinsic benefit of this new technology led to an explosive innovative growth in both computing hardware, and many other blockchain-based assets that operate within a highly secure digital infrastructure. The functionality and authenticity of these blockchain assets come at no debate, however with the growing number of users an issue still remains of where to properly store coins/tokens from either being lost or stolen. In the article, 'The Most Comprehensive Cryptocurrency Wallet Guide', written by Simona Vaitkune on Medium gives a detailed breakdown on the five types of digital asset storage options including online, mobile, desktop, hardware, and paper wallets. The general concept of digital wallets is to allow users to virtually store their cryptocurrencies, which are secured by a public and private key. These wallets heavily differentiate from each other based on levels of security protection which depends upon several key aspects including hot/cold wallets, anonymity, and multi-feature security layers including two-factor authentication (2FA), multi-sig, backup files (12- 24 word recovery seed), and software updates. Hot wallets are meant for instant use and are only accessible if linked by an Internet connection to use on exchanges, desktop, or mobile applications. Digital assets stored on hot wallets exemplify the greatest potential risk for unrecoverable funds. The security of hot wallets is mainly dependent upon the security habits of the individual holder and third parties themselves. They are considered most vulnerable based on prior evidence from exchange server hacks, phishing scams, and computer vulnerability as well if broken, stolen, or infected with malware. Cold wallets refer to a type of storage that is not connected to the Internet and can be secured using different facets such as a hardware device, paper, and even brain wallets. Its access resides offline until manually retrieving the private key using a pin, mnemonic phrase, or both. Long-term funds are likely to be held in cold wallet storage and by far the safest option in regards to security. Bitfi is a global payments technology company based in the US that enables businesses and consumers to securely participate in a decentralized economy. Their mission is to accelerate the growth and adoption of digital assets. This past week the company released their Knox hardware wallet focusing mainly on user-friendliness and air-gapped security. When visiting the homepage of the Bitfi website they state its the worlds first un-hackable device, and seeing this as someone who has been in the computer space for over 15 years it can bring a sense of unease. Ignoring the fact that they supposedly have John Mcafe now on their team, let us dig in further to what makes this device so remarkable. The transition of storing cryptocurrencies on any type of cold wallet can seem highly technical for someone who is inexperienced with encryption technology. If sets of rules are not followed funds can be lost forever. Bitfi intends on making this easier and safer for the average individual. Instead of having to write down a 24-word mnemonic phrase or separate private keys for each coin, and then worrying on how to safely store it from theft or damage. Bitfi created an algorithm, which acts similar to a brain wallet giving a user the freedom to make a long unique phrase they can easily remember (for example: Ilovemyjobbecausetheypayme@5) will be specific for them and impossible to guess or brute force. Unlike popular cryptocurrency hardware devices such as Trezor or Ledger Nano S, the Bitfi Knox wallets DO NOT store the user's private keys in the hardware. If the Bitfi Knox device is stolen or seized and then taken apart the keys are unable to be retrieved. Since there are no private keys are stored on the device there is also no potential for a man in the middle or distribution attack that can occur where a user's keys are stolen prior to actually receiving the device. We saw this happen when unfortunate consumers purchased the Ledger Nano S from 3rd party sellers this past year. As explained by CEO Daniel Khesin, the Bitfi Knox wallet is not a storage device but rather a separate CPU running calculations for their open sourced algorithm. A secret phrase the user created will calculate the private key to sign for transactions made on the Bitfi dashboard. The device will also update automatically to the latest firmware when connected to Wi-Fi, and routes to company node that allows a user to view all their balances on the device. Bitfi will also release an app on the phone that will work with the Knox wallet to allow their users to purchase products and services on the go. The device itself has a smartphone type of look to it with an LED Touchscreen, multi-currency support, dashboard and other additional customizable features. Bitfi plans on continually integrating blockchain assets every few weeks. They currently support Bitcoin, Ethereum (ERC20 tokens), EOS, NEO/GAS, Litecoin, and lastly Monero being the first company to functionally implement the popular privacy coin on their wallet without additional downloads from Github. On their webpage, it looks as if the wallet already went on sale, and within a short period of time sold out entirely. In my opinion, I have never heard of a hardware wallet that performs like this so I am interested in purchasing one just to see if Bitfi Knox succeeds in its functional promise.

80,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Bitcoin vulnerability exposed (transaction time),0,7lnari,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7lnari/bitcoin_vulnerability_exposed_transaction_time/,2017-12-23 18:03:55,"After this whole BTC correction that may or might not still be ongoing it has me questioning BTC's and crypto currencies long term future. I think for the past few months we have noticed the influx of interest into crypto especially bitcoin. It seems that bitcoin and cryptos as a whole is starting to not be a niche product but started to become more mainstream. But with this influx we saw a huge backlog and expensive transaction fees. If bitcoin is going to survive I feel it needs to fix this problem and fix it quickly. I know the LN is coming soon, but anything longer than 6 months I feel is too late. There are a lot of other coins (thinking LTC) that does what BTC does but better, and I personally believe that if BTC loses its market dominance its going to send a dangerous precedent and message to investors. If bitcoin can be overthrown so easily then what stops something else from taking over the new coin and so on and so on. It would potentially send the message that no coin has lasting power and all of this was speculation and then we start venturing on which coin will be the new leader, or flavor of the month. I personally love the idea of not relying on the banks or institutions to move money and the whole trust in numbers, but there are major flaws with bitcoin. I think this problem is going to be exacerbated the more mainstream bitcoin becomes. I don't want the idea to die, but I also am not the most educated bitcoin person. Can someone please tell me how this community and the dev team is going to address this problem? Thanks for reading!"
81,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Questions about the security model of LN,9,7nu6zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7nu6zl/questions_about_the_security_model_of_ln/,2018-01-03 22:57:29,"I've been looking into the inner workings of the lightning network for awhile now, and I've come across two security concerns. I want to know if there are solutions to the following two potential issues: -In order to run a lightning network hub or receive payments on the lightning network, my keys must be autonomously accessible to an Internet-facing service. -If my computer crashes, all of my funds since the last blockchain commit (channel close) are lost. If the first is true, that means you cannot store your funds on the LN network offline, the hardware-wallet style security model is impossible here. If a software vulnerability is found in a particular implementation of the LN and this vulnerability allows an attacker to steal funds, it could be financially devastating for anyone/everyone running that LN implementation. What is being done to address this? Will users be expected to run a standalone machine with a minimal attack surface in an attempt to minimize the risk, as well as trust that enough testing has been put into the LN that these sort of vulnerabilities will almost never be discovered (security by correctness)? Regarding the second issue, the obvious solution is to commit each state to disk. However, this still poses an issue if your hard drive crashes. You'll have to have an external, or cloud backup, of each ""state"" (whenever you receive money, whether it's for yourself or someone else if you're a hub) or risk losing your money if your hard drive crashes. Historically, with on-chain scaling, this wasn't an issue, as this ""cloud backup"" was simply the blockchain. Will this sort of backup functionality be automatically built in to LN? Can we store transaction states in a more scalable, decentralized way (I've heard of SPECTRE, block-trees, and tangles that could maybe solve this)? Having to manage the attack-surface like your average sys-admin and manually setting up backups would be too much for the UX I feel."

Banks are there for a reason* In banks, due to its inherent structure, there is possibility for rollbacks. Manual overrides. Security can always be broken, hence the need for manual overrides. *3. Transparency is not something we desire in reality* Studies were done that most big nodes can be identified and with enough internet shopping and data leaks at some point everybody is going to know how much money their neighbour has. *4. Cause of climate change* Bitcoin should use less energy than fiat, not more, as in its current form. *5. Current use: criminal activity &amp; tax evasion* I don't want to support criminal activities. Still, this is the weakest argument since this could also been said about fiat. So, stop with bitcoin?

85,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Critical Electrum vulnerability,462,7ooack,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ooack/critical_electrum_vulnerability/,2018-01-07 14:40:30,"A vulnerability was [found](URL in the Electrum wallet software which potentially allows random websites to steal your wallet via JavaScript. If you don't use Electrum, then you are not affected and you can ignore this. Action steps: 1. If you are running Electrum, **shut it down right this second**. 2. Upgrade to [3.0.4](URL (making sure to verify the PGP signature). You don't necessarily need to *rush* to upgrade. In fact, in cases like this it can be prudent to wait a while just to make sure that everything is settled. The important thing is to not *use* the old versions. If you have an old version sitting somewhere not being used, then it is harmless as long as you do not forget to upgrade it before using it again later. If at any point in the past you: * Had Electrum open with no wallet passphrase set; and, * Had a webpage open Then it is *possible* that your wallet is already compromised. Particularly paranoid people might want to send all of the BTC in their old Electrum wallet to a newly-generated Electrum wallet. (Though probably if someone has your wallet, then they already would've stolen all of the BTC in it...) This was just fixed hours ago. The Electrum developer will presumably post more detailed info and instructions in the near future. **Update 1**: If you had no wallet password set, then theft is trivial. If you had a somewhat-decent wallet password set, then it seems that an attacker could ""only"" get address/transaction info from your wallet and change your Electrum settings, the latter of which seems to me to have a high chance of being exploitable further. So if you had a wallet password set, you can reduce your panic by a few notches, but you should still treat this very seriously."

I had 2FA enabled. I had 12-word seeds on Mac OS/Linux. I thought I was invulnerable. But my love of the Warriors basketball and cord-cutting got the best of me. sportsarefree.xyz is a sports streaming website that played a super LONG con. This is how it worked: They streamed every basketball game and every football game for free, even a WWE channel 24/7. I knew it was too good to be true, and you know what? It almost was. While I have no love for hehestreams or other $100 paid services, I saw no other option. As an aside, I believe NBA League Pass needs to figure out how to monetize their streams using crypto to cut out middle men and trim the fat from their lucrative TV blackout deals and charge everyone a more reasonable fee for League Pass. So until that day, sportsforfree was my drug. Then, all of a sudden, they stopped streaming games by saying the NFL and the NBA figured them out and learned how to block their streams. The mod on the chat box suggested in a real smooth way that we anons install HLS Magic, a new streaming codec. This was actually not their first time doing this, but somehow I managed to escape the first Chrome extension I was duped into installing. Here's how they did it: they used a vulnerability in the Chrome developer protocol called CORS. HLS Magic was the trojan horse for a keylogger. Now, normally I would be much more secure in Mac OS but I let. them. in. In my stupidity, I installed Clappr using the Terminal. Clappr was an insecure Github repo that took forever to install, but I thought I was genius when I finally figured out how to use it. After all, I was able to watch the 49ers get back to their Quest For Six, and Jimmy Garoppolo caused me to forget all of my hacky computer foibles. So I decided to wash my digital identity as much as possible. It was a panic fest for a while. I learned from /r/bitcoin that even though Bitcoin is unusable with long confirmation times and high fees, that it is still fucking stupid to use the same phone number for my credit card and Coinbase. It doubles the attack vectors when really you can keep them separate and more secure with Google Authenticator and 1Password with Touch ID. Using my Google Voice number, they could have gained access to my Gmail using SMS and a temporary phone number. They could even go as far as looking in the Gmail trash bin because those old emails from whenever Coinbase or Bitstamp tells you to login dont disappear until you DELETE them from trash. You have no idea how many old emails reveal your activities. Please learn from me and make crypto more secure. Or else more thefts will scare people away from digital wallets. Take your computer security seriously. Don't fuck with free sports websites. And don't fuck with Steph Curry. He is the only Skyfucker worth all my crypto. (Throwaway for obvious reasons) Edit: remember to revoke all access to third party APIs that require too much info. Especially CORS."

Bitcoin could be vulnerable to a limited double spend and block reorganization attack if 51% of the miners colluded against the best interests of Bitcoin. Even with a 51% attack the damage could be mitigated; it would hurt confidence in the system; but the system would continue functioning normally after routing out the malicious actors. Banks however are vulnerable to systemic failure with a simple 10% attack. Most of us here are well aware of fractional reserve banking which allows banks to create 10x more money in loans than they have on deposit; sometimes more. If just 10% of the money were to be withdrawn as cash we would would witness a global economic meltdown of unprecedented proportions. People wouldn't simply lose some confidence in banks; contagion would spread and the legacy financial system we all know would come crumbling down all across the world; plunging the world into economic uncertainty and perhaps even precipitating major global conflict. Kind of crazy to think about. Billions of people all around the world dependent on this system, and all it takes to bring it all down is 10% of the money to be taken out. Considering wealth distribution is hardly equal that 10% of the money could represent a few thousand people. The entire world economy could come crashing down if just a few thousand of the wealthiest people of the world decide they don't want to work with the legacy financial system anymore.

Then, in order to not be suspicious, 99% of the time it does nothing. With a 1% chance, it replaces the address with one that it can later redeem the money from, hoping that you would send money to it. Like the pastebin document reveals, it can just look in the page for any publicly available information: a block/tx hash, an existing address (hoping that it had been used before), ... Note that again, address reuse adds vulnerability here. Just to say that there are a lot of chrome extensions that have access to all pages you visit and are free to inject any code they want.

A technical discussion about why the situation is like it is would maybe provide a helpful antidote for people considering bch over btc. &gt;Rather than reduce its protocol messages to be as few as possible, each Bitcoin-running computer sprays the Internet with a redundantly large number of inventory vector packets to make very sure that all messages get accurately through to as many other Bitcoin computers as possible. As a result, the Bitcoin blockchain cannot process as many transactions per second as a traditional payment network such as PayPal or Visa. Bitcoin offends the sensibilities of resource-conscious and performance-measure-maximizing engineers and businessmen alike. &gt; &gt;Instead, the secret to Bitcoins success is that its prolific resource consumption and poor computational scalability is buying something even more valuable: social scalability. Social scalability is the ability of an institution - a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate, and featuring customs, rules, or other features which constrain or motivate participants behaviors -- to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate. Social scalability is about the ways and extents to which participants can think about and respond to institutions and fellow participants as the variety and numbers of participants in those institutions or relationships grow. &gt; &gt;Whereas the main social scalability benefit of the Internet has been matchmaking, the predominant direct social scalability benefit of blockchains is trust minimization. &gt; &gt;Scalable markets and prices require scalable money. Scalable money requires scalable security, so that a greater number and variety of people can use the currency without losing its integrity against forgery, inflation, and theft. &gt; &gt;Satoshis breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary. &gt; &gt;When we can secure the most important functionality of a financial network by computer science rather than by the traditional accountants, regulators, investigators, police, and lawyers, we go from a system that is manual, local, and of inconsistent security to one that is automated, global, and much more secure. Cryptocurrencies, when implemented properly on public blockchains, can substitute an army of computers for a large number of traditional banking bureaucrats. &gt; &gt;In computer science there are fundamental security versus performance tradeoffs. Bitcoin's automated integrity comes at high costs in its performance and resource usage. Nobody has discovered any way to greatly increase the computational scalability of the Bitcoin blockchain, for example its transaction throughput, and demonstrated that this improvement does not compromise Bitcoins security. &gt; &gt; It is probable that no such big but integrity-preserving performance improvement is possible for the Bitcoin blockchain; this may be one of these unavoidable tradeoffs. Compared to existing financial IT, Satoshi made radical tradeoffs in favor of security and against performance. The seemingly wasteful process of mining is the most obvious of these tradeoffs, but Bitcoin also makes others. Among them is that it requires high redundancy in its messaging. Mathematically provable integrity would require full broadcast between all nodes. Bitcoin cant achieve that but to even get anywhere close to a good approximation of it requires a very high level of redundancy. So a 1 MB block consumes far more resources than a 1 MB web page, because it has to be transmitted, processed, and stored with high redundancy for Bitcoin to achieve its automated integrity. &gt; &gt;These necessary tradeoffs, sacrificing performance in order to achieve the security necessary for independent, seamlessly global, and automated integrity, mean that the Bitcoin blockchain itself cannot possibly come anywhere near Visa transaction-per-second numbers and maintain the automated integrity that creates its distinctive advantages versus these traditional financial systems. Instead, a less trust-minimized peripheral payment network (possibly Lightning ) will be needed to bear a larger number of lower-value bitcoin-denominated transactions than Bitcoin blockchain is capable of, using the Bitcoin blockchain to periodically settle with one high-value transaction batches of peripheral network transactions. &gt; &gt; Bitcoin supports a lower rate transactions than Visa or PayPal, but due to its stronger automated security these can be much more important transactions. Anybody with a decent Internet connection and a smart phone who can pay $0.20-$2 transaction fees  substantially lower than current remitance fees -- can access Bitcoin any where on the globe. Lower value transactions with lower fees will need to be implemented on peripheral bitcoin networks. &gt; &gt;When it comes to small-b bitcoin, the currency, there is nothing impossible about paying retail with bitcoin the way youd pay with a fiat currency  bitcoin-denominated credit and debt cards, for example, with all the chargeback and transactions-per-second capabilities of a credit or debit card. And there are also clever ways to do peripheral bitcoin retail payments in which small value payments happen off-chain and are only periodically bulk-settled on the Capital-B Bitcoin blockchain. That blockchain is going to evolve into a high-value settlement layer as bitcoin use grows, and we will see peripheral networks being used for small-b bitcoin retail transactions. &gt; &gt;We need more socially scalable ways to securely count nodes, or to put it another way to with as much robustness against corruption as possible, assess contributions to securing the integrity of a blockchain. That is what proof-of-work and broadcast-replication are about: greatly sacrificing computational scalability in order to improve social scalability. That is Satoshis brilliant tradeoff. It is brilliant because humans are far more expensive than computers and that gap widens further each year. And it is brilliant because it allows one to seamlessly and securely work across human trust boundaries (e.g. national borders), in contrast to call-the-cop architectures like PayPal and Visa that continually depend on expensive, error-prone, and sometimes corruptible bureaucracies to function with a reasonable amount of integrity. &gt; &gt;Blockchain technology, which implements data integrity via computer science rather than via call the cops, has so far made possible trust-minimized money -- cryptocurrencies  and will let us make progress in other financial areas as well as other areas where transactions can be based primarily on data available online. &gt; &gt;This is not to say that adapting our institutions to our new capabilities will be easy, or indeed in particular cases anything short of difficult and improbable. Utopian schemes are very popular in the blockchain community, but they are not viable options. Reverse-engineering our highly evolved traditional institutions, and even reviving in new form some old ones, will usually work better than designing from scratch, than grand planning and game theory. One important strategy for doing so was demonstrated by Satoshi  sacrifice computational efficiency and scalability -- consume more cheap computational resources -- in order to reduce and better leverage the great expense in human resources needed to maintain the relationships between strangers involved modern institutions such as markets, large firms, and governments.

July of this year, I lost all my worldly possessions in a house fire. The house is gone. Wife and kids, okay. Thank God. But everything else was a total loss. My PC with my bitcoins (more than a half, less than a whole) are lost. I had the wallet encrypted and backed up to a flash drive. Gone. I've been loosely involved with bitcoin since 2010. I am one of those people that had tens of thousands at one point. I found it fascinating. But never had that HODL in my gut like some of you. But, I did finally hold onto a little bit. Before the fire, the coins had doubled in price. Being gone from the community for a year or so, I had some catching up to do, and Bitcoin actually had some amazing stuff going on. Now, the fire was not started by mining. I can assure you that. The fire was electrical, but started in a different room than the computer was in. I mentioned I played with bitcoin back in the day. In November 2010, I did some testing on the testnet that showed that there was a huge spamming vulnerability. Gavin Anderson, Jeff Garzick, and Satoshi all weighed in on what I said, but they said it wasn't a priority. So, what I did next, not being proud of, I flooded the main net with 0.01 BTC transactions for a couple of days. Satoshi committed SVN Rev 185 changing how free transactions were prioritized. Not necessarily my proudest moment, but I got my point across with a few lines of python and some donated bitcoin. We were very poorly insured. We've taken a 6 figure hit on our home and belongings, and are in a rental home at Christmas time. If anyone can learn ANYTHING from my nightmare, is a backup of your wallet means NOTHING if it's in the same location as the original. Secured, offsite, something. Don't be me. Secure your bitcoin. I wish I could get back in on this, but I have other priorities at the moment. God bless you all, and HODL!"
97,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Transaction fees are getting ridiculous.,236,7juak3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7juak3/transaction_fees_are_getting_ridiculous/,2017-12-15 07:10:37,"I cant believe how many people are complaining about them. Everyone knows Bitcoin is **not ready** to be used to buy a coffee, yet I constantly see posts like: &gt;I tried to send my cousin Timmy $5 and the fee was $4! What gives?!?! Bitcoin is completely unusable! Since the masses on this sub continue to whine about issues we all know about, I thought Id share some things to consider regarding transaction fees. **Do you want your Bitcoin to go up 500%?** If Bitcoin was perfect and we could transact around the world cheaply, it would not have the explosive price growth it has currently. It would be adopted everywhere, and would stabilize. You are getting great returns because of how early you have adopted the technology. Because you are in early, you will have to deal with growing pains, and tx fees are one of them. If you invested in AirBnB now, your returns would not be terrific. Why? They are already a market leader; the investment is incredibly safe. If you invested in them when they were renting out air mattresses, you would have made a killing. Thats because they didnt have the best technology *yet*, or the adoption to go with it. **Average transaction size on-chain is around $15,000** Getting your transaction into a block can be thought of as an auction-like process. Whoever pays the most will get their tx confirmed faster. This is a very fair process. The currency average transaction size on-chain is around $15,000. A $20 fee for that transaction size would represent just over a 10th of 1%. . When you cant buy an ice cream cone without paying a higher fee, remember that there are many others transacting substantial amounts of Bitcoin that will outbid you to get confirmed quicker. For them, $20 is nothing. **Is Lightning network the solution?** It could be, but we dont completely know that yet. Its one of the proposed solutions that appears very promising. Its been testing well, and *could* allow you to buy your ice cream without paying a substantial fee. If Lightning is not the answer for whatever reason, something else will be. Bitcoin is far too valuable (market cap $275B USD as I write this) to not figure scaling out. It might be a longer road, but there are steps we can take in the meantime to lower our tx fees. **Coinbase has not implemented SegWit** We have a scaling solution that will make transactions cost less, and its called SegWit. There is one serious flaw with it though: if you dont use SegWit, you cant get the benefits of SegWit. Such a pain in the ass, I know, but there are things you *can do* to help drive adoption. Pressure Coinbase to add SegWit, like u/pitrucha [suggested earlier today]( URL If the largest exchange wont implement a scaling solution we have, then we cant expect that scaling solution to positively affect the network. SegWit adoption is [currently below 10%](URL This is a big reason why transactions are more expensive. **Wont Bitcoin lose all its value if we dont make it completely scalable immediately?** This is pure speculation (and Im not an investment advisor), but I think not. Unless fiat currencies or other altcoins are able to solve all of the problems Bitcoin intends to fix in the meantime, we should be just alright. Bitcoin is a technology. Technology takes time, and if it was perfect it would already cost $1m per coin. Building it right is more important than building it fast. A strong foundation is the most important thing right now. **2 examples of crappy code harming a network** DAO  Ethereum allows developers to build dApps on their platform. DAO was one of those apps. Long story short, The DAO was hacked and Ether was stolen. Ethereum had to be hard-forked to return the stolen Ether to the DAO, so it could be returned to users. This was not a vulnerability with Ethereum, but one created by a solution running on the Ethereum network. If Bitcoin was entrusted to poor development like the DAO, something equally as negative could happen. Its important that we build slowly to make sure that security is being taken as seriously as possible. Nobody wants to lose their Bitcoin. SegWit 2X  SegWit2X was a proposed hard-fork of Bitcoin with no native replay protection, and it was aiming to take development of Bitcoin away from the core team. This was a temporary scaling solution (block size increase), which the backers proposed would solve the current tx fee issues Bitcoin was dealing with. The SegWit 2X fork never happened because the developer (Jeff Gardzik) improperly coded the fork  it never deployed, and a major potential disaster was averted. **So what should you do if you have high transaction fees and NEED to talk about them?** Discuss the issues rationally, and also include a **potential solution**. Otherwise youre just complaining, and nobody wants that. Shoutout to u/chazley who earlier today [discussed a potential fix]( URL for scaling issues along with a discussion about tx fees. This is what we come here for, not to hear how youre crushed that you cant transact $10 cheaply across the Bitcoin network. "

Jameson responds by saying that SPV is not where we want it to be in terms of security as full nodes might be lying to SPV clients. I don't understand this as a serious issue. Nodes can lie by omission sure... but they cannot make a SPV node think it received a payment when its not the fact. A SPV node can fully and independantly validate a transaction by requesting a merkle branch. If the merkle branch checks out but the transaction is indeed not on the bitcoin main chain the full node needs to create a fabricated chain at high expense which is a problem for full nodes in any case. This is the same issue as for full nodes mitigated by burying the transaction under additional blocks/confirmations. In short - where is the real deal breaker in terms of SPV scaling supported by at least a few thousand full nodes.

Current uses cases like usenet subscriptions, vpn subscriptions and licenses for games can all wait for a confirmation to finial the transaction. Merchants could activate the subscription or license once they see the transaction but if it doesn't finialize they cancel your subscription. Merchants have ALREADY implemented such functionality for credit cards. ( See what happens when you use a credit card thats just about to expire lol ) Pretty much all of the stuff i have bought in 2 years of using bitcoin could have waited for confirmations. * Zero-conf is a hack, transactions can be droped out of the mempool based on a nodes configuration resulting in, inconsistent behaviour. It doesn't protect against people attempting double spends.. which only effects real-time consumable purchases ( but honestly what % of bitcoin use cases are these?) * The original bitcoin had full transaction replacement and it worked. ( small DOS vulnerability fixed in RBF) * Full RBF, will allow negotiation of fee's. Clients don't need to predict what the fee is going to be in 10 minutes which basically results in fee race conditions. **greater profitability to miners that accept RBF transactions** * Wallets can implement RBF in the background and make it hard for non technical users to scam merchants ( technical people can do it already - already proven many times ). Eg You can make a transaction and set a date for it to be confirmed, the client can gradually bump up the fee as the deadline approaches ( up to a max limit ). On average this will reduce the fee's you pay and will help minimise race conditions. Right now people tend to overestimate fees because their worried their transaction will get stuck for ever. Automatic fee bumping for hardware wallets might be tricky.. ( unless they sign multiple transactions and queue them up or something in the node ) Now there is an financial reason to run your own node ( see above point ) I know people support zero-conf as its convenient, but honestly its a hack that needs to be replaced by additional layers. It causes more subtle problems all for the benefit of very low value use cases. Please consider my points before down voting. u/petertodd "
106,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Market economics of bitcoin forks,5,7ctf65,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ctf65/market_economics_of_bitcoin_forks/,2017-11-14 16:17:22,"Bitcoin (BTC) is a major development step in cryptocurrency that solves many fundamental problems, thereby enabling wider adoption. This is a collaborative open source development by volunteer enthusiasts in a relatively conservative manner to avoid unintended consequences. This approach may be at odds with desires of early adopters and speculators whose priorities are aligned with rapid growth and exploitation. The open source architecture is the basis of many forks by alternative groups that wish to improve the code for their specific purposes. Consequently, this experimental code is the DNA of many altcoins. However, when a fork is created by a disaffected group to directly compete with bitcoin itself then we see interesting unstable and volatile market movements. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, exhibiting effects of positive feedback as described by W. Brian Arthur in Positive Feedbacks in the Economy, Scientific American, 262, 92-99, Feb 1990. An interesting economic effect of positive feedback is that stable shared markets may not result. There may be multiple market equilibriums, some of which may not be optimum. The market may snap to one of these equilibriums based on either chance or a relatively small stimulus. Arthur suggests that an economy may become locked into an inferior path when a technology with significant long-term potential initially emerges slowly. If two or more technologies or products compete for the same purpose then when one competitor gets even a small lead it can initiate a rapid market shift. One example of dominating an emerging technology is Microsoft Windows. This may not be the optimum technology from a number of viewpoints, however it addressed widespread consumer needs. How many casual PC users would be interested in having to develop the fragmented offerings of the various unix operating systems to suit their particular needs? Some commercial adopters seem frustrated with the slow rollout of improvements by bitcoin core, particularly with the immediate and significant issue of scaling to promote high speed and low cost transactions. Consequently, they have promoted the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork with larger data block sizes to address this problem in the short term. This new coin was created to directly compete in the same market in a way that was coordinated to cause a rapid market price increase on exchanges. This will cause investors to sell BTC in order to buy BCH, in turn causing the BTC price to fall. Positive feedback causes further selling of BTC on the falling price signal and further buying of BCH on its rising price. The extent of the price spike or dip is a result of tension between investor greed and fear. For example, in a pump and dump the buying frenzy turns into fear by the last-in investors that they paid too much and a price reversal now results back to the original equilibrium. The fear acts as a restorative negative feedback. However, if the stimulus is large enough for the market conditions then the price could snap to a new equilibrium as the positive feedback dominates. The objective of BCH seems to be one of achieving the flippening by displacing BTC as the dominant coin. However, BTC investors have shown some resilience and the enormous BCH price pump so far has snapped back to roughly twice what it was at the start of this cycle. How much of this lost momentum resulted from some exchanges going offline during the pump is uncertain. Bitcoin core has some convincing arguments that it is pursuing the better long-term technology, as evidenced by the work in progress. It also has first mover advantage and the largest uptake. However, it is an open source and collaborative system that does not aggressively compete in the market place. If the market is to resist becoming locked into an inferior product then it will rely on BTC investors and their resilience to market selling pressures. This requires investors to resist any panic buy/sell urges, or in other words exert some negative feedback. Weak hands may be those who do not understand the underlying technology and its value, and believe they paid too high a price. They could educate themselves as to whether this is BTC just going through some growing pains with the temporary vulnerability being exploited by a competitor. "

Just sharing. [Source](URL The Day Bitcoin Was Hacked In the ninth year of Satoshi, at 9:30am UTC on a cold February morning, Bitcoin was hacked. The hacker (or hackers) found a way to take advantage of a command in Satoshis original code. Then, using some very impressive number-crunching power, they played man-in-the-middle and intercepted transactions as they approached the big Bitcoin miners. But this required more than impressive number crunching  it required world-class intelligence, as well as access to dozens of major routers. This, however, didnt become clear for a few hours. During that time, tens of thousands of bitcoins were stolen. Whoever hacked Bitcoin had access to secret backdoors in the big commercial routers  backdoors that werent supposed to exist. A few ex-employees of the big router company had once tried to speak out on this subject, but they had been quickly silenced. (This wasnt known till later either.) By the time dawn broke in New York, bitcoiners in Japan, Korea, and all across Europe were in a panic. A couple of dozen key Americans were being roused as well. The old cypherpunk channels were busy for the first time in many years. A hasty meeting was called in the oldest darknet chat room, and a moratorium was called on all Bitcoin mining (transaction processing), beginning immediately. Only two significant miners refused to acknowledge the move, but they were just being asses on principle. In any event, they joined the moratorium half an hour later. No transactions would be recognized. Bitcoin had stopped. It took just over an hour for the big financial sites to figure out what was happening, followed by a roar of victory that crossed continents. Central banks, Wall Streeters, and gold bugs joined together, rejoicing that their joint enemy the curse that they all wanted to bury the upstart that had thrown confusion into their lives was dead. Many of them literally jumped, screamed, danced, and stomped their feet. Comment boards erupted with glee. Butt coin is dead! Buh-bye TwitCoin losers! and much worse were posted, over and over and over. Several thousand neophyte bitcoiners panicked and tried to dump every coin they could on the exchanges, but the exchanges closed as well. The result of this was that the price for Bitcoin, was, for all practical purposes, zero. At this, the enemies of Bitcoin let out an even bigger cheer than before. Their world view had been restored. Whereas they had been looking like fools  repetitively pronouncing Bitcoin dead as it inexplicably refused to die  it was now the bitcoiners who were the fools. The haters spewed a river of venom, with vigor and with glee. A couple of dozen cryptocurrency scam artists emptied their bank accounts during that day, cleared out of their apartments, and headed to unknown addresses. They knew an opportunity when they saw one. And so they took advantage of the confusion, getting away before anyone could call the law down on them. But it wasnt just the scammers; at least as many Zuckerberg wannabes started looking for new ways to get amorally rich as quickly as possible. The old chat room, however, remained choked with traffic. Literally dozens of Bitcoin developers, enemy miners, and altcoin developers had been sharing their findings. New information was deposited in the main chat room, while an old cryptographer summarized it all in a second room (where solutions were being discussed) and cross-posted conclusions between the two. In a third room the best programmers divided the code between themselves and hunkered down to find the vulnerability. It took them all four hours. An hour after that, a patch was being tested. Three hours and four versions of the patch later, all agreed that it was ready. At midnight in London (0:00 UTC), every major Bitcoin miner turned back on , and by agreement (an agreement they all kept), they restarted from block number 684273, which was the last complete block before the hack. Bitcoin  to the shock and horror of the crypto-hate community  was back. In the end, only a handful of people lost money (mostly by providing products during the hack), and only one of those businesses failed. Bitcoins price (as measured in dollars, etc.) lagged for a few days and then returned to its previous trajectory. Many of the altcoins remained shut for a day or two more, simply because they had less skilled manpower to throw at the problem. But soon enough they came back too, with the exceptions of the scammers who had run away and the get-rich-quickers who had wandered away. The haters went right back to hating."

Bitcoin is controlled by all Bitcoin users around the world. - It is possible to send and receive bitcoins anywhere in the world at any time. No bank holidays. No borders. No bureaucracy. Bitcoin allows its users to be in full control of their money. - Bitcoin transactions are secure, irreversible, and do not contain customers sensitive or personal information. - You should never expect to get rich with Bitcoin or any emerging technology. It is always important to be wary of anything that sounds too good to be true or disobeys basic economic rules. - However, Bitcoin is not anonymous and cannot offer the same level of privacy as cash. The use of Bitcoin leaves extensive public records. - Bitcoin is money, and money has always been used both for legal and illegal purposes. - Bitcoin is freeing people to transact on their own terms. - As with all currency, bitcoin's value comes only and directly from people willing to accept them as payment. - No one is in a position to predict what the future will be for Bitcoin. - Bitcoin remains by far the most popular decentralized virtual currency, but there can be no guarantee that it will retain that position. - Bitcoin's most common vulnerability is in user error. - In the event that quantum computing could be an imminent threat to Bitcoin, the protocol could be upgraded to use post-quantum algorithms. I am incredibly excited to be able to participate in a project that is so transparent in its values and vocal of its potential shortcomings. Being able to see what the flaws are is key to growing the technology and perfecting the platform. Wether is takes off and becomes the currency of the future or not, we can at least say we were a part of the push for its success. Alongside you all, its an honor to be a part of mankinds first digital currency backed by mathematics that gives the power to the people. (that sounded a little weird, lol promise I'm not a commie!)

When you initialize a Ledger Nano S you are not asked to provide any entropy seed. Does Ledger know the private key of every wallet theyve ever sold? You cant go through the firmware to prove these are randomly chosen. Great comment comes from another Reddit user: This is exactly why I got a Trezor. I don't code but I know people who do. They tend to be highly critical of other peoples' code. If they find a flaw in an update, they would inform the company and community within minutes. Since Trezor is open-source, you can be assured there are is at least one person out there who doesn't work for Trezor and has studied it for weakness... which is exactly how the last vulnerability was exposed and quickly fixed."

A censorship resistant, decentralized, digital ledger that no-body can control or alter. That's an innovation that has mind-boggling implications. If bitcoin is truly that (and I believe it can be), then it needs to be bullet proof. It needs to be attacked over and over again from every possible vector, and needs to survive each of these attacks and get stronger with every one that fails. It needs to survive government censorship, PR disasters, fraudulent exchanges, corporate takeover....etc. From where I'm sitting, segwit2x is the single most dangerous attack that bitcoin has faced so far. It's an attack from within. Maybe even a well intentioned one. If segwit2x succeeds, then bitcoin has been vulnerable at the governance level all along, and the NYA is merely an exploit to the vulnerability. The experiment was grand, but it has failed. If, as I hope, segwit2x fails to take over bitcoin, then we are much closer to a truly censorship resistant ledger, and humanity is all the better for it. When I think about things from this angle, I'm almost grateful for the NYA. I want to know, sooner rather than later, wether or not control over bitcoin can be achieved by a dozen people with mixed intentions, sitting in a hotel room somewhere. If they succeed, I'm not mad at them, I'm just deeply sad about the death of a beautiful experiment. If they fail, then I'm grateful that they tried, and made bitcoin stronger. "

113,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Why is a 2mb block size a bad thing?,0,752urg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/752urg/why_is_a_2mb_block_size_a_bad_thing/,2017-10-09 03:56:09,"Hello bitcoiners, I guess I should start off by saying I'm not a shill or trying to troll here, I'm simply trying to understand. Having larger blocks inevitably leads to mining and node centralization. Bigger blocks also mitigate transaction times when there is a consistent and significant backlog. There are pros and cons to having larger blocks. My question is why do the cons so heavily outweigh the pros? It seems to me that if you were going to have centralization, it would stem either from big blocks or second layer solutions. I would argue that the necessary centralization for a lightning network to occur could be even worse than some non-mining nodes not storing a copy of the blockchain as would happen in the case of big blocks. If a person wanted to transact on segwit 1mb bitcoin as I believe you guys envision it, they could lock their money into a lightning channel and then transact however many times they want through that channel, but when they want to settle, they'd have to pay a large fee to include that settlement TX on the chain. This may or may not be economical depending on the robustness and scope of the lightning network and transaction fees of similar coins. On the other hand, with larger blocks and segwit, it just seems like it's the best of both worlds. Lightning, but with lower fees to transact on chain (All other things equal). I don't understand how the miners expect to mine 2x if nobody buys it. I also don't understand how users expect to use 1mb blocks and only on chain txes for presumably a couple years. Big blocks would cause some full nodes to shut down, but hard drives get cheaper every year, and bitcoin more expensive. I doubt it would cause too much mining centralization, as long as blocks weren't like 8mb right now lol. To be a miner anyway, you pretty much have to live in China or Iceland and own a bunch of asics. It's already super capital intensive, and I don't see making the blockchain double or even triple its size having much of an impact. Given the rate of adoption we're seeing now, I don't think it makes any sense to limit block size to such a small number unless you were willing to introduce a different sort of centralization. Not mining, but transactional. Only certain institutions will be able to afford to transact on chain, if the 1mb block size is kept for much longer, imo, so people will have to most likely use custodial accounts if they want to transact at all, since creating a lightning channel necessitates money being sent to a multisig address. The lumped transactions pay a smaller fee per person, since fewer kb are used pee output. This system makes bitcoin extremely vulnerable to censorship. This is because right now in order to make it so a transaction doesn't get confirmed, you need to either bloat the mempool with txes of a higher fee, or you need to control the majority of hashrate. This is prohibitively expensive. In the case of centralized lightning operators, all that needs to be done is some underhanded dealings with a lightning node operator, or government intervention, or whatever it may be, and that lightning node operator might be forced/incentivized to not include certain transactions in their settlement txes on chain. And again I'm not saying the core devs want this vulnerability to exist or anything and I'm not saying bigger blocks are irrefutably better and you're all stupid, I'm just wondering what you guys think.

Reading the latest develpoments today, I asked to myself: ""but hey, I thought Bitcoin core was part of the NY agreement"", despite I read the news each day as a big holder of bitcoins. Yes, I read the news everyday, at least 10mn per day, and it is just impossible to understand everything. This is why I googled old articles. Many people here has probably a clear vision as they are more experts than me, but what I identified in several articles just enabled me to build ""my"" objective opinion. Below is what everybody needs to undersand according to me: * Bitcoin Core is CONSERVATIVE. This is key to understand all debates, and I think this should be promoted more by core developers. Scaling will not be done against security, or by accepting ""risks"". If Bitcoin needs to scale, a second layer is necessary to preserve the security of the first layer which proved his resilency since many years now. I really think this is the good approach. Many people here made a comparison with TCP / HTTP. And I think they are perfectly right. TCP is strong on a security point of view, but offer no possibility. And protocols above TCP, like HTTP, IRC, SSH or others, opened internet to the world for the best and the worst, with many many vulnerabilities. Adding layers over protocols has never been a problem. Patching working protocols open the door to many vulnerabilities. Bitcoin is valuable today. And people buy not only the feature, but the security and this conservative approach. I hold some bitcoins. and I don't want to be crushed by a poor vulnerability like the Telnet one on SunOS&lt;5.7 (yep, only old people will understand). * Bitcoin Core makes prudent statements. Reducing the risks through the code is good, but it appears also that Bitcoin core is also conservative in their statements. And yes, they never endorsed Segwit 2X. Except if I missed something, there is no discussion, no controverse on the communication. URL URL ""None of the regular Bitcoin Core contributors were part of the New York Agreement"". I was not sure on that, but it's true. There was a very good communication. Take the first link, read the table: which open-source project makes such thing, describing the position of each developer? People can say that it is partial, but hey, each one put their name on this table. It cannot be faked when we think that what is branded by these people is their technical expertise. So, as a summary of this long post, my choice is clear. I am not for or against one party, and I will not hesitate to choose the most profitable party. But as a strong Bitcoin holder since 2012, I want a) security b) conservatism c) clear communication d) new features &amp; scaling through a second layer. This is clear for me, and currently, it seems to be the strategy of Bitcoin core, whatever the market is doing. I am not selling. I am a long-term hodler, I have a lot of money to secure, and Core strategy fits my needs. Place your bet now, and sorry for this messy post. "

His biggest beef seems to be that Bitcoin simply cannot succeed as a currency because it simply has no value of itself -- it has no practical uses, and no protection as currency through fiat. He said the only thing it had going for it was the ease of use in digital commerce, but that gold was catching up with companies that will now let you load up pre-paid debit cards with the value of an amount of gold stored in vaults anywhere around the globe, and you can take ownership of that gold at any time. Those vaults, however, are the vulnerability. They act as a valve that a government can use to enforce compliance. If you are Wikileaks, for example, and you're relying on gold in this way to fund yourself, a government can use that valve to cut off the funding. ***This*** is the value of Bitcoin. Eventually (ignoring the problem with exchanges to local currencies for the moment), through further adoption and acceptance, Bitcoin becomes a way to transfer value from point to point without going through any single valve that can be shut off. It has no physical form, and ***cannot*** be physically confiscated by anyone. ***That*** is its intrinsic value. I've understood this for a while now, but it wasn't until I heard Peter Schiff talking about this gold debit card like it was different from anything else we currently have that it really sunk in and I could finally articulate it. I really like what he has to say for the most part, but on this one point we differ greatly."

The headlines, blogs, forums all speak of new found riches, what seem like buried treasures found yet, as new highs are made for Bitcoin and other currencies, new lows of self worth are discovered daily by the countless gambling addictions that have popped up with the rise and adoption of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Available for iPod, iPhone, iPad, Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, Samsung, etc, 24/7, 365 days a week at lighting fast speeds. Deposit bonus, VIP raffles for free bitcoins, holiday bonus, VIP trips, personal hosts - yup, its all in there and at times - it is magnificent. However, that is the single most toxic thing about gambling addiction - if even for the briefest of moments, that time it is magnificent takes a grasp so powerful, so determined and so unlikely to be found again until the hooks are set, play play play, reward, play play play, reward are deeply embedded into our cognitive behavior and we have conditioned ourselves to only derive happiness from the briefest of moments that the brain thinks are magnificent I am one of those souls who lost millions of dollars, friends, close relationships, values, moral compass and most importantly - my ability to derive self worth, self love and empathy until I was almost too far down the rabbit hole to turn back. Some statistics suggest nearly 80% of all Bitcoins in circulation are used for online gambling. They are the ideal currency for such gaming activities - anonymous, instant and can be broken down into payments both big and small. I am writing this not to shun any operators nor the industry, I am writing this to let the thousands of people across the world who are in pain that no words can truly describe from the ruin and shame that go hand in hand with gambling addiction see that they are not alone. The cycle of destruction that comes with gambling addiction is on par with the greatest of natural disasters. I have had the fortune of experiencing almost every type of addiction one could experience, nothing even comes close to the grip, power and intensity of online gambling addiction. Now, I can understand those reading have little room for sympathy, after all, gambling addiction is and has been portrayed as one of the most shameful addictions one can develop that are stigmatized by both the media and in real life. The goal of this is to not earn anyones sympathy, I do not feel like a victim - these are choices I made however, the US Surgeon General (whom I have the greatest respect for going against the grain) has coined (no pun intended) any addiction as a Cognitive Brain Disease. This means that the chemical makeup of ones brain is altered and is not a choice. The brain gets rewired to release the chemical dopamine only when a jackpot or near jackpot is obtained. Perhaps a brief explanation of the gamblers high will help put things into context. If I am playing cards, and lets say I had a good run and am up $1 million. Each win experiences diminishing marginal returns, this means that the pleasure or high I receive from each win decreases with each bet. In fact, even if I won another $1 million jackpot while up $1 million, it will offer significantly less of a high than if i were to be down $1 million. The gamblers high, as little sense as it may make to some, is not experienced when someone is winning money. The gamblers high truly kicks in when someone is down big and comes out of nowhere with a big win. The speed and velocity of such a swing, down $1 million to up $1 million (we call that a $2m swing) is the true high and the rush of that high is so great we chase it leaving our lives, pride and self worth behind. The force of that rush is so intense, gamblers will intentionally bet irrationally to lose their winnings simply so they can experience that rush. Like I said, its the most vicious addiction I have experienced New technologies that show the game is Provably Fair allow players to instantly verify the die roll if you will to show that the outcome was already decided by the software before the person decided how much they would bet or what decisions they would make during the game. (Ex: the makeup of the shoe of cards in a game of blackjack) I commend the industry for providing such transparency and unlike fiat currency gaming sites, offer the fairest chance of any gambler to take down the house however, it takes a bit more understanding of the psyche behind gambling addiction to understand the predatory nature of such sites and the bells and whistles used to retain those addicts over long periods of time to boost their CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value) Technology has led to great advancements and power, with that comes responsibility. I am very much a believer in capitalism and feel very strongly a business should have the ability to take advantage of inefficiencies in a market to their advantage. I would simply ask the operators of such site to do this with caution, offer a sense of humanity and empathy and help educate players around loss limits, self exclusion and even offer help if a player is playing on edge. While taking advantage of a market opportunity is one thing, taking advantage of someones emotional and financial vulnerability goes against every facet of our own humanity. For those who are struggling with online gambling addiction or any addiction to that matter, I know all too well just how dark times can get, I feel your pain and understand that hope is a hard thing to come by when such a spiral takes hold. Turn to those who you love for help, be brutally honest in whatever you are experiencing no matter how much shame you think it may bring. Shame is a funny thing, everyone has it, nobody likes to talk about it and the less we talk about it the more we have. The sense of relief and hope that offers almost instant gratification when you are honest with yourself and your families about your addiction is the biggest catalyst to overcoming the darkest of days. Find yourself, no matter how hard or dark it may be, the rewards are greater than any jackpot can offer "
121,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Discussion on most secure &amp; user-error-proof seed storage.,5,6yhjvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6yhjvz/discussion_on_most_secure_usererrorproof_seed/,2017-09-07 04:37:28,"I want to start a discussion / get advice going on the smartest ways to store our backups/seeds. **Initial thoughts**: - **PLAIN TEXT**: Storing a seed as **plain text** (written on paper, stored as a .txt file on a USB stick) anywhere is a bad idea, because anyone who gets hold of that seed, gets hold of all your money. And nowhere (that I can think of) is completely safe. For example: * **Safe Deposit Boxes**: They get broken into. A lot. They're (usually) not available outside banking hours / during holidays. There are sometimes accidents (fire, flood, earthquake, etc.) which destroy the contents of the boxes. * **Home of Trusted Friends / Family**: They could get broken into. They could forget where they put your stuff, and never be able to find it. Same vulnerability to aforementioned accidents. * **On a computer at home**: if it's connected to the internet, it could be hacked/vulnerable to malware stealing it. Even if it's not connected, it has the same vulnerabilities as storing with friends/family (theft &amp; accidents). **SEPARATE LOCATIONS**: A smart solution is to either encrypt your seed and store the key elsewhere OR split your seed into multiple parts and store each part in separate locations. A couple of initial thoughts: * **Encrypt your seed / store key separately**: so you have **encrypted seed** stored in **location 1** and **encryption key** stored in **location 2**. (This includes hardware wallets like the Trezor and the Ledger). * **Pros:** The seed by itself is useless to anyone who steals it, because it's encrypted. It's gibberish. The key by itself is useless to anyone who steals it, because they don't have anything to decrypt with it. * **Cons:** You can start getting into the territory of user error here. Wouldn't it suck to see in 5 years that you have a million bucks, but when you try to access it, you can't decrypt the seed for some reason. The key doesn't work for some reason, or you're not using the software quite right, etc. * **Split your seed and store the parts separately**: So you have **Seed part 1** stored in **location 1**, **Seed part 2** stored in **location 2**, and **Seed part 3** stored in **location 3**. * **Pros**: Any part of your seed is useless to anyone who steals it, because it's only a third of the length it needs to be. Also, when you've got all 3 parts, there's no decryption needed, you just put them together and you're set (provided you make it clear which order they go in e.g. marking the paper with 1/3, 2/3, 3/3). * **Cons**: You're hugely reducing your entropy by giving away 1/2 or 1/3 of your seed to a potential theif. This will greatly reduce the time needed for them to brute-force (have a computer guess) the remainder of the seed, allowing them to access your funds. A couple of potential solves for this are 1) definitely split into at least 3 parts, halves would give away too much. 2) don't write what currency the seed is for. Then the attacker would need to check every combination s validity against multiple currencies. **MULTIPLE BACKUPS**: Another point I'd like to touch on, is having multiple copies of each of your backups: * **Multiple copies:** Due to all the combinations of fire/theft, etc., it's smart to have a few backups of everything. So if your bank safe deposit box gets wrecked or accessed, you haven't lost your only backup. * **Multiple geographic locations:** Some events can wreck massive areas e.g. hurricanes, fires, earthquakes. So if all the copies of your backups are stored within a few miles of each other, that might not be good enough. * **Multiple formats**: It's possible that something like a solar flare, or other event, could render backups stored in one format (a USB stick, for example) completely useless. So it may be smart to have some copies stored digitally (USB, SD, SSD) and some stored in an analogue way (paper, engraved metal). **MULTIPLE WALLETS**: an extension/related point to having multiple backups, is having multiple wallets. * If you'd be super bummed to loose all the crypto you have in one wallet, use multiple wallets. * **Pros**: If you split your hodlings across 4 wallets, and one gets compromised, you only lose 25% of your cash. That would suck, but it would suck way less than losing all of your cash. * **Cons**: To do this right, you'd want to consider mixing up the aforementioned geographic locations and the formats with this as well...which starts getting incredibly complicated to set up, keep track of, and REDEEM down the line (will you remember this complex mess in 5 years, after your house fire, and how to restore everything?) *** **Proposed method:** - Accounting for the need for simplicity (against user error) and security against theft/loss/damage, I think the smartest solution is: **Backup 1 / Location 1 (near-ish my house)**: 1. Half 1/2 of my seed written on paper. 2. Encrypted USB (with my whole seed on it). **Backup 1 / Location 2 (near-ish my house)**: 1. Half 2/2 of my seed written on paper. 2. USB with my encryption key on it. **Backup 2 / Location 3 (a town that's at least 100 miles from my house):** 1. Half 1/2 of my seed written on paper. 2. Encrypted USB (with my whole seed on it). **Backup 2 / Location 4 (near Location 3):** 1. Half 2/2 of my seed written on paper. 2. USB with my encryption key on it. **Backup 3 / Location 5 (the internet):** 1. Half 1/2 of my seed, stored as a .txt file inside my password manager. (My password manager stores everything in the cloud, but it's encrypted with my passphrase that I've committed to memory). 2. Encrypted file (with my whole seed on it).

122,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Prediction Markets as Digital Commodity Markets - Secured by Bitcoin Network.,6,6ze2nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6ze2nd/prediction_markets_as_digital_commodity_markets/,2017-09-11 18:16:15,"**Prediction Markets In A Nutshell:** Prediction markets are a way to bet on future events. The way prediction markets operate today resemble gambling rather than investing. There is no underlying asset to extract value from after the bet has been settled. The main vulnerability of prediction markets is the need for a trusted third party to settle the bet. While one could try to decentralize the platform that is used for bets, the way the outcome of the event is decided is still a point of failure in the system. The solution to the problems mentioned above is to turn future events into digital commodities. To understand how to do so in full, please read the following [article](URL In short, by utilizing bitcoin blockchain it is now possible to commodify and interlink any event imaginable, including future events. The platform that used to commodify the events is [counterparty](URL Counterparty resides on top of bitcoin, which means that all digital assets that are created via counterparty gain the security of the bitcoin network. Counterparty contributes to the bitcoin ecosystem by creating an additional use case  each counterparty transaction has to include a btc fee. *** **Future Events As Digital Commodities:** By following the instructions specified in the 'constructing universal map of knowledge' [article](URL one can become an owner of a future event asset. Because future events are treated as digital commodities, price discovery mechanism becomes one of the tools used to predict the outcome of an particular event. The greater market value an asset that anchors a version of a future event has, the greater probability that the event it anchors will occur in the future. One of the major features of the counterparty protocol is a decentralized exchange. The decentralized exchange removes the need to trust a third party to facilitate the trading of future event assets. The assets are always under the control of the traders, and the transactions are secured by bitcoin network. Unlike traditional prediction markets, asset based prediction markets are not a zero sum game. Events that did not occur in 'consensus reality' could still have value as being part of an alternative timeline. Fictional/simulated timelines and the events that happen in them can be registered as independent events and be a part of a larger construct. *** **Value:** The value of event assets is largely based on the fact that they are highly resistant to forgery. In general (and as previously [explained](URL the invention of bitcoin technology is the invention of digital scarcity. Bitcoin was created to allow people to send digital information between each other in form of a token (btc). None of the participants can retain a valid copy of a token after the transaction has been made and there is no need to trust a centralized service to validate the transactions. All the transaction are recorded on a distributed public ledger. The fundamental value of a distributed public ledger is the secure environment it provides that allows people to publish/send certain information without trusting any third party. Information that has been written into the ledger is automatically timestamped, anyone can view it and nobody can modify it. Centralized services cannot provide objective timestamping simply by design, information can be edited by service operators and they are easier to attack. In order to record the information into the distributed public ledger, a fee is paid to the those who invest resources to secure it (bitcoin miners). The objectivity of a distributed public ledger is measured by the amount of resources the attacker has to use in order to undermine its integrity. When counterparty is used to create event assets, the events assets are objectively timestpamed and secured by bitcoin network. The timestamping is used to differentiate between particular events. The first to capture the event is the event owner. *** **Authentication:** Today we use physical objects as anchor points to culturally significant events. Physical objects have to be authenticated by experts in order to maintain their relevance and value. One cannot be completely certain that the object itself is authentic because there is a need to trust a third party. The process of authentication without the need to trust any third party is built into the counterparty protocol. That means that digital assets become more concrete representation of events, because they are more easily authenticated than physical objects. Additionally, culturally significant events that have no physical anchor points can now have digital objects to serve that purpose. It can easily be verified when a particular event was first recorded and there is no need to trust a centralized service to do so. *** **Connections:** The 'constructing universal map of knowledge' article, described how to connect event assets in a two-way link via value communication. The greater quality connections future event assets have, the greater predictive power they gain. A greater insight could be derived from observing the connections of future events, as future events can be connected by 'if/then' type of branching structure. Event assets owners have economic incentive to connect their events to future events that they believe have higher probability to occur as it could increase the value of the assets they own. The owners that don't protect the integrity of the information associated to the event assets, including the validity of connections, will risk the decline of monetary value of their assets. This is the main economic incentive that will insure the existence of reliable information, essentially putting an end the 'fake news'/'post truth' era. *** **Conclusion:** Having insight into future events and access to reliable information could improve our decision making ability and benefit humanity as a whole."

However, with this DoS vulnerability disclosed and in the wild, it seems very risky to rely on unpatched Bitcoin Core nodes to keep the network from partitioning. This could greatly increase the risk of chain splits and chain reorganizations. Maybe Parity, BitcoinJ, libbitcoin, and bcoin can keep the network glued together (I don't know if they're similarly dropped by 0.15 or not), but those nodes are few and far between. It seems like this is the sort of risk that could have been avoided by not attempting to preemptively partition Core 0.15 nodes from the rest of the network. In the meantime, are there any plans for Core to backport the fix to an earlier release which can serve as a bridge without risk of attack?"

What we currently know is that Bitcoin is still an **asset** and its value **largely** depends on what traders think of it and how much they believe in it as the source of their investments. You cannot blame them for not thinking otherwise because they have more pressing needs than HODL'ing and believing in some bright future which in the case of pure numbers and nothing but numbers may never come true. Nothing and no one stand behind bitcoin and its value, only our common belief which is as tangible as neutrinos. And until scaling is fully solved Bitcoin is not looking to become a currency. Bitcoin needs a scaling solution which will allow it to scale up to **millions** of operations per day with as little as seconds of confirmation times which is a far cry from all today's implementations (even BCC is not a solution). I will not outright call Bitcoin a bubble but it owes the most of its value to exchanges and traders. Absolute most of you have never purchased a single item using Bitcoins in your life, so, obviously Bitcoin is not money. And it's not like businesses are reluctant to use it - they are just scared to use it. These crazy swings in valuations, these absolute uncertainties in regard to confirmation times and transaction fees - yes, Visa might be more expensive but it freaking works. And also blockchain, as it's currently implemented, doesn't allow transactions reversals which are too common in the real world. The current crisis (and I cannot find any other name for it) in Bitcoin's valuation is because people don't really believe in mathematical entities. **Edit**: if you feel the need to disagree, find some strong arguments, please."

127,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"Why Bitcoin should have voting, and what the voting protocol could look like",0,6k99ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6k99ze/why_bitcoin_should_have_voting_and_what_the/,2017-06-30 01:59:21,"_Bitcoin should have voting_ A successful protocol needs a strong network effect, which requires as large a number of economically relevant actors to participate as possible. People will be more likely to join Bitcoin if it has the features they want. Voting is a way to measure what people want, and make that knowledge public. Consensus changes to the protocol are less dangerous and more likely to succeed the more the more widespread the accurate belief that there is consensus is. Voting is a way to make the fact that the knowledge about what people want is public public. This is a sort of like dating. Sara likes Lisa. Lisa likes Sara. This is good, but not that powerful yet. Now suppose that Sara *knows* that Lisa likes Sara. This is better. Now suppose that Sara *knows* that Lisa likes Sara, and Lisa *knows* that Sara likes Lisa. This is better still. Now suppose that Sara *knows* that Lisa *knows* that Sara likes Lisa, and Lisa *knows* that Sara *knows* that Lisa likes Sara. The odds of something interesting happening are are much improved. And so it is with protocol changes. The type of users that form the basis for Bitcoins long term stability and health need a way to coordinate deployment of changes to the protocol not just to make improvements, but more importantly to respond to attacks. For example, lets say (hypothetically) that there were some kind of vulnerability inherent in the Proof of Work that enabled an ASIC manufacturing company to design hardware that worked less efficiently by default, but could be put into a special secret configuration that would make it substantially more efficient. If there is a conflict between the users of Bitcoin, and the miners, I think most of us would want the users to win. Voting gives them a way to coordinate a counter attack. This helps avoid the scenario where most people can understand that an attacker is abusing the system, but the attacker is controlling the other machinery of protocol change. *** _Voting should have high turnout_ You want high turnout, otherwise the vote does not actually represent the preferences of most people. Perhaps the best way to achieve high turnout is to make it easy to vote. Users rationally understand that their individual vote is not that important, but not devoid of importance, and therefore worth at least a little time and effort. For example, every wallet could have a ballot screen that users could fill out, and then the wallet automatically cast votes matching that ballot. When new initiatives achive some sort of threshold level of importance, the wallet could pop up a dialog box notifying the user and asking their opinion. Deciding not to vote should be considered a valid option, but people should be at least notified of the important debates. *** _Voting should resist gaming or corruption_ Clearly sibyl resistance is important, but in a pseudonymous system that is tricky. Satoshi apparently intended to rely on using hash-power to imbue Bitcoin with sibyl resistance, but that experiment failed, because efficiency of scale has concentrated the majority of hash-power into the control of a few people, rather than in the diffused one CPU one vote described in the white paper. Hash-power is still good, though, because those few people have interests that are substantially (though not perfectly) aligned with the interests of Bitcoins users. The ideal sibyl resistant signal would not have an efficiency of scale. It would not get cheaper to produce the more of it you produce. In fact, it would be nice if it got cheaper the more people are involved, and more expensive if just one person tries to purchase it. The things that have that quality are things that people ordinarily have about them for some other purpose. For example, if you could measure proof of shoes you would have an attractive sibyl resistant metric. The more people you include, the more shoes come along for free  but one person attempting to buy shoes must spend a lot of money, and then must deal with all of those shoes somehow. Two things Bitcoin can easily access that are like this are: Stored Value: One of the things Bitcoin is good for is storing value, and people storing value are users worth caring about. It makes sense to use time stored and amount stored as multipliers for this metric. Block Space: The other major thing Bitcoin is good for is transferring value, and block space is the scarce resource that this consumes. Votes can be attached to a particular transaction, and weighted according to how many bytes the transaction occupies. Unfortunately there is the potential for custodians to abuse these metrics by voting with the coins of their users. As a cultural norm, custodians must be encouraged to participate honestly in the voting process, by giving ballots to their customers and allowing them to control the voting power of their coins. To the degree that custodians fail to do this  maybe they would pay a price in lost business? If custodians do hijack the votes of their customers, perhaps the size of the influence could be estimated and factored into the evaluation of votes. Fortunately, even misbehaving custodians represent a party with some expertise, and an interest in the success of Bitcoin, and distinct wishes from miners and from influential developers. There is also the unfortunate potential for people to sell their votes. Perhaps we can rely on the honesty of the community, and the fact that an individual vote would not be worth paying very much for? Perhaps some magical cryptography could make it so that you can vote, and your vote ends up in the total, but it is impossible for you to prove what you voted for? Votes should not be able to be censored. The same peer-to-peer broadcast network that broadcasts transactions should probably be used to broadcast votes. Full nodes should store vote information that might be relevant in the future. *** _Voting should impose minimal burden on full nodes_ If full nodes are going to take on the responsibility of tracking votes, then votes must be designed to not burden full nodes. Since votes must be authenticated, and we are already signing transactions anyway, I think it would be economical to include the vote as an optional part of the transaction. For example, the vote could be done with OP_RETURN, and then scored based on how many bytes the transaction is, how many bitcoins are being moved, and coin age. *** _Voting should involve a minimum loss of privacy_ Voting is probably going to involve a loss of privacy, because your votes come through as a signal in your transactions. Means should be sought to minimize this effect by aggregating votes together somehow and making it unclear which transaction links to which vote. "

How come verification cost rises proportionally with the amount of money you send? Are verification costs (computing power, energy) required for verification of larger transactions proportionally larger? 2. If I understand this correctly, Bitcoin transactions are free (there is no mandatory transaction fees). Miners are awarded new bitcoins for their blockchain maintainance. But, when electricity is, say, cheap, and currency is doing well, miners might want to induce ""artificial traffic"" (simply transferring coins to themselves) in order to mine in times of cheap electricity. This is a unneccesary burden on the blockchain and it, in my opinion increases the dependence cryptocurrency has on energy price. It opens up a vulnerability for speculation and governmental interference and it hurts the environment. Now if, say, every transaction was fined @ 1% transaction and miners were to get that 1% +0.5% transaction in fresh bitcoins (I made up the numbers), creating artificial traffic would drop in value, as it would now be reduced to only 33% as profitable as it is now. Am I thinking wrong? I think this could increase the lifespan (or at least the initial stage) of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin."

132,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Hard Fork Framework,16,6cht5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6cht5y/hard_fork_framework/,2017-05-22 03:37:42,"Hard Fork Framework (HFF) Instead of trying to avoid hard forks at all costs, perhaps we should create a well defined, versioned, framework to embrace hard forks. The framework would provide a relatively easy way to allow anyone to run their own consensus rules. Perhaps this could be done via plugin system? When a fork occurs, the block-hash (or perhaps some other algorithm, because the block-hash loses entropy as the difficulty increases. Perhaps the hash should be transaction based so that multiple forks could be created per block) of the first block will become its reference ""fork-hash"". The new fork can then be ""named"" and referenced as ""bitcoin-deadbeef..."". The creators of the fork might give their fork a pseudonym such as ""Bitcoin Super Duper XT 1000"", but this does not need to be handled by the framework. Only the fork-hash is important. Just like transactions, it would be recommended to wait for the new fork's chain to become at least a certain length before trusting the fork-hash. The number of blocks to wait would depend on the consensus rules of the new fork. (If the new fork changed the average block rate to 30 seconds, you would want to wait for many more blocks to confirm than for a fork with an average block rate of 10 minutes). Replay attacks could be mitigated by requiring that the fork-hash be included in the transaction (not sure how this might affect the size of the transaction, perhaps there is a clever way to do this?). This would ensure that transactions would only be valid on their respective forks. Or whatever replay prevention technique is deemed fit. Why would we want this? 1. Mitigate consensus change / social / stalling attacks. If a re-branded ""Bitcoin Super Duper XT 1000"" comes along wanting to change the consensus rules to something controversial, the response is simple: ""Create a HFF module"". The discussion ends there. 2. The HFF will allow wallets, exchanges and businesses to easily accept new hard forks if they want to. They would simply download the HFF plugin module and tell bitcoind to include/run it. The HFF would provide a well defined API for interacting with forks, so the user's software may not require any changes. (Some forks may require custom API commands, in which case the client software would need to be changed, but that is up to the maintainers of the fork. It is in their best interest to make their fork as compatible as possible) 3. If there are valid HFF changes that fork X needs, this should be far less controversial as long as it does not inhibit the other forks from functioning normally. Making sure HFF is properly versioned should allow for future innovation while keeping support for existing forks. 4. Empower users by providing them with an economic way to support their preferred chain. Each exchange will make the decision whether or not to support a new fork. There may end up being hundreds or even thousands of forks so it would only make sense for the exchanges to support the most common. Once an exchange enables support for a particular fork (One of the goals of HFF is to make this easy), users will be able to either sell or buy the new coin. Let the market decide. 5. Keep miners in line. If miners misbehave, it would be trivial to create a new fork using a new POW algorithm. If there truly is an economic majority opposed to the miners' behaviour, then the misbehaving miners may find themselves mining an economic minority chain. This should be a constant reminder for them that they are not in charge. 6. Segwit + LN enabled forks may become easily exchangeable. So if a particular merchant has not yet enabled ""bitcoin-deadbeef"", an intelligent wallet could convert to ""bitcoin-3d7ae587"" on-the-fly to make the payment. 7. Creating a fork becomes more like creating a linux distro or any other open source software. The best survive. The weak die. Survival of the fittest. How is this different from an altcoin? 1. History is preserved. You will have the same number of coins on each chain. No, this is not inflation because the value of the new coin at the time of the fork is zero. An exchange rate would need to emerge naturally. Preserving the history is important because it allows existing stake holders to vote economically by buying or selling the new coin. 2. Choosing to support an altcoin takes time and effort. The goal of HFF is to allow businesses, exchanges and users to enable support as easily as possible. E.g ""bitcoind -consensus libbitcoinsuperduperxt1000"". Or ""bitcoind -consensus libpowkeccak"" etc. 3. Most of the code remains the same for all forks. Only the consensus code differs from fork to fork. Could a HFF plugin expose a security vulnerability which puts other running forks at risk? This would obviously need to be addressed in the design. Perhaps each fork would run in its own process? Or its own container? Or even its own machine if the user chooses. The goal would be to sufficiently sandbox each fork from each other. Each user should assess the competency of the dev team (Or the actual code if possible) behind the fork before they run it. Wont multiple forks confuse people? This will need to be addressed through education. People will call each fork by their friendly name. However, each fork should be referenced using its fork-hash when appropriate. It is likely that only a small handful of forks will have any meaningful relevance. Is this even possible? Maybe not. Hopefully the devs can discuss it. (Or even immediately dismiss) What is the time frame for such a feature? This would likely take several years to design and implement. It would be a long term goal."

Right now, r/Bitcoin and other forums are filled with discussions about these issues that are sure to baffle and frighten many newbies. An August 1 showdown looms with potentially fateful consequences! Here is a good little video explaining the AsicBoost issue: URL It is a technology patented by Bitmain that exploits a flaw in the bitcoin protocol, enabling miners with access to this technology to increase their profits by approximately 20x (2000%). This would enable Bitmain mining operations to drive competitors out of business, and the resulting mining centralization would give the government of China the power to cripple the bitcoin network whenever they chose. It was recently discovered that Bitmain's current mining hardware includes the chips/CPU's that are required to do AsicBoost (and are not otherwise necessary). After this discovery, Bitmain admitted it was true but said they decided not to use that capability because of the harm it would cause to Bitcoin. However, it is currently possible to use this AsicBoost advantage in an undetectable manner (""covert AsicBoost""), and many believe it is the primary reason for their opposition to SegWit, which fixes the vulnerability that enables covert AsicBoost. Distrust of Bitmain was further heightened by the discovery that they installed a ""backdoor"" in their mining equipment which enabled them, or a third party hacker, to remotely shut down and even destroy their mining hardware. There is widespread agreement in the technical and economic bitcoin community (except for many miners) that SegWit is the best/safest option to scale and improve the bitcoin protocol at this time. In addition to the AsicBoost issue, some miners worry that SegWit will reduce their income from transaction fees by facilitating off-chain, second-layer transaction processing (which is the only realistic way that Bitcoin might someday be useful for micro-payments and compete successfully with fiat-based retail payment systems). Miner opposition to SegWit has been led by Bitmain. If miners choose not to activate SegWit by August 1, a controversial User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) will INEVITABLY occur. It is essentially an attempt by Bitcoin node operators to force miners to accept SegWit; it could cause a split in the network, lots of confusion, and lost value.

141,vulnerability,Bitcoin,A newcomer with questions about wallets.,5,69py95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/69py95/a_newcomer_with_questions_about_wallets/,2017-05-07 16:27:12,"Hello! So after playing around with Coinbase for a few weeks, I'm curious about the idea of setting up more secure wallets. My understanding is that hardware wallets are the most secure because access to the wallet is limited to whoever has access to the wallet, which can be easily removed from a network and locked up. Software wallets are less secure because it stores the coins on the computer itself, making the coins vulnerable to malware and because computers are generally more accessible. Online wallets being the least secure because the information is relayed through a third party. So I'm leaning towards probably a mix of the three but I'm unsure of their different uses. Is my hardware wallet really more secure if I have to use the wallet location to process payments online? For example: if I want to move from hardware to an online wallet, wouldn't my hardware wallet then be subject to the same vulnerability since the online wallet knows my hardware wallet 's location? If that's not the case, why isn't it? Can hardware wallets easily support multiple types of coins? Do I need a separate hardware wallet for each alt? Diversification is important to me. My biggest concern about hardware wallets is failure. I'm not worried about loss or theft, but of physical hardware failure. This makes online wallets appeal to me... But is hardware failure a concern? If it is, is it possible/easy to transfer my wallet to a new hardware periodically? Thanks. :)"

There are certain structural oversights in Bitcoin that need to be fixed. Without fixing this altcoins will probably overtake Bitcoin in the long run. 2. SegWit has several [benefits](URL including short term higher transaction capacity, long term much higher transaction capacity through second level transactions and also safe (!) increasing of the block size. Additionally it will make it easier for smart contracts and the like to build on Bitcoin directly. If Satoshi would design Bitcoin from scratch today he would probably do it in a similar manner. 3. SegWit is a good solution, ready for action and well tested. Even some of it's strongest opponents secretly admit it is ""good"" ([verified chatlogs](URL 4. There are two possible ways to deploy/implement SegWit, as a softfork (SWSF) or as a hardfork (SWHF). A hardfork would allow a slightly cleaner implementation but would also require replay protection (as the exchanges have specifically asked for lately). SWSF does not require replay protection assuming a hashrate majority. Replay protection is difficult thus SWHF would altogether cause more technical debt than SWSF. Also a hardfork is generally considered of higher risk and would take longer preparation time. 5. Because of a block verification processing time vulnerability that increases quadratically with block size, increasing the block size is only possible AFTER SegWit is active and only for SegWit transactions. There might be alternative solutions but these will require more computing resources and do not scale as good with larger block size. 6. Any alternative to SegWit SF would take at least half a year longer in implementation and testing. 7. A large mining hardware manufacturer and a rich early adopter are trying to prevent SegWit from being activated, probably because of financial incentives and/or power political reasons ([verified chatlogs](URL 8. It is safe to ignore the Hong Kong agreement as it was never 'officially' signed by 'Core' (and other reasons). If you feel like bringing it up chances are you should research it some more. 9. Watching altcoins with SegWit flourish pressure from the users will become so high that Bitcoin finally will get SegWit, probably by the miners accepting SWSF after all. 10. Expect interference from the establishment and altcoin investors to fuel conflicts within the Bitcoin community. Educate yourselves thoroughly, stick to the facts and be polite.

Neither implementation was testing their consensus code on any other testnets; this was effectively the only testnet being used to test either codebase. The issue was due to a [block on the testnet](URL that was mined on July 30, almost a full month prior to anyone noticing the fork at all, which was in violation of the BIP109 specification that Classic miners were purportedly adhering to at the time. Gregory Maxwell [observed](URL &gt;That was a month ago, but it's only being noticed now. I guess this is demonstrating that you are releasing Bitcoin Classic without much testing and that almost no one else is either? :-/ &gt;The transaction in question doesn't look at all unusual, other than being large. It was, incidentally, mined by pool.bitcoin.com, which was signaling support for BIP109 in the same block it mined that BIP 109 violating transaction. Later that day, [Maxwell asked Roger Ver to clarify whether he was actually running Bitcoin Classic on the bitcoin.com mining pool](URL who dodged the question and [responded with a vacuous reply that attempted to inexplicably change the subject to ""censorship"" instead.](URL Andrew Stone (the lead developer of Bitcoin Unlimited) [voiced confusion](URL about BIP109 and how Bitcoin Unlimited violated the specification for it (while falsely signaling support for it). He later [argued](URL that Bitcoin Unlimited didn't need to bother adhering to specifications that it signaled support for, and that doing so would violate the philosophy of the implementation. Peter Rizun [shared this view](URL Neither developer was able to answer [Maxwell's direct question](URL about the violation of BIP109 4/5, which had resulted in the consensus divergence (fork). Despite Maxwell having provided [a direct link to the transaction violating BIP109](URL that caused the chain split, and explaining in detail what the results of this were, later [Andrew Stone said](URL &gt;**I haven't even bothered to find out the exact cause.** We have had BUIP016 passed to adhere to strict BIP109 compatibility (at least in what we generate) by merging Classic code, but BIP109 is DOA -- so **no-one bothered to do it.** &gt;I think that the only value to be had from this episode is to realise that consensus rules should be kept to an absolute, money-function-protecting minimum. **If this was on mainnet, I'll be the Classic users would be unhappy to be forked onto a minority branch because of some arbitrary limit** that is yet another thing would have needed to be fought over as machine performance improves but the limit stays the same. Incredibly, when a confused user expressed disbelief regarding the fork, Andrew Stone [responded](URL &gt;Really? There was no classic fork? As i said i didnt bother to investigate. Can you give me a link to more info? Its important to combat this fud. Of course, the proof of the fork (and the BIP109-violating block/transaction) had already been provided to Stone by Maxwell. **Andrew Stone was willing to believe that the entire fork was imaginary, in the face of verifiable proof of the incident.** He admits that he didn't investigate the subject *at all*, even though that was the only testnet that Unlimited could have possibly been performing any meaningful tests on at the time, and even though this fork [forced Classic to abandon BIP109 entirely](URL leaving it vulnerable to the types of attacks that Gavin Andresen described in his [Guided Tour of the 2mb Fork](URL &gt;Accurate sigop/sighash accounting and limits is important, because without it, increasing the block size limit might be dangerous... It is set to 1.3 gigabytes, which is big enough so none of the blocks currently in the block chain would hit it, but small enough to make it impossible to create poison blocks that take minutes to validate. As a result of this fork (*which Stone was clueless enough to doubt had even happened*), Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited were *both* left vulnerable to such attacks. Fascinatingly, this fact did not seem to bother the developers of Bitcoin Unlimited at all. _____________________________________________________________________________________ On November 17, 2016 Andrew Stone decided to post an article titled [A Short Tour of Bitcoin Core](URL wherein he claimed: &gt;Bitcoin Unlimited is building the highest quality, most stable, Bitcoin client available. We have a strong commitment to quality and testing as you will see in the rest of this document. The irony of this claim should soon become very apparent. In the rest of the article, Stone wrote with venomous and overtly hostile rhetoric: &gt;As we mine the garbage in the Bitcoin Core code together... I want you to realise that these issues are systemic to Core He went on to describe what he believed to be multiple bugs that had gone unnoticed by the Core developers, and concluded his article with the following paragraph: &gt;I hope when reading these issues, you will realise that the Bitcoin Unlimited team might actually be the most careful committers and testers, with a very broad and dedicated test infrastructure. And I hope that you will see these Bitcoin Core commits bugs that are not tricky and esoteric, but simple issues that well known to average software engineers and commits of Very Ugly Hack code that do not reflect the care required for an important financial network. I hope that you will realise that, contrary to statements from Adam Back and others, the Core team does not have unique skills and abilities that qualify them to administer this network. As soon as the article was published, it was immediately and thoroughly debunked. The ""bugs"" didn't exist in the current Core codebase; some were results of how Andrew had [""mucked with wallet code enough to break"" it](URL and [""many of issues were actually caused by changes they made to code they didn't understand""](URL or had been fixed [years ago in Core](URL and thus only affected obsolete clients (ironically including Bitcoin Unlimited itself). As Gregory Maxwell said: &gt;Perhaps the biggest and most concerning danger here isn't that they don't know what they're doing-- but that they don't know what they don't know... to the point where *this* is their best attempt at criticism. Amusingly enough, in the ""Let's Lose Some Money"" section of the article, Stone disparages an unnamed developer for leaving poor comments in a portion of the code, unwittingly [making fun of Satoshi himself in the process](URL To summarize: Stone set out to criticize the Core developer team, and in the process revealed that he did not understand the codebase he was working on, had in fact personally introduced the majority of the bugs that he was criticizing, and was actually completely unable to identify any bugs that existed in current versions Core. Worst of all, even after receiving feedback on his article, he did not appear to comprehend (much less appreciate) any of these facts. _____________________________________________________________________________________ On January 27, 2017, [Bitcoin Unlimited excitedly released v1.0 of their software, announcing](URL &gt;The third official BU client release reflects our opinion that Bitcoin full-node software has reached a milestone of functionality, stability and scalability. Hence, completion of the alpha/beta phase throughout 2009-16 can be marked in our release version. A mere 2 days later, on January 29, their code accidentally attempted to hard-fork the network. Despite there being [a very clear and straightforward comment in Bitcoin Core](URL explaining the space reservation for coinbase transactions in the code, Bitcoin Unlimited [obliviously merged a bug](URL into their client which resulted in [an invalid block (23 bytes larger than 1MB) being mined by Roger Ver's Bitcoin.com mining pool on January 29, 2017](URL costing the pool a minimum of [13.2 bitcoins](URL A large portion of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes and miners (which naively accepted this block as valid) were temporarily banned from the network as a result, as well. The code change in question revealed that the Bitcoin Unlimited developers were not only [""commenting out and replacing code without understanding what it's for""](URL as well as bypassing [*multiple* safety-checks](URL that should have prevented such issues from occurring, but that they were not performing any peer review or testing whatsoever of many of the code changes they were making. This particular bug was pushed directly to the master branch of Bitcoin Unlimited (by Andrew Stone), without any associated pull requests to handle the merge or any reviewers involved to double-check the update. This once again exposed the unprofessionalism and negligence of the development team and process of Bitcoin Unlimited, and in this case, irrefutably had a negative effect in the real world by costing Bitcoin.com thousands of dollars worth of coins. In effect, this was the first public mainnet fork attempt by Bitcoin Unlimited. Unsurprisingly, the attempt failed, costing the would-be forkers real bitcoins as a result. It is possible that the costs of this bug are much larger than the lost rewards and fees from this block alone, as other Bitcoin Unlimited miners may have been expending hash power in the effort to mine slightly-oversized (invalid) blocks prior to this incident, inadvertently wasting resources in the doomed pursuit of invalid coins. _____________________________________________________________________________________ On March 14, 2017, a [remote exploit vulnerability discovered in Bitcoin Unlimited](URL crashed [75% of the BU nodes on the network](URL in a matter of minutes. In order to downplay the incident, Andrew Stone rapidly published [an article](URL which attempted to imply that the remote-exploit bug also affected Core nodes by claiming that: &gt;approximately 5% of the Satoshi Bitcoin clients (Core, Unlimited, XT) temporarily dropped off of the network In reddit comments, he lied even more explicitly, describing it as [""a bug whose effects you can see as approximate 5% drop in Core node counts""](URL as well as a [""network-wide Bitcoin client failure""](URL He went so far as to claim: &gt;the Bitcoin Unlimited team found the issue, identified it as an attack and fixed the problem before the Core team chose to ignore it The vulnerability in question was in [thinblock.cpp](URL which has never been part of Bitcoin Core; in other words, this vulnerability *only* affected Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited nodes. In the same Medium article, Andrew Stone appears to have [doctored images](URL to further deceive readers. In the reddit thread discussing this deception, Andrew Stone denied that he had maliciously edited the images in question, but when questioned in-depth on the subject, he resorted to [citing his own doctored images as sources](URL and refused to respond to further requests for clarification or replication steps. Beyond that, the same incident report (and images) conspicuously omitted the fact that the alleged ""5% drop"" on the screenshotted (and photoshopped) node-graph was actually due to [the node crawler having been rebooted](URL rather than any problems with Core nodes. This fact was plainly displayed on the 21 website that the graph originated from, but no mention of it was made in Stone's article or report, even after [he was made aware of it and asked to revise](URL or retract his deceptive statements. There were actually 3 (fundamentally identical) Xthin-assert exploits that Unlimited developers [unwittingly publicized](URL during this episode, which caused problems for Bitcoin Classic, which was [also vulnerable](URL On top of all of the above, the vulnerable code in question had gone unnoticed for [10 months](URL and despite the Unlimited developers (including Andrew Stone) claiming to have (eventually) discovered the bug themselves, it later came out that this was another lie; [an external security researcher had actually discovered it and disclosed it privately to them](URL This researcher provided the following quotes regarding Bitcoin Unlimited: &gt;I am quite beside myself at how a project that aims to power a $20 billion network can make beginners mistakes like this. &gt;I am rather dismayed at the poor level of code quality in Bitcoin Unlimited and I suspect there [is] a raft of other issues &gt;The problem is, the bugs are so glaringly obvious that when fixing it, it will be easy to notice for anyone watching their development process, &gt;it doesnt help if the software project is not discreet about fixing critical issues like this. &gt;In this case, the vulnerabilities are so glaringly obvious, it is clear no one has audited their code because these stick out like a sore thumb In what appeared to be a desperate attempt to distract from the fundamental ineptitude that this vulnerability exposed, Bitcoin Unlimited supporters (including Andrew Stone himself) attempted to change the focus to [a tweet that Peter Todd made](URL about the vulnerability, blaming him for exposing it and prompting attackers to exploit it... but other Unlimited developers revealed that [the attacks had actually begun well before Todd had tweeted about the vulnerability](URL This was [pointed out many times](URL even by [Todd himself](URL but Stone ignored these facts [a week later](URL and shamelessly lied about the timeline in a propagandistic effort at distraction and misdirection."

146,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"ASICBOOST is not the issue, it's the misinformation campaign",17,63xwg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/63xwg3/asicboost_is_not_the_issue_its_the_misinformation/,2017-04-07 13:09:39,"Wanted to share my thoughts on recent events. **1) ASICBOOST is not the issue** I believe that the use of ASICBOOST is fair game. Sure, the Bitcoin protocol has a vulnerability. But it is not the miners job to fix vulnerabilities. The only thing miners essentially care about is profits. And to that end, it is within their rights to exploit a loophole in the network. This is just the invisible hands at work. Some might argue that the ASICBOOST exploit should be labeled as an attack on the network. I can see why someone would call it an attack, while some would call it a genius optimization. Its just a matter of perspectives. Maxwell looks at it from the developers perspective. To him, the Bitcoin protocol should be as bullet-proof as possible, free from foul plays. The miners look at it from the businesss perspective. To them, a vulnerability, as long as it doesnt harm them, is an opportunity to earn money. So I can understand both sides of the argument, and to call it an attack or just business as usual is just a matter of perspectives. But that is not what people are angry about. To bring up competition in the free market is to totally miss the larger point. Which is: **It is within the miners right to seek secret commercial advantages, but it is not within their rights to wage media campaign that obfuscates real issues and blocks technical progress.** And that is what people take issue with. A few miners have repeatedly blocked Segwit, and convinced others very loudly to do the same, without revealing the vested interest they have in the non-Segwit world. Would you ever ask a Wall Street derivative trader for advice on how to reform the derivative trading industry? Of course not! Because of the obvious conflict of interest. **The same goes for Bitcoin miners who have a vested interest in the non-Segwit world. These miners should be disqualified from making technical evaluation of Segwit.** So it was dishonest of them to wage a PR campaign to do exactly so. Even if the ASICBOOST allegation turns out to be false, this is a valid concern from a system perspective: **Are miners ever qualified to make technical recommendations, without disclosing their conflicts of interest?** Some might argue that miners are not stupid. That they understand that if their actions harm Bitcoin, Bitcoin value will go down and they, too, will suffer. So there is no way they would act against Bitcoins interest. But this argument misses an important factor. It underestimates the amount of sunk cost miners have with the existing ASIC hardware they already invested in. This makes it difficult for them to be flexible on protocol changes. (I suspect the problem is way worse because many of these mining companies probably operate with high debt.) So in the long term, the miners interests might align with Bitcoins. But in the short term, that might not always be the case. **Whats important to point out is the information asymmetry advantage the miners enjoy. You can have valid criticisms of Core (no one is beyond criticism) and their roadmap, but at least anyone can audit Cores code changes due to the nature of open source software. You cant audit what the miners say or their intention.** A good, working free market requires the majority of participants to be able to make informed decisions. And a lot of people have been misled into making uninformed decisions due to this information asymmetry. So the lesson here is it pays to keep the miners honest. **2) Mining centralization is a bigger problem than development centralization** Jeff Garzik brought up a few interesting points in a recent [Forbes Unchained podcast](URL - Bitcoin consensus rules are similar to the US Constitution, in terms of being resistant to change by design - Bitcoin could learn from NASA use of a 9-step ladder process, called TLR to gauge technology readiness - the issue of development centralization. Regarding the issue of development centralization, it is a valid concern IMO. Generally speaking, I believe developers could be biased, in choosing what features to implement and the order in which they implement them. They might have interests that do not align with Bitcoins, e.g., due to philosophical differences between what they and others perceive Bitcoin to be. They might be bought out by unknown third parties that have ulterior motives. However, I believe this concern is mitigated by the transparent nature of open source software. All technical proposals are out in the open, and anybody can audit the intended code changes. The developers cant force the network to adopt new changes. Whats important to note is that **whatever ulterior motives developers might have, the only way they can express their intent is through code and only code**. They can say the most controversial things in the world, but code is the only means they have to actually make a meaningful impact. The worst things that can happen with development centralization are: 1. *Stagnation*: the developers started writing code that other market participants dont accept, and then no changes would be adopted. The Bitcoin protocol and network would stay stagnant. 2. *Death*: once Bitcoin gets stagnant, other alternative cryptocurrencies might leapfrog Bitcoin in terms of innovations, and Bitcoin might die if consumers start adopting these altcoins. I think both of these issues are over-blown. Regarding issue 1, some people view stagnation as a disaster, especially for those who want Bitcoin to be a payment network (as opposed to Bitcoin as a store of value). I believe that Bitcoin can serve both use cases. But it will take a long time. Going back to Garziks point about the similarity between Bitcoin consensus and the US Constitution. We should think of the resistance to change as a feature, not a bug. Yes it might be slower to change things, but it also promotes stability for the ecosystem. Bitcoin needs patience and stability to succeed, it will not be overnight. Equally noteworthy is Garziks second point: Bitcoin should learn from NASAs TRL process and try to have the same maturity, in terms of gauging technology readiness and deploying them. Regarding issue 2, I think people vastly underestimate social acceptance, trust and network effects. It is not easy to create a brand as strong as Bitcoin. If you spend a lot of time in the cryptocurrency space, you might be inclined to think that any of the altcoins out there could replace Bitcoin tomorrow. But I dont think that will be the case. The Bitcoin brand is super strong and it has taken many years to get to this point. To quote the Isareli historian Yuval Noah Harari, money is essentially societys [collective hallucination](URL It wont be that easy to get everyone on the planet to hallucinate about an altcoin the same way we already do about Bitcoin. On the other hand, I think that mining centralization is a much, much bigger issue. Unlike developers, miners have financial resources to throw around and can be more effective in bending the system to their benefits. There have been a lot of examples throughout history of systems being corrupted by people with money. A few recent examples: the NRA lobbying against gun laws, or the oil industry lobbying against climate change policies. So for me, it is in Bitcoins interest to keep mining as decentralized as possible."

The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State. - Joseph Goebbels Many of us falsely assume that, when people like Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and Craig Wright create blatant, bold, outrageous lies, they are spontaneous and poorly designed. But I assure you that these proclamations are not spontaneous. Roger, Jihan, and Craig have spent many hours - with many public relations and marketing experts - determining precisely where and how to allocate resources to the maximize the effects of the lies they tell. There is method to the madness; these men are not interested in morality, justice, or the benefit of mankind. They are pursuing fame and wealth, and they spare no cost (or expertise) in order to achieve what they want. Here's some good news: if you're reading this and understand it to be true, you are undoubtedly immune to these tactics. You can count yourself among the more intelligent (less gullible) of the human race. The bad news is, men like Joseph Goebbels, Roger Ver, Jihan Wu, and Craig Wright aren't interested in you. They don't care what you think. They don't want to persuade you (per se), because you are too smart to fall for their campaigns. They know this. So they ignore you (and all your protests). They are targeting stupidity and vulnerability. That's what they need. And it works. If you visit r/btc and read many of the comments and responses, you will find that they contain an abundance of profanity, trite aphorisms, ascribed stereotypes, and catch phrases. These are the voices of cattle. They are the grinding mouthpieces that people like Roger, Jihan, and Craig need in order to expand the ranks of faithful. They need slogans. They need loyalty. They need unquestioning fools who respond eagerly, passionately, and predictably to even the slightest suggestion of surface-level malfeasance. And because ignorance is the fertilizer for the movements, the more outlandish and horrifying the lies, the more likely the idiots are to adopt them and repeat them - ad nauseam. So what is the cure? Unfortunately, there is no magic button we can push to make this stop. History shows us that, by and large, the only solution to this problem is to let the disease run its course. But that doesn't mean we're powerless. The best response to this type of propaganda is calm, rational reason. Try not to use catch phrases. Try not to condescend. Try be patient. Always be polite. And if none of that works, silence is always your friend. And there is more good news. In the end, the truth always wins. It may take a while, but propaganda, fear campaigns, and lies are unsustainable. Roger and Craig (and probably Jihan) are predictable sociopaths; they fear exposure and failure above all else. They delude themselves into believing they can sustain the campaigns as long as they follow Goebbel's advice: just keep repeating the lies. But the truth caught up to Goebbels, just as it catches up to all liars. Roger, Jihan, and Craig will be no different. We just need to be patient. Bitcoin is fine. It's working as designed. It's working as promised. We mustn't get caught up in the mania created by morons, because then we fall into the trap."

I have been playing on nitrogensports.eu (mostly poker, but also the occasional sports bet) for over 2 years and have generally been pleased with their site. I enabled 2FA on the account (via Google Authenticator) very early on and have not changed it in at least a year (most likely two). On nitrogen, they require an OTP for logging in as well as requesting withdrawals. My email address is not connected to my account at all and I use a unique username/password to access the site that is not shown to other players and not used on other sites. I woke up one day last week to find that my balance was empty and 2 successful withdrawals had been made. I immediately contacted support via their on-site ticket system and began inspecting all of my other accounts to try to figure out what had happened. After several days of fruitless back and forth with support and a full investigation of my own devices and accounts, I still cant seem to figure out what happened and how my account was compromised. I was hoping someone who perhaps knows a bit more about 2FA and Google Authenticator could point me in the right direction. Here are the facts as I understand them: 1. My 2FA Device (iPhone) was always and still is in my possession 2. None of my gmail accounts were accessed from any devices or locations that are not mine 3. My icloud account was not accessed from any devices/locations that are not mine and has 2FA of its own 4. Nitrogen was not affected by the CloudFlare vulnerability 5. There is no evidence that either one of my home computers were compromised 6. My iPhone is not backed up anywhere locally 7. None of my other 2FA enabled accounts were touched in any way. No failed logins, nothing. This includes other bitcoin exchanges/wallets. Nitrogen conducted some type of investigation relating to the matter but did not return any useful results. What am I missing? How did this person get access to all 3 credentials (username, pass, and 2FA secret)? EDIT: I wanted to clarify that Nitrogen did state in a support response after their investigation that ""We've concluded no illegitimate access to the account has occurred as a result of a breach of Nitrogen Sports security."""

I'm a customer of theirs, and generally they're good at what they do. However in their latest newsletter email they took the opportunity to criticize Bitcoin to their customers. It's a real shame imo because I think there's a good deal of cross-over between people interested in gold and people interested in Bitcoin. BullionByPost should be looking at ways to capitalize on that, not trying to use their influence to stifle interest. Here's the newsletter: &gt; **Is one Bitcoin really more valuable than an ounce of gold?** &gt;With the pound on its worst run since August and plenty of indications of a downturn in the UK economy as Theresa May moves to trigger Article 50, we predict an increasing interest in safe-haven investments in the near future. One asset whose popularity is rising is bitcoin. The cryptocurrency's value has risen dramatically in the last twelve months, and some advocates view bitcoin as the currency of the future. Bitcoin has drawn attention recently as the price of one coin rose above an ounce of gold. It is currently trading at 1019 per bitcoin. &gt;However to consider bitcoin a viable alternative for gold seems premature. As a digital currency with no material value, it is hard to see how bitcoin varies from other fiat currencies in terms of security. Can a digitcal currency match the safety of a physical asset with a high intrinsic value? Gold may currently be priced lower, can we really argue that its intrinsic value is lower than that of bitcoin? &gt;History demonstrates that bitcoin is unlikely to hold this position for a sustained amount of time, with dramatic swings in its price characteristic of the cryptocurrency.The lack of regulation in the bitcoin market means that there is a considerable risk attached to bitcoin, with its price being extremely volatile and vulnerable to manipulation. &gt;The digital currency suffered a setback on Friday when the Securities and Exchange Commission rejecting a proposal to establish a bitcoin ETF on Friday, citing a lack of regulation as a major concern. The approval of such an ETF would have made bitcoin far more accessible, boosting demand and thus its value. &gt;The decision saw bitcoins value plummet by more than 15% on Friday. Although the bitcoin price has almost fully recovered since then, this drop demonstrates the vulnerability of an asset that is struggling to truly establish itself as a mainstream form of investment. Compared to gold, an asset that has maintained a high value for thousands of years, the volatile and unpredictable bitcoin appears more a speculative punt than a reliable long term store of wealth. "

In terms of bringing visibility to bitcoin and potentially more adopters into our system it seems like a win-win. They'd also get the potential benefit that their raised funds may appreciate, which again is speculative of course but volatility seems to be leveling off and their use is likely relatively short term - this is not retirement money. Other benefits: their utilization of the funds could be tracked by backers and they'd potentially get backers from our community.

I wanted to share my experience to help educate others of where these security vulnerabilities are, and how they can affect you. Notice I'm refraining from posting some terrible title such as OMG someone just stole my bitcoin, help!, this is because I know where the security vulnerability is, and how it should be addressed. Bitcoin itself is a completely secure system and 100% trustworthy. My security flaws ended up being from other websites, most not even bitcoin related. Around 10:00pm last night I received a text message from Circle containing my 2-factor authentication code required for login. Obviously I was not trying to login to Circle at that time and realized someone was up to no good. However, this attack on my Circle account was stopped because of that 2-factor login method. I then remembered that my Circle account was protected with a password I know for a fact is compromised. I had not got around to changing my password because I really don't have anything stored in that account. I did quickly change the password and brushed off the experience. Around 1:00am I received an email from changetip. It was a withdrawl email for about $25 in bitcoin. Turns out, I must have been using that same compromised password for my reddit account, since that was how I usually logged into my changetip account. Do to using the compromised password on something as simple as my social media account (reddit), it inadvertently resulted in the loss of $25 of bitcoin. I think this is a very important lesson Ive learned first hand, and I wanted to share the experience with all of you. If I had left a compromised password on one of my main email accounts, this loss could have been a lot worse. I will be taking proactive steps to increase all of my online passwords today including: - Changing all of my email passwords, both personal and business. - Double checking I have 2-factor auth on said emails - Make sure my email accounts have a recovery email method - Change passwords for all bitcoin sites Ive signed up for. All different passwords. Things you should look for before sending bitcoin to any website wallet account: - 2-factor authentication login method - Site requires you to click a link in an email to confirm withdrawals In the end, I would simply like to remind people that the bitcoin I lost was because I trusted another online party to store some bitcoin. This loss is a result of my pure laziness. However, I will be looking into security options available to me from changetip to help improve my account security. Regardless, the safest place to store bitcoin is on your own wallet, on your own hardware, with limited internet access. Your bitcoin is 100% safe that way. Dont be scared to use bitcoin and store it yourself. Just dont be lazy, change your passwords regularly, and dont use the same password for every website. Even if that website is not related to bitcoin.

I originally planned to use 3 Trezor devices, however I have realized that this creates a central point of failure if Trezor is ever forced to include a backdoor, or there is somehow a vulnerability in their code that is missed. Because of that, I am now considering to use three different hardware devices; Trezor, Ledger, and Keepkey. However, I have some questions that I was hoping you all could help me out with. 1) The only multisignature wallet that I have been able to find that also supports hardware wallets is Copay. However, Copay only allows the use of hardware wallets when using their google chrome app (and not any of their Desktop apps). What are the security implications of this? 2) For the Ledger key, my plan is to use the Ledger Starter to allow for a secure environment to initiate my Ledger wallet in. However, I am having trouble choosing which Ledger Wallet to use (Ledger HW.1, Ledger Nano or Ledger Nano S). What are the major differences of these products? 3) Unlike Trezor and Keepkey, Ledger is not open source. It also uses a smart card instead of normal hardware to secure the private keys. However, the company discusses how the spec is open and it is still safe because the operations are deterministic and can be tested that the software is working as it should be. What are everyones opinions on this? Thank you everyone for all your help!"
167,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Some reasons to add sync flags to Bitcoin,36,4uip05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4uip05/some_reasons_to_add_sync_flags_to_bitcoin/,2016-07-25 23:51:56,"The idea presented here could have the following benefits: 1. Improve mining decentralization 2. Reduce variance in mining profitability 3. Reduce or eliminate SPV mined blocks 4. Reduce or eliminate empty blocks, smoothing out resource usage 5. Reduce or eliminate the latency bottleneck on throughput 6. Make transaction stuffing by miners be either obvious or costly 7. Gives miners something to do while they wait for attractive transactions to appear 8. Can be easily done with a soft fork #Basic idea: Ideally, all miners would begin hashing the next block at exactly the same time. Miners with a head start are more profitable, and the techniques that help miners receive and validate blocks quickly create centralization pressure. What if there was something that acted like the starting flag at a race, which could suddenly wave and cause all of the miners to simultaneously begin hashing the next block? #Implementation: Let a sync flag be a message consisting of: 1. Hash of the previous block. 2. Bitcoin address 3. Nonce This tiny message could propagate through the network at maximum speed. If miners had to include the hash of this flag in the next block, then all miners wait for this flag, and when it suddenly spread through the network, all miners could simultaneously begin hashing the next block. The sync flag should not be produced too quickly. You want to give everyone enough time to be ready to hash the next block. Let's say that the hash of the sync flag is a proof of work that is targeted for 2 minutes. To fund this proof of work, the protocol is modified to demand that the block produced 10 blocks after the sync flag must allocate 25% of the block reward to the address published by the sync flag. In this way, sync flags are produced in 2 minutes, and blocks are produced in 8 minutes, with 10 minutes total. [Illustration 1](URL [Illustration 2](URL #Explanation of reasons: **Improve mining decentralization** One factor driving centralization is the imperative miners have to achieve low latency in receiving and validating blocks. To achieve low latency, it helps a lot if you have expensive low-latency internet connections, curated network topologies, and large pools that have a plausible chance of finding consecutive blocks. If miners are expected (or forced) to validate a block prior to mining on top of it, the rational end game would be to outsource the validation step to a trusted third party specialist who can choose optimal locations on the globe to serve their (multiple?) mining pool clients. These are all less decentralized than the mining situation Satoshi and others imagined. **Reduce variance in mining revenue** Currently, there are about 144 opportunities per day for a pool or solo miner to see any revenue at all. With sync flags, that number doubles to 288. Sync flags are only worth 25% of what a block is worth, but this still represents a significant reduction in variance. This variance is one factor causing solo miners to group into pools, and large pools to be more attractive than small pools. **Reduce or eliminate SPV mined blocks** One way miners have sought to make full-block-transmission-and-validation-latency irrelevant has been through ""SPV"" mining or ""Head-first"" mining. There is some evidence that these techniques may be widely used, and that badgering the miners about it is an ineffective strategy to stop them. In SPV mining, a miner would simply accept any block header that shows the correct proof of work. All other validation is entrusted to other miners. This practice is quite dangerous as the SPV miners can wander off on some invalid chain, taking SPV nodes with them. If this occurs during a soft fork, these blind miners can also fool unupgraded fully validating nodes into following them. ""Head-first"" mining means that miners start hashing as soon as they receive the block header with the correct POW, but they simultaneously validate the block, and abandon it if is not valid. I consider this to be pretty safe, as it strictly limits the length of an invalid chain that can result from mining without validating. However, ""Head-first"" mining can plausibly generate 2 or 3 confirmations of an invalid block. It would be nice if such confirmations did not happen. The sync flag technique is similar to head-first mining, but rather than hashing the next block while they wait for transmission and validation of the prior block, they hash the sync flag. Nodes can differentiate between sync flags and blocks, and can ignore sync flags when counting confirmations. **Reduce or eliminate empty blocks, smoothing out resource usage** Empty blocks are another consequence of SPV or Headfirst mining, because the miner cannot safely include any transactions in the block they are hashing until they have validated the prior block. By delaying the start of hashing the next block until after validation, miners would not have this reason to mine empty blocks. **Reduce or eliminate the latency bottleneck on throughput** Centralization pressure due to latency issues has been a major preoccupation over the last year. If latency mattered much less, it could represent a scalability improvement that could enable higher throughput. **Make transaction stuffing by miners be either obvious or costly** Currently, the entire block reward goes to the miner who mines it. One unfortunate consequence of this is that it does not cost the miner anything to covertly stuff the block with transactions. These transactions would pay fees and be indistinguishable from ordinary transactions, but the fees are paid by the miner and then immediately returned to the miner. With sync flags, the miner must share these transaction fees with the address contained in the sync flag 10 blocks prior. This means that if the miner gives the transactions a normal looking fee, they will incur a cost that will be paid to the sync flag. If the miner wants to avoid this, they must give their stuffing transactions a zero fee, which provides evidence that they are stuffing. Also, when miners stuff with transactions using a zero fee, they cannot manipulate the perception of how much fee it takes to get into a block. Note that miners could still try to covertly stuff blocks that will pay a sync flag that they themselves created. if this is a big concern, it can be addressed by forcing blocks to pay multiple sync flags. **Gives miners something to do while they wait for attractive transactions to appear** From the Montreal scaling workshop last year, we have [this talk](URL which worried that as the block subsidy reduced and transactions became a more important fraction of miner revenue, it would be rational for miners to turn off their mining equipment for a ""gap"" phase after a block is found, to allow time to pass as more lucrative transactions entered the mempool. I don't know whether this will actually happen. The presence of a suitable backlog of transactions would help prevent this dynamic from emerging. But if such idling behavior was the optima mining strategy, it could create a serious vulnerability. Idle hands are the devil's workshop as the saying goes, and idle miners represent a pool of inert hashpower that is available to rent for all kinds of destabilizing purposes. It would be better to put those miners to profitable work mining a sync flag while they wait. Also, this creates a more efficient price discovery mechanism for transactions, because you allow transactions paying high fees time to arrive to the marketplace, rather than take whatever anyone is offering because all the ""good"" transactions got gobbled up in the prior block. **Can be easily done with a soft fork** Although a hard fork would be more efficient, sync flags could be easily implemented using a soft fork by introducing the following rule: Every block must include a transaction which pays 25% of the block reward to the address given by the 10th previous sync flag, and commits to the hash of the 1st previous sync flag. #Am I missing anything here?"

The leading manufacture of HSMs is a company called Safenet. Safenet's HSMS are used by Amazon for its cloud HSM service. Last year, researchers discovered a key extraction vulnerability in Safnet HSMs. An attacker could copy a 2 byte portion of a key and then brute force it. The attack could be executed so it left no trace in the normal HSM logs. See the link below for details. URL My guess is that the attackers put malware on a computer connected to the HSM.

I do not practice law, but wanted a forum where information can be exchanged. Here is the link to the entire page: URL Some interesting key sections to note. CREDITORS ARRANGEMENTS A creditors' arrangement (CA) is a procedure which enables a company to compromise liabilities with creditors. It is similar to a company voluntary arrangement under the English Insolvency Act 1986. A CA is flexible and can vary or cancel debts. A CA cannot affect the rights of secured or preferential creditors without their written consent. A proposal for a creditors' arrangement may be made by the directors, or if the company is in liquidation or administration, by the liquidator or administrator. The company must be insolvent or likely to become insolvent. There is no moratorium on creditor rights and no court involvement. The arrangement must name a licensed insolvency practitioner who will act as the interim supervisor. The interim supervisor calls a creditors meeting to consider the arrangement within 28 days of his appointment. If the creditors approve the arrangement by 75% in value of those present at the meeting, the arrangement takes effect. If approved, the arrangement binds all creditors of the company (including dissenting creditors) and creditors who were not present at the meeting or who did not have notice of it. There are safeguards for creditors who are unfairly prejudiced to apply to the court for relief. The duties and powers of the supervisor are set out in the arrangement. They will usually include the power to take control of assets. The arrangement will terminate upon completion of the arrangement, at which point notice is given to the company, the members, the creditors and the Registrar of Corporate Affairs, together with a report summarising the receipts and payments. SCHEMES OF ARRANGEMENT Section 179A of the Business Companies Act 2004 enables a compromise or arrangement to be proposed between a company and its creditors or members. In law, a scheme is a contract varying or compromising the obligations owed by a company to its members or to its creditors. In substance, a scheme is a business plan. Since its content is not prescribed by law, it offers great flexibility. Creditors schemes are commonly proposed by insolvent companies in an effort to stave off liquidation. In this form, it is a survival strategy. The key feature of a scheme is that it can be imposed on a minority against their will, which is why it is regulated by various statutory safeguards. In this respect, it is similar to a creditors arrangement (CA). The key difference between a scheme and a CA is the level of court supervision or intervention. A scheme requires the courts approval at two key stages of its implementation, and at each of these stages, the courts scrutiny is thorough. However, once sanctioned by the court, a scheme entails little or no interference by the Court. Unfair preference A liquidator may apply to court to set aside a preference that has the effect of placing a creditor in a better position than they would have been in the event of a liquidation. The preference must have occurred within the vulnerability period (see above) and the company must have been insolvent at the time or become so as a result of the preference. There is an exception for transactions in the ordinary course of business. The test is the effect of the transaction and not, as in English law, a desire to prefer. If the person is connected with the company, there is a rebuttable presumption that the company was insolvent at the time or became so as a result of the preference, and that it did not take place in the ordinary course of business. The court may make such order as it considers fit to restore the position to what it would have been had the preference not occurred. "

Industry has woken up and they now clearly see the value proposition of blockchains. Today, every single one of them is dismissing using the bitcoin network because of it's low capacity and high fees. Let me assure you, that is a very good thing for us. If we had 300mb blocks supporting transactions for a penny a piece, I guarantee you that businesses would fill every bit of that space as fast as possible; to record their stock trades, their invoices, their medical records, you name it. That's all I heard talked about by various banks and industries. They are incredibly excited about the prospect of using blockchains for these purposes. Today, they are choosing to use ethereum and hyperledger and others, since the bitcoin network cannot support that use case. Let's be clear. We do **not** want them using our network to record billions of their petty transactions. The bitcoin network needs to be protected. It has, today, 12 billion dollars worth of value in it. In coming years we all hope to see that approach 120 billion and even higher. The acceptable level of risk, when it comes to changing the network dynamics, is extraordinarily low. Could we raise the blocksize limit to 2mb safely? Yeah, probably we could. Could we raise it to maybe 4mb or even 8mb? Maybe, with extensive testing and some network improvements. But, even if we did that, that space would get flooded immediately. There is exponential demand for cheap, insanely secure, transaction space that bitcoin would offer. What I learned at that conference is everyone wants what bitcoin has, and if they can get it cheaply they will use it all up. Look, I get it. The high fees are annoying. The inability to perform low value transactions in a timely manner is annoying. But, let me tell you what is frightening. The idea that we would make rapid changes to the network, risking decentralization or network problems, risking everyone's money, just so we can keep using the network for inexpensive low value payments. Did everyone else see their bitcoins increase in value dramatically in the past few weeks? Good. Keep it that way. The acceptable level of risk to our savings is pretty low. When I began my career as a software engineer I started out doing cardiovascular research at St. Louis University. I worked on software which analyzed every single heartbeat a patient had for 24 hours. If my software had a bug in it, it could actually lead to the death of a patient. Now imagine someone who writes software for a pacemaker, an airliner, a nuclear power station, and so on. I didn't do that work for long, for most of my career I have worked on computer video games where, the worst that could happen, is someone's game might crash and they lose some save-game checkpoint. A bug easily patched. But..a bug in bitcoin, or a network vulnerability, could lead to a loss of 12 billion dollars worth of value! We have spent since 2009 building up trust in this network to the point that people are willing to commit 12 billion dollars of value in it. The acceptable level of risk to any change to the network or the software is incredibly low. We can, and should, get sidechains up and working as soon as possible. On a sidechain, pegged to bitcoin value, you could try BU, you could try any damned crazy ideal you want. And, the only thing at risk is whatever value got pegged over there. **EDIT** I wake up this morning to the news of what's going on over at ETH. I feel no schadenfreude about what they are going through and while, technically, it is not a bug in ethereum, but rather an exploit of a particular script running on the network, it does prove the point that adding technical complexity increases potential attack vectors. It has long been a criticism of ETH that the complexity and open-ended nature of their scripting language presented way too much surface area for attackers. In contrast, the bitcoin scripting language is very restrictive and adding a single new opcode can takes months to years to get through the approval, testing, and vetting process. What I'm saying here, is I think this demonstrates my point that being extremely conservative about changes to a live network holding onto over a billion dollars worth of value is prudent. "

175,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Suggestion for correcting Bitcoin's centralization problem,5,4ir7lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4ir7lb/suggestion_for_correcting_bitcoins_centralization/,2016-05-11 06:20:20,"Argument of Bitcoin centralization: Bitcoin is a fascinating story; its mysterious origins combined with an open source, revolutionary method of distributing and securing information make it a really unique and promising technology the entire world can benefit from. When Satoshi began the first blockchain in January 2009 they envisaged a truly decentralized, secure network protected not by steel and concrete but by mathematics, combined with geographic diversity, so that anyone could use, contribute and be rewarded for securing the global decentralized fledgling blockchain. As time went on industrious miners sought ever more efficient and powerful methods of cracking blocks. The financial reward for the development and implementation of; at first specialized software for GPUs, and later specialized hardware, massively increased the difficulty of finding new blocks. The average home user could no longer compete with their peers, turning instead to pool mining in an attempt to maintain profits and keep the Bitcoin flowing. It was at this point, where miners started pooling resources, centralizing mining efforts and entrusting their precious profits to pool operators that Bitcoin in its original concept began to fail. The days in which anyone could download the wallet, contribute to network security and be rewarded for their efforts were over. As mining pools grew so did their total hash rate, bringing with it the threat of 51% attacks and chain forking; today the peace kept by pools artificially keeping their hashing power below 51% - a far cry from the mathematically secured, globally distributed system Satoshi envisaged at Bitcoin's inception. In recent months there has been an ongoing argument over block size. Back in the days when Bitcoin mining was highly distributed the community would vote as to which version they would run by running the code of their choice. As centralization wormed its way into the core of Bitcoin the large pools were given more power to decide over the direction development should take - leading to the impasse Bitcoin now faces broadly between miners and users. All of the above has led to the inescapable conclusion that Proof of Work (PoW) no longer provides the highly distributed, ubiquitously inclusive security model that technology such as Bitcoin requires. This is not a failure of the technology behind PoW, but a failure of the humans (myself included) that employ it to turn a profit and drive the blockchain forward. Proposal for change: One of the key benefits of Bitcoin in comparison to traditional monetary systems is decentralization. By removing a central issuing authority and placing the generation of new money and processing of transactions in the hands of the majority consensus, Bitcoin has provided hope to those seeking a fair monetary system that isnt gamed by a controlling minority. Due to some unforeseeable developments occurring after the launch of Bitcoin, the ugly head of centralization has made an appearance and some changes are necessary if we care to correct it. No longer can an individual run the Bitcoin software on their PC and participate in the Bitcoin network in an influential manner. Mining pools and farms have taken the average individual out of the equation and allowed big players to become the owners of blockchain transaction confirmation and the generation of new coins. Again we encounter control in the hands of the minority with all others forced to follow along, left without a voice. Sound familiar? To fix this problem, I would like to propose an alternative to PoW for discussion as a solution, Proof of Stake (PoS). Not the traditional PoS you find in Peercoin and its clones, but an evolved and improved version that also addresses and corrects the problems found in traditional PoS. Proof of Stake Participation (PoSP) which is not just and idea, but is a tested and proven product currently employed in an alt coin, Crypto Bullion (CBX). The PoSP white paper can be found here URL for further details. Traditional PoS as employed in Peercoin (white paper can be found here URL was created as an attempt to address some of the issues in PoW, primarily the vulnerability to attack, or manipulation that can occur resultant to centralized majority control. (Peercoin actually employs a hybrid system, which uses both PoW and PoS, but I am just going to discuss PoS.) Additional to this, PoS offers a far more energy efficient solution than PoW for generating new coins and confirming transaction. Where PoW requires a high hashrate for security, PoS instead requires a high volume of coins being held online in the network to confirm and enforce honest transactions. The idea being that those with larger investment into the network, reflective by their ownership of coins, are most inclined to act honestly as nefarious activity hurts the value of the network and therefore their investment. The problem however in the traditional implementation of PoS is that it rewards for behavior detrimental to network security. Coin owners are rewarded by interest that is paid on the coins that are held stationary in their wallet for a minimum of 30 days or a maximum of 90 days. Basically, if implemented in Bitcoin, you would have to hold your Bitcoin in your wallet for at least 30 days at which point you could connect to the network and compete to claim interest on the coins you own. A slightly higher interest rate reward would be paid to those who held their Bitcoin stationary for 90 days before connecting and claiming their interest. So instead of mining as we find in PoW, the creation of new coins in PoS occurs via interest payments used as an incentive to encourage coin owners to bring their coins online to the network to validate honest transactions. However since security is dependent on coins being held online at all times, the reward structure of traditional PoS is actually detrimental because it rewards for coins being held off-line. In contrast, PoSP encourages and rewards for coins for being held online. In fact, only coins held online are eligible for earning the reward and those that are held offline forfeit their share to coins active on the network. This is accomplished first by changing the reward structure to a fixed amount per block instead of a variable based on percent of coins staked. PoSP takes a set annual rate of growth in money supply, divides it by the number of blocks set to be generated in a year and establishes that value as the block reward that is doled out to network participants at the generation of each block. So in order to compete and earn a block reward, one must a) own coins, b) have their coins online and c) accumulate 1-hour of coin age (time their coin is held stationary in their wallet  the 1-hour time requirement helps smaller wallets to compete with larger wallets). The reward encourages people to keep their coins online, and since all coin owners will not do this, it allows for an interest earnings rate that surpasses the annual inflation rate further benefiting those who secure the network and confirm transactions and encouraging more people to participate in the network and further enhance security. As an example, PoSP implementation in CBX averages payouts of about 8-10% per year to network participants while the overall inflation rate remains at 2%. If employed in Bitcoin, this would allow everyone who owns Bitcoin and an Internet connection the opportunity to participate in the Bitcoin network confirming transactions and generating new coins  reviving the realization of decentralization. The reward structure could be matched to Bitcoins current schedule for growth in money supply and once the 21 million-coin cap is reached, the block reward would transition to be composed solely of transaction fees. Therefore no change is necessary in Bitcoins scheduled money supply. Regrettably, since centralization has already occurred to a certain extent, making this change now means it would have to be agreed upon by those who currently control the blockchain. These are unfortunately the beneficiaries of the centralization that has occurred so they of course will be hesitant to make this change. However, the push for a fair decentralized system is one of the keys that spurred the growth of Bitcoin to begin with, so to ensure longevity of Bitcoin through loyalty of the majority, centralization has to be dealt with and corrected. edit: added argument to outline Bitcoin centralization claim, courtesy of FiniteRed"

177,vulnerability,Bitcoin,BigchainDB: a prime example of blockchain bullshit,81,4j7wjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4j7wjf/bigchaindb_a_prime_example_of_blockchain_bullshit/,2016-05-14 05:14:22,"## Intro BigchainDB is ""a scalable blockchain database"" (which falls under the category of so-called ""private"" or ""permissioned"" ""blockchains"", I believe) which was released in February 2016. It generated a lot of hype due to impressive scalability benchmarks: it was able to process a million transactions per second. BigchainDB got a lot of praise from private blockchain enthusiasts. It entered many partnerships, e.g. with Eris Industries, Everledger, Capgemini, etc. But BigchainDB's architecture is _fundamentally flawed_. All BigchainDB nodes, by design, connect to a single RethinkDB cluster. (RethinkDB is a distributed NoSQL database, kinda like MongoDB but better.) If something bad happens to that RethinkDB cluster, the whole blockchains goes down. E.g. suppose one node is hijacked by an attacker and executes ""dropTable"" on the RethinkDB cluster it is connected to. All other nodes will go down because they don't have an independent storage. I think it's a beautiful illustration to [Andreas Antonopolous's argument](URL that private blockchains will end up less secure: &gt; In the end, it also lags behind in terms of security because its not exposed to the kind of robust peer review that an open Internet-based system has to have to survive. While bitcoin is getting stronger and stronger with security, these things will actually wither. &gt; The idea being that intranets end up being these really insecure places where youre running Outlook and FrontPage and old versions of Apache that havent been patched. Whereas on the Internet, if youre Facebook, if youre Google, if youre Apple and youre operating Internet applications, you have to be robust. You have to respond to vulnerability. You have to make systems that are antifragile, resilient to attack and theyre constantly evolving and theyve become very robust. I used to think that this argument is weird, but we've got a confirmation: a system which is _fundamentally_ flawed gets all the praises and people start building apps on top of it before it is thoroughly analyzed. ## Proof You might think I'm just making this up or exaggerating. It's hard to believe that all 9 people working on BigchainDB (that's how many co-authors its whitepaper has) don't see a problem with using a single shared RethinkDB cluster. I though that maybe I'm missing something, so I asked this question in their gitter: &gt; killerstorm @killerstorm May 01 23:03 Hey people, do you I understand it correctly that all nodes are connected to a single rethinkdb cluster? what if one of nodes will execute r.dropDb(...)? &gt; Rodolphe Marques @r-marques May 02 12:56 @killerstorm yes all federation nodes are connected to a single rethinkdb cluster. We are working on a consensus protocol that requires a majority of the nodes to agree in any change done in the database (voting of blocks is part of that consensus protocol). For data deletion we are listening to changefeeds on the data and revert any change that should not happen. Regarding more admin tasks like table and db drops we are trying to leverage rethinkdb permissions and replication to make sure no single node is able to just drop the database (still work in progress). &gt; killerstorm @killerstorm May 02 15:39 &gt; Sorry, I don't see how changefeed can protect against data loss. Where would data come from after it's deleted? Is there a backup? &gt; Rodolphe Marques @r-marques May 02 15:41 &gt; backups are a planned feature. Changefeeds can be used to restore data when documents are deleted. When documents are deleted the changedfeed will return the documents that were deleted Although changefeeds are not enough to prevent dataloss in case a node uses db drop. So they confirmed that a single db drop can destroy this ""blockchain database"". But they say that some time in future they will start working on securing their system. A day after I asked a question about dropDb, they added an issue: [How to lock down the RethinkDB ""admin"" account?](URL &gt; @killerstorm pointed out that anyone with admin access to RethinkDB could just drop the database. What can be done to prevent that and similar things (e.g. dropping tables)? So, basically, 8 months after they started the project and 3 months after they released it publicly they became aware that this problem exists. Wow, just wow. ## The mindset Obviously, this isn't the only potential attack vector. It's just the simplest thing which came to my mind. There are probably _thousands_ of serious attack vectors. The fundamental issue is that RethinkDB is not Byzantine fault tolerant, it is not designed as such, it's just an ordinary database. And so if you implement a ""blockchain"" as a thin layer on top of RethinkDB you get it exposed to potential attackers. It's hard to imagine that none of people working on BigchainDB weren't aware of the problem, that would imply that all 9 people working on it are pants-on-head stupid. No, they know that BigchainDB isn't ""Byzantine fault tolerant"", it is mentioned in the white paper. They just don't see a problem with it. It is a startup mindset: make an MVP, ""fake it till you make it"", generate buzz... Security is literally their last priority. They believe that they will add security after they get a lot of money from partners, investors, etc. And, meanwhile, it's just a prototype, bro. The problem with it is that it's highly misleading. Here's what BigchainDB paper says about security: &gt; Byzantine faults: In order to operate in a trustless network, BigchainDB incorporates measures against malicious or unpredictable behavior of nodes in the system. These include mechanisms for voting upon transaction and block validation. Efforts to achieve full Byzantine tolerance are on the roadmap and will be tested with regular security audits. It incorporates measures, you see. Mechanisms. Business people reading this will understand that it's ""mostly secure"". While in reality it's like not secure at all. It can be destroyed with a single line of code. The mechanisms they are talking about are hashes and signatures. It's similar to what Bitcoin does, but by themselves hashes and signatures do not make things secure. You need to use proper architecture and protocols. After all, hashes and public key cryptography existed for almost 50 years, but we've got Bitcoin only 7 years ago. An apt analogy for BigchainDB would be a cargo cult of a blockchain tech: it has hashes like in a real one, it has blocks, etc. There is superficial similarity. But it doesn't ""fly"" like a real one, because superficial similarity doesn't define object properties. And BTW that 1 M tps benchmark they didn't isn't impressive: they were, basically, testing RethinkDB IO speed (as they say themselves). Yep, sure, RethinkDB is great. BigchainDB, on the other hand... The lack of focus on security is understandable when if you take into account that there are no serious uses for ""private blockchains"" yet. People are just experimenting with stuff, doing proof-of-concepts and whatnot. Everybody understands that you aren't going to have real adversaries when you run an internal test. So these make-believe blockchains are OK. Maybe in future this stuff will mature app. BigchainDB might become secure if RethinkDB becomes Byzantine fault tolerant, for example. But, personally, I'm rather disappointed with the ""security last"" approach and deceptive marketing. ## Disclaimer I work in a company which might be, potentially, a BigchainDB competitor. This isn't a coincidence: obviously, ""blockchain tech"" people review blockchain tech software. So this post might be seen as ""shitting on your competitor"" kind of a post, I understand that. But I'm writing this on my own, in my spare time. And when I mentioned BigchainDB to my colleagues, they recommended against writing any articles. If you dig through my comment history, you can see that I've been critical to many things: [Mastercoin](URL [alt-coins](URL [21 inc Bitcoin computer](URL [sidechains](URL and so on.

179,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"Informative post by Greg Maxwell on new blocksonly feature, limits of efficient block transfer and better relay methods",68,47niwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/47niwm/informative_post_by_greg_maxwell_on_new/,2016-02-26 16:02:13,"Couple of highlights &gt;* Bitcoin Core 0.12 introduced a new blocksonly setting. When set to blocksonly a node behaves normally but sends and receives no lose transactions; instead it handles only complete blocks. There are many applications for nodes where only confirmed transactions are interesting, and a node which still verifies and forwards blocks still contributes to network health-- less, perhaps, than one that relays transactions: but it also consumes fewer resources to begin with. An additional downside they don't get the latency advantages of signature caching since every transaction they see is totally new to them-- this isn't something miners should use. &gt;* How much less bandwidth does blocksonly use in practice? I recently measured this using two techniques: Once by instrumenting a node to measure bandwidth used for blocks vs all other traffic, and again by repeatedly running in both modes for a day and monitoring the hosts total network usage; both modes gave effectively the same result. &gt;&gt;* How much is the savings? **Blocksonly reduced the node's bandwidth usage by 88%.** &gt;* A significant implication of this is that **any scheme for bandwidth reduction which works by using already relayed transactions to reduce the size of transmitted blocks can *_AT MOST_* reduce the overall bandwidth usage by 12%-- assuming that differential compression achieved an ""infinity-fold"" improvement**. &gt;* Why does relay use so much bandwidth? The fundamental reason for this is because relay in the Bitcoin Protocol is linear in the number of transactions and the number of peers. (E.g. bandwidth is a function of Transactions * Peers). &gt;One possible scheme I've been discussing (and working on) for a while is mempool reconciliation. &gt;&gt;* The idea is this, at random intervals a node will ask one of it's peers for a sketch of the top X MBytes of it's mempool. In it's request it could also signal that it's interested only in transactions whos ancestor feerate is over some minimum threshold, along with information about the size and feerate of its own mempool. The returned sketch is an IBLT of some size estimated by the sender based on the information sent by the requester. &gt;&gt;* Unlike the efficient block transmission IBLT proposals, this IBLT only transmits transaction IDs-- which will avoid the fragmentation overhead needed in sending whole transactions. &gt;&gt;* The requester then attempts to reconstruct the IDs using the content of it's own mempool. If it is unable to reconstruct all of the IDs, it requests from another random peer with a different seed. &gt;&gt;* When the node has multiple IBLTs it can use the partial solutions from each of them to help solve the other ones. &gt;&gt;* As it learns new txids that it was previously unaware of it then fetches them via getdata. When it completes a reconstruction it can INV any missing transactions towards the peers that didn't have them. &gt;*In any case, this scheme would avoid the quadratic-like behavior of relay bandwidth.* It would let nodes trade latency off vs relay overhead, and it would allow for a graceful way of handling the highest priority transactions first. -- transactions a dozen or more blocks deep in the mempool are not going to get mined any time soon, so if they have lower relay latency from reconciling them less frequently that is no great harm. I believe it could do so without substantial increases in vulnerability to attack. The same software infrastructure could also be used for bandwidth minimized block transfer for nodes that do have mempools (otherwise blocksonly gives optimal bandwidth gains), though latency minimization is much better accomplished via techniques like Matt's efficient block relay protocol-- since the most important thing to minimize latency is to minimize roundtrips.

Around the same time LTC had meteoric rise from 2 to 8.65. On July 8th this was the top post on /r/bitcoin: URL The next day, LTC hit the high of 8.65 and within a week the price dumped to 3. There is no direct evidence that this attack was orchestrated to pump and dump litecoin, however, it did show a possible vulnerability to attack Bitcoin's user base. This attack is a direct reward response for spamming the blockchain as it can frustrate Bitcoin users to make them move to altcoins. The rising of the value of the altcoins gives fuel to spammers to sustain the attack. If I was coordinating the attack I would do it something like this: * Accumulate a large position in an altcoin over time without trying to move price too much. * Start the spam attack and acquire more of the altcoin pumping the price so that it might garner some attention * Create negative propaganda against bitcoin about transactions, dev's, the technology etc. * Sell enough of the pumped altcoin to sustain the attack if funds were low * Make one final spam push to really frustrate users then dump the altcoin after it bubbles. Unlike July, Bitcoin is much more vulnerable to this type of attack. The user base is much more frustrated, fearful, and anxious as we near the block size limit. The attack is much cheaper sustain also now that blocks are closer to being full. I am not saying this the case with the certain altcoin that has seen very large gains recently, but it could be a possibility. I do fear these types of attacks will get easier as blocks get more full. If I was the attacker I would try to cause a fee event in Bitcoin where tx fees were pushed to bubble like levels. This could possibly be done nudging the lower limit of transaction fee's that are guaranteed to be in a block higher and higher until it snowballs and causes a panic. If this occurred frustration levels would skyrocket, users would be envious of the altcoin's rise, and a large portion of Bitcoin's user base would be captured and dumped on. Unfortunately, I do not see a way to prevent this attack other than making the community aware of it and just remember to stick to your convictions and HODL."
182,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"Critique of Peter Todd's ""RBF will have zero effect on users vulnerability to double-spends""",0,42r4qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/42r4qm/critique_of_peter_todds_rbf_will_have_zero_effect/,2016-01-26 22:41:41,"**Summary** Peter Todd recently [posted a description](URL of tests he ran to see how easy it is to successfully double-spend bitcoins. Because he was able to execute double spends successfully against a large number of popular wallets using a Python script he wrote, Peter claims to have shown that: &gt;With the above in mind, deployment of opt-in RBF will have zero effect on users vulnerability to double-spends. Peter's tests do not establish this, due to his security model not incorporating the probability of double-spends. **The argument** Peter sets up his post with: &gt;A common criticism of Opt-In Replace-by-Fee (RBF) has been that we need to give the ecosystem more time to implement detection of opt-in RBF transactions, arguing that if we dont users will be put at a significantly greater risk of being ripped off by malicious double-spends. For this criticism to be valid, user and merchant wallets must already be able to detect situations where a transaction may be maliciously double-spent, and warn their users appropriately. On the other hand, if they cant do that, then opt-in RBF doesnt change the situation anyway: an attacker doesnt need to use it anyway to rip people off, and when wallet authors fix that they can trivially add opt-in RBF detection anyway with one or two lines of code. This analysis ignores how Bitcoin Cores support of RBF could change the amount of double spending attempts. It matters how likely double spend attempts are before and after RBF, not just whether they both meet some binary threshold of difficulty. **Could Cores support for RBF make double spending easier?** Imagine these two scenarios: Scenario #1: A user who wants to double spend must seek out and download a special version of an open source wallet which incorporates the double spending logic in Peters Python script. The user must transfer some coins to that wallet address, then use it to double spend. Scenario #2: A user who wants to double-spend needs to open the latest version of the wallet that theyve always used, then use a UI which allows them to attempt double spends via RBF transactions. It should be clear that attempting a double spend as described in Scenario #2 is easier than in Scenario #1. How do we know that this wont lead to more double spend attempts? We can all imagine a determined double-spender who would not be deterred by having to go through the process Peter described in his tests. However, its possible that many double spends will come from people just trying out some double spending for kicks, who may then do more of it if they succeed. Users who are curious to try double-spending may also be wary of downloading a wallet from an non-trusted source, whereas they wouldnt worry about using an option in a well-known wallet like Electrum or Mycelium which they already use. **Doesnt this only apply to wallets before they add RBF detection, which is trivial to add?** Yes. It is technically pretty easy to add this check. However, as Peter confirmed in his tests, wallets have traditionally not protected themselves very well or quickly against 0-confirmation double spending. Its unclear how quickly theyll add RBF detection. If there is a delay between when some mainstream wallets integrate RBF support and when some merchants are checking the RBF flag on transactions, these merchants could see their double-spend losses increase.

They can be used to test Bitcoin Core itself, validate our understanding of the Bitcoin protocol and improve security. Software monoculture is dangerous. A vulnerability in Bitcoin Core might affect a large number of nodes and businesses which rely on them. A business can protect itself by cross-checking transactions against implementations not based on Bitcoin Core, as they are highly unlikely to have exactly the same set of vulnerabilities. Implementation based on type-safe languages (Go, Java, Haskell) are particularly interesting because they eliminate a large set of vulnerabilities. Perhaps one day we can make one of these type safe implementation the reference implementation. And formal verification (which is more feasible for languages like Haskell) can be used to make sure that implementation matches the specification... ...But none of this matters to Gavin Andresen.

He only mentioned Classic, Unlimited and XT which are 99.99% same as Bitcoin Core. _Meet the new boss. 99.99% same as the old boss._ OK, perhaps he didn't mention, say, btcd because he's afraid of some subtle consensus difference which can cause network fork, that might be really dangerous... Well, hello, Classic, Unlimited and XT are specifically designed to cause a network fork! Let's stop pretending. Gavin's post is just a thinly veiled hard fork propaganda.

Otherwise he would have mentioned btcd, haskcoin, libbitcoin, which actually introduce diversity (implemented in a different language), new development teams, etc. We ""didnt have the resources to support multiple development teams""?

I disagreed with his earlier post, but I wanted to give him a benefit of doubt, as he successfully led the project for years. Now he resorts to cheap propaganda, this is just despicable.

184,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"Make miners prove that they validated (or at a minimum know the full contents of) the block 4 blocks ago, not 1 block ago",6,44wt83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/44wt83/make_miners_prove_that_they_validated_or_at_a/,2016-02-10 01:09:51,"The topic of how SPV mining is bad has come up several times in the last year. There was a [recent proposal](URL to demand that miners prove that they have received all of the contents of a block before they can start mining. There have been various proposals in the same spirit over the years. I think making miners prove they have the full contents of the block they are trying to build on is a bad idea, because it puts miners at a disadvantage if they cannot rapidly acquire the entire block contents. This task favors centralized players with high bandwidth, low latency connectivity, which is expensive, and the problem gets worse the larger blocks get. Players with poor connectivity will fail to mine profitably because too much of their time will be spent receiving and validating each block. A similar benefit could be achieved without the negative centralization impact if the miners are asked to provide evidence that they validated a block far enough in the past. For example, if miners were required to provide evidence that they validated a block at height H - 4 when mining the block at height H, then you have a situation where there is a 99.9% chance that the block at H - 4 will have been broadcast more than 250 seconds ago. On average, miners would have 30 minutes to receive and validate the H - 4 block. I do not know exactly what kind of evidence the miners should be asked to provide. It would be nice if the evidence had the following properties: 1. Showed that they actually validated the block, not just that they knew it. Alternatively, it could maybe just take a similar amount of time as validation takes, so that there is no temporal cost to validating in parallel. 2. Verifying the evidence would not add much time to the overall block validation step. 3. Verifying the evidence would not be necessary to perform the rest of the block validation. Like with segwit, nodes could skip this verification if they wanted to. 4. Was hard to outsource. For example, perhaps the proof could incorporate the header from block H-1, or some of the intermediate mining steps that would only be accessible to someone who was about to solve the block. The above idea could be implemented with a soft fork, and would create incentives that would practically guarantee that miners would would validate every block as soon as possible. It would not absolutely enforce that behavior, so theoretically miners could construct a chain 3 blocks long on top of an invalid block before they were forced to prove knowledge of the bad block. I think this would be incredibly unlikely if the above idea were implemented because the cost to behave ""properly"" would be negligible, and if you misbehave you risk losing a lot of money. But what if such a chain were produced? First of all, unless the network is deploying a soft fork, fully validating nodes would not accept the bad block and would not notice the bad chain. As I understand it, the fact that SPV nodes do not validate blocks could cause them to follow this bad chain, however this vulnerability could be improved with a simple fix. When validating nodes serve blocks to SPV nodes, they would include a message to indicate that they have personally validated the block. SPV nodes could be configured to consider a block ""provisional"" until several nodes indicate that they have validated the block. *** My first reaction to this issue was that SPV mining did not present a big problem because miners are incentivized to validate as soon as possible, and discard blocks or chains when they discovered they were invalid. I have changed my mind this weekend and suggest making the changes described above. What I realized, is that while SPV mining is pretty harmless during normal operation, it can be disastrous during a soft fork. Consider this scenario: 1. A soft fork is being rolled out, and whatever threshold of miners has been reached. Blocks that do not conform to the soft fork are officially considered invalid. 2. An un-upgraded miner produces a block that is valid according to the old rules, but invalid according to the new rules. 3. Even though they indicated that they were ready for the soft fork, a large fraction of the miners are just SPV mining, not actually validating. They do not notice that this block does not obey the rules of the soft fork and they build on it. Call this chain B for bad. 4. Un-upgraded nodes cannot notice that these blocks are ""bad."" They see these blocks as confirming transactions. 5. Miners who have upgraded, and are validating, reject the longest chain and continue working on the soft fork. Call this chain G for good. 6. Upgraded nodes follow chain G. 7. The network therefore experiences an unplanned hard fork between chain B and chain G. Eventually all miners will switch to one of the two chains, but it cannot be known ahead of time which chain will win. This is pretty much a worst case scenario. From the above, part of the personality of a soft-fork becomes more clear to me. During a soft fork, it is impossible for fully validating nodes, if they are not upgraded, to determine whether or not they are on the correct chain. This puts almost all of the power and responsibility on the miners. If they mine without validating during this delicate phase, no one else is positioned well to correct their mistakes. Un-upgraded nodes are effectively turned into SPV clients -- not just for transactions making use of newly rolled out features, but for the question of which chain is valid. Ideally, miners would: 1. Receive the solved header for H - 1 2. Start mining H with no transactions 3. Receive a compact message that allows them to include at least some transactions while mining H. 4. Receive the main block H - 1 absent the SW and do a complete (provisional) update of the UTXO state. Prioritize transactions and start mining a full block. 5. Receive the segregated witness for H -1 and fully validate the block. 6. Discard the current block and roll back the utxo state if you have discovered that H - 1 is invalid. Forcing miners to validate prior to hashing could cause most miners to **stop validating at all** and outsource the validation job to specialists with low latency internet connections, much like how high frequency trading is done on computers that are physically located close together. This is not a good idea. Why is introducing anything that allows miners to ""make progress"" toward solving a block a deadly sin, but this proposal, which allows certain miners (especially the one who solved the last block and already has it and knows that it is valid) to get a head start is a-ok?"

Mike is yesterday's news. Those who've experienced a messy breakup will recognise Mike's role as the spurned lover. Sadly, at some point Mike became a primadonna who threw tantrums when his ~~shitty~~ ideas were snubbed. Mike soon became more trouble than he was worth. After being ostracized by active, sensible developers, Mike made an embarrasing public scene with his XT nonsense. After *that* failed, Mike leapt into the arms of a decrepit banking sugardaddy, all while spouting histrionic venom about his former dalliance. Mike has rendered himself untrustworthy and irrelevant through such bitchy, gold-digging behaviour. Good riddance, I say, and cheap at the price. More concerning than Mike's antics is this sneaky hardfork push by ""Classic."" Mike's populist campaign to drum up support by XT by harping on blocksize opened up a festering wound in Bitcoin's consensus, a vulnerability Classic now seeks to exploit. While the rest of us were enjoying the holidays, these Toomin nobodies, buffered by manufactured social-media hype, were sneaking about China, busily deceiving miners. Classic now presents the support of these duped miners for 2 Mb. blocks as a fait accompli which will soon put them in control of Bitcoin's future. These untested manipulators, who sprang from nowhere with their tweaked code, believe they have what it takes to steer Bitcoin's development? Really? Fuck that and fuck them. How could anyone trust these guys? Are these Chinese miners who've pledged their support *COMPLETE AND UTTER FOOLS?* Don't they realise a contentious hardfork will wreck Bitcoin's value and destroy their business?

All those who've invested time, money and effort into the Bitcoin project may be left with a broken shitcoin run by opportunistic non-entities. And all because a bunch of impatient idiots thought convenient coffee-payments were the world's burning issue and couldn't wait a few more months for their BTC frappucinos. In the midst of all this suicidal stupidity, banking vultures circle with their total-surveillance Bankcoin waiting in the wings and Ethereum spammers crawl all over r/Bitcoin's face like maggots. I'm not sure how a community of supposely rational, self-interested actors allowed things to reach this point. But there's still time to pull back from the brink...

In recent months I have been causing trouble again and as such there are always those who choose not to believe me or to engage in an attack on my character as a solution to not addressing the issue at hand. Let us start with career and that I am the VP of GICSR in Australia. Other than using an email address at GICSR, I am listed on the board as a director. Next, I am a trustee with the Uniting Church Trust Fund and am otherwise involved with the UC. That is me on page two of the funds newsletter where I had been accepted in the appointment. I have shaved, but it is still me in the photo. My role at Charles Sturt University is noted below and I have staff ID 11293457 if you want to actually check that. On certifications. I hold the three platinum certifications GSE, GSE-Malware and GSE-Compliance from GIAC. I will add my SANS/GIAC certs. I have more than any other person globally (not a boast, it is a fact). This is 37 Certs from GIAC alone. Click the link if you do not believe me. The answer is not just to believe this, validate it. All up, with Cisco and others I have over 100 certifications. Now, do you really care if you believe the total? Not really, and does it matter, not really. Some of those will start to disappear as I cannot maintain them and actually have a life anymore. I have 27 recertifications next year that I will do at a cost of over $11,000. I will let some lapse. Degrees and more I am not going to cover all of my degrees any more. I will not discuss more than post graduate and a list of the papers associated with my doctoral work and I will simply cover those related to my profession here. I will not discuss my role as a lay pastor or theology degree other than face to face and only whit those I choose to discuss it with. There is enough to know I am involved with the Uniting Church and I am not here to convert people. If you are an atheist, that is your choice and I will not try to sway you at all. The thing is, atheism is also a belief. It is not and cannot be proven with science and hence is in a way also a religion even if in the negative. I do not wish to debate this (unless it is face to face, I like you and there is wine involved). If you are not happy with my post graduate qualifications, adding undergraduate qualifications right down to the associate degree level will add little. Then, does my having an Associate degree in Science (Organic Chemistry, Fuel sciences) add anything to my role in digital forensics and information security. If you really want to know what these are, there are old posts that searching will eventually uncover. As for the bio and claim that I am a perpetual student with numerous post graduate degrees including an LLM specializing in international commercial law and ecommerce law, a Masters Degree in mathematical statistics from Newcastle as well as working on his 4th IT focused Masters degree (Masters in System Development) from Charles Sturt University where he lectures subjects in a Masters degree in digital forensics. He is writing his second doctorate, a PhD on the quantification of information system risk at CSU. Charles Sturt University The masters degrees from CSU are: MMgmt(IT)  Masters of Management (IT) MNSA  Master of Network and System Admin MInfoSysSec  Master of Master Information Systems Security MSysDev  Master of System Development (nearly complete I am just running out of subjects to do at the University. I even needed to take one where I was the author of the text just to have the credit points). Next year I complete my second doctorate. I also have two other Masters degrees not from CSU (the 4 they note in the link are those listed above), a Masters in Statistics (Newcastle AU) as well as a Masters in Law (Northumbria, UK). I am also doing the SANS Masters degree and have one more thing to complete this. That will give me 2 doctorates, 7 masters degrees and 8 other degrees. It is not too difficult to check that I am enrolled in the MSISE at the SANS Technology Institute (Master of Information Systems Engineering). Other than having presentations on the site (see this link) it would be crazy for me to state this. I have 37 GIAC certifications (which is most of either of the STI masters degrees. If I was to misrepresent my status at SANS/GIAC, the ethics policy means I will lose them all. So, first it is simple to actually check AND I have too much to lose in lying. I do this every couple years. Here is a link to a past time I had to do the same. Northumbria University I completed a Masters in Law in a UK based University. This is: LLM Northumbria  Master of Law (International Commerce Law, Ecommerce Law with commendation). PG Diploma in Law My dissertation was on ""Internet Intermediary Liability"". I received a commendation. If you need to check, I had Student Number: 05024288 Newcastle University MSTAT  Master of Statistics I was student number 3047661 at the University of Newcastle here in Australia. My thesis that I wrote to complete this degree was on The homogeneity of Variances. I analysed and tested many of the common statistical methods used in homogeneity tests in statistics (such as the Levene tests). Why? The links are associated with universities and others, so it is not too difficult to check me out. I am not stopping you. The only thing I do not wish to discuss openly is my role with the Uniting Church. My theological belief is one of the few things that remains personal and more than the stuff the church posts publically about me (which I attempt to minimise) I will not discuss. If you believe that my trying to maintain one personal and private thing in my life means I am lying, believe as you will. It does not impact my chosen career in information security and nor does it detract from this. Contrary to the believe structure some hold, one CAN be a doctor of the church as well as a scientist. Religion and Science do not overlap and nor should one seek to make them do so. We can never prove nor disprove the existence of any religion or other spiritual belief structure. This is why I also preach tolerance. I believe I am correct as far as I can be (and that is about zero as the human mind is too small to comprehend the infinite in any extent and any person who tells you differently is a liar or a fool). I comprehend and believe in my way, others in their own. Is Islam, Catholicism, Judaism etc right? Yes and no. Am I right, yes and know. Basically, we see a small aspect of the infinite and that is all we ever will. We can be right and wrong at the same time and will never be completely right as we cannot hold the concept of an infinite in our heads (and I have studied large number theory). In a way, I hate having to do this each few years. In this, I have scratched the surface of what I have done and that leaves many in disbelief. That stated, I fail in humility for this as well as other reasons. On Sanity I guess that the final aspect of this is on sanity. I have been accused of being insane for doing all I do. To take a quote from one of my doctoral supervisors: Craig, you have a doctorate, why on earth would you want to go through this again. It is insane. I love study. I can do it and I am good at it. I do not need to do formal study, but I like it. I enjoy the structure. I like the process and it means that I do more. I do not watch sport (I do play sport but there is a distinction) and I do not watch TV. Formal study is MY form of relaxation. To those people (usually without degrees) who keep attacking me and saying I cannot have done this, I offer you the chance to validate all of it. Now, the answer is that you can do something. Instead of engaging in an exercise designed to cut down tall poppies and to attack those who have done something, why not do something yourself? I will (and have in the past) helped others. I will do this for nearly anyone (none of us are not perfect and that includes me). There are ways that anyone can study these days. In fact, I am more than happy to help all I can to have people achieve this. Instead of attacking the character of others you see as frightening (and this really is what this is about), how about you spend the time doing a qualification yourself? Really, my email is public. I keep offering, instead of attacking the accomplishments of others, add to your own. I offer this and from time to time, people take me up on it. This is, I offer to help others improve their education. Not for money, not for fame, but as I want to have a better aware and education world. In this, I also benefit as a more educated (practically) world is one that will have fewer (though always some) issues and which could be more tolerant.

I was used to the idea that any address that hadn't been spent from was considered quantum-safe. But this isn't true for any coins that were mined and not moved prior to 2012. What this means is that all of Satoshi's coins are theoretically stealable by anyone who can pull off a successful quantum attack on bitcoin. In fact, we must now consider them the canary in bitcoin's quantum coalmine because they will likely be the first to fall. Anyone who can pull off a successful quantum attack on these early unmoved coins will make over **$500 million dollars**. Today. Everyone will think Satoshi is moving his coins, but in fact it will more likely be a quantum attacker, and that is a shame, unless Satoshi himself wizes up and acts soon. Beyond that, a successful quantum attack may allow someone to masquerade as Satoshi by giving them the private key to these original coins. The day is quickly approaching where even if someone were to sign a message using Satoshi's known coin hoard addresses, we should think twice about whether this person actually is Satoshi or not, since it may not be long before a successful quantum attack will make his early addresses vulnerable to exposure. Now this vulnerability changed in 2012, so current mining to an unspent address is, thankfully, safe. And if you have an address with coins in it that has never been spent from, you are also quantum safe. I just fear we are in for more Satoshi-hoaxing and drama due to these old addresses. And if Satoshi's coins ever move, we should consider it likely that the quantum nut has finally been cracked by someone and we'll need to be more careful about address reuse. There may be one other issue. There may be a lot of 2012 mined coined that has never been spent. Right now we consider much of this coin to be simply lost. But in the near future, quantum cryptographers may be able to recover much of this coin and make perhaps another $500 million or so. A billion dollar prize for the quantum researchers out there. Not a bad plum if you ask me."

Somebody managed to exploit that vulnerability to withdraw a large amount of bitcoin. Low on bitcoin reserves, Paul Vernon created a plan to attempt to recoup the lost funds. They changed their fee system from trade fees to withdrawal fees, thus encouraging users to keep funds on the site and to keep more of the money of those that do decide to withdraw. Holding a significant value as altcoins, Paul Vernon decides to restrict bitcoin, litecoin and ripple withdrawals while maintaining withdrawals of some altcoins. This allowed him to sell his own altcoins at a premium, possibly while arbitraging on other exchanges. Notice, the mods don't restrict chat about what altcoins to use to withdraw, but they do ban users who get upset at the site issues or shout ""Gox"". By blaming account inactivity, AML's or KYC, they are able to maintain their remaining bitcoin reserves to keep operations going and leak out some withdrawals so that there are hopeful reports from users. By releasing vague tweets about equipment issues every few weeks they hope to drag things out long enough that they have hope of again reaching liquidity before their reputation is irreparably damaged. Rumor is that Paul is currently in China where he is working on the Chinese Cryptsy clone 'Bitebi9'.

196,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Is bitcoin susceptible to infiltration by government intelligence agencies who wish to destroy the project?,4,3ya5ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ya5ws/is_bitcoin_susceptible_to_infiltration_by/,2015-12-26 23:49:14,"Personally I believe we are currently under a coordinated attack by government surveillance institutions who want to destroy Bitcoin. These intelligence organisations are certainly Straussian and an undeniable threat to Bitcoin, although the current level of infiltration is unknown. We know that infiltration is a widely used and successful tactic deployed by intelligence organisations. That's not conspiracy theory, its fact, they use it to manage &amp; monitor animal rights activists, leftists, environmental activists, unions, right wing groups, other national governments, alleged terrorist groups,/cells, agitators and political parties they don't like. Often infiltrators are deployed simply because of the ideas of the groups rather than the relative threat. This is all fact, anyone that would deny this is delusional, wilfully or otherwise. We believe that Bitcoin is a threat to nation states and the financial system, therefore you can fucking well believe that intelligence networks also see it as a possible threat, if only because of the rhetoric of Bitcoin proponents. On that basis I think it is naive to believe that there have not been attacks on the community through infiltration. These infiltrators will seek to control and obfuscate the narrative to destroy real debate and coordination. We have to prevent that. Finally, we know that intelligence organisations have always understood encryption. From the time of Turing, breaking encryption to undermine their enemies has been their raison d'etre. So these organisations will have many patriots who are experts in the cross-fields of encryption and software development on their books. Based upon that simple train of thought, it is impossible for us to rationally assume that the core dev community has not been infiltrated by intelligence agencies, although the extent of which is unknown, and so is the impact upon the development path. Infiltrators may be on both sides of a perceived debate, stoking the fires and creating animosity within the community, they may not be on one side particularly or the other. But we cannot assume there is any stratum of the community they do not act in. At the very least, we require multiple implementations in order to combat this attack vector. All of these implementations may be infiltrated, but all least we will have alternatives to migrate to when a manufactured vulnerability is discovered. But as a community, with the knowledge that this coordinated attack is more than likely underway, how do we trust each other. Somewhat counter intuitively, I think we need to trust everyone implicitly, because the way the infiltrators win is by showing discord, disunity, animosity. If we assume good faith, even to sometimes unreasonable levels, and stop calling each other liars of fools, then we can weed out the infiltrators by reducing their negative influence. A person should never be called an infiltrator unless there is undeniable evidence to prove it. Investigative journalists interested in these community &amp; bitcoin should seek to uncover these infiltrators without further stoking the fires. To do this everyone collectively must accept that they may be completely wrong, on all sides of the debate, no matter how technically proficient you are, and to work to discover the weak points in our own argumentation more than the weak points in the argumentation of your opponents'. That is the only way to win against those who wish to destroy bitcoin from the inside. To conclude, please read this: URL If you disagree, please help me to find the flaws in my logic, but don't assume I'm wrong just because it goes against your intuition and prior beliefs. We all need to be more humble, at every level, in order to restore the unity of this community."

The reason for disabling UPnP by default was because a buffer overflow vulnerability was found (URL in the miniupnpc library (which I think has now been fixed), however it has been determined that the miniupnpc codebase likely contains further vulnerabilities, and so to be on the safe side UPnP has been diabled by default to prevent UPnP vulnerabilities being a structural danger to the network.

Why? -Decentralised - This is a key property of the Bitcoin network. Decentralisation means no single entity has control over Bitcoin. It also increases the networks security by eliminating points of vulnerability. The network is a peer-to-peer (p2p) network, much like BitTorrent. -Digital - Imagine Bitcoin as an email application that allows you to send money. Payments can be sent and received on any computing device with an internet connection, instantly, anywhere. Just like you can access your email account on any computer in the world with an internet connection, the Bitcoin network allows you to access your money wherever you are if you wish to. -Highly Divisible - People often ask if one bitcoin is worth so much money, how can I possibly pay for small things? The answer lies in the fact that a bitcoin is highly divisible. Like a dollar can be divided into 100 cents, a single bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 satoshis - that's a hundred millionth of a bitcoin! -Frictionless - As said before, a bitcoin can be sent to anyone, anywhere, at any time, for free. Transaction fees are drastically lowered for both consumers and merchants using bitcoin. This feature, combined with bitcoins divisibility, allows you to pay one tenth of a cent or a million dollars without transaction fees. -Volatile - Bitcoins price volatility has been a major cause for concern amongst people new to the currency. Whilst this is an issue, bitcoins volatility is a product of it being a new, young, and illiquid market. This dangerous volatility will pass as bitcoin becomes more established. In addition to this, there are easy ways for merchants accepting bitcoin to overcome these volatility problems. -Pseudonymous - Media sources report bitcoin as being an anonymouscurrency like cash, this is incorrect. Bitcoin is not anonymous. Since every transaction that ever takes place in the Bitcoin network is recorded in the blockchain, the identity of any person involved in a transaction is only protected by their ability to deny their association with that bitcoin address. Once your identity is linked to a bitcoin address, everything you do through that address can be tracked. -Irrevocable once sent - Like cash, once you pay someone, there is no way to get that money back without the recipients approval. For merchants accepting bitcoin payments, this is useful, since credit card payments can be revoked up to a week after payment."
201,vulnerability,Bitcoin,ELI5 for: double spends / bitcoin being sent twice / conflicting transactions / bitcoin not being confirmed (the malleability attack),90,3nfb2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3nfb2y/eli5_for_double_spends_bitcoin_being_sent_twice/,2015-10-04 16:30:30,"*I have noticed a lot of people asking about the current malleability attack. Wanted to attempt an ELI5 style description for it.* &amp;nbsp; First off, bitcoin is SAFE. This *attack* would be better described as a nuisance. Basically someone is exploiting a vulnerability in the network by sending bitcoin transactions a second time. The second time they send it they are using a slightly different transaction id. The only thing being changed is the transaction id. The attacker cannot change other details, such as who you are sending bitcoin to. This issue is called *transaction malleability*. &amp;nbsp; If you are sending bitcoin from one wallet to another you will notice the transaction appears to have been sent (or received) twice. Only one of these transactions will be confirmed. For most wallets the duplicate (unconfirmed one) should eventually disappear. Each wallet will handle this differently and I am not aware of all the behaviors. If you are sending bitcoin to a service or website and have an issue you will probably need to contact them. Here is a mega simplified example of what can happen with services: * From my address 1abc send 0.5 bitcoin to address 1efg with transaction id 2000. * The service you are sending to then records transaction id 2000 and starts watching it to see when it gets confirmed into a block. * Meanwhile the attacker takes your transaction and broadcasts it again with transaction id 2001. * Both are valid transactions and the first one to make it into a block (get a confirmation) will win making the other one invalid. * If 2001 wins and the service is still watching 2000, even though they received the bitcoin they wont see the confirmation. An analogy would be if you deposited a check into the bank that had check number 1001 but for some reason the bank recorded it as 1002. You kept checking online for check 1001 and never see it, even though the money was taken from whoever wrote the check and put into your account. &amp;nbsp; Further reading: URL"
202,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"ELI5: Why is TxnID set at a time when it is still ""malleable""? Why not set it at a time when it's no longer malleable: eg, at the time when the Txn is included in a block?",2,3nyywf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3nyywf/eli5_why_is_txnid_set_at_a_time_when_it_is_still/,2015-10-09 00:41:52,"As far as I understand, if a full node (or miner?) sees a transaction which is still in the mempool (ie, a transaction which has not yet been included included in a block appended to the blockchain, an unconfirmed transaction), then it is possible for a full node (or a miner?) to change that transaction's ID and re-broadcast the transaction. This has several consequences: (1) There would now be two ""versions"" of the transaction in the mempool (essentially equivalent: they have the same sender and receiver and addresses and amount  they just have different IDs), and - for a time - each of these Txns can get written to a different (but short-lived &amp; competing ie not-yet-definitive) ""version"" of the blockchain. But, of course, as specified by the Bitcoin protocol, only the *longest* of these competing ie not-yet-definitive blockchains ends up becoming ""the"" blockchain, and thus only one of these versions of the transaction ends up getting ""confirmed"", when its block gets buried under more blocks being appended to the blockchain every ten minutes. So for a while, having two versions of the transaction under the same ID, included two different (competing ie not-yet-definitive) versions of the blockchain can *appear* to cause a double-spend  but only for those users who are willing to consider zero-confirmation transactions. (2) ""Malleating"" (changing) the transaction ID in this way (ie, of ""unconfirmed"" transactions in the mempool) is also what is allowing that Russian hacker ""Alister Maclin"" to ""break"" Bitcoin whenever he wants, as he claims - by re-broadcasting (other people's) transactions which are in the mempool (ie, not in the blockchain yet), under a different TxnID. URL Of course, some people have pointed out that this attack hasn't actually ""broken"" Bitcoin - it has ""merely"" knocked 6% of the nodes off the network, by making the mempool take up 1 GB (of RAM?) On the other hand, this particular attacker is apparently only interested in sending out a warning (hoping to get the devs to fix this vulnerability?). Maybe more malicious attackers (eg, who actually want to destroy Bitcoin) might devote more resources to such an attack. So it seems like a more malicious, more resourceful attacker could actually take down the entire Bitcoin network (or most of it) at this time, simply by exploiting ""Txn (ID) malleablility"". Is this true? --- Pardon my ignorance, but one reason I got into Bitcoin is because, being p2p, I thought it had resiliency similar to BitTorrent. As far as I know, it would be impossible for an attacker - even a very malicious attacker with lots of resources - to take down BitTorrent. (Why can we assert this with a fair degree of certainty? Because industry groups such as the MPAA and RIAA - and maybe even government agencies such as the FBI - evidently *hate* BitTorrent, and have evidently been trying everything they can to take it down  but with no success.) --- Anyways, I don't know much about Bitcoin development (although I try to read most posts from devs on reddit - on this sub, and on the other, less-xensored subs :-), but my question is: Eventually, (one of the differently ID-stamped versions of) the transaction gets included in the (definitive ie longest) blockchain, and at that point (when the block in which it's included gets appended to the blockchain), the TxnID is of course no longer ""malleable"". So my question is: If the TxnID is still malleable at any time before the Txn is included in the blockchain, then why does the Txn even get stamped with an (evidently arbitrary) ID before it's written to the blockchain? It seems like this ""TxnID"" - at the time when the Txn is still in the mempool, before being written to the blockchain - is pretty meaningless. So why does the current Bitcoin protocol assign a ""TxnID"" at a time when it's still ""malleable""? Is this due to some unusual requirement of the distributed or p2p nature of this particular database? **Who assigns the ID? When? Why then?** I presume that, in the current situation, the *sender* of the Txn is the party which is currently assigning the Txn ID. But this assignment seems pretty arbitrary and meaningless, if any hacker can grab that Txn from the mempool and change its ID and rebroadcast it. If the ID of the Txn in the mempool doesnt actually serve to identify the transaction (because the transaction is *actually* identified by its sender and receiver and amount), then why does that ID even exist on the transaction while its in the mempool? Couldn't the task (of creating or setting the Txn ID) simply be shifted to some other party in the system (*later* in the process) - eg, the *miner* who includes the (still ID-less) Txn into a block? Thanks for any help understanding this detail! "

Now and then I've had concerns that this may not work or have some vulnerability. I thought what if someone sent the asset to a Bitcoin eater address. Then no one could move it, and everyone could safely share that one license. However, because we're using the private key, no one has access to the private key of the eater address.

Technologically, BTC is and has been stuck in the dark ages of the blockchain. With 6 years and 101 BIPs, you expect some major bug fixes and improvements on the protocol. But the developers haven't even fixed a major DOS vulnerability that even litecoin has fixed! And the block size debacle is ridiculous. The correct solution is to implement GHOST and improve the block generation rate to 3-15 seconds/block without sacrificing security, not to risk the whole system being bogged down by giant blocksizes or to risk &lt;51% attacks! But nope... Major changes to the protocol have never been implemented by the dev team. I got into Bitcoin because it was technologically superior to fiat, and now there are other coins that are technologically superior to Bitcoin. 2. Your community sucks. Drama everywhere. Almost no discussion of core technology! Long time faces getting up and leaving. Censorship of discussion. 3. Most of the infrastructure of Bitcoin is opensource. It can and has been cloned by alt coins. Bitcoin has 1, and only 1 advantage: the number of users, which hasn't been growing very much."

207,vulnerability,Bitcoin,A SIMPLE GUIDE TO SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY TUMBLING (MIXING) BITCOINS,1,3h5t1x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h5t1x/a_simple_guide_to_safely_and_effectively_tumbling/,2015-08-16 12:23:33,"Bitcoin tumbling, also referred to as Bitcoin mixing or Bitcoin laundering, is the process of using a third party service to break the connection between a Bitcoin address sending coins and the address(s) they are sent to. Since the Bitcoin blockchain is a public ledger that records every transaction, mixing coins is critical for anyone who doesnt want the entire world to know exactly where they send and store their BTC, or from where they receive it. Properly mixing coins may seem like a daunting task to those who arent very familiar with Bitcoin, but it is actually a simple process that will only take a few minutes of your time for each deposit. There are good reasons for everyone to mix their coins, but for those who use Darknet Markets in particular, it is a necessity. New tools are being built all the time to increase the ability of the public, as well as private corporations and government agencies, to follow coins through the blockchain and track those who use it. It may seem like a waste of time now, but in the near future it may be simple for anyone- including friends, relatives, employers, and law enforcement, to track every Bitcoin transaction youve ever made and see exactly where it ended up. Breaking the connection between your addresses and the coins destination by mixing them is certainly a precaution that all DNM users should take. In this guide we attempt to provide the simplest possible step-by-step instructions to help users unfamiliar with the process of Bitcoin tumbling do so effectively. This guide assumes the reader already has a basic understand of how to send Bitcoins and how to use .onion sites. To mix your coins using this method, you will need: -Bitcoins, or the ability to buy them. -The Tor Browser -The ability to create new Bitcoin wallets, both via Tor and on the clear net. We recommended using Electrum, but any client that functions over Tor will work. Alternately, you could use Blockchain.info and their Tor hidden service to create all or some of your wallets. NOTE: Always make sure you get the .onion link for this and every hidden service from a safe place (like Darknetmarkets.org), never from Wikipedia, Reddit, or Hidden Wikis! Also make sure that you never use the blockchain.info clearnet url over Tor; doing that opens you up another possible vulnerability (malicious tor exit nodes). A good place to make sure you are using the correct URL is from our Darknet Resources page, or memorize our short link for it: drk.li/BC. The Steps Step #1: Create a wallet on the clearnet. (We will refer to this as wallet #1) Step #2: Buy Bitcoins, and send the amount you want to mix to wallet #1. Step #3: Create a second wallet, this time over the Tor network. (wallet #2) Step #4: Send your bitcoins from wallet #1 directly to wallet #2. The reason for this is to add plausible dependability between your clearnet wallet and in-person purchases. If you are ever investigated by law enforcement or the company from which you are buying coins (this happens with Coinbase.com especially), you can reasonably claim that you sent them to someone else who controls wallet #2 (for whatever made-up reason you have in mind as your excuse for your BTC purchase). After that you have no idea/dont care what that person did with them, nor should anyone expect you to. Step #5: Create a third wallet, also over the Tor network. (wallet #3). Step #6: Select which mixer you will be using, and set up your transaction there using the address(s) from wallet #3. It is best to use multiple addresses, and to set random time delays. ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE CORRECT .ONION LINKS! Scams are rampant everywhere online, and the darknet is no different. You can choose your mixer(s) and get the correct URLs from our list of darknet Bitcoin mixers. We recommend Helix by Grams first, and then Bitcoin Fog, as the two seemingly best in a group of imperfect options. They have both been extremely reliable so far while processing millions of dollars. DO NOT use blockchain.infos shared send or any other coinjoin product as your mixer, as those do not completely hide your trail like the others. Mixers in DarkNet: braveb6iyacflzc2.onion - BraveBunny btcwashzcpqktkwt.onion - Bitcoin Wash m2cylfgzmxwauyqz.onion - BTCmix bitmixegkuerln7q.onion - bitmixer cleancondgqja34b.onion - CleanCoin cleanco.in - CleanCoin foggeddq65qveh2g.onion - BitcoinFog blenderi54mbtyhz.onion - BitcoinBlender grams7eo7mkagczs.onion - Helix Light laundryzlzgnni4n.onion - BitLaundry NOTE: Turn off JavaScript before doing this step if you are using Helix, Bitcoin Fog, Bit Blender, or other mixers that function without it.

Complex solutions are brittle (easy to make mistakes that destroy your keys). - Setting up a secure environment is hard work. - Electronics can break. - Implementations can have security issues that cause the generated keys to be insecure. - People can die. How to securely store Bitcoin in the face of these problems? I'm quite knowledgable in IT security, and couldn't figure out a really good solution, let alone one that would be practical for people who are not comfortable with ""just popping in a live CD and hacking up a python script from memory"". My current approach would be: - Use a Raspberry Pi (offline) for all activity requiring a computer. Boot OS into RAM and remove SD card to ensure that nothing can be stored after I remove power. - Generate a wallet seed by hashing together a few blocks from /dev/random on whatever device I use plus a lot of random input from a keyboard, then converting it to a seed. - Run ssss on it - Store shares in multiple somewhat secure places. - Use Trezor + Mycelium to use the key. - Verify the recovery process. Transfer a small amount of money to it, nuke everything except the secret shares, recover and send the BTC back out. Only then actually use the address. I think this is quite good. It stil has the following problems: - I have to write or audit code for converting a hash to a wallet seed. Dangerous mistakes can be made here. - ssss is kind of a single point of failure. If ssss or the PRNG on the system where it's run has a vulnerability, a single share might be enough to recover. - It's a pain in the arse, and for storing 21 BTC, ~2% of the value are lost to the purchase of the Trezor. - Distributing the shares in a way that it's recoverable in all desirable use cases and not recoverable in all undesirable use cases is another non-trivial problem.

These are all problems which stem from not having a way to price transaction fees; we do not have a fee market. In my mind if we had a functioning fee market each transaction would be included in the next block every time. The fee that is included with each transaction is what should guarantee inclusion in the next block. The transaction fees would change continuously because miners would compete with each other in a real world/free market...I think...somehow... How do we translate the cost of mining into a real world supply/demand situation where fees are pushed lower by miners in competition? Perhaps with a fee market we could remove the block size limit assuming it solved the mass transaction vulnerability. If we had no block size limit we could then assess the true network capacity. Then take the network capacity and relate that to transaction fees. Transaction fees would go up as we approach max capacity, and vice versa. It seems to me that the only way to price a transaction is to relate it to the max capacity of the network...and since the max capacity is currently determined by the max block size, changing this number is controversial. Will we replace the max block size with a fee market? Will a fee market ever exist? Are there other solutions or thoughts on the matter? Is this being looked at?"

[""On dialogue""](URL is one such extension of his works in quantum theory which is clearly written both to the general public but also the future of mankind from his time. It might be time to revisit his thesis in regards to the two main global economic debates going on today: &gt;Dialogue is not discussion, a word that shares its root meaning with percussion and concussion, both of which involve breaking things up. Nor is it debate. These forms of conversation contain an implicit tendency to point toward a goal, to hammer out an agreement, to try to solve a problem or have ones opinion prevail. &gt;This reveals an aspect of Dialogue that Patrick de Mare has called koinonia, a word meaning impersonal fellowship, which was originally used to describe the early form of Athenian democracy in which all the free men of the city gathered to govern themselves. &gt;As this fellowship is experienced it begins to take precedence over the more overt content of the conversation (sic). It is **an important stage in the Dialogue, a moment of increased coherence, where the group is able to move beyond its perceived blocks or limitations and into new territory** &gt;Dialogue resembles a number of other forms of group activity and may at times include aspects of them but in fact it is something new to our culture. We believe that it is an activity that might well prove vital to the future health of our civilization. &gt;Speaking is necessary, of course, for without it there would be little in the Dialogue to explore, But the actual process of exploration takes place during listening  not only to others but to oneself &gt;if a group is able to suspend such feelings and give its attention to them then the overall process that flows from thought, to feeling, to acting-out within the group, can also slow down and reveal its deeper, more subtle meanings along with any of its implicit distortions, leading to what might be described as a new kind of coherent, collective intelligence. &gt;A Dialogue works best with between twenty and forty people seated facing one another in a single circle. &gt;Often the quieter participants will begin to speak up more as they become familiar with the Dialogue experience while the more dominant individuals will find themselves tending to speak less and listen more. &gt;Any controlling authority, no matter how carefully or sensitively applied, will tend to hinder and inhibit the free play of thought and the often delicate and subtle feelings that would otherwise be shared. &gt;**Hierarchy has no place in Dialogue.** &gt;**No content should be excluded.** &gt;its value may also be perceived by members of an organization as a way of increasing and enriching their own corporate creativity. &gt;In this case the process of Dialogue will change considerably. Members of an existing organization will have already developed a number of different sorts of relationship between one another and with their organization as a whole. here may be a pre-existing hierarchy or a felt need to protect ones colleagues, team or department. There may be a fear of expressing thoughts that might be seen as critical of those who are higher in the organization or of norms within the organizational culture. Careers or the social acceptance of individual members might appear to be threatened by participation in a process that emphasizes transparency, openness, honesty, spontaneity, and the sort of deep interest in others that can draw out areas of vulnerability that may long have been kept hidden. &gt;In an existing organization the Dialogue will very probably have to begin with an exploration of all the doubts and fears that participation will certainly raise. Members may have to begin with a fairly specific agenda from which they eventually can be encouraged to diverge. &gt;Most organizations have inherent, predetermined purposes and goals that are seldom questioned. At first this might also seem to be inconsistent with the free and open play of thought that is so intrinsic to the Dialogue process. However, this too can be overcome if the participants are helped from the very beginning to realize that considerations of such subjects can prove essential to the well-being of the organization and can in turn help to increase the participants self-esteem along with the regard in which he or she may be held by others. &gt;The creative potential of Dialogue is great enough to allow a temporary suspension of any of the structures and relationships that go to make up an organization. &gt;Many of the ideas suggested in this proposal are still the subjects of our own continuing exploration. We do not advise that they be taken as fixed but rather that they be inquired into as a part of your own Dialogue. &gt;**The spirit of Dialogue is one of free play, a sort of collective dance of the mind that, nevertheless, has immense power and reveals coherent purpose. Once begun it becomes continuing adventure that can open the way to significant and creative change.**"

Given that bitcoin is a peer to peer network, doesn't that present a risk to bitcoin users as well? What I mean is, if I turn on my wallet, I'll have access to the ip addresses of other bitcoin users, since to syncing up, as a necessity, I'll be connecting to other nodes/wallets. Sure, some of these end points will servers, that will be well maintained and have oversight, but most will be other users. The issue I see, is that if I want to go after BTC users and trying to steal their bitcoins, the search for potential victims is already done for me, and all I need to do, is write something very similar to web crawler that looks at all these ips, and tests them against know vulnerabilities. Currently, given the foot print of BTC, and the relatively low value of it, the number of people that engage in this behavior, where they go after BTC users, it pretty small, but what happens when BTC starts gaining popularity with the general public and increase in value. Where the investment in attacks, is not measured in hundreds, or thousands of dollars, but in millions? What protection is available for users from states with enormousness resources who eventually decided to attack BTC? Is this something we can even protect against? That a look at China, and how it had breached multiple ""secure"" US network, and stolen untold amount of data. IF they can go after a network is that has so many safe guards, and oversight, what protection are there so the average Joe from these types of attacks? Basically here is what I want to understand. What can protect BTC users from a technically powerful state like China, if they decided to fire up their wallet, attack and spread using the very system (peer to peer) that insures that bitcoin is not centralized? As I see it, I fire up my BTCW, I'll get 8 connections from that, I get 8 potential victims, and as I crawl out wards, I'll then have potentially ~64, then 512, then 4024, and so on."

Anyway. I disagree with the sentiment. I want to make a distinction between a *hack* of the code and a *crack* of the maths behind the cryptography. Both are very different. A hack, at it's very worst, would involve being able to either spend another user's coins, or mint a huge amount for yourself. It is not possible for a hack alone to allow a user to derive another user's private key from their public address. As a result, EVEN THE WORST HACK COULD BE FIXED BY A PATCH, AND ROLLING BACK THE BLOCKCHAIN FROM BEFORE THE VULNERABILITY WAS EXPLOITED. This is exactly what happened when 90bn coins were hacked into existence a few years ago. If something similar happened tomorrow, it would obviously be terrible for bitcoin's PR, but nothing it couldn't recover from. A crack of the maths, in theory, would be far worse. If someone has the ability to figure out the private key of any address, then it's game over- there is nothing a patch can do to fix this. However, as long as you have never sent coins from an address, your private key is hidden behind two completely unrelated forms of cryptography- SHA and ECC. The chances of either one of these being 'cracked' by an individual or organisation are so small as to be almost zero- yet the chances of BOTH being cracked by the same individual or organisation are orders of magnitude closer to zero still. Therefore, it is not an even remotely valid concern. TLDR: we can recover from a hack. We can't recover from the maths being cracked, but it's so unlikely that isn't worth worrying about. Thoughts?"

Researchers last month discovered millions of devices and websites were using an outdated encryption key to secure their communications. The weak key resulted from a Clinton administration mandate that software and hardware makers use weak cryptography in products exported outside the United States. Once those restrictions were relaxed in the late 1990s, many technology makers abandoned the weak cryptography. But researchers said this week that the old keys were included in the code that is still being used in a variety of modern devices and websites.

The country, with twice the Internet users of the United States, is expected to produce 50 percent of global I.T. spending in 2015.Mutual Suspicion Mars Tech Trade With ChinaFEB. 27, 2015 The discovery of the old vulnerability comes as officials in the United States and Britain press the technology industry to create so-called back doors for law enforcement agencies into the new and hard-to-crack encryption used by its products. Those back doors, industry officials argue, can just as well be used by hackers to intercept communications and pose an unnecessary risk to customers. When computer scientists say you cant build a crypto back door without weak encryption for everyone, this is exactly what were worried about, said J. Alex Halderman, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. The debate over encryption  touched off by Edward J. Snowdens disclosures of the nations efforts to crack and circumvent such protections  has intensified over the last year as technology companies added stronger security that would lock out government agencies. The National Security Agency and the F.B.I. have urged tech companies to keep a back door open through their security technology for law enforcement agencies. And David Cameron, the British prime minister, has threatened to outlaw encrypted apps like Facebooks WhatsApp messaging service. But many tech companies have repeatedly said they have no intentions of changing what theyre doing, as Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, signaled in a speech last month at Stanford. If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money  we risk our way of life, Mr. Cook told an audience of White House officials, executives and cybersecurity experts. Fortunately, technology gives us the tools to avoid these risks, and its my sincere hope that by using them and by working together, we will. There is no indication that hackers have exploited the newly discovered flaw, and technology companies say they are working to fix the problem. Apple said on Wednesday it would patch the vulnerability through software updates for its mobile operating system, iOS, and its Macintosh operating system, OS X, next week. Google said it had developed a patch to protect Android connections to websites and provided the patch to Android manufacturers. BlackBerry and Amazon, whose products are also affected by the flaw, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Continue reading the main storyContinue reading the main storyContinue reading the main story Researchers are updating a list of vulnerable websites and services on their website, Freakattack.com, and pushing site administrators, device manufacturers and users to upgrade their software. More than a third of the 14 million websites scanned by researchers at the University of Michigan are still vulnerable. Security researchers are calling the vulnerability Freak  short for factoring attack on RSA export keys  because it can be used to crack a 512-bit encryption key in seven hours, using Amazons readily available cloud computer service, at a nominal cost of $100 per website. A 512-bit key was the strongest allowed for export at the time. Today, that is considered inadequate. After researchers from Microsoft and Inria, the French computer science lab, discovered the vulnerability last month, Matthew D. Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University, warned the researchers that it could be more widespread or dangerous than they had thought. Soon after, the researchers discovered that roughly 36 percent of online servers were vulnerable. Mr. Green alerted the affected technology companies. Mr. Green said the vulnerability demonstrated the risk inherent in weakening encryption in order to allow law enforcement agencies access to secured communications. The flaw is the fourth major  and old  security issue to be discovered hidden in a variety of tech products. Critics say that part of the problem is that there are not enough people paid to test and monitor the security of widely used Internet systems. Also, the Internet consists of a lot of moving parts with different people responsible for software, servers, bugs and more  and they often do not communicate. Nobody was kind of looking down to see how all these different issues fit together, Mr. Green said."

The first is if the cryptography is cracked- perhaps some solitary mathematician finds a way to get the private key from the public key, and uses this knowledge to steal everyone's coins. The second is a code fail, allowing someone to spend other people's coins without knowing their private key, for example. However someone mentioned in another thread that even if one of these were to happen, there is no reason why the blockchain couldn't be unwound to the latest block before the hack/crack occurred, and frozen at this point until a fix is made and distributed. Then the network could resume as if nothing happened. In fact I believe this was exactly what happened when someone hacked themselves 90bn coins early on in Bitcoin's life- the blockchain was frozen, the vulnerability fixed, and play resumed.

Money will always attract hackers, however Bitcoin is so attractive for another big reason: it's mostly unregulated, theft is hard to prove and hard to trace. Hacking is the very definition of a gray area. Hackers love gray areas. If it's completely legal, it's not hacking at all. If it's very, very illegal - few will venture in that territory. Most script kiddies prefer staying in shallow watters. Where am I trying to get with this? To a completely unrelated (apparently) point: Bitcoin is very sturdy and hack-proof. Bitcoin itself. However, when they get to your stash, they usually exploit the vulnerability of another legacy sistem. One such system, more often than not, is your email. As a result, I want to make a proposition to you: consider using encrypted email. I'm personally trying to ditch Gmail in favour of URL - you should consider it (or other services like it). "

You shouldn't give him any of your money. Why not? Well, first let's look at what he's claimed: he's going to create the [first 'Blockchain Operating System'](URL What does that mean? That's the thing; he's not really clear on it. The [whitepaper](URL makes a bunch of vague promises like that adding 10% more processors will give you 10% more computing power (because [Amdahl's law](URL doesn't exist), but one of the things he does heavily imply is that hacking Factom Linux would require 'hacking the blockchain': &gt; The intent of this page is to explain the Factom Linux part of the ePlug project, not go into all the details of how Blockchains work. Lets just put it this way: If you can hack a Blockchain, Im sure the NSA will hire you. This is patently false. Heartbleed didn't require someone to break RSA or anything, it was a vulnerability in OpenSSL itself. Same for Shellshock and a good deal of other attacks; the cryptography itself can be entirely worked around. As a silly example, if I was running a process as root that let anybody connect remotely execute any command, my computer would get owned regardless of how many times I say the word 'blockchain'. There have been attacks against routers that relied on the router's web interface not having any XSRF protection, so just visiting an attacker-controlled page would cause your browser to send a request to the router resetting the password, at which point the attacker could connect to it and own you. Security isn't just about running the code you think you're running. &gt; A BOS supports a single global file system visible from all authenticated nodes (ePlugs, mobile clients, pcs, etc). So... the *entire* filesystem is sharded across the network? What about temporary files? Is it going to spam the network every time it needs to write to a log file? What about [procfs](URL Why would you need to put all your local configuration files 'on a blockchain'? See [this thread](URL where he shows that he doesn't understand what a stack is and so has no business being anywhere near operating system design. &gt; The convenience of having a single global name space is obvious No... not really. If I can read other people's files then that's a massive security vulnerability, obviously. If I can't then why are they in my namespace? &gt; Factom provides the ability to use the Blockchain as a verification and validation service to insure that every component of the BOS is tracked, tested, and installed correctly. Factom provides the ability to identify issues, and distribute secure updates. This is the one part that isn't completely dumb. Signing updates is a good idea, and storing signatures someplace where timestamps can't be easily forged (i.e., a blockchain) is good so that if the signing material gets compromised you can still go back to a known good version, as long as you can establish some date where the signing material was still secure. Moving on: in [this pdf](URL he claims that ePlugs will entirely replace ISPs. He fails to establish how ISPs wouldn't be able to use their massive fiber infrastructure to maintain dominant network positions, or how to cross large gaps such as, I don't know, an ocean. There's also [this post on /r/darknetplan](URL which goes into the hardware issues (getting a wifi antenna powerful enough to reach your neighbor isn't easy, and 'smart home' sensors are a massive security issue). The money quote here is this: &gt; Existing IoT devices have proven themselves to be even more hackable, they don't use any blockchain technology whatsoever Yes. Because buffer overflows, XSRF, side-channel attacks, everything can be stopped if you click your heels and say 'I do believe in blockchains, I do, I do!' And finally, there's [this page alleging that he's been involved in several other scams targeting the 'survivalist' market](URL which was [found by /u/mrchaddavis](URL If you click that second link you'll see evidence it's the same person: both the scam page and [Ken's project page](URL mention Line9 LLC and tek9.asp.

230,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Something fishy is going on. I wanna hear your thoughts.,17,2sad5i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sad5i/something_fishy_is_going_on_i_wanna_hear_your/,2015-01-14 02:27:06,"First off, I'd love some quality input here. I've been in Bitcoin for a long time, in the course of this time I've tried to figure out exactly what could kill Bitcoin. Most people would agree with me that you can't kill Bitcoin by attacking it head-on. The hash rate is too high for a 51% attack, shutting down bank accounts that are used as fiat on ramps allows traders to trade in person, the cryptography can't be reversed transaction wiseand realistically speaking, there is no carte blanche way to seize any bitcoin from any user. Moreso, destroying the Internet would set us back but we could switch to radio for bitcoin transactions. Because of all of the above, Bitcoin is very anti-fragile, that is to say that it gets stronger every time it's attacked; both in terms of technical security, and the users that would implement changes immediately if vulnerabilities were found. I've given this lots of thought, and this is a serious post, in my thinking the one question that I keep coming back to is: what could kill Bitcoin? Assuming banks, government, three letter agencies, the ""elite"" really did want to kill Bitcoin, what would the attack vector be? And realistically there's only one answer, the only vulnerability that Bitcoin has is the one that nobody expects; price. We live in a world where banks and those listed above are incentivized to keep Bitcoin ineffective, not worth the hassle, but most importantly - redundant, and the way you do this is hammer the price into the ground. No one is switching to Zimbabwe currency because it's worth nothing, it 1 BTC was worth 0.00001 USD - even with denomination - why convert to use it? Here is what a real attack might look like, an attack that eats bitcoin from the inside out, and you do it by playing the game. I don't want to get too conspiratorial, but it occurs to me that if significant money was put into mining hardware by bad actors like government, banks, and so on, they could effectively mine and dump so hard that it crushes the whole Bitcoin ecosystem. Once the price is below a significant barrier, miners in the community have no choice but to turn off their hardware and let the hash rate and overall security of the network decrease. With deep and seemingly endless pockets, these bad actors can effectively mine forever at a loss and encourage the price to go wherever they want. If they could get it down to 1 dollar or lower, for the sake of argument, this would significantly stall the infrastructure and development of the community. It's a funny poetic justice, that the only way to kill Bitcoin is to play the mining game so effectively that virtually every other miner and user is at your whim. As other miners drop off the market the community becomes more and more centralized, at this same time a bad actors are removing coins from the supply either by destroying them or ""losing their keys"". Moreso, with the majority of the hashing power they could fork to any chains they like, constantly, consistently, making bitcoin users have no assuredness of their balances and transacts. This may sound crazy to some of you, but I think that it's a very real answer to the question ""what could kill bitcoin?"" The notion that secret government agencies are conspiring against Bitcoin is a little silly I admit. But if you frame it in the context of the following it makes sense: I goddamn guarantee that the powers that be have asked them self the question, and I would not be surprised if there were government agencies mining, it seems like a no-brainer even for reconnaissance on their behalf. It also seems like a no-brainer for banks and wealthy corporate conglomerates to encourage adoption of bitcoin for the sole purpose of cashing out and tanking the price, which effectively kills miners and reduces the security of the network. In other words, if the government/tptb is even remotely interested in killing bitcoin, this is the only attack vector I can see. It is also taking place right now in terms of the visible effect, so I'm just suggesting a cause. Tldr: are u a government/bank/elite - wanna kill bitcoin? Kill price, miners will follow, security drops, and system becomes unusable."
231,vulnerability,Bitcoin,"As a hardcore ""believer"", these are some of the reasons why I want Bitcoin price to go lower yet.",52,2sbloo,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2sbloo/as_a_hardcore_believer_these_are_some_of_the/,2015-01-14 07:57:58,"Hi, I don't post a lot but this is one of those times I feel compelled to do so. I'll go directly to the point and share the reasons why I want Bitcoin's price to go lower yet: 1.- Selfishness. Let's be honest, I was an ""early-but-late"" adopter and can only envy those super early adopters that accumulated so much bitcoin. No matter what the trolls say, for hardcore ""believers"" the lower the price gets it represents a new opportunity to get more bitcoin wealth, now that we have realized the technology's potential. It's like a opportunity from the past that comes to the future. 2.- Because I think this is the way it has to be Just think about it: if bitcoin's price had been only going up from the beginning no one in their right mind and without an extreme money urgency would have sold an ever increasing store of value. This would have had at least some undesirable effects: a) there would be a small elite of super wealthy new rich people that did almost nothing to get their wealth (just things like taking a not so big bet on a new technology or even hacking an immature early bitcoin service). This alone, would cause a crisis of credibility in many people's eyes and could further justify governments' actions to stop the growing parallel economy that would in that case represent an even bigger threat to the status quo. b) the world distribution of this newly invented store of value would be almost negligible, concentrating the great majority of the wealth in some already wealthy countries, particularly the US. This would be a very good argument for not-so-rich or plainly poor countries to reject this new financial model for the risk of feeling completely excluded from it. This big price dips are allowing for more distribution of existing coins, not only among people but among countries, which ultimately will help make bitcoin more valuable as a store of value and unit of account for international transactions. 3.- This will (hopefully) bring some fear to future speculators. One of the big problems many people see in bitcoin is it's current volatility, and this volatility is due to mainly one thing: trading speculators. There are some big players in particular manipulating a market full of newbies that are even trading on big leverages. I feel this big price dips should make people understand we're on an extremely volatile and unpredictable territory. This fear will hopefully make future bubbles more ""stable"" and less ""chaotic"" because, proportionally, the number of people willing to make big risky bets will be smaller (again, hopefully). 4.- Bitcoin slowly gets a reputation as a store of value and not a get-rich-quick scheme Many retractors' main argument is that bitcoin is a pyramid, ponzi scheme or GRQ scheme. This is understandable because there are very few examples of items that have appreciated by 100s% in a short period of time (it has been days in the case of the bubbles). If bitcoin price grows more steadily it will slowly gain reputation as a true store of value (like gold, but better) and not like a new type of gambling. 4.- Unless anything fundamental changes in the bitcoin protocol (doomsday vulnerability, unrecoverable bug, etc.), or there is a really global coordinated effort to ban bitcoin and fine/prosecute users and businesses, I really don't see a reason to worry right now even if the price goes lower, because: a) more and more merchants are accepting bitcoin b) more and more people are storing bitcoin c) more and more people are using and buying bitcoin, just not as fast as many would want to sustain high prices with current coin generation (inflation). So for now, I'll try to stop focusing on the amount of dollars I have in btc and instead focus on wealth, denominated in btc. But remember, we're just a little more than a year away from the next reward halving... and that will be another story. Thanks for reading :) "
232,vulnerability,Bitcoin,Potential applications of colored coins: better remittance using atomic transactions,8,2srfor,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2srfor/potential_applications_of_colored_coins_better/,2015-01-18 07:04:53,"I've been advocating colored coins since 2012, and the most common criticism I'm hearing from crypto-savvy people is along these lines: &gt; This isn't an improvement over a centralized solution, as you need to trust the issuer anyway. No need to bloat the blockchain. This is true, if you assume that trust is a binary relationship: you either trust the issuer or you don't. Easy, eh? But the reality is a bit more complex. You might trust that the issuer actually has money in his bank account, but you don't trust him to have an unbreakable trading system. See: BitStamp. People still use it, so apparently, they believe that it's still solvent. But it have demonstrated that its trading system (particularly, the hot wallet part) is not unbreakable. (Yes, their old system was broken, the new one is surely better :) .) So, in practice, it is desirable to use a system which relies on a minimal set of security assumptions and requires as little trust as needed. E.g. a fiat&lt;-&gt;bitcoin exchange needs to take care of fiat side, but it [doesn't need to hold bitcoins](URL and it cannot have a hot wallet vulnerability if it doesn't hold any bitcoins. Moreover, the fiat side also benefits from a transparent, persistent, immutable ledger. But the security benefits of colored coins are not as interesting as protocols which can be built on top of them. Let's consider a Bitcoin-based remittance use case: Alice lives in US, wants to send money to Bob, who is in Kenya. Alice will buy bitcoins with her US dollars, send them to Bob, who will deposit them into one of Kenyan Bitcoin exchanges and will sell them for shillings. This sounds good in theory (Bitcoin transfers are almost free!), but in practice you have a problem: on top of fees taken by exchanges, parties are exposed to Bitcoin volatility. Kenyan exchange does not trust US exchange (if they trusted each other, they could as well use US dollars for settlements), and so it will require several confirmations. And, as we know, Bitcoin price might drop as much as 10% in matter of hours. So why would Alice and Bob risk their money to Bitcoin volatility? Might as well use WU. With colored coin atomic transactions, we can implement a transfer with a deterministic exchange rate without any additional trust requirements. Here's the setup we use: * Alice have already deposited USD into US-exchange and currently holds USD-coins * Claire trusts US-exch and wants to purchase USD-coins using bitcoins * Dave holds KES-coins from Kenyan exchange and wants to buy bitcoins Now let's assume these parties can use some communication medium to find each other and transfer pieces of data (this exchange medium can be either centralized or decentralized, this doesn't affect security aspects of the protocol). Thus they can create and sign a transaction with tree inputs and three outputs: Inputs: * 100 USD-coins from Alice * 0.5 BTC from Claire * 9000 KES-coins from Dave Outputs: * 100 USD-coins to Claire * 0.5 BTC to Dave * 9000 KES-coins to Bob As you can see, quantities of coins of each kind are preserved, and in the end each party receives what he wants. The exchange rate (90 KES for 1 USD in this example) is known before the transaction is signed, and if it doesn't suit Alice and Bob they can either wait or use other service. A basic implementation might be susceptible to double-spend DoS attacks: e.g. if Bitcoin price goes up, Claire has an incentive to double-spend her bitcoins to get them back and sell them at a higher price. To prevent this, funds might be locked via multi-sig in advance. Also exchanges might use multi-sig to make sure that only entities which went through AML/KYC procedures can hold balance in fiat currencies. Thus we can conceptually understand it as two trades: 1) USD&lt;-&gt;bitcoin happening on US-exchange between Alice and Claire; 2) KES&lt;-&gt;bitcoin happening on Kenyan exchange between Bob and Dave which are both tied to a single Bitcoin transaction. If that transaction is confirmed, then both trades are confirmed as well. If it is not confirmed (e.g. double-spend), then none of trades happen. This way we can ensure atomicity across two exchanges which do not trust each other. An interesting question is whether this can be done without colored coins. In principle, yes, exchanges might make the trade conditional on whether a Bitcoin transaction is confirmed (that would be a transaction from Claire to Dave). But then we have a problem with a race condition: what if transaction _does not_ happen? E.g. 1. Alice, Claire, Dave submit their orders 2. Exchanges make conditional trades, blocks everyone's funds 3. For some reason, a transaction from Claire to Dave doesn't get into the blockchain 4. After some time, exchange releases Alice's coins, and they are involved in other trad 5. 3 hours later, Claire-&gt;Dave transaction is published 6. So Claire sent her bitcoins, but got nothing in return To avoid this kind of a problem, we need to make sure that Claire-&gt;Dave transaction cannot happen when Alice's funds are unblocked, and to do that, we can represent Alice's funds as a transaction output... Which is exactly what colored coins are about. Basically, by representing everyone's funds as Bitcoin outputs we can create a solution which isn't prone to any synchronization problems, as Bitcoin rules make sure that outputs can be spent only once.

It runs an Ubuntu container, which downloads Kinsing and then attempts to spread the malware to further containers and hosts. The campaigns end-goal  achieved by first exploiting the open port and then carrying through with a series of evasion tactics  is to deploy a crypto miner on the compromised host, the researchers say.

Attackers are upping their game to mount ever more sophisticated and ambitious attacks, the researchers note. In response, enterprise security teams need to develop a more robust strategy to mitigate these new risks. Among their recommendations, Aqua proposes that teams identify all cloud resources and group them in a logical structure, review their authorization and authentication policies, and adjust basic security policies according to a principle of least privilege. Teams should also investigate logs to locate user actions that register as anomalies, as well as implement cloud security tools to strengthen their strategy.

Our distributed storage platform built with threshold cryptography (bunkr) is able to issue digital signatures without ever recomposing a signing key. Instead, the key remains distributed among a number of shareholding parties and signatures are computed with secure multi party computation. We have a [very beta command line bitcoin wallet](URL as a proof of concept. Our command line prototype currently isn't too different from standard desktop wallets, but the threshold signatures happening under the hood means we could potentially take this in some interesting directions. Some possibilities: 1. Extending the multi-signature possibilities of a bitcoin wallet (arbitrary size t-of-n wallets, plus its privacy preserving to signers since one key is split rather than there being multiple keys). 2. Contracts that control the circumstances under which different parties are authorized to query signatures from a bitcoin wallet (which is distributedly stored). 3. Supporting more cryptocurrencies, elliptic curves, and BIP standards. What is still to be desired in wallet solutions (if anything) for different facets of the bitcoin community? What directions seem potentially valuable for exploring how threshold cryptography and SMPC can support cryptocurrency custody issues? Interest in demo-ing our wallet?"
241,cybersecurity,Bitcoin,Reverse Ransomware: A mechanism for automatic negotiation of the timing of information release,6,c039q2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/c039q2/reverse_ransomware_a_mechanism_for_automatic/,2019-06-13 18:35:31,"Information can be valuable, particularly when it is secret. Often, people are willing to pay to keep information secret, yet the information is in the public interest. I propose a mechanism whereby an individual could monetize their valuable secret at the expense of those who wish it to remain secret for longer while ensuring it is eventually released to the public. A simple script can be developed, configured with a PAYLOAD (secret data), a STARTTIME and an ADDRESS. Using a simple scheduler like cron, it would be set to run every X minutes doing the following steps: - Read blockchain state to determine ADDRESS -&gt; BALANCE - ENDTIME &lt;- calculateEndTime(BALANCE, STARTTIME) - specific curve should be tailored to the target, but the cost to extend should increase exponentially over time to ensure eventual publishing. - Check if the calculated ENDTIME is in the past: if so publish - Publish step should consist of multiple modules, each of which posts the PAYLOAD to a different provider. Ideally, should create modules for various social media platforms, pastebins, blogs, etc. No single point of failures. - This software should be deployed on multiple devices, each publishing to different platforms to reduce chance of failure. By using this system, the information holder can complete the action of releasing information before offering the mechanism for altering the timing of the release. In situations where the information is in the public interest, I believe this significantly changes the moral (and legal?) calculus of the situation. Threatening to reveal information unless you are paid is extortion. However, if after making publishing a certainty, the publisher informs those that may wish it stay secret for a while longer of the address that will delay publishing... it seems a bit different. Would the use of this be ethical? Legal? Potential Applications: - Negotiation of ""Responsible Disclosure Periods"" for cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Researchers often face legal and professional intimidation in attempting to schedule a date for releasing information about a security vulnerability to the public. Set it in this mechanism, let the company know. Wash your hands. - Wikileaks-type whistleblower funding mechanism - Pretty self explanatory. Might want to add a mechanism for the public to accelerate delay-cost increases by paying into an alternate 'speedup' address. - News? Modern news doesn't really have a business model anymore. Could this potentially be the funding model for the journalists/news agencies of the future? Do what you will with this idea, hereby in the public domain. Make our dank cyberpunk future my friends. Use your wealth to spread love and good in the world."

Ms Ang's husband, Craig Wright, is a computer scientist with cybersecurity and blockchain expertise who works as Chief Scientist for nChain Ltd, a blockchain technology company with a corporate vision ""to transform how the world conducts all transactions  using the blockchain's distributed, decentralised ledger that chronologically records transactions in an immutable way"". As a researcher, he publishes prolifically and has developed innovations for which patent protection has been sought. He is the same Craig Wright who has identified himself publicly as being 'Satoshi Nakamoto', the online pseudonym associated with the inventor (or a co-inventor) of Bitcoin. I do not need to consider whether that claim is true, and on the evidence for this application I would not be in any position to do so. ... 14. Ms Ang opened her UFX account with Reliantco in January 2017. I consider the account opening process in more detail below. She opened the account to invest personal funds available to her for investment from the proceeds of the sale of a former home in Australia and the sale of her interest in Demorgan. She used her account to invest in Bitcoin futures through the online UFX platform essentially in two periods. Firstly, she invested between January 2017 and May 2017, before withdrawing the majority of her funds (including accrued gains) to put towards the purchase of a family home. Secondly, she invested between July and August 2017 after the property purchase did not go through and she decided to reinvest. 15. Stated very broadly, the net result of Ms Ang's activity through her UFX account was to turn c.US$200,000 into c.US$700,000 by the date on which Reliantco purported to terminate the account, 10 August 2017. By the end of August 2017, when Ms Ang says she tried to close the account and withdraw her funds (including investment gains), she claims her positions should have returned c.US$1.1m to her. In her primary case as to quantum, she extends the claim to an allegation that Reliantco prevented her from turning that US$1.1m into what would have been (she says) c.US$2.5m by the time she commenced these proceedings and over US$3m today."""

Founders Fund, the venture-capital firm co-founded by Peter Thiel, has amassed hundreds of millions of dollars of the volatile cryptocurrency, people familiar with the matter said. The bet has been spread across several of the firms most recent funds, the people said, including one that began investing in mid-2017 and made bitcoin one of its first investments. Founders and Mr. Thiel, 50 years old, are well-known for early investments in companies like Facebook Inc. that sometimes take years to come to fruition. The bitcoin bet is quickly showing promise. Founders bought around $15 million to $20 million in bitcoin, and it has told investors the firms haul is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars after the digital currencys ripping rise in the past year. It isnt clear if Founders has sold any of its holdings yet. The bet hasnt been previously reported. Bitcoin vaulted last year from a fringe area of Wall Street interest to the most talked-about asset in the financial world. The currency, essentially a digital form of money with no government or central bank behind it, started 2017 trading around $1,000, then shot to near $20,000 as individual and institutional investors alike ramped up speculating on its rise. From its all-time high reached in mid-December, the price chopped almost in half over the rest of the month. Prices as of late Tuesday afternoon were up 10% to $14,783, after ending 2017 at about $14,000, according to research site CoinDesk. Bitcoin spiked after The Wall Street Journal reported Founders investment. Relatively few mainstream investors have bought large sums of bitcoin, scared off by concerns about cybersecurity and liquidity, as well as more mundane fears of investment losses. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. Chief Executive James Dimon famously called the digital currency a fraud, while Bridgewater Associates founder Raymond Dalio said it was a bubble. Even some of those who do own it are cautious about speaking too publicly, lest they draw the attention of hackers. The late-year price plunge has also spooked some. On Dec. 22, the prominent investor Michael Novogratz said he was delaying launching a crypto-focused hedge fund for outside investors, stating we didnt like market conditions for new investors. South Korea announced last week it would crack down on cryptocurrency trading, an ominous sign given that the country at one point accounted for as much as one-fourth of global bitcoin trading activity. Founders began buying in for its investors before the recent volatility, the people familiar with the matter said. The billionaire Mr. Thiel is an outspoken libertarian who co-founded digital payments service PayPal Holdings Inc. and made headlines as a prominent booster of President Donald Trump. He serves on the presidents technology advisory council. Mr. Thiel previously ran a multibillion-dollar hedge fund focused on global macroeconomic trends, and had some success navigating the financial crisis before racking up investment losses by investing in havens and missing out on the subsequent rebound. Bitcoin 101: What It Is, How to Invest The virtual currency bitcoin continues surging to new highs as a frenzy of investors get in on the action. WSJ's Paul Vigna explains what you need to know, and how to invest should you want to join the mania. Photo: Alexander Hotz/The Wall Street Journal. What You Can Buy With Bitcoin: A $10 Pizza for $76 Bitcoin is a virtual currency, but very few people use it to actually pay for things because of transaction fees and its rising value. WSJ's Thomas Di Fonzo takes to the streets of New York to try to spend bitcoin at brick-and-mortar establishments. As a venture capitalist, Mr. Thiel and Founders fund are among the most successful in Silicon Valley. Founders has more than $3 billion under management and has taken stakes in more-than 100 companies, including Facebook, Airbnb Inc., SpaceX and Lyft. More recent investments include the crypto-focused hedge funds Metastable Capital and Polychain Capital, which puts money into blockchain companies. Mr. Thiel made the decision to buy up bitcoin together with Founders other investment partners, a person familiar with the matter said. In an October onstage interview at an investment conference in Saudi Arabia, Mr. Thiel described cryptocurrencies as charismatic. While Im skeptical of most of them, I do think people are a little bit underestimating bitcoin, specifically, because it is like a reserve form of money, Mr. Thiel said. If bitcoin ends up being the cyber equivalent of gold, it has great potential. By buying bitcoin outright, as opposed to backing other companies doing business in the space, Founders would seem to be breaking with its investing tradition, an investor said. But in communications with investors, Founders representatives have sought to cast the investment as a high-risk, high-reward wager similar to its other venture bets, the people familiar with the matter said. The representatives have told firm backers that a cascade of cash into technology companies has stretched their valuations to historic highs, making stakes in startups as dangerous a risk as ever. Bitcoin, on the other hand, could multiply several times over in the coming years. Thanks to its rise, the bitcoin investment is already estimated as the most valuable in the Founders most recent, $1.3 billion venture fund. People close to the firm said that the fund hasnt made many investments yet. Founders has also warned investors that bitcoin does share one potentially perilous similarity with more traditional venture capital investments: The digital currency could be worth nothing, or close to it, in the end. Corrections &amp; Amplifications Bitcoin reached its all-time high in mid-December. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it reached the level in November."

If you're new to bitcoin, please take some time to understand good security practices. I know some of this is in the FAQ for newcomers, but, let's be honest, a lot of people ignore stickies for some reason. Plus I thought I'd add a few more tidbits of advice: - Use strong passwords (URL - Use two factor authentication (2fa) wherever possible (especially email, for the love of god). Try to avoid 2fa over text. Use something like Google Authenticator, instead. And when you do use 2fa with something like Authenticator physically write down a backup key for whatever service you're activating it with and keep that key safe in case you lose your device. Here's some guidance: URL - If you're not a day trader (and most of us shouldn't be), then please don't keep much or any crypto assets on an exchange! Why? Because it's just another way to lose your assets. The exchanges can go down, or get hacked, etc. And see above and use good passwords and 2fa on any service you're committing any crypto assets to! - Store your bitcoins safely and securely. There are a lot of ways to do this. You can, essentially, pay a trusted service to do it for you, like Coinbase. Or bring your bitcoins more fully under your control by using a hardware wallet. Hardware wallets create a boundary between your assets and the internet, and have become really easy to use. If you're holding a substantial sum of bitcoin, especially if you're not trading and are long term, get a hardware wallet. Here are two good ones: URL URL - Don't talk to many people about how many bitcoins you have, just like you don't go around telling people how much in savings and other investments you might have. - Make plans in case you die. Morbid, I know. Buy a safe, write out your hardware wallet recovery phrases (don't use a printer or in any way put recovery phrases on a computer), store a copy in your own safe, and entrust copies to trusted family or friends, your attorney, a bank safe deposit box, etc. Create instructions for redeeming your coins, and write instructions for who they go to if you die. Consult an attorney in your locality, but usually these sorts of things hold up if you have at least two witnesses sign a document like that. Be safe! If anyone has any other good advice post it here. There are now and will likely be a lot of people entering this space, and we should help them prevent and plan against the worst. Also, it occurs to me that there's probably an emerging market for financial advisers who have the technical know how to consult customers on best practices and plans of this kind. Edit: u/tedjonesweb added the comment below and it's important enough I thought it ought to go up here: &gt;Don't forget to make backup of your keys even if you use hardware wallet. &gt;Hardware wallets use flash memory (like SSD disks, USB flash drives) and this type of memory is prone to failure, especially when it's not powered for weeks or more. &gt;Hardware wallets are great for making secure transactions, however it's irresponsible to keep your private keys only on them (without backup). &gt;I have a habit to write multiple copies of my important files when I use floppy disks, USB flash drives and optical disks (CD, DVD). &gt;DVDs are more reliable than CDs, I prefer DVD+R (instead of DVD-R). &gt;Here is my short guide: [Archiving private keys - TLDR version](URL"

They were made similar to the official application of the popular exchange of cryptocurrency Poloniex in an attempt to obtain user credentials and, presumably, steal their money. Apps have been removed from the Google Play store. Scams applications were used like Poloniex, without having an official mobile application and having a mobile optimized website. They used the Poloiex logo and visual identity to forge the official application, and once the credentials were stolen, they simply redirected users to the mobile site of the exchange. The first application was created by a developer called ""Poloniex"", and he managed to lure up to 5000 users to install it. It was available on Google Play about a month before its removal. The other app, named POLONIEX EXCHANGE was published by POLONEX COMPANY and only got as many as 500 installs before being removed. After finding about the existence of these apps, ESET informed Google  which removed them  and Poloniex. Both applications worked the same way. After the launch, they asked users to enter their credentials to log in to Poloniex on a phishing page, and then send users a fake Google invitation, inviting them to log in to their Google account, for a ""two-step security check"" in which they asked permission to view email messages user, settings and basic profile information.

The Community season 6 was filmed sometime in 2013, probably about 6 month prior to the April 2014 release of season 6 episode 6, or in concert with the release and press coverage of the articles. **Full Review:** The episode is actually about cryptocurrency, specifically it plays off of **""proof of work""** vs **""proof of stake""** and a **51% P + Epsilon attack.** A P + Epsilon attack is based on Game theory URL The Save Greendale commitee represents a Proof of Stake system where as the greater Students of Greendale model roughly a Proof of Work system and how it responds in a P + Epsilon Attack. The proof of stake model works, but centralizes authority and leads to abuse of authority (save greendale committee is the proof of stake in this) The broader proof of work model (the students at greendale) fails to protect the system, turning on it, in the P+Epsilon attack orchestrated by the Hackers The episode brilliantly shows the drawbacks of both options, one protects the system and its integrity the other protects the majority at the expense of the minority. **Blockchain Technology:** Blockchain is a decentralized technology that secures data using advanced cryptography and economic incentives to allow millions of non related users to secure and verify that an exchange of value has occurred. Many different ""miners"" (people with computers who host and process information for the blockchain) work together in their own interest to **Proof of Work:** Bitcoin and many other blockchains use ""Proof of Work"" to secure the blockchain against malicious attacks. This makes it very very hard to change or falsify information in a blockchain. The ""Miners"" or people who process information for the blockchain put in time x electricity X money spent on computing equipment and receive currency for their efforts. **Downside: The majority rules in all cases and can oppress the rights of the minority** Shown poignantly when Gupi Gupta thanks the Save Greendale committee for standing up for him, he has been oppressed and banned from preforming because of student pressure at his venues. Due to his politically incorrect, racist jokes. **51% attack** If theoretically you had 51% of the computing power on a blockchain network you could take control of the network and falsify transactions or steal currency: Epistemic Attack: Done from without the network (example 1 party creates a huge ""miner"" on the blockchain and uses it to take over the network. Expensive and economically infeasible. Systemic Attack: Done from within the network, the most likely form being a **P + Epsilon attack** **P + Epsilon attack: Characteristics** **part 1: Credible promise of reward/punishment** (in the episode the hackers release the lunch lady's emails to establish they can actually accomplish the ""punishment"") **part 2: Must be a larger reward/punishment than any reward offered by not attacking the system** (preserving the freedom of speech for Gupi Gupta) **part 3: Has to be a reward/punishment that each participant feels individually so that the decision can be made spontaneously by all members** (see Nash Equilibrium for more here hURL **Part 4: If the attack is successful, the reward/punishment need not be fulfilled on (IE the emails are not released.)** **part 5: has to be delivered to all participants at close enough to the same time to prevent action against it: Email from the hackers to each student.** **proof of stake:** **Proof of stake seeks to overcome the P + Epsilon attack by requiring an ""investment/deposit"" by any miners for them to be able to mine, in the currency that they are mining. Meaning if they attack or do anything to damage the system they are invested in, they suffer personally more than if the system fails then if they defend the system.** In ""proof of stake"" systems, you get authority or influence based on how much you have invested in the system, higher investment means more control, and more to lose if the system is attacked. This is shown by the emotional and moral investment from the save Greendale committee, it mattered more than the reward/punishment offered by the hackers **The Downside to a ""proof of stake"" system** **The centralization of authority makes so that a few participants can act in the best interest of the system as they perceive it and to the detriment of the users of the system.** This is shown by the hackers releasing the emails, the upside was the comedian no one wanted to see was able (compelled by Annie) to preform, preserving freedom of speech within the system The downside was mass privacy violations, leading to a melt down of the system. Garret particularly shows this well as he screams that he is the worst nightmare of the system, as they drag him out of the scene. Another illustration of the centralization and abuse of power, is forcing Gupi Gupta to preform, and forcing ""Fat Neil"" to sit and be terrorized by him. **Other major concepts from Blockchain** **(the title of the episode is basic email security)** **Privacy** **Freedom of speech** **Security of information** **Ineptitude/corruption of the government when it comes to cybersecurity/freedom of personal information** This is illustrated by 3 parties, **1. The Dean** who represents the blindness/ignorance/corruption of the government with regards to privacy and personal information. **2. Elroy Patashnick** Who represents the lack of prowess and effort put into protecting our data by Centralized authority. (leaves the password as changeme) **3. The inept police force** When trying to investigate the hackers, the police are not only totally useless, they hire a hacker to crack the case and eventually do, the dialog between the kids show some of the hacker ethos prevalent in Cryptocurrency/Blockchain.

The licensing enforces certain operational requirements for the exchanges, including high standards for cybersecurity, the segregation of customer accounts and the verification of customer identities. Seventeen applications are still in review, while 12 firms have closed their doors in light of the new regulations. Local cryptocurrency exchange Quoine  one of the 11 firms to receive a license  said in a press release that it will work alongside regulators ""towards the healthy development of the cryptocurrency industry within Japan and on a global scale.""

256,cybersecurity,Bitcoin,Canadian Government Point of View on Cryptocurrency and Securities Law,6,6x8l0f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6x8l0f/canadian_government_point_of_view_on/,2017-09-01 04:10:43,"URL The CSA Notice addresses a number of considerations of relevance to Fintechs, investors and their advisors, including the potential applicability of Canadian securities laws to initial coin offerings (""ICOs"") and initial token offerings (""ITOs""), cryptocurrency exchanges and cryptocurrency investment funds. It follows a press release issued by the Ontario Securities Commission earlier this year confirming that Ontario securities laws may apply to any use of distributed ledger technologies (""DLTs""), such as blockchain, as part of financial products or service offerings The CSA Notice clarifies that regardless of whether the instrument distributed is referred to as a coin/token instead of a share, stock or equity, that instrument may still be a ""security"" under Canadian securities laws. The key takeaways from this clarification are: The existing definitions to establish whether an instrument is a ""security"" also apply to coins/tokens generated from an ICO/ITO. A security includes an ""investment contract"". In determining whether a coin/token is an investment contract, a four-prong test should be applied, being does the coin/token involve: (i) an investment of money (ii) in a common enterprise (iii) with the expectation of profit (iv) to come significantly from the efforts of others. Advertisement of a coin or token as a software product is not relevant in determining whether a coin or token constitutes a ""security"". The ""investment contract"" test looks at the economic realities of the circumstances and provides a very broad and flexible means of capturing new and innovative arrangements  such as ICOs/ITOs  that do not fit within other definitions of a ""security"". Generally, ""securities"" offered to the public in Canada must be offered with a prospectus, which provides details of the venture and the securities being offered and is filed with the relevant securities commissions. However, there are prospectus exemptions that allow an issuer to offer securities on a private placement basis without a prospectus. ""Securities"" that are coins/tokens are no different. An ICO/ITO of a coin/token that constitutes a ""security"" requires either the filing of a prospectus, or the use of an applicable prospectus exemption. For example, coins/tokens that meet the definition of securities could be distributed to accredited investors in reliance upon the accredited investor exemption, or could be distributed to retail investors in reliance upon the offering memorandum exemption, without the need to file a prospectus. Whitepapers are not prospectuses and do not fulfill the disclosure requirements applicable under Canadian securities laws. To date, no business has used a prospectus to complete an ICO/ITO in Canada; however, coins/tokens have been distributed in Canada on a prospectus exempt basis. While no cryptocurrency marketplaces or exchanges have registered with securities regulators in Canada to date, CSA Staff emphasizes the need for cryptocurrency exchanges to determine whether the cryptocurrencies that they offer are ""securities"" and, if so, to register as a marketplace or get an exemption from registration. The CSA Notice also addresses the following with respect to dealer registration or registration exemption and marketplace requirements: Businesses that undertake an ICO/TO for a business purpose may be required to register as a dealer or get an exemption from registration. Factors to consider include whether a security is involved, a broad base of investors is being solicited, whether a considerable amount of capital is being raised from a large number of investors, the use of public forums (i.e., the internet) and participation in public events to market the sale of coins/tokens. Any businesses that meet the business purpose must fulfill know-your-client and suitability requirements and other on-going registrant obligations. Platforms used for trading coins/tokens that are securities may constitute a marketplace and therefore must comply with marketplace requirements or otherwise seek an exemption from such requirements. Any platform used for offering coins/tokens that constitute securities must have policies and procedures, including in respect of cybersecurity matters, in place. The CSA Notice also outlines several factors relevant to the operation of cryptocurrency investment funds. As with other funds, a cryptocurrency investment fund should register in the category applicable to it as an investment fund manager and/or adviser, or dealer. The fund should consider how the valuation method of the cryptocurrencies and securities included in the fund's portfolio will take place, whether this method will be assessed in an independent audit and how the exchange of cryptocurrency will take place. Any exchange used to purchase or sell cryptocurrencies will have to be subject to due diligence by the fund. Moreover, where retail investors invest in the fund, some jurisdictions in Canada will not accept an offering on an exempt basis in reliance upon the offering memorandum prospectus exemption, and instead will require compliance with the prospectus requirement, investment suitability and investment fund regulations. Finally, any custodian that holds the portfolio assets of a cryptocurrency investment fund must have cryptocurrency-related expertise."

258,cybersecurity,Bitcoin,North Korea is trying to amass a bitcoin war chest,0,6zry95,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/6zry95/north_korea_is_trying_to_amass_a_bitcoin_war_chest/,2017-09-13 13:01:01,"Hackers linked to North Korea are ramping up attempts to steal bitcoin in order to bring in money for Kim Jong Un's regime, a top cybersecurity firm says. Bitcoin and other forms of virtual money -- known as cryptocurrencies -- appeal to North Korea as the U.S. pursues international sanctions aimed at further isolating the country, according to a new report from FireEye. ""Sanctions against North Korea are likely to fuel their cybercrime activity,"" said Bryce Boland, Singapore-based chief technology officer with FireEye. ""Attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges can be a great vehicle to obtain what is ultimately hard currency."" It's just the latest example of the illicit ways North Korea allegedly brings in money as it endures wave after wave of increasingly tough international sanctions over its rapidly advancing nuclear weapons program. FireEye says it has identified three attacks against South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges that took place between May and July, all of them linked to North Korean hackers. The spike in activity began soon after the U.S. said it planned to ratchet up sanctions against North Korea. With fresh U.N. sanctions and bitcoin's skyrocketing value, ""the potential windfall from these attacks has risen accordingly,"" Boland said. A single bitcoin is currently worth more than $4,300, up from less then $1,000 at the start of the year. FireEye identified the North Korean group behind the bitcoin attacks as TEMP.Hermit. Other security firms have linked the group to past high-profile cyberattacks, including the hacking of Sony Pictures in 2014. Hackers tied to North Korea are also suspected of carrying out a series of attacks on global banks that came to light last year. They included a cyberheist on Bangladesh's central bank in which tens of millions of dollars were stolen. The North Korean government has repeatedly denied involvement in international cyberattacks. Intelligence agencies and cybersecurity experts have also linked North Korea to WannaCry, the biggest cyberattack the world has ever seen. The WannaCry virus initially demanded victims pay a ransom in bitcoin, yielding more than $140,000. Related: Someone has emptied the ransom accounts from the WannaCry attack Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies areoften held in accounts at online exchanges. But FireEye points out that hackers can swap them into other, more anonymous cryptocurrencies -- or move them elsewhere and eventually withdraw them in traditional currencies like South Korean won or U.S. dollars. North Korean hackers have previously targeted South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges, stealing bitcoin worth $88,000 (at the time) between 2013 and 2015, according to Yonhap News, which cited South Korean cybersecurity firm Hauri.

The downside of this approach is that over time the number of private keys grows and you need to constantly update your backup file to include newly generated keys. That means you can not ""backup once and forget"". User-unfriendly approach. Also, it was as obvious as 2x2 that backup file with private keys *should be encrypted* with a *strong password* and the same in case of printed QR with encoded key. And as we are dealing with potential offline brute-force attack, the strong password is nothing less secure than diceware generated &gt;=6 word pass (this is as well user-unfriendly). ## Printed QR This sheet of paper is vulnerable to fire/water and no less importantly: lost. So the good approach for the printed key is to store it in a fire resistant safe encrypted with a strong password. - Not something average person can do - Does not work for daily wallets ## File with private keys Suitable for daily wallets but should be updated after each transaction. blockchain.info used to provide this option: you could attach Dropbox or receive emails with updated backup file after each transaction. Your keys are safe as long as you remember your password and it is *strong*. In my opinion, this backup technique was the closest to the most secure and user friendly solution for daily wallets; strong password is something average user still can't understand, however. ## Two concepts emerged over time to address the above stated issues: - BIP32 for deterministic key generation - Hardware wallets as cheap and secure replacement for expensive safes So nowadays we do have a way to *backup once and forget* but almost nobody (including me, probably) understands how to do that the right way. Let's look at Trezor security model. I still need to backup my seed to a paper recovery card. Am I the only one who finds this practice insane? And the same goes for *every Bitcoin wallet out there*. Every software wallet app tells me to back my 12 words in a *safe place*, but no one of them specifies what a safe place actually is. And for most users the backup goes as follows: 1. Write down 12 words on a sheet of paper 2. Put this sheet of paper somewhere (in a desk/book ect) Because what else can be more secure than a sheet of paper? **Be your own bank, fuck yeah**. I have been trying to figure out the solution to this dilemma that is suitable for most potential crypto-users who are not tech-savvy and here is the scheme. It relies on smartphones as I can't imagine most people using something different to transact in Bitcoin. Please note that It hardly relies on Apple hardware and ecosystem. I am sorry to all android users out there but here are my thoughts about why this is so important: 1. Android is a cybersecurity nightmare. **A pro-user can tune his android to be secure as well as to choose the good model from the market**. **Average user is the one who never receives security updates, installs shitty software and likely just bought a fancy new device from china that is factory rooted**. Hell. I don't want this thread to be about Android vs Apple, but if you have a solution that does not rely on seed-on-a-paper backup I will listen to it with pleasure. 2. On the other hand we have Apple with their secure-enclaved iPhones and iCloud Keychain. To understand security of iCloud Keychain one needs to go [here](URL TL;DR once iCloud Keychain was initiated and rolled out to the public it is secure as rock (provided that initiation was not compromised: very unlikely cause leakage will cost Apple it's face). To understand the security of iPhone with secure enclave one needs to go [here](URL and [here](URL TL;DR is that such an iPhone with latest iOS has unprecedented level of security that is light years ahead of competitors. That said, nothing is ideal and iPhone has it's weaknesses, but in practice there is no known successful attack on record out there. Think of iPhone [+software wallet that utilizes keychain (not iCloud)] like a **hardware wallet by itself** (with separate hardware and operating system running under the hood) that is manufactured by a huge company (means many audits their products for security) can't say the same for Bitcoin hardware wallet manufacturers. ## How a wallet should help people keep their bitcoins in **secure** AND **accessible** manner (big IMO) ### During the first launch a wallet should: 1. Generate a 12-word mnemonic. I consider it the best practice (and a privilege of a smartphone) to use additional sources of entropy like a feed from sensors (touch screen, accelerometer, gyroscope and with certain permission: camera). No hardware wallet out there relies on additional entropy, and to date, only few software wallets utilize this technic ( [Bither](URL is one of them) 2. Ask a user to enter emoji-pass that consist of 8 emojis from a special emoji-list (). Like a word list for diceware passwords / wallet mnemonic, emoji-list consists of only special emoticons that are easily distinguishable and represent well known meanings, that said: no all shades of emotions, no gender/race related emojis etc. The alfa-version of such a list is available [here](URL These 8 emojis are used as a ""passphrase"" during BIP39 binary seed derivation. After that stage, mnemonic and emoji-pass are stored inside **local** keychain. Some clarification: provided that an attacker knows 12 word mnemonic, he needs to compute: - 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 (312 emojis from an emoji-list in the power of 8) different binary seeds (each takes 2048 rounds of sha512) - 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 addresses (one [ex. external] address from BIP44 notation for each binary seed). Provided that it's guaranteed from a wallet source that the first (or i-th) external address will be shown to user and potentially used for transaction. That could be hardened by using a random i-th external address from some (even small) range - Compare the above set of addresses with all addresses from a blockchain to determine whether correct seed was generated) As far as I know, 89,791,815,400,000,000,904 combinations is considered a safe for password. In our case we have an additional anti brute-force measure (2048 round of sha512 + comparison to addresses from blockchain. I would be glad for some realworld info (math) regarding speed of bruteforce in that particular case, but I dare to say that even if attacker has access to a supercomputer or a powerful botnet, user will have time to transfer bitcoins in another wallet). ### During sometime after user is onboard A wallet should give an advice to enable iCloud Keychain storage for 12 word mnemonic. There should be a foolproof system that will 1. Let the user memorize an emoji-pass by providing a simple trainer that asks to enter pass many times and in different forms through some period of time 2. Examines the user before the mnemonic is finally backed up into iCloud Keychain. Of course, user is advised to set a strong password for his Apple ID and enable 2FA with an explanation that clarifies importance of these steps. Please notice that emoji-pass never leaves the device. Moreover, it can be stored in such a manner that system deletes it after some period of time and/or after reboot. In that way a user will more likely memorize his emoji-pass forever (or notice the problem before some big amount of bitcoins is in game). ### What's good about emoji-pass - The character set is ~30 times bigger than numeric (pins used by many wallet providers as additional security) and ~3 times bigger than all-space set - Being picture representation of some meanings (words) emoji-sequence can be memorized with much better success and ease than word-sequence. Additionally, they are extremely popular around the globe and hiding the 12-word unlocalized mnemonic behind the scenes increases the user-friendliness of the software dramatically. The threat model shifts from: ""backup your fucking mnemonic wherever you want, it's not our problem"" to ""set-up one good password plus 2FA for your Apple ID, memorize these fancy emojis and you are safe to go and switch devices as often as you need"" Even if user does not have a good password and 2FA, **he will receive a notification** that his account is compromised and will have enough time to secure his bitcoins. I am open for criticism, but I do need to know how the community perceive this dilemma of wallet back up. Thank you! (Edit: typo)"

(Minister in charge of the Smart Nation initiative)",14,35pe8s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35pe8s/mp_in_singapore_dr_vivian_balakrishnan_speaking/,2015-05-12 22:46:25,"URL Speech by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, and Minister-In-Charge of the Smart Nation Initiative for SMU's Sim Kee Boon Institute for Financial Economics (SKBI) Annual Conference Dinner on Wednesday, 06 May 2015, 7.00pm at Fairmont Hotel Mr. Lim Chee Onn, the Chairman of the Advisory Board SKBI The family of Mr Sim Kee Boon : Ms Jeanette Sim, Mr Peter Sim The family of Prof Winston Koh, Prof Arnoud De Meyer, our host, Friends, Ladies and Gentlemen 1 Its always a challenge for an ophthalmologist, an eye surgeon, to address an audience like this, who knows far more than me about financial services and financial institutions. 2 Mr Stephen Aguilar-Milan is a futurist with the World Futures Society, and he has a hypothesis that every 50 years or so, there is a major technological wave. My hypothesis is that every time there is major technological wave, you have a period of intense disruption, a period of increased opportunities, a period of great inequality and robber barons, and it takes some time before the middle class adopts the same technologies and creates more wide spread prosperity. My thesis tonight is that we are in the midst of such a wave. 3 So lets start with Stephens hypothesis. If you go back to 1770 in England, the time of mills and canals  the canals that you can still see in London and England  that was the start of cottage industries, of early industrialisation in England. The fact that it happened in England gave it a head-start in the Industrial Revolution. 4 You move forward another 40 or 50 years from there, you get to the early 1800s. The pivotal invention then was the steam engine, and with the steam engine came railways and railroads, and many fortunes were made by the successive rollout of railways in England, Europe and America. 5 Fast forward another 50 years to about 1870  that was the age of steel, electricity and heavy engineering. That was also the age of large ocean-going ships, warfare, refrigeration and trade opened up on an industrial scale. 6 The 4th wave began sometime around 1910. That was really about oil, and oil opened up the possibility of the automobile, and especially in America, the age of the car, interstate highways, and the long American love affair with the car and all that it represents in popular culture. 7 If you stop to think about these waves, and think about some names associated with these waves  if you go back to 1910 and think about oil, what names come to mind? For instance, Rockefeller  that was how huge fortunes were made. If you go further back to the age of steel, the American name that comes to mind is Carnegie, and related to that, Mellon, the bank. And if you go back to the age of the steam engine and railways, there are pantheons of tycoons, technologists and early-adopters who made huge fortunes because suddenly, everything changed, and there was a period of big disruption - old industries were gutted, and new industries were made. The people who got in first made huge fortunes. 8 Now lets move forward to the 5th wave. You can roughly date the 5th wave to the late 1940s, after the Second World War, in particular the invention of the transistor, which replaced the old vacuum tubes. By accident or design, this started off in Silicon Valley. I think it was William Shockley who moved back to Palo Alto from New York, because he had an ageing mother in Palo Alto. At the same time, Stanford University was also trying to find and define an opportunity for commercialising its academic pursuits, and finding daily relevance for the discoveries in the labs and the work that its professors did. The transistor in turn led to an explosion of electronics, and in a later wave, electronics in turn led to computers and much of what we know of modern electronics today. So starting from the transistor in 1947, we move all the way to today. 9 If you believe this theory of 50 years, we are clearly past 50 years. This is where I will take a risk, and posit that there is a 6th wave. The difference in technological waves is that they dont come and go; each wave builds successively on preceding waves, and this 6th wave is actually about connectivity - meaning that the transistor led to the CPU, which led to the computer and now it is about the Internet, the World Wide Web, big data analytics, the Internet of Things, and telecommunications. We are moving beyond hardware to bits and ideas, and we are now living in a world which is far more densely connected than ever before. 10 Today, a lot of the political polemic is about inequality. My favourite theory is that inequality is not the result of a covert right wing conspiracy, but really just another episode of the fact that there is a major tectonic technological wave sweeping through our society, and the people who get it, the few people who understand and are first able to capitalise, will make fortunes as large, in historical terms, as the Rockefellers, the Carnegies and the rest. So its no accident today that the names you hear about, whether its Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Carlos Slim in Mexico, Jack Ma of Alibaba, are all people who are early riders of this emerging wave. The point I want to make, therefore, is that this is only just beginning. It will take some time for these tools and technologies to be democratised, commoditised and to be in the hands of ordinary people, and for the middle class to regain its wage-earning capacity, its productive capacity and its fair share of national wealth. So that is my hypothesis for what is currently happening in society and economics, and in the political arena as well. 11 Now let me cite a few examples. Many of these examples you will be familiar with, but they help make the point. 12 In the mobile banking space, many of you would have heard of Safaricoms M-Pesa. Since Kenyas M-Pesa brought banking-by-phone to Africa, this has grown from a novelty to a bona fide payment network. Even at a few dollars a transaction, mobile payments in sub-Saharan Africa will generate about US$1.5 bn in fees for mobile money providers by 2019, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group. It was also reported that in sub-Saharan Africa, more people will have a mobile money account than Facebook account. Mobile phones are clearly spreading faster than bank branches, and especially in emerging markets like India, Bangladesh, Africa and other parts of Asia. It is no wonder therefore that many banks and telcos (such as Safaricom), and even Technology Giants (such as Google and Apple) are now focused on creating innovative financial services via the mobile channels. 13 If you move into the retail space, youve heard of the names: eBay, Amazon and Alibaba. Alibaba has come to dominate Internet Retailing in China, and frankly anyone who dominates any sector in China is going to be huge. Just to give you some idea of scale, Alibaba has moved beyond its remit of just connecting businesses to each other, which is how it started. It has moved far beyond that. It now allows companies to sell directly to the public, and for the members of the public to transact with each other. Weve heard of Tmall, weve heard of Taobao. Taobao and Tmall processed 1.1 trillion yuan  which I think is about US$170 billion - in transactions in 2012, and in September 2014, Alibaba's market value was measured at US$231 bn. I am sure the numbers have changed since then, but these are numbers with many zeros. 14 In the crowdsourcing space, you have heard of Kickstarter and Indiegogo, and nowadays artists, entrepreneurs, communities, even people in trouble with the government can raise funds from crowdsourcing sites  to raise funds from the 4F Bank. You know what the 4Fs are? Fans, Family, Friends and Fools. We laugh about it. But the point is that it allows everyone to mobilise funds and it goes far beyond this 4Fs, because in this world currently awash with liquidity and low interest rates, people are looking for ideas and services to take a bet on. According to the Crowdfunding Industry Report by Massolution, in 2012, US$2.7 bn was raised online through crowdfunding, and this number can only grow. **15 In the virtual currencies space, Rajendra mentioned Bitcoin, and I think you had a convention or a seminar on it. Frankly, I am not sure about the future of cryptocurrency, although clearly if you think about the way governments are managing paper currency, it doesnt give you great confidence either. But actually what intrigues me more is the technology behind Bitcoin. I am not sure how many of you are familiar with the Blockchain Technology. Blockchain technology is a computational algorithm that enables distributed verification of the integrity of ledger items. Whether that item is a transfer of money, or cryptocurrency, or contracts, or services, it is in fact a generic platform technology which I believe has not yet found the most appropriate use case. But nevertheless, further breakthroughs in this area will open up the world and will disrupt services in a major way.** 16 And for those of you who are involved in banking and finance, you know that some key competitive advantages which banks have had are (i) funds (ii) reputation (iii) some kind of protection by government regulations and (iv) knowing your customers businesses because you were lending them money - in other words you had access to information. But if you were to stop and think about it, what this technological wave has done is that it potentially disintermediates all those competitive advantages which banks and traditional financial institutions have had. You want access to funds, you can go to crowdfunding portals. As for having information on what businesses are doing, it is not just banks, and it is not just the consultants like Accenture, it is the people who have accurate pulse on the flow of bits, data, and transactions who know what is going on. I think David Lee was telling me just now that Alibaba employs hundreds of PhDs to do data mining. Is Alibaba really a retailer or is it actually in the information business? Are telcos really just selling you voice or are they preludes to the mobile banking business? Even Amazon or take any logistics company, are they really just delivering pizzas and electronics or are they really in the fulfilment business? So the point I am making is that if you can find the centre of gravity between money, information, fulfilment, and then the elusive quality called trust, that is where a huge focal point of opportunity is. 17 So I hope I have given you enough food for thought. I just want to appeal for you to do three things. 18 First, please for the sake of Singapore and Singaporean institutions, find new ways to deliver new services to our people and the people beyond Singapore. If our banks, financial institutions and businesses are doing exactly the same thing next year as they were doing last year, we are going to be swamped, because the pace of change is not slowing down. So please find new ways to deliver new services. 19 Second, please focus on this field of data science and data analytics. Whether you are a bank, financial institution, consultancy firm or university, we now live in the age of big data. And I used to joke with my medical colleagues that you almost do not need to do a clinical trial now, when you can measure the universe. Why settle for a sample and then engage in fancy statistical gymnastics to prove your conclusions, when you can measure everything in real time. So pay attention to data analytics and data science. 20 Third, we need more rational, careful, and technologically-based conversations on the issues of cybersecurity, protection of privacy, and especially protection of identity. Because you cannot have a world that is fully able to take advantage of financial innovations, information revolution, even electronic medical records, if a decent level of security, protection from identity theft, and protection from a loss of privacy and confidentiality is not guaranteed. In other words, security is the essential flip side of the coin of utility; and if we can get that done right here, then we have a head start. 21 So my final point is why Smart Nation. The answer is: we do so because we have no choice. Like many things we have done in Singapore for the last 50 years, all the way back to the time when Mr Sim Kee Boon was a pioneer senior civil servant working for Mr Lee Kuan Yew, we had to break new grounds, we had to be adventurous, we had to be innovative because we have no choice. Jobs were going to disappear in the early 1970s as the British forces pulled out of all ports east of the Suez, and thats why we industrialised. Similarly, what I have described now is potentially another occasion when 20 to 30 percent of previously stable, good, middle class, white collar jobs are at risk because you cannot out-compete a robot, a machine, or a computer for routine, white collar work. 22 So we need to do all these things, and we believe we have an edge because we are small, and we have a single layer of government. Half of our cabinet ministers are engineers. Our PM is a mathematician who can still code. If you do not believe me, you can check his Facebook account and so far after five days, people have only found a little boundary error in his algorithm. But it is a very elegant program. 23 So the point is that we get it, we understand technology, we are not afraid of Science and Technology, but we need to have not just the PM coding, we need an entire society that is capable of understanding and exploiting the opportunities that this wave provides for us. So I wish you all the very best and I hope SMU, and especially the Sim Kee Boon Institute, continues to break new ground, not just because it is fun, but because it is essential for our continued prosperity and progress as a nation. Thank you all very much. "
267,cybersecurity,Bitcoin,NY Times: Outdated Encryption Keys Leave Phones Vulnerable to Hackers,0,2y0m1o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2y0m1o/ny_times_outdated_encryption_keys_leave_phones/,2015-03-05 23:51:58,"By NICOLE PERLROTH and BRIAN X. CHENMARCH 4, 2015 SAN FRANCISCO  A government policy that forbade the export of products with strong encryption in the 1990s has years later left users of devices like Android and Apple phones vulnerable to hackers when they visit one-third of all websites, including whitehouse.gov and nsa.gov. Researchers last month discovered millions of devices and websites were using an outdated encryption key to secure their communications. The weak key resulted from a Clinton administration mandate that software and hardware makers use weak cryptography in products exported outside the United States. Once those restrictions were relaxed in the late 1990s, many technology makers abandoned the weak cryptography. But researchers said this week that the old keys were included in the code that is still being used in a variety of modern devices and websites.

The country, with twice the Internet users of the United States, is expected to produce 50 percent of global I.T. spending in 2015.Mutual Suspicion Mars Tech Trade With ChinaFEB. 27, 2015 The discovery of the old vulnerability comes as officials in the United States and Britain press the technology industry to create so-called back doors for law enforcement agencies into the new and hard-to-crack encryption used by its products. Those back doors, industry officials argue, can just as well be used by hackers to intercept communications and pose an unnecessary risk to customers. When computer scientists say you cant build a crypto back door without weak encryption for everyone, this is exactly what were worried about, said J. Alex Halderman, assistant professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Michigan. The debate over encryption  touched off by Edward J. Snowdens disclosures of the nations efforts to crack and circumvent such protections  has intensified over the last year as technology companies added stronger security that would lock out government agencies. The National Security Agency and the F.B.I. have urged tech companies to keep a back door open through their security technology for law enforcement agencies. And David Cameron, the British prime minister, has threatened to outlaw encrypted apps like Facebooks WhatsApp messaging service. But many tech companies have repeatedly said they have no intentions of changing what theyre doing, as Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, signaled in a speech last month at Stanford. If those of us in positions of responsibility fail to do everything in our power to protect the right of privacy, we risk something far more valuable than money  we risk our way of life, Mr. Cook told an audience of White House officials, executives and cybersecurity experts. Fortunately, technology gives us the tools to avoid these risks, and its my sincere hope that by using them and by working together, we will. There is no indication that hackers have exploited the newly discovered flaw, and technology companies say they are working to fix the problem. Apple said on Wednesday it would patch the vulnerability through software updates for its mobile operating system, iOS, and its Macintosh operating system, OS X, next week. Google said it had developed a patch to protect Android connections to websites and provided the patch to Android manufacturers. BlackBerry and Amazon, whose products are also affected by the flaw, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Continue reading the main storyContinue reading the main storyContinue reading the main story Researchers are updating a list of vulnerable websites and services on their website, Freakattack.com, and pushing site administrators, device manufacturers and users to upgrade their software. More than a third of the 14 million websites scanned by researchers at the University of Michigan are still vulnerable. Security researchers are calling the vulnerability Freak  short for factoring attack on RSA export keys  because it can be used to crack a 512-bit encryption key in seven hours, using Amazons readily available cloud computer service, at a nominal cost of $100 per website. A 512-bit key was the strongest allowed for export at the time. Today, that is considered inadequate. After researchers from Microsoft and Inria, the French computer science lab, discovered the vulnerability last month, Matthew D. Green, a cryptography researcher at Johns Hopkins University, warned the researchers that it could be more widespread or dangerous than they had thought. Soon after, the researchers discovered that roughly 36 percent of online servers were vulnerable. Mr. Green alerted the affected technology companies. Mr. Green said the vulnerability demonstrated the risk inherent in weakening encryption in order to allow law enforcement agencies access to secured communications. The flaw is the fourth major  and old  security issue to be discovered hidden in a variety of tech products. Critics say that part of the problem is that there are not enough people paid to test and monitor the security of widely used Internet systems. Also, the Internet consists of a lot of moving parts with different people responsible for software, servers, bugs and more  and they often do not communicate. Nobody was kind of looking down to see how all these different issues fit together, Mr. Green said."
