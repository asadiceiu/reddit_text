0,vulnerability,Warframe,Let's theory craft some Xaku builds!,1,i2nj7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/i2nj7u/lets_theory_craft_some_xaku_builds/,2020-08-03 10:55:27,"Hey Tenno! The upcoming broken-frame Xaku isn't out yet but they'll be here pretty soon and I thought It'd be fun to hear everyone's thoughts on possible builds and which stats may be the most valuable to mod for. Here's what we know so far about their abilities in their current state (Sourced from [Warframe Wiki](URL * **Xata's Whisper** - Xaku imbues their primary, secondary, and melee weapons with potent Void energy, granting themselves a Void damage bonus for a duration. * **Grasp of Lohk** - Xaku tears open a Void breach in front of them, causing grasping tendrils to lash out at nearby enemies. Up to a limited number of enemies struck by the breach are disarmed, with their weapons stolen and transformed into Void energy weapons that hover and follow Xaku. Stolen weapons last for a duration, gaining an enemy level damage multiplier and automatically fire at enemies nearby. If cast on weaponless enemies, Void entity orbs orbit Xaku instead which fires a single Void energy beam at the nearest enemy. * **The Lost** - Xaku can selectively cast one of three abilities originating from the three fallen Warframes, by cycling the selection wheel between the Gaze, Deny, and Accuse sub-abilities. * **Gaze** - Xaku screams at an enemy target, entangling it in Void tendrils for a duration. The victim is held captive in stasis and emits a defense reduction aura that weakens enemy Shields and Armor while within range. * **Deny** - Xaku unleashes a shockwave of pure Void energy toward the aiming reticle that inflicts damage on enemies crossing its path. Enemies that survive are hindered by a crowd control effect. * **Accuse** - Xaku breaches into the Void, opening a short-lived fissure at the targeted location on the aiming reticle. Enemies within its radius are afflicted with Corruption for a duration, causing them to turn on their former allies. * **The Vast Untime** - Devastate the surrounding area as Xaku detonates themselves, fragmenting all of their body parts outward to inflict damage, vulnerability to the VoidTearIcon b Void damage type and slowed movement to all enemies in range for a duration. Xaku exposes their Void skeleton after detonation, granting themselves a 75% damage reduction bonus against incoming enemy attacks, an evasion bonus, and a movement speed bonus. Press the ability key again to recall Xaku's body parts to reform on them, ending the bonuses in the process. We don't have any hard numbers yet but with all this in mind please feel free to share your thoughts!"
1,vulnerability,Warframe,Hydroid Passive Suggestion: Sunken Armory,1,i5y2w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/i5y2w0/hydroid_passive_suggestion_sunken_armory/,2020-08-08 22:10:32,"The issue with Hydroid: *Hydroid's main selling point is safety, but we're in a meta were killspeed is valued a lot more than security. In addition to that Hydoid's vulnerability phases (while out of Undertow) have become much more deadly for him than they used be pre Steel Path. An often neglected issue is how the changes to Arcane Energy indirectly hurt him, by significantly increasing the time required to restock energy.* The suggestion: *Lore: Under the sea vast treasures can be found. Coin and wealth, but also sunken armor and weaponry. It's power accessible by only a few. Hydroid is one of them.* # Sunken Armory Killing an enemy effected by Tentacle Swarm or Undertow grants Hydroid a stack of ""Sunken Armory"" which lasts 20s. Hydroid gains 100 armor and 15% weapon damage per stack. (Max 6. stacks)Sunken armory stacks only decay while Undertow is deactivated. # =&gt; Conclusion: While it does not fix Hydroid's low ability damage (that's a different rework) Sunken Armory grants Hydroid a balance of power between under- and above water combat. It's especially suited for modes like Mobile Defense where he can bunker up for some while, draw power while the game pace is slower - and transfer some of this power to when he has to quickly change locations. It's a very interesting solution that fits the idea of his charge abilities ""invest time to gain power"", but replicates it in a more natural manner. It forces the player to find a balance between stationary and more active play - and while it definitely doesn't work well in faster game modes like Capture, I could see Hydroid become a more interesting pick for Survival / Mobile Defense / etc. when combined with some love for the other parts of his kit. Note that while the passive might seem relatively strong to other passives, it's balanced around him requiring both time and energy to tap into this power."

3,vulnerability,Warframe,The Definitive Excalibur Build,1,i6ob7s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/i6ob7s/the_definitive_excalibur_build/,2020-08-10 04:28:21,"So I have previously uploaded an Excalibur Umbra build. Getting some thoughts and opinions from some other Excal players I have ended up with a distinctive build. Aura: Steel Charge(My Previous Arua was growing power but after realising that the 25% multiplicative bonus was much more inefficient when compared to Steel charge Which gives a major raw bonus to damage.) Exilus: Primed Sure footed or Power drift (either is amazing and both function well. Whilst I was playing through steel path I kept running into know down problems which put me in jeopardizing positions. Pure sure-footed was my solution to this problem as it prevents me From knock down) Arcanes: Rank 5 Blade charger &amp; Rank 5 Arcane Strike (In my previous setup I had arcane fury instead of Blade charger. However, I found this Arcane through arbitrations and Found the Absolute increase that it gave over fury. I tested using both arcane but I started to run into diminishing returns.) Mod setup: Umbral intensify Umbral Vitality Umbral Fiber (Umbral set is a must for this build as it gives a substantial boost to health, power strength and armour.) Chromatic Blade(This augment is like peanut butter with jelly. When Excalibur is concerned this mod is always with him.The 300% bonus status chance to the exalted blade is immense.i use a red emissive btw so I have heat.) Energy Conversion (This Mod is very underrated for Excal.It gives a 50% damage increase to the next ability cast after picking up an energy orb.) Health conversion(This mod replaced the Radial javelin augment in the build.This mod is very good as it give a great increase to survivability by giving 450 bonus armour after picking up health orb and it stacks 3x.) Adaptations(This mod is amazing. An absolute must for all endgame builds.Gives great immunity to enemy status effects.) Hunters Adrenaline(Great for High-intensity situations as it can sustain your energy.) A completely new addition to this build which is featured in one of my other build is Helios Prime. Helios Prime Setup: Synth fiber(This mod plays off of Synth destruiction.It increase sentinel armor by 100% for 12 seconds after a health orb is picked up.) Synth destruction(This mod allows for Health conversation to proc more often.it give a 25% chance for health orbs to be dropped from targets that are killed or damaged by helios.) Enhanced Vitality (More health) Metal Fiber (More armor) Calculated redirection (more shields) Targeting receptor (The exact same as assault mode but it's for helios) Primed Regen (This mod allows for helios to be in play multiple times) Detect vulnerability(Great augments for helios giving additional damage to highlighted targets) Umbral Exalted Blade build: Condition overload(This mod is an amazing multiplicative damage increase.On my blade I run viral heat for armor strip and damage stack.Plus the blade usual I.P.S that a 600% damage increase at max and an average of 240%.) Healing return (This is the pivatle point of survival in this build.It allows for 20+ health regen after every sword swing on an enemy.) Sacrifical steel(Great mod increase raw crit chance) Sacrifical pressure (Ok mod increases raw damage) Spoiled strike(ok mod increases raw damage.) Shocking touch(Used to make viral and adds additional raw damage) Primed fever strike (used to make viral and adds a lot of raw damage.) Beserker(Allows for more aggressive play and allows for more consistent and quicker application of damage.) Das the updated and final build.Thanks for Reading all that bullshit :) have a good day"
4,vulnerability,Warframe,Frame Revamp Discussion: Equinox,1,i7527e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/i7527e/frame_revamp_discussion_equinox/,2020-08-10 23:43:14,"Everyone knows this game's tendency to fall short of what some would call ""ideal balancing"", things are introduced, and unless their issues are game-breakingly extreme (and sometimes even when they are), almost immediately forgotten about. But hey, that leaves a genuine place for player discussion when it comes to features and balancing, as it's hard for anyone to argue that there isn't a fair bit of room for improvement. So I figure I might as well write down an exceedingly long and boring dissertation on the subject for people to skip and write their own ideas about. So go ahead and skip this and write down any ideas you have, as that would be a better use of your time than actually reading this. So, let's talk about Equinox &amp;#x200B; Equifax is a hybrid frame featuring the unique idea of each ability having 2 effects, dependent on which form they are cast in, Equinox's form can be toggled with their 1. Each form is leaned in a particular direction, Offensive for their Day form, and Defensive for their Night form. &amp;#x200B; So, what's the problem with Equinox? Well first, we have to take a look at what roles they can fill, before we can start talking about how well they actually fill them. &amp;#x200B; On paper, Equinox is made to fill the dual role of damage and defense, all through mostly AoE skills, and with the unique twist of being supportive in nature regardless of what is being done. As an example, their main damaging ability, Day Form's ""Maim"", has it's damage effectively increased and nearly dependent on any damage done by your teammates, it is an AoE nuke ability that still comes from a place of support, supplementing damage already done by your allies or even yourself. Knowing this, some enticingly interesting synergies emerge, on paper at least. Their Day Form allows them to shadow their team, supplementing their damage both directly and with their own, while their Night Form allows them to shadow their team with supplemental defenses, CC'ing enemies, reducing enemy damage directly, and restoring their team based on their own feats. Unfortunately all of these things break down in execution, which we'll get to soon. &amp;#x200B; Now, for those who don't know, and to give us a better understanding of Equinox, we go into the specifics of what each ability does. &amp;#x200B; Equinox's passive gives them a bit of health when they pick up an Energy Orb, and a bit of Energy when they pick up a Health Orb. This is mainly thematic, and doesn't serve to really impact any of what Equinox does. &amp;#x200B; Equinox's 1, ""Metamorphosis"", toggles their currently active form and gives a decaying buff based on which form they turn into, increased Armor and Shields if they change into their Night Form, and increased Weapon Damage and Movement Speed if they change into their Day Form. Each subsequent Ability's effects and name are dependent on Equinox's form. Equinox's 2, in Night Form, ""Rest"", puts enemies to Sleep in a small Radius with a long casting range and decent duration, but is removed if enemies fall below a certain health threshold. Equinox's 2, in Day Form, ""Rage"", applies a damage vulnerability to enemies in a small Radius with a long casting range and decent duration, but also increases their movement speed and attack speed. &amp;#x200B; Equinox's 3, in Night Form, ""Pacify"", is a channeled aura that cripples enemies within range, scaling in effect the closer they are to Equinox, reaching half potency if the affected enemy is at max range. Energy drain is dependent on number of enemies affected, and does not halt Energy Recovery. Equinox's 3, in Day Form, ""Provoke"", is a channeled aura that grants nearby allies increased ability strength when they cast an ability. Energy is only drained when an ability is cast within the aura, and does not halt Energy Recover. &amp;#x200B; Equinox's 4, in Night Form, ""Mend"", is a Channeled Aura that restores shields to allies within it when an enemy within it is killed, it also stores a percentage of the damage done to enemies killed within it as health that is restored when the ability is deactivated to all allies within the Aura. Equinox's 4, in Day Form, ""Maim"", is a Channeled Aura that inflicts a Bleed Status Effect on enemies within range, it also stores a percentage of the damage done to enemies killed within it as damage that is dealt to all enemies in range when the ability is deactivated. I probably should've just copied this straight from a wiki or not included it at all, but I amn't one to fix my mistakes, and after all, I already told you to skip over all of this, right? &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Now that that is out of the way, we can discuss how each ability actually performs. &amp;#x200B; Equinox suffers from a bit of staggered clunkiness in their kit, with an ability selection that heavily favors a very limited selection of the myriad of options they seem to have. So what are some minimalistic changes that could be made to help with that? &amp;#x200B; First off, the buff effects from ""Metamorphosis"" are pointless as they are. They encourage and indeed solely reward a playstyle of frequently switching between forms but, that's just not how anyone is going to play this character. The form a player will use will be determined by what they think would benefit their team, not what their timer is at. If a team is frail, and needs additional defenses, a player will stay in Night Form, only swapping to Day Form when it's needed. If a team needs healing or defenses, they need them consistently, and if they're benefiting from it as much as they can, losing them for however long could prove fatal. Removing the duration from these buffs and making them permanent effects of a given form would provide a massive boon to Equinox's functionality, as the defensive form would actually be more defensive than the offensive form, and the offensive form would actually be more offensive than the defensive form. To phrase this better; the timer on these buffs encourage and come from a weird conception of how Equinox's breadth of options would play out in-game. They come from this idea that having a lot of options means the ideal is constantly rotating through those options, regardless of what's going on, and while that can be made true and encouraged on a micro level, the kind of options presented to Equinox are not equivalent in all situations, they are options that respond to certain situations better, situations which take longer than 25 seconds to play out, and as such aren't the kind that will see a lot of the constant interchangeability needed for this kind of gameplay loop. Having certain aspects of Equinox's base stats scale with Ability Strength would also encourage investment in a stat that is otherwise unattractive to sacrifice other stats for. &amp;#x200B; Equinox's 2 is... fine, the radius on it is inconsistent which could use a touch up, but it is otherwise a functional contribution to their kit. &amp;#x200B; Equinox's 3's failure to carry over it's activation state between form changes is a source of a great deal of the clunkiness in their kit, and another reason the constant Form Changing playstyle that is seemingly encouraged superficially is actually discouraged functionally, allowing this ability's ""On/Off"" toggle to be unaffected by changing forms would be distinctly beneficially without actually doing anything to change the balance of the character. &amp;#x200B; Equinox's 4 is the source of a lot of the failing of the character. In that ""Maim"" is much much more beneficial an ability than ""Mend"". This comes from one easily remedied shortcoming, that the final ""Heal Bomb"" of ""Mend"" doesn't give Overshields. This single failure is what results in nearly the entirety of Equinox's kit falling apart, ""Mend"" is just not a good defensive ability. While yes, allies can gain Overshields from the active effect of ""Mend"" the fact that the strongest heal of the ability is incapable of adding anything to an ally's survivability is why most players will almost solely use Equinox's Day Form. ""Maim"" can one shot anything that can be one shot, whereas the effect of ""Mend"" is inherently prevented from ever reaching a level where Energy would be more effectively spent on Mending than Maiming. This allowance would give their kit purpose, as there would finally be a clear answer to ""What can swapping to Night Form contribute over Day Form?"". Now something would need to be done to keep it from becoming stronger in higher tier content, where a single enemy might otherwise be enough to completely charge every player's Overshields. One option would just be to have the effect call upon an enemy's base stats as opposed to their level-scaled health values, then have that value be effected by a multiplier to keep everything in check, then have that multiplier be affected by ability strength and you'd get an ability with a ceiling making it worth using with requirements keeping it from being godly and stats that enable diverse builds. That would end up requiring a change to the Augment Energy Transfer, but it didn't have a huge use before, so eh. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; To summarize in a small changes list: Made the stat increases from ""Metamorphosis"" permanent effects for each form. Made the state of ""Pacify &amp; Provoke"" universal between forms. Altered ""Mend &amp; Maim"" to better encourage the use of ""Mend"". &amp;#x200B; But what do you think? Would any of these ideas actually help Equinox, or do you have something better? What changes do you think could be made to let Equinox live up to their full potential? Do you think Equinox even needs help at all; that their pigeonholing in ability use is more the fault of the playerbase than the game itself?"
5,vulnerability,Warframe,Lets talk about Xaku,1,ihwtp4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/ihwtp4/lets_talk_about_xaku/,2020-08-28 10:14:49,"In xaku's current state their are 6/10 to 5/10 in how useful they are. i'm am here to propose some changes in two parts. numerical buffs and changes. Experimental changes. i will explain my reason behinds these buffs. Numerical buffs ***General buffs*** ***Void damage negatives removed.*** currently void damage is the worst damage type due to it having no positives and only negative multipliers . removing these multipliers would fix a large problem with xaku's kit being very poor Vs armored grineer besides gaze. ***35% increase all ability animation speed*** currently xaku's 2,3, and 4th to a lesser extent have very slow animations. increasing these speed would benefit them greatly. &amp;#x200B; ***Xata's whsiper*** ***increase void damage add to 35% previously 26%*** as it stands xata's whispers damage boost is lack luster and barely makes a difference in DPS. increase this to 35% would help make the damage more noticeable along with the removal of the void damage negatives &amp;#x200B; ***Grasp of lohk*** ***increased base duration to 15 seconds from 12 seconds*** the void weapon duration currently is very short . increase this would overall would increase xaku's dps &amp;#x200B; ***increase damage scaling by 25%*** the damage the weapons deal are average at best. increasing this would make grasp of lohk a more viable ability in late game. &amp;#x200B; ***increase the base range to 10m from 8m*** the range of grasp of lohk is currently very small without modding for range. increasing this would improve the ability's overall effectiveness &amp;#x200B; ***The lost*** ***general*** ***reduce energy cost from 75 to 50*** xaku's currently a high energy consuming frame. reducing this cost shall help their energy economy ***Accuse*** ***Shorten the corrupted animation by 25%*** reducing the start up animation of enemies being corrupted will help their effectiveness &amp;#x200B; ***Vast untime*** ***removal of the energy drain a second*** ***OR*** ***Removal of the duration*** Currently the vast untime is xaku's most expensive ability for a average surivability and a average damage boost for 225 energy at full unmodded duration. either A remove of the the energy drain per second to make their energy economy much more manageable . Or B remove the duration allowing xaku to freely use their dodge chance at an energy cost. both buff have their upsides and downsides. but both successed in making xaku's build much more manageable &amp;#x200B; ***Lower base energy cost to 75 from 100*** lowering this will improve the energy economy of xaku. allowing the use of their other abilities. &amp;#x200B; ***List the speed boost and damage vulnerability*** &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; ***Experimental changes*** these changes aren't as simple as just removing some numbers or buffing some but can be just as impactful on their performance &amp;#x200B; ***Grasp of lohk*** ***casted where your looking up base 15m*** this would allow grasp of lohk be used as more effectively ***Deny*** ***remove the punch through and add on AOE blast on hit*** ***doing this would make this ability a more impactful cc as the blast would cc the in air.*** &amp;#x200B; ***Vast untime*** ***add a second area of effect around you equal to half your range that applies the slow and damage vulnerability*** this would allow xaku to utilize the effects of vast untime more often and having to recast less. ***saving them energy*** &amp;#x200B; Ps in hotfix 29.0.4 vast untime is currently useless and does not of it's effects other than the energy drain"
6,vulnerability,Warframe,TED talk on damage types.,1,ij32h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/ij32h0/ted_talk_on_damage_types/,2020-08-30 10:02:20," **Let's cut to the chase, meta sucks, modding a single way to deal with every enemy in the game sucks as well. What's the point of having weaknesses on different enemies when Heat Viral Slash kills literally everything equally? So I'm here to re balance, remake, and re-purpose every damage type in the game.** **Step one:** ""Divided assault"" We've needed a mod for a long time now that force separates status damage types. Imagine a mod that cut your status damage string in half, you could have toxin and heat on one side, toxin and cold on the other side. This greatly increased build variety and strategy moving forward. **Step two:** A unified philosophy for damage classifications. What I mean by this is that damage should fall under one of 3 categories 1. *RAW*: This damage category is dedicated to effects that do nothing but *more* damage. Slash is a good example of this. 2. *UTILITY*: These kinds of effects do NOT increase damage, but bring useful debuffs or additional tools that combo with other damage types. Viral is a good example of this. 3. *HYBRID*: These types of damage are a combination of the first two, however do not bring nearly as much raw damage or utility as the others by themselves. A good middle ground. Heat is a good example of this. **Step three**: Address the elephant. Let's be real, if your damage doesn't nuke armor it's garbage. Corrosive was meta forever because it was one of the few ways of stripping armor, then viral slash meta popped up because slash ignored armor and viral cut hp in half, and now heat reduces armor while viral increases raw damage to HP. It's a sad state for the game to exist in, and doesn't really have a solution beside massive balance and scaling changes to the different enemy hp and defensive options. However the goal here is build variety, not balance. (However it would be neat if armor scaling was a flat numerical reduction to damage instead of straight DR. Big guns hit hella hard with crits and heavy RAW, small guns need to stack HYBRID and UTILITY to get through.) With our prerequisites and framework out of the way, lets get started with the *fun* stuff. **IMPACT PUNCTURE SLASH** These 3 damage types are on every weapon in the game, and for good reason. These are going to be our RAW base stats, and are functional on every weapon type no matter the application method. AOE, single target, snipers, shotguns etc etc. These need to be the biggest, and hurt the most. After all, when a bullet zips through your brain, what kills you? The poison the bullet was coated with? Or the super heated plasma slug traveling at hypersonic speed liquefying your grey matter? * **SLASH** Oh boy the big one. Currently Slash is a straight up damage amplifier, stacking with crit and other status effects for hundreds or a single massive damage proc that ignore armor. This by itself is extraordinarily good, and dwarfs any other damage type or proc. It's the first to change. SLASH is now a RAW damage type, applying a bleed effect that does *not ignore armor or resistances.* Instead it stacks multiplicatively with itself, every additional slash proc adds to the current one indefinitely. IE a slash proc of 100 damage would tic for 200 the next time a slash proc from the same weapon is applied. 100, 200, 300, 400 etc. Additional procs reset the bleed timer. * **IMPACT** Widely considered the most hated of the IPS damage types, Impact directly disrupts game play by staggering enemies, making them difficult to head shot and generally frustrating to deal with. Another issue is some weapons have guaranteed Impact procs, like the Nagantaka, the single shot projectile weapon that rewards headshots. Yikes. Impact needs a very large overhaul. IMPACT is now a RAW damage type, applying a very small knockback that bumps the enemy backwards, distance on proc scales with weapon damage, the most being a single meter (think Rubico) smallest being negligable. After 10 procs the enemy would have their weapon knocked out of their hands, disarming them. The inherent knockback on all weapons in the game would be removed. A secondary effect could reduce accuracy as being hit by concussion shells would likely cause you to flinch pretty heavily. (This damage type is the most in flux for change, I'm open to any better ideas here.) * **PUNCTURE** Does anyone even know what this damage type even does? I see it happening, know it's there but have never thought ""Wow what a proc"". That's because Puncture is one of the most useless procs in the game that get by on not actively being annoying to use. But even a 75% reduction on a single enemy is laughable when 25 Grineer bombards are coming at you from 3 directions. PUNCTURE is now a RAW damage type, giving each shot a a chance to pierce the target based on proc strength. (Lex prime blows holes through enemies like butter, Phage does not.) This way punch through mods are useful on weapons that don't have a lot of inherent puncture, leading to more build options. Now to the real bastions: Status effects. Lets make each of these appealing to mod for in different situations yes? **BASIC STATUS TYPES.** **HEAT, COLD, ELECTRIC, TOXIN** Each of these effects are decent, and a mainstay of the average build. Everyone need them, everyone wants them. Except well, cold and electric because those procs are useless. I firmly believe tier one status types should all be utility only, if you want their effects, you have to sacrifice damage. * **HEAT** Heat has recently become very popular due to it's inherent armor stripping properties, and another proc that just applies more damage. Seriously it even CC's enemies, what more could you want with a *basic* damage type? Lets tone that back and add power somewhere else. HEAT is now a HYBRID status proc that applies the ""On Fire!"" debuff. Enemies will flail around for a short time, consecutive procs will both increase the damage over time, but at 10 stacks cause the afflicted enemy to radiate heat procs to enemies around them. Fire eventually would cook you alive in your armor, so at 10 stacks heat damage tics will ignore armor and shields. * **COLD** Cold is known for one thing and one thing only, the status that builds into Viral. Well no more, building cold is now a compelling option! COLD is now a UTILITY status proc that applies the ""Freezing"" status effect. Starting at one proc enememies will suffer a slow, gradually increasing in strength until at 10 stacks completely freezes the enemy solid. Enemies frozen solid will then be shatter-able by large enough impact procs, killing them instantly. * **ELECTRIC** Electric has always been the status that was ""pretty decent but not heat"" for a long time now. It's damage is fine, the CC is great, but why take a strictly electric weapon when you could just bring more anything else? ELECTRIC is now a UTILITY status that applies the ""Haywire"" status effect. Chances are, any electronics or technology like visors and life support systems would fry under enough electric strain, and that's exactly what this does! Electric builds up static energy that at 10 procs unleashes a burst of electrical discharge, temporarily disabling robotic systems (like shield ospereys), disabling shields, and jamming visors blinding Grineer for a short time. Infested would simply be stunned by the discharge. * **TOXIN** Toxin is one of the mainstay damage types that go into basically every build. Whether modding for corrosive or viral, the olden days of stealth nuclear gas clouds, or just on it's own toxin is a widely loved status type that is sadly very uninteresting. TOXIN is now a UTILITY status that applies the ""Sickness"" status effect. Sickness decreases enemy movement speed, reload speed, and lowers their hp by a very small percentage per stack capping at 10. **COMBO STATUS TYPES** **BLAST, CORROSIVE, GAS, MAGNETIC, RADIATION, VIRAL.** Here comes the big boys, the only thing anyone cares about. These status types are blatantly the most powerful, and with good reason, however the disparity between the ""good ones"" and the ""bad ones"" is far too vast. Lets change that. New Combo statuses have the luxury of being Hybrid damage, that is to say they bring both additional damage, and utility, but not too much of both. * **BLAST** I'm running out of creative steam here, so these are gonna be short and sweet. Blast sucks. Straight up knocking down enemies is usually a bad thing on weapons that require precision. BLAST is now a HYBRID status that causes each proc to apply an explosion at impact, the blast would be 50% of the original impact damage, blast radius scaling on damage. (Again, big heavy shots have a big ass explosion, little ones have smaller, more rapid explosions.) Additionally enemies affected by blast have an execute threshold of 10% HP and applies ""On fire!"" for a few seconds after. If the first explosion doesn't kill you, the second one certainly will. * **CORROSIVE** Yada yada corrosive best bc it makes armor go bye bye. CORROSIVE is now a UTILITY status effect that applies a small area of damage vulnerability and armor reduction. (Think banshee sonar but less, ""energy"") the amount of vunerablility and size of the hole scale on proc number as well as proc damage. Big acid splash, big hole, More small acid splashes, deeper holes. * **GAS** Gas is quite possibly the most interesting damage type that does almost nothing after damage 2.0, that HAS to change. GAS is now a HYBRID status effect that creates clouds of poisonous gas that ignore all resistances for it's own damage tic, and applies any other status from your weapon to enemies inside the cloud. * **MAGNETIC** Magnetic is the worse damage type in the game by far. It does almost nothing to everything except shields, and enemies with shields typically have wayyyyy more HP than shield. MAGNETIC is now a UTILITY status that applies ""Magnetic"". Enemies affected have their weapons jammed, as well as attract bullets to themselves on the impact point, from allies or tenno it matters not. Magnetic amplifies caught bullets damage by 50%, and causes armor to break, up to 50% at max procs. * **RADIATION** Cool proc effect, enemies do 0 damage. (PENDING FOR IDEAS. HONESTLY RADIATION IS A HARD THING TO FIX.) * **VIRAL** Most useful proc in the game. Straight up amplifying damage to enemies is good on literally everything, and halving HP was way too strong. VIRAL is now a HYBRID status that applies ""Infection"". Each stack of infection does nothing by itself, but has a timer from the first proc that is not refreshed. For each additional proc, scaling on damage at the end of the timer the enemy will gain an ""Execution threshold"" maxing out at 50% of current HP lasting for 2 seconds. **VOID DAMAGE** Remove the discount mag bubble. It now does causes the enemy to take %hp damage on application from all sources. (Jump out, bathe them in void energy, jump back in and obliterate them with anything you please.) Also fixed Xaku, your welcome. Thank you for attending my TED talk, please if you have better ideas for damage types feel absolutely free to comment and I will happily replace them.

7,vulnerability,Warframe,"An enemy Necramech is like a Big Daddy from Bioshock, except completely unfair.",1,ijlomd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/ijlomd/an_enemy_necramech_is_like_a_big_daddy_from/,2020-08-31 08:07:15," 1. It can enable its Storm Shroud with no warning, reflecting damage back and killing you instantly. 2. It can stay invulnerable (or nearly) for 5 minutes at at time. Even if you can use void damage to disable Storm Shroud (works \~25% of the time), your weapons probably don't do squat. 3. Its window of vulnerability varies from 30 seconds down to 2 seconds. 4. Like most bosses, it's immune to stagger and all status effects. 5. Like most bosses, it destroys your companion in the first 3 seconds of the battle. 6. It spews a ton of grenades that do huge AOE damage. 7. Its only weakpoint is a small spot on its back, so you're screwed if you didn't bring a squad or a punch-through weapon. 8. It can cause a huge slow effect field without line of sight or any kind of status proc. 9. It can cast a wide nullification field that disables your abilities, including transference and Void Dash. 10. It can easily regenerate its limbs during its invulnerable phases. 11. It will hunt you down and kill you if you try to take a breather (the game doesn't allow pausing in solo mode). 12. Your AOE damage can splash off a vulnerable mech and hit a Storm Shrouded one, reflecting it back and instantly killing the you anyway. In other words, an enemy necramech is a lot like a Big Daddy except with a dozen unfair mechanics. DE can't claim those mechanics are meant to balance the fight, because the best way to kill one is to cheese the whole encounter by blasting it dead through Volt shields with Peacemaker or an overpowered sniper rifle. If you actually want to fight it... fuck you, I guess."
8,vulnerability,Warframe,So it turns out mirages eclipse and nezhas blazing chakram work together!,1,ijs7l2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/ijs7l2/so_it_turns_out_mirages_eclipse_and_nezhas/,2020-08-31 15:23:09,So I pretty much main nezha. I use his 2 for the damage vulnerability (223% with my build) and now with the addition of helminth Ive added mirages eclipse for an additional 321% damage when standing in the light. The two together are insane. It doesnt appear that the 75% reduction stacks with the 95% from warding halo though. Unless the math is weird on that one.

Trying to build health shred ether daggers. I know slash is basically a DoT for health correct? And viral buffs health dps by 100% stacking to 325%. Does the actual ""damage"" stat of viral matter? Since it is just a vulnerability debuff to enemies or does it contain it's own DoT? Just wondering if I should stack into slash damage or viral. Thanks in advance!"

Octavia was advertised as the bard frame, and while she's got a phenomenal kit, she's more about groovin to a tune and gettin boogy wit it! Hey, it's been a while since I posted one of these. I've spent a considerable about of time on this one, bouncing it around a few people tweaking bits and pieces. The major idea here was bringing a frame concept that did something *new* instead of just being a reskin and rename. With 48 ~~death dealers~~ Warframes to pick from, originality become more and more difficult. With this concept, I hope to bring a refreshing idea (maybe a digital artist to help render some concept designs), and push the idea in the Forums with a smart and aesthetically pleasing presentation. I hope to get some constructive feedback and critiques. The last ""serious"" concept I shared was for Lycan, a wolf frame my son thought up. With DE's dwindling frame ideas, reaching out for community designed frames, and a community who wants to have a foothold in impacting the game, I think our chances of getting well designed concepts at least looked at is much better.

12,vulnerability,Warframe,Event highlights the flaw in sentients vs abilities,1,fx88m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/fx88m1/event_highlights_the_flaw_in_sentients_vs/,2020-04-09 01:16:00,"Warframe has always been awesome to play as you get to grab your fave frame and go to a mission and use some awesome op ability to tackle the objective. Some frames are better suited over others, but it also enough flexibility for diversity of frame use. This event how ever doesn't really. Example: I was really vibing nezha today, played a few missions and then logged into scarlet spear /: the condrix take no extra damage from the charkram vulnerability ...this sucks. Other frames like chroma and Octavia can not only get a damage boost but can share that.. why can't my nezha do the same? If DE wants to continue with sentients I think reconsidering how they interact with frames abilities is super important because it really neuters a lot of frames in terms of use...and that is just wasted assets on a game built around diversity."
13,vulnerability,Warframe,Profit-Taker is still hands down the worst fight in this game.,71,fzx0ca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/fzx0ca/profittaker_is_still_hands_down_the_worst_fight/,2020-04-12 23:45:16,"Everything about this fight is just awful. Most of us did our time in Profit-Taker hell, then cut and run once Exploiter outclassed it both in gameplay and rewards, but since it's far and above one of the most profitable credit sources in a double credit weekend, combined with decent Solaris United standing (by the way THANKS DE for adding 1.2 *million* more standing grind to that shit show for no reason) some of us are returning to the orb fights. Also, there will always be new players progressing through there, and this fight serves as a terrible, off-putting road block in the Fortuna journey. Here is a quick summary of why this fight is a skid mark on the underwear of Warframe. 1. Way too many ground units dealing far too high damage. Playing in pubs you can even watch kitted out Chromas dropping semi-regularly. This design locks out all but 3-4 frames from reasonably participating, and even then requires flawless endgame builds. And that's all BEFORE the fact that they can place beacons to cause more enemies to spawn, including mini-bosses like Jackals and Scyto Raknoids. 2. Crowd control immunity. SO MANY enemies on the Vallis are just arbitrarily immune to crowd control, further limiting many frames from being valuable in any way during the fight. Since the changes to status, and stacking status procs, we were told Liches were the first step in allowing status (and hopefully CC) to affect more existing things. Sentients have been patched to nerf stasis, but *in a way which does not make it 100% ineffective off the bat.* Please, let the goddamn ground troops in the Vallis be the next step towards justice for CC. 3. Archgun deployment and reliance. 1. Compounding with CC immunity, archguns are *meant* to create a burst when deployed, knocking back enemies and giving you a window of safety during the tedious animation. Since most of the enemies in the fight ignore this, you either have to run 100m outside of the fight, be VERY high on health and health regen, or simply die every time you bring out a mandatory weapon. *Shoe-horning in an arcane for armour during this as a band aid is not an acceptable solution, especially after nerfing high armour values.* 2. Also compounding with the overwhelming number of enemies is the fact that you rely on them to be able to progress the fight. Shooting your archgun puts it on cooldown regardless of whether you exhaust your ammo or not, requiring either waiting out the cooldown or hunting through the hundred crewmen to find the *one* who may not have even spawned who is carrying a fluctus. It's a hindrance and adds nothing of value to the fight. Archguns should simply have no cooldown in a fight which mandates multiple uses frequently. Hell, Archguns aren't strong enough to need a cooldown full stop, leave the limit at ammo. 4. The arbitrary ""haha you lose"" timer. Yet another ridiculous limiter of which frames can participate; provided you can outlast the orb and its hoardes of insane damage, the final quarter of the fight is met by a DPS-gate. Chew through the orb's shield, legs, then remainder 1/4 hp in 5 minutes or you fail. Just cos. Yeah, that may be reasonable in full squads. Yeah, that may be reasonable with Chroma, or a disgusting god-tier archgun riven. No, that's not balanced for the other 99% of the cast. There's no reason for this limit to exist except to punish people who slog it out for a long fight only to be told ""not good enough"" without actually losing. Seriously, there is nothing to be lost by removing this feature, those who can run it still ignore the timer, those who struggle still have a hard fight to fight. 5. Display the shield's vulnerability in the HUD, not on the orb. Lore-wise it makes zero sense for a walking death star to have been built with a holographic display to tell the people fighting it what it's currently weak against. What's worse is it's seemingly programmed to move around in ways that hide that information from the player. Even soloing the orb when you're the only thing to target it loves to just turn 180 degrees to force you to run 200 meters to be able to hit it again. It would make far more sense to have SU broadcast the damage vulnerability directly to the tenno's HUD. 6. Fuck magnetic procs. Seriously. Is it just to rub salt in the wounds that the most useless damage type to us is the most annoying against us? Yeah, you can get rid of the permanent energy drain from EVERY attack inflicting magnetic with arcanes since the rank 5 update, but it still distorts your HUD half the time anyway, and in a mode where I'm constantly swapping between 4 weapons and the operator every 3 seconds, it would be nice to just be able to check my weapon at a glance. Get over the hard on for magnetic procs on bosses, or at least limit it to one specific attack. 7. Status and knockdown immunity. If a frame has a goddamn 16 drain mod (or an ability) just to stop being knocked down, it's already bad enough that they stagger every time anyway, *the stupid enormous walls should not be able to pinball them around the Vallis.* They should do damage and pass right through, *maybe* a stagger, not the rubbish they currently do."
14,vulnerability,Warframe,A Few Minor Tweaks to Ash's Kit to Increase QoL Significantly,0,g95sce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/g95sce/a_few_minor_tweaks_to_ashs_kit_to_increase_qol/,2020-04-28 03:59:11,"([link to forums thread](URL Inspired by seeing the sick-looking Ash Deluxe 2 from the latest Devstream, I tried playing Ash again today. While not necessarily being a bad Warframe, or a Warframe that needs a full kit re-do, he does have a few minor annoyances which add up and spoil the experience of playing him by a good amount. Lemme break down the problems I see with his kit and suggestions on how to fix them. --- # Shuriken Infamously, the biggest offender. *Without the Augment*, there is literally no case where you would rather use it than Blade Strom, considering Blade Storm costs *much* less energy, can target *many* more enemies much quicker and deals a *lot* more *scaling* damage. Conclusion? Players need to have a reason to use it instead of Blade Storm, and get more bang for their buck. * **Increase the base amount of Shurikens thrown per cast.** Three (up from two), I believe, is a good number, especially considering the next point... * **Let Power Strength affect the number of Shurikens thrown.** I don't really understand why it isn't this way currently, and it's going to be a great buff to the ability, especially if using the Augment (*please see note below*). * **Make enemies able to be struck by multiple Shurikens.** This ensures no Shuriken is wasted, and will concentrate damage on one enemy if no other enemies are present. Additionally, this will play into a synergy with Blade Storm I will get to in a bit. These two changes will fix the ""bang for your buck"" aspect of Shuriken, but there's still no point in using it instead of Blade Storm. So, let's add one: * **Enemies affected by Shuriken receive 25% more damage from all sources, affected by Power Strength.** The number isn't anything crazy like the damage increase from Nezha's Blazing Chakram or Equinox's Rage (100% / 50% damage increase respectively), but still enough to incentivize players to use it in cases where a Blade Storm cast is not enough, or Blade Storm needs just that little bit more damage to kill the target. While we're at it, why not give you a reason to use it *with* Blade Storm? * **Enemies struck by Shurikens during Blade Storm's aiming phase receive one mark instantly, regardless whether they are within the focus ring or not.** Or multiple marks, if struck by multiple Shurikens, which is possible thanks to the above tweak. Please scroll down to my proposed Blade Storm changes to read more on this synergy, as it will make more sense. *Note:* with all of these changes combined, I can foresee a possible nerf to Seeking Shuriken. Luckily, with the recent overall enemy armor scaling changes, I don't believe it will be that bad, especially considering Ash has ways to deal with armored enemies besides Seeking Shuriken. Also, let me remind you that Banshee's Sonic Boom Augment exists and is essentially a much better version of Seeking Shuriken, and will probably remain that way after these changes. --- # Smoke Screen Not much wrong with this ability, IMO, especially since they added that one second grace period after invisibility effects end where enemies still cannot target you. *But*, if I absolutely *had* to list a few changes, they would be aimed at making Smoke Screen a more effective CC ability and encourage players to actually use the CC aspect: * **Make Smoke Screen recastable.** Will also help with the low base duration. * **Make enemy stagger also open them up to finishers.** Essentially, this change makes Smoke Screen a kind of reverse Teleport (which I'll get to in a moment): Teleport makes one enemy far away vulnerable, while Smoke Screen makes multiple enemies in a very small radius vulnerable. I think adding more options for Ash to make enemies vulnerable to finishers is thematically fitting. That's what assassins do, right? Expose the target's vulnerability and go in for a swift kill. --- # Teleport Just one change, and I think it's been suggested by the community many times before, especially since it works this way in Conclave already: * **Cut the range significantly, but make it freely targetable.** Obviously, teleporting anywhere you aim within *60 meters* (moddable) is not particularly well-balanced. Currently, the range is *20 meters* in Conclave. I think it will need to be slightly fewer in PvE Warframe due to availability of Power Range-affecting mods - *15 meters* should be a good baseline. This will really open up mobility options for Ash. * **Add a minor ""aim magnet"" for currently viable targets.** This way you can still target enemies and objects reliably and conserve the usability of Teleport's Augment. --- # Blade Storm I think the community is well aware that Blade Storm is extremely powerful. The community is also well aware that Blade Storm is extremely clunky. Current gameplay for Blade Storm is press 4, swipe your mouse around like a maniac and hope your crosshairs catches enemies around you, being effectively unable to do anything else and disorienting yourself in the process, and then press 4 again. Not a very enjoyable experience, though, admittedly, a rewarding one. So, the only change needed for Blade Storm is of mechanical nature: * **A rework of Blade Storm targeting mechanics:** 1. Activating the ability overlays a **focus ring** on the HUD around the crosshairs - think Mesa's Peacemaker initially and Garuda's Seeking Talons when maximally charged. The ring shrinks in size *considerably* when aiming - think Peacemaker at maximum fire rate and Seeking Talons at minimum charge. 2. Enemies that are kept within the focus ring for an amount of time - depending on whether you're aiming or not - will receive **one** Blade Storm mark, up to a cap of **three**, like currently. Enemies accrue marks individually, meaning *multiple* enemies can be marked *simultaneously*, given they are within the focus ring. The enemies *do not* lose the marks if they leave the focus ring. * **If *not* aiming:** the ring is at maximum size. Enemies get marked at a rate of *once per 0.83 seconds*, meaning an enemy needs to be within the focus ring for *2.5 seconds* total to reach mark cap. * *Why?* The wide capture range is offset by slow buildup, and you're going to be using the aimed mode for anything more than trash mobs anyway, not to mention the Shuriken synergy. * **If aiming:** the ring is at minimum size. Enemies receive their initial mark *instantly*, and additional marks *once per 0.25 seconds*, meaning an enemy needs to be within the focus ring for *0.5 seconds* total to reach mark cap. * *Why?* Effectively, one instant mark followed very closely by two additional ones preserves the current version of Blade Storm targeting for people who prefer it, while also making it better by increasing the targeting radius slightly instead of being limited to just your crosshairs. 3. Current synergies with Smoke Screen and Teleport are preserved. In addition, enemies struck by Shurikens during Blade Storm's aiming phase receive one mark instantly, regardless whether they are within the focus ring or not. Multiple Shurikens can apply multiple marks to the same target, as said above in the Shuriken section. * *Why?* This gives you a reason to use Shuriken *alongside* Blade Storm, as opposed to just using Blade Storm *instead of* Shuriken right now. The energy cost difference is balanced by the fact that enemies do not need to be within the focus ring to be marked, as well as the innate damage bonus that Shuriken will provide. --- Overall, I don't believe these changes will be too hard to implement (with the exception of Blade Storm), but they will greatly improve Ash's playability and bring him up to par with modern Warframe design."

16,vulnerability,Warframe,Thoughts on the usefulness and meta of the reworked status,1,fe676v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/fe676v/thoughts_on_the_usefulness_and_meta_of_the/,2020-03-06 12:53:33,"The main focus of the status rework seemed to be to re-balance statuses against each other and crit. I've been doing some testing of how the statuses feel against high level enemies and these are my thoughts **Impact** Impact has always been once of the worst statuses and this update seemed to have made it even worse. Getting multiple impact procs doesn't seem to have any difference compared to how getting a single impact proc used to be right up until you hit the max and the enemy falls over which is a complete detriment if you're using a ranged weapon. Unlike the old blast proc it's not even good crowd control and it makes any impact heavy status weapon a pain in the ass to use. **Puncture** Puncture has been mostly unchanged with the exception of its new ability to stack to 70% less enemy damage and it continues to be as useless as ever. In a game like warframe the damage is hardly ever going to come from a single enemy and so puncture procs are only ever going to be useful if you can apply them to the entire room. DE has been hinting they may be soon removing status immunity for many boss enemies which may give puncture a use but even then having a status that's only viable against bosses makes it a terrible status given that most of the game is a horde shooter. In some ways puncture is even weaker that impact as impact will remove 100% of the enemies damage on the first proc as they stagger so if you have a gun that procs both impact and puncture then the puncture is going to do virtually nothing **Slash** Slash continues to be the king of physical status. It was recently nerfed against shields but shields continue to be easily destroyed, even at high levels and with the recent buff to the scaling of enemy shields. Unless impact and puncture are in some way changed to decrease killtime or to provide meaningful crowd control, slash will continue to be the only useful physical status **Toxin** Toxin has been unchanged and it probably the only status I feel is in a good spot right now. It occupies a niche but continues to be useful outside of it. **Electricity** Shock procs were buffed in the update but still seem to be too weak. in theory being able to transfer both damage and CC from the target to the enemies around it is a good idea but the damage is too weak and the radius is far too small to be effective. **Cold** Despite not being very strong I quite like how cold works. It provides survivability by reducing enemy fire rate and also keeps the enemies nice and still for easy headshots. The only thing I would really ask for it is for it to be able to freeze enemies at max procs. **Heat** Heat continues to be strong as it provides a reduction to armour and additional damage from the proc. despite the scaling changes, armour continues to be the only factor worth modding for and so heat continues to be useful. **Viral** Viral got a big change but its usefulness continues to be universal. It's useful against all factions and massively reduces killtime. There seems to be some misinformation going around that the bonus from viral procs doesn't effect slash procs. this is incorrect. Viral still affects slash procs although it doesn't ""snapshot"" the damage bonus when the slash proc is first applied. **Corrosive** I consider corrosive to have been nerfed although it remains one of the few statuses that are endgame viable due to armours prominence. People have pointed out that leaving 20% of armour remaining allows your weapon the keep the +75% damage bonus while ignoring 75% of the remaining 20% armour but the 5% armour left is not insubstantial and corrosive was directly nerfed when looking at alloy armour. **Magnetic** I like how they changed magnetic procs but the reality is that nobody worries about dealing with enemy shields in anything other than a shield enhanced sortie 3 and until that is changed magnetic will still be trash tier status **Blast** Blast has the same problem as puncture in that it's completely inferior to staggering the enemy with a single impact proc. Before the update blast had a niche use in using it for crowd control on warframes that didnt have any of on their own but now blast is basically useless. It might have had some continued use if its proc was still AOE but given that its now a shitty single target proc tied to a worse damage type its pretty much dead. **Radiation** Radiation is still mostly useless other than redirection some fire away from you. 5x the damage still isn't enough to have the enemies do meaningful damage to each other. If the damage buff was a bit higher and it was also a damage increase in *taking* damage from the same faction then it might start to be useful. **Gas** RIP Gas. gas feels heavily nerfed from this update. Gas sticking to the target limits makes it almost single target single enemies usually leave a little bit of space between each other and the proc ending on the targets death makes it worthless against crowds of weaker enemies since for the proc to deal significant damage to nearby enemies the shot that procs it will probably kill the target immediately. since it no longer causes toxin procs it also lost a niche use against shields. the duration was also nerfed for seemingly no reason given that gas wasn't too powerful before. **Conclusion** Slash/muntions+viral continues to be king with heat and corrosive still being meta for their ability to reduce armour. Overall I'm disappointed in this update as I was hoping to see the statuses balanced to the same level yet it seems they are more unbalanced than ever. Gas, radiation, and shock all need to be buffed and Blast, puncture and impact all need to be revised completely. Magnetic is in a good place if shields are buffed to be as big a problem as armour. I would recommend impact to be replaced with stacking +damage vulnerability but with a very low status duration of perhaps a second, puncture to be replaced with +status duration or power to give it a niche but strong use for status weapons, and for blast to get it's old status back with the loss of accuracy to be it's stacking effect for after the enemies get up."

He doesn't have the time to look at whatever blocked his way; this whatever quickly pulls him inside the room. With only a brief time to scream, he disappears with that same ""splash"" sound. ***To acknowledge their existence could shatter a mind...*** Slowly falling, maybe drifting away ? in a dark empty world, the grineer comes back to consciousness. Instinctively, he searchs for a light. Nothing in front, nothing behind or below.

It is a grineer mask. Cracked, ripped off a helmet... tainted. He stops moving. Takes out his trusty sheev. There is something here. He can breath thanks to his armor, but it won't last long. And so he observes. In this dark space, his senses are ringing every bells. He is being watched and it is a trap. They will come. ***This platform we made may be a mistake.*** They come closer. Forms are moving in the abyss. Multiple creatures. They're quick and moves like sharks around their prey. He catches a glimpse when one of them passes under the light.

It is not big, it is gigantic. The grineer's blood freeze. Enormous, glowing, eyes illuminate the mere human. **It is no tool, but a door.** In that room, the water gathers to form slowly an individual. Walking as if nothing, Hydroid. ***The final mistake of our univers,*** Step by step in the corridor, the warframe's shadow is growing. He stops to slowly look behind.

I'm definitely not alone in having these sorts of ideas, and I know DE doesn't check the subreddit, but maybe this will help someone, in some way. Or maybe I'm just one of so many people venting, at the long end of my rope, starting to wish for a Warframe that never was. 'Meaningful grind', 'respecting players' time', etc. etc. Hopefully DE isn't lying to us, so much as they're misguided and/or lying to themselves. Bonus Payment: Imagine getting your credits after each three hour wave, even if your abritrary flotilla didn't eliminate all 100 Murex waves. This way, no one is screwed because of accidentally getting booted to an otherwise empty flotilla, or coming into a wave too late, or just plain bad luck with everyone else in your flotilla. Endless Missions and Scoring Scaling: Why aren't these missions endless, as DE stated they would be? People are going to no-life this, there is no amount of content or grind that will keep everyone occupied, let alone content or even happy. Of course endless missions would also make earning credits easier, at least for those capable of endurance running, which not everyone is for any number of reasons. Fixes and 'fixes': Gazing into my scrying mirror, I see DE rendering Sentients immune to (most? all? only CC?) Warframe abilities, or at the very least immune to rift-related shenanigans. Maybe it's for the better this way, because then we can't mostly AFK shit, and that's definitely something DE has repeatedly tried to prevent with its playerbase. On one hand, Sentient immunity to such powers wouldn't make sense lore-wise, because Sentients' most dire vulnerability is to the void. On the other hand, Sentients would be stupid to attack the Tenno without some kind of countermeasure, as they've already demonstrated with adaptation. The Murex should and would and probably will have countermeasures against our Railjacks, too, or at the very least point defenses, preventing people from simply parking the RJ inside and withering the storm (almost) unscathed. Apologies for the screed, but I want my Warframe hiatus to end, yet recent developments keep pushing me away."
19,vulnerability,Warframe,Regarding the viability of the wide cast of unused warframes,1,fbfpby,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/fbfpby/regarding_the_viability_of_the_wide_cast_of/,2020-03-01 04:19:59,"Listening to the Devstream from yesterday, they spoke about adjusting the accuracy of enemies (and then some of the shieldgating) with the overall goal of trying to create more room for all warframes to be a bit more viable. It's a good goal ... but I'm not entirely sure they're grasping what the real problem is here. What makes each warframe different from each other? * Different stats (shields/armor/health/movement speed/etc) * Different passive abilities * Different abilities Pretty basic, right? Okay, now what happens when you add ability nullification, energy restriction mechanics, and/or immunity to abilities? * Different stats *oh* *** Here are the problem scenarios: * **Problem:** Target is immune to abilities, but vulnerable to weapons * **Solution:** Take warframes which improve weapon damage * **Problem:** Target takes capped damage from weapons and nullifies abilities * **Solution:** Take warframes which have high EHP * **Problem:** Target is immune to crowd control or has high DR which reaches immunity quickly * **Solution:** Don't take a frame with CC * **Problem:** Target has a RNG or random timer vulnerability phasing mechanic which will prevent vulnerability if they cannot find the player * **Solution:** Don't use invisibility and maybe just use a high EHP or healing frame to tank the damage until vulnerability phases come up *** You want Nyx to be more viable? Make her abilities useful in more situations, improve her EHP to be good enough to use even when abilities stop having use, give her weapon damage buffs, or create a niche situation/game mode where she excels. Adjusting how enemies deal damage to players isn't going to solve the problem of how everyone sticks to the same warframes all the time. Loki used to be my go-to for Defense missions because of Radial Disarm, but the meta has shifted to just wide aoe instant killing and that slows things down. He used to be my go-to for Spy missions, but between Decoy being able to trigger enemies to trip alarms and the fact other frames can straight up ignore laser grids I never us him for that either. I used to use him for Assassinate missions, but because most enemies now either strip your invisibility, perfectly track you the millisecond it ends, or are just straight up invulnerable while you're invisible... Yeah, no reason to use him there either. The moment his abilities are nullified, that's it. He's done. Improving EHP a bit with shield gating might help. Decreasing enemy accuracy to add more skillful or active play to avoid damage might help. But at the end of the day all of these nullification and immunity mechanics are what cripple build diversity. See also: * Status weapons are useless against many high-end targets (Liches in particular since that's new), so crit or raw damage are always the best choices * High damage single shot weapons are useless against phased mechanics, so high rate of fire weapons are always the better choice * Grineer have the best Affinity distribution between spawned units on a given map, so Affinity grind is almost always better vs. Grineer (and Infested always the worst, Corpus/Orokin being okay depending on number of nullifier spawns) *** tl;dr: When the only difference between your warframes becomes stats due to nullification/immunity, that's the defining factor of any ""meta"""

Except that when i look at the ability it says in red numbers 39% for damage vulnerability and 14%. I tried removing all mods and such to see if that was the issue but it still said that. I don't think its supposed to be like that right? Anyone know whats wrong? On xbox by the way if that means anything.
21,vulnerability,Warframe,Vengeful Eximus an idea for challenge,1,eqwb9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/eqwb9s/vengeful_eximus_an_idea_for_challenge/,2020-01-20 00:37:38,"Considering challenge is a topic as of late I'd give my 2 cents about what I'd consider a good challenge: Vengeful Eximus types. In a radius of 20 meters around this one any dead enemy of the same faction and their loot will be vacuumed to this enemy and absorbed. Depending on the amount of enemies this one will become stronger by a certain % and the loot he drops upon being killed will be increased by that % as well (loot from vacuumed allies will also increase). This enemy also increases in size equal to the % in power gained until reaching 200% of his initial size. &amp;#x200B; Obviously this is just a concept and I don't have the necessary spreadsheets to determine which ratio of % vs enemies killed would be appropiate and how big the radius should be in relation to that ratio and small critters/small enemies spawned from enemies should not affect % due to lack of dropping anything and not being equal to normal enemies. So what do you think about the concept? &amp;#x200B; An enemy modification scaling the enemy as well as the reward randomly in missions while also providing visibility through increased size and choice in wether to engage/increase the challenge and reward willingly or avoid it alltogether by focusing on those that stick out due to slowly increasing size asap. That's what would be one concept I'd consider quiet fun and maybe even expandable later down the line/in later updates through giving such enemies a modification of the last special enemy they absorbed like Nox armor and vulnerability, nullifier bubble, etc. (but obviously such a modification should have special seperate increase in reward on top of the baseline if killed while having that modification, like more endo/credits/etc. when killed while being noxified/bubbled/etc. thus giving incentive to also think about what the enemies in this mission drop primarily and then apply the corresponding modification to the vengeful one before killing them). &amp;#x200B; I feel like Warframe isn't really rewarding quality kills as in any enemy requiring more time than what would still be considered bearable is marred by the fact that Warframe is rewarding quantity and speed while not giving any proper incentive to slow down overall except for stealth multipliers (which aren't working as intended as of late either). Thus before the challenge is adressed or at the same time while adressing said challenge one has to recognize that increase in challenge as something worth an increase in payoff appropiate to the increase in challenge. After all, a challenge without any proper payoff is worthless and a proper reward without challenge is pointless. (at least for a Looter game)"
22,vulnerability,Warframe,"Statuses, elements and your archgun, a primer.",1,edx81u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/edx81u/statuses_elements_and_your_archgun_a_primer/,2019-12-22 10:39:30,"[/u/awang1621 already made an initial post about the new statuses. This is an additional supplement that adds more information and clarifies some different interactions. I'll also speak a little bit about combined and uncombined elements.](URL **Note**: I'll be referring to plasma, ballistics and particle effects based on their IPS equivalent to avoid confusion. When modding your archwing you will see IPS, so we'll stick to that terminology. [Image for status icons. Impact, puncture, slash, then cold respectively.](URL &amp;nbsp; **Base damage types:** **Impact**: Unknown if this debuff stacks, it decreases the damage enemy ships deal and decreases their accuracy. (Given the prolific usage of homing missles, and large explosion radii, in veil, the benefit of an accuracy decrease is unclear.) **Puncture**: A stacking debuff that reaches a cap. (I reached this cap with 40 hits on the crewship being used for testing.) The total value of this debuff when I was testing it came out to ~3.2x at cap. Given its cap, I'm considering this a sort of analogue to corrosive in PvP. When the status wears off, you must reapply all stacks to get their benefit, this is not a permanent debuff like corrosive in PvE. Inflicting new stacks seems to refresh the duration of all stacks currently on the target. (Assumption because damage increase was consistent across the 12 second testing period, there were no drop-offs to damage numbers during a reload animation). **Slash**: A stacking debuff that appears to have no cap. I say no cap, but I literally can't reach it on lvl 43 crewships while getting useable numbers for calculations. My max count has been 41 simultaneous procs. My approximation for the base of the exponent is 1.25 based on a couple tests. (1.25^38 = 4815 for reference) Due to crewship DR, my initial numbers are 0 and 2 damage, which leaves a lot of openness to rounding errors and limits the ability to avoid these errors. &amp;nbsp; Therefore, we can say that 6 slash procs are approximately equivalent to 40 puncture procs, and anything after 6 will dwarf the benefit of puncture completely. Slash is also a much more effective debuff per status proc inflicted. Any puncture proc after the ~40th is worthless. &amp;nbsp; **Elemental statuses:** **Cold**: This is hands down your go-to status. Enemy ships inflicted with this will slow down coming to a halt a few seconds later and the proc is renewable. Bonus points for grineer ship's armour being slightly vulnerable to cold damage (alloy armour). **Electric**: An enemy procced by this will spin out of control for the duration of the proc. Grineer ship's armour has a negative vulnerability to electric, don't look at this element. The cc has potential, but is dwarfed by cold's ability to stop an enemy creating a stationary target. **Heat**: Inflict a DoT effect on an enemy ship. Sounds great on paper. In practice my procs deal 0,1 or 2 damage against veil cutters depending on how many puncture/slash debuffs are present (unsure to what degree each of the debuffs affect the proc's damage, I am simply able to see my procs deal different damage amounts between DoTs inflicted moments apart.) Has no bonus or penalty against the armour type. **Toxin**: Fancy radiation, enemies fire on other enemies. Given the pitiful damage a crewship manned by a tenno does against other grineer ships, I couldn't even bother to test this to see if that DR is from tenno damage sources specifically or is a global DR against all damage in railjack missions. It can take fire off your ship in a large dogfight, but you can probably just kill everything off anyways. No penalties or bonuses for the armour type. &amp;nbsp; **Combined elements:** Combined elements are included in your total damage and their bonuses/penalties do affect your outgoing damage. Combined elements do not inflict status procs and are not included in the weighting calculations for status procs. **Radiation**: It has a big bonus against alloy armour. That's it. Magnetic has a penalty and the other combined elements are all neutral against alloy armour. &amp;nbsp; TL;DR: **How do I build a weapon?** We're looking for a bunch of slash procs, puncture if we can't get slash, as little impact as possible and we're building for radiation + cold to take advantage of armour vulnerabilities while getting as many of the 60/60s as we can. (Small note: a great argument can be made to take 4 60/60s and take no elemental status sources to get more slash procs. This depends on how much you want cold procs.) Possible weapons: imperator vandal, phaedra, cyngas. A combination of status chance and fire rate is your deciding factor between the weapons. I'm not going to create a bunch of builds and try and explain the nuances of them in this post, we'll just talk about the generalities. &amp;nbsp; **Phaedra**: Great status, good fire rate, low weighting towards slash procs, decent damage per bullet. **Imperator Vandal**: Decent status, great amount of bullets, good weighting towards slash, low damage per bullet. **Cyngas**: Excellent status, decent fire rate, great weighting towards slash, high damage per bullet. Note: The base weightings for the guns in order are 10%, 25% and 34%. My descriptors are relative. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; **Issues**: I don't know if capping puncture procs will actually remove an enemy's armour causing elemental bonuses to no longer apply. I didn't test toxin, maybe it's actually busted and crewships will one-shot fighters. I can't be bothered to find out the formula for heat to properly factor it in (it also means nothing in the face of slash stacking.)"
23,vulnerability,Warframe,Can we get Heavy Attack Mods that scale with the Combo Multiplier?,1,ei4rye,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/ei4rye/can_we_get_heavy_attack_mods_that_scale_with_the/,2020-01-01 03:08:36,"Heavy Attacks feel a bit underwhelming unless you build for them specifically. I see many builds that focus exclusively on either Light or Heavy Attacks, but few that actually focus on maintaining a high Combo Multiplier by weaving together Light and Heavy attacks. I think the buffs to True Steel and Sacrificial Steel on Heavy Attacks was a missed opportunity. The mods could've been made to scale with the Combo Multiplier on Heavy Attacks. This change wouldn't hurt the effectiveness of the mod for Heavy Attack builds that already use Corrupt Charge, but would vastly improve its effectiveness for builds that focus on building a higher Combo Multiplier. Some other mods I might like to see scale with the Combo Multiplier: Melee Prowess (an alternative to Weeping Wounds), Reach (clear an entire room with a single Heavy Attack), Killing Blow (even more damage). I'd also like to see a mod that applies a Damage Vulnerability debuff on enemies lifted by a Heavy Attack. That would promote interplay between melee and other damage sources, by allowing you to set up a group of enemies with melee, then finish them off in style with a gun, an ability, or the help of a teammate. What other mods would you guys want to see? I'm honestly surprised that with the Old Blood Update, Blood Rush and Weeping Wounds weren't changed to only affect Heavy Attacks. That sort of change would been in line with their stated design philosophy for Melee changes. Though, I can see why DE would hesitate on that, since it would be too drastic a change. Also, can we have Melee Combo Efficiency affect the amount that the Combo Multiplier ticks down when Combo Duration runs out? It would be nice to be able to rely something other than just Naramon's Power Spike for maintaining Combo between droughts of enemies."
24,vulnerability,Warframe,"Kuva Liches and the Nemesis System: If you're going to copy someone else's homework, copy it right.",1,dsut2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/dsut2s/kuva_liches_and_the_nemesis_system_if_youre_going/,2019-11-07 19:16:46," It's clear that DE is aping a lot of this system from Shadow of Mordor, and that's not a bad thing in and of itself-- I've clocked over 100 hours in that game and *still* haven't beaten it because I had so much fun creating new nemeses and tracking them down, pulling them through Mordor's political quagmire until the entire place was run by war-chief thralls. But it doesn't ape *enough.* I get that they don't want just straight plagiarism, but there's some cues they could take to improve on a system that, at the moment, is pretty fucking bad. **Flip the Script on Opting In:** In Shadow of Mordor, a nemesis was created when you died in combat, with the Uruk who landed the finishing blow on you becoming a new nemesis. Why can't it be the same here? Kuvalings should be harder to kill, but not impossible-- something on the level of a Nox. Time-consuming, kind of annoying, but doable. You have to *let* yourself die to them, essentially, upon which they'd copy your Warframe's abilities and become a lich. **Better Personalities:** I just created my sixth lich in the game. I've seen reports of people having personality traits like ""allergic to nature"" or ""afraid of children"", but I've yet to get *any* of these. There are no clues on how to get them, either. In Shadow of Mordor, if an Uruk managed to run away or survive a fatal blow (including decapitation, SOMEHOW) he'd receive a fear of whatever killed him-- bees, fire, the various monsters that are all over Mordor. Why not have liches have a fear of Kavats if you manage to score a requiem on them when you've got your smeeta on you? Make it angry if it sees the Warframe that birthed it? React differently to certain tilesets, such as admiring Orokin architecture on Lua while saying it's a pity that it'll have to be painted red, or complaining of the cold in Corpus ice planet, or threatening to throw you into the reactor on a Grineer galleon? **Weaksauce Weakness Implementation:** Requiem mods are actually something I don't mind too much. I like the idea of you having to cast a specific spell to harm your lich. That being said, I like the *idea* of it. The execution needs execution. DE managed to borrow the idea of finding out weaknesses via interrogation of a Uruk's underlings from Shadow of Mordor, but did it in the most obtuse way possible. Here's what I think should be done: when you find out the first requiem in the sequence, it inflicts a permanent debuff on the lich-- something like weakness to the last element to damage it, loss of a damage immunity, reduced shields, loss of an ability, or vulnerability to the Warframe you Requiemed it as (from what I've seen, they *can* be CC'd and affected by abilities, including Mesa's Peacmaker, so credit to DE for learning *something* from the Wolf of Saturn Six(and if that turns out to be a bug, so help me Lotus I will crash my Liset into Fortuna at Mach 30)). The same thing happens with the second requiem. When you get to the third, you kill it, plain and simple. **The Liches Who Do Something:** Canonically, Grineer don't even get names until they do something worth getting a name over, so the Kuvalings getting named post-lichification show that they hold a fair bit of pull. Some of the lich's voice lines upon conversion mention the Queen(s) killing them if they were to ever find out that they sided with the Tenno, implying they have to show some facade of Grineer loyalty, still. The liches you convert could provide bonus murmurs on thrall-hunting missions, or even create their own thralls that you can then harvest for murmurs. Maybe they can call off the Grustrag 3, steal back stuff that your current lich stole from you, or you can have them disable all security measures in a spy vault and just let yourself in. Deploy them on a timer in order to clear a node your current lich has control over for you while harvesting murmurs at a reduced rate. Hell, just have them appear to deliver the login bonus once in a while, something to show they still exist outside of occasional, usesless cameos once every two dozen missions or so. **Trophies!:** Add in the masks of the various Liches in as operator cosmetics. I think they'd look cool, at least, but they'd have to be resized. Nuff said. **ADD BACK IN THE COLLECTIVE MURMURS FROM LICH ATTEMPTS.** This isn't related to the Nemesis system, but it's a complaint that bears repeating. There's such a thing as a bug that should be made into a feature, DE-- I seem to remember a certain thing called ""Zoren Coptering"" from a few years back? If it needs to be nerfed, fine, but it made lich hunting *fun*. Plus, Shadow of Mordor even had a whole mechanic where friends who played the game and had suffered defeats could be avenged-- this would make a neat equivalent to it. I realize that most of this is, at best, impractical. DE probably had the voice lines for liches recorded months ago, and I don't know the mechanics or technicalities of getting into contact with voice actors to record new lines for a lot of this stuff-- DE is lucky in that the majority of their major characters are voiced by staff at the company, but I have no idea if that's the case for the liches. But I just spent over 500 words vomiting words onto this subreddit, so maybe DE will take some notice?"

Each percent filled grants 1% ability power and -0,5% ability efficiency. At 100% insanity, your ability strength is increased by an additional 15%, but your shields begin to deteriorate, draining 2 points of shields per second, increasing by 1 every 2 seconds spent at max insanity.. If you have no shields at max insanity, you are drained of health and energy at the same rate. * Passive 2: Elder mind: Crouching and dashing will send you into the elder mind, taking the form of a chosen captura scene (in arsenal, open worlds not included). Here, nightmares will begin to attack you if you have insanity stacked, taking the form of random enemies. Killing them reduces insanity by 15% and grants 10 energy (scales with ability strength).

Overshields from this ability have an independant cap of 1000, last up to 24 seconds and has damage reduction equal to half your insanity. Generates 1,5% insanity per enemy hit.

During this time, insanity doesn't cause you to lose ability efficiency, but it is drained by 0,2% each second, accelerating by 0,2% each second. Insanity generated over the cap now releases a seeker per 1% percentage exceeding the limit. Losing all insanity causes the ability to end.

28,vulnerability,Warframe,Liches are the wrong mechanical direction,17,dr3yn2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/dr3yn2/liches_are_the_wrong_mechanical_direction/,2019-11-04 04:52:50,"Skill in Warframe boils down to one of three things: #1 gear, #2 mechanical knowledge, #3 attention span. #1 includes modding and arsenal. It's locked in before the mission even begins and can carry most of the starchart by itself. #2 includes basic *in-mission* mechanical knowledge (like parkour) but is more about things like memorizing the spy vault or figuring out key behaviors in a boss fight (ex: changing profit taker shields with operator, standing under eidolon to maximize shraksun punch through). #3 is basically like driving - can you remember to check for traffic and crowded intersections (enemies on minimap) or stop signs (your health) or green lights (vulnerability phases) every X seconds for Y time without falling asleep at the wheel? The need for #3 can be reduced drastically by bringing a tankier frame and better weapons, which brings us back to #1. #2 ultimately develops into a gamemode specific meta that trivializes it. And it is easy by design to trivialize a gamemode where you essentially bring the right bruiser with the right stick and press the right button every X seconds to assure victory. Liches are the logical conclusion of this kind of design - almost all of their complexity is fully bound up in #1. You have the right parazon mods in the right order, you pump catchmoon several times, you press X to mercy kill. There's no need for #2 because that's not a real *in-mission* mechanic. And there's little call for #3 because there's just one real vulnerability phase that you skip with a fully scripted cinematic. A satisfying boss fight needs to have actual mechanics to learn that feel fundamentally different than the usual patterns. Here are some examples just off the top of my head. Some of them are probably too hard to code, but most of them already exist in some form as an isolated mechanics or behaviors. Defensive: many bosses have invulnerability phases and/or follow a shoot-legs shoot-body model. Alternatives: % max health DPS cap (Lephantis but whole body as ""weak spot"") and viral/corrosive proc immunity, % max health regeneration, parkour (Garesh), shooting during parkour, high mobility melee stance combos (Shimmering Blight, Reaping Spiral), teleports (Garesh, although he uses it more offensively), invisibility phase (Executioners in general) but revealed by scanners. Offensive: many bosses have high firerate attacks with either hitscan or massive AoE properties that encourage a mix of Spoiler Mode, camping behind terrain, and one-shot builds. Alternatives: % warframe max health DPS cap and viral/corrosive proc immunity (to encourage frame diversity), boss attack/ability status and CC duration cap, highly telegraphed attacks and abilities (Juggernaut charge, Lephantis scythe arm), non-DPS and non-CC abilities (ex: stealing abilities/weapons, ""turning back time"" a few seconds, manipulating terrain)."
29,vulnerability,Warframe,"Exalted Armor/Sentinel for Vauban (I already know, Vauban is Juggler now)",0,d670xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/d670xx/exalted_armorsentinel_for_vauban_i_already_know/,2019-09-19 11:34:13,"Had this rework Idea ready, I know it is to late to give any input on Vauban rework (the skill are already being worked on right now. But I wanted to share this idea. I will give the problem I saw Vaubans original kit and my reworked skill. &amp;#x200B; **Tesla** *Tesla is just too weak, but I don't want to change it too much. So, I just gave it more Utility and CC.* **1. Tesla Wire** Grenades now explodes upon contact, sending an electric pulse stunning enemies on a 7.5 meters radius. After this explosion the grenade sticks and zaps nearby enemies dealing 50 electric damage with a guaranteed electric proc.Tesla Wire has the same linking effect as the old Tesla link, but enemies passing through the link will be knocked down (knock down lasts for 9 seconds). **\[Argument\] Mite Tesla (replaces Tesla Link)** Vauban throws a Tesla mite raknoide, this raknoid will send an electric shockwave upon impact. After the shock wave the raknoid will activate and send electric attacks, charge enemies and send electric shock waves (the electric shock waves have a countdown). Hitting an ally with this skill will cause the tesla raknoide to attach to them granting them increased shields and a buffed retribution effect (has a change to retaliate enemy attacks with an electric shock, procs electric). Allies can pick up (pressing x near them) the racknoids if they want the buff. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Mine layer** *Well, only Sherd it truly worthy it. Concuss does not fit well on an engineer frame (melee finisher on engineer). Bounce is a bit of meme (it is useful on interception but thats about it). Trip Wire is the third instance of area denial on his kit, it is redundant. Ive completely reworked this skill, sherd got absorbed on the reworked version, bounce got reworked as part of another skill and concuss was completely erased.* **2. Smart Grenade** Vauban throws a grenade like a baseball pitch. Grenade does impact damage upon contact with the target enemy. Upon contact the grenade will detect the enemy health type (flesh, cloned flesh, infested flesh) and act accordingly &amp;#x200B; * If the targeted enemy has Flesh or Cloned Flesh the grenade will explode, striping armor and shields from all enemies in a 5 meters radius (regardless of health type). * If the targeted enemy has Infested flesh, the grenade will send an electric pulse(5 meters radius) overloading the enemys neurological system, leaving them catatonic. Catatonic enemies wont move and have their aura disable. * If the targeted enemy has Robotic Health, the grenade will the grenade will star overwriting enemys systems, reducing their damage. Upon death, the enemy will be reactivated with increased stats and fight alongside Vauban. Up to 3 robots can be controlled this way. This grenade has no explosion radius. A few examples for the sake of clarity: &amp;#x200B; * &gt;!Supposing you are fighting the Corpus. If you throw the grenade on a Corpus Tech, the grenade will explode striping all enemy on blast radius even if their health type was not Flesh (ex: if there was bursa close to this tech the bursa would suffer the armor and shield reduction effect ) !&lt; * &gt;!Supposing you are fighting the Corrupted. If you throw the grenade on a Corrupted Ancient, the grenade will explode leaving all enemies in the blast radius catatonic even if their health type was not Infested Flesh. ( ex: you are opening relicts on a corpus mission and you throw the grenade at the Corrupted Ancient healer , there as a corpus Comba close by this Comba will have his auras as well. !&lt; * &gt;!Supposing you are fighting the Sentient. If you throw the grenade on a Batalist, the grandee will reduce his damage. When this Batalist die, he will be reactivated on Vauban side !&lt; **\[Argument\] Universal Aid** Smart grenade will be able to target ally. Like the original smart grenades, its effects are conditional. The grenade will have one of the fallowing effects. Effects dont stack, throwing additional grenades will override the effect of the last one. &amp;#x200B; * If the ally has full shield, give this ally 100 % electrical damage * If the ally has damaged shields, give this ally 50 shield/s and reinforced shields (has the Hildrin passive and takes 50% reduced damage from all sources) * If the ally has no shields (either depleted or nonexistent), gives them 3 seconds of invulnerability and increased bullet jump and aim glide (has the same visual effect as lighting dash) Note: Holding 2 will throw the grenade at Vauban. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **Bastille and Vortex** *Both skills do the same, area denial. Both functionalities will be rolled into a single new skill. The new version of bastille will absorb all the area denial and trap making of Vaubans old kit. It will also add a bit of a fortification building flavor to it.* **3. Bastille 2.0** * **Gravity well** (replaces the old bastille) (same duration and range as old bastille)- Increases the gravity on a region, the first 12 enemies entering this area will be completely halted. Extra enemies will be slowed by 60%. Throwing a tesla inside this area will spawn a Vortex. * **Energy Wall**\- Deploys energy wall stopping enemy fire (Hp calculated like a frost wall). The wall has a 10% of retaliate enemy fire by firing back a plasma bolt dealing impact and fire damage (this bolt has guaranteed heat and impact proc, damage scales based on the exalted drone weapon mods). Like volts shield both Vauban and his allies can pick up the shield (applies the same restrictions, even dough, I think the energy drain and the movement speed reduction are stupid, Volt has set this precedent so I have to fallow it). Swapping back to the primary weapon will drop the shield into the ground. * **Bounce**\- Range increased to 10 meters, but trigger range is only 1 meter. Enemies that collide with the celling will take 30% maxHealth finisher damage (this effect can only happen once per enemy). Allies inside the 10 meters radius have increased air glide duration and bigger jump height. *Clarification (the trap affects enemies on a 10 meters radius but can only trigger if an enemy get within a 1-meter radius of the center).* **\[Argument\] Air support.(replaces repelling bastille)** Vauban calls down a unique air support, liset will bombard the area and leave Arsenal station. Arsenal station will fully resupply allies once. Vauban has tinkered with his lisset to allow him to call down a unique and powerful air support. When Vauban calls down this air support his lisset will perform a bombing run (like the scimitar) dealing damage to all enemies (damage scales with the mods installed in the sentinel exalted weapon). Additionally, the lisset will drop a supply package. Allies may interact with the package only once either to fully resupply (ammo, shields , health and energy ). *Note: this air support is called by using Vaubans (it will appear as a 4 option on the skill cycle)* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **4. Blriot** Summons his master work Sentinel, Blriot * **Visual**: A shield drone but looks like cephalon tech (lots of floaty bits) * Drone fallows Vauban like a shield drone would. * Modable like a sentinel * Must use unique targeting precept (Sentinel targets the closest enemy to the center of Vauban CrossHair) **Sentinel Weapon:** * Sniper * Trigger type Charged * Takes 3 seconds to Charge. * Launches a single bolt of electric energy. High critical Chance and Critical Damage. Has a guaranteed electric proc. High base damage. &amp;#x200B; **Precepts:** * **Electrical singularity**  launches a massive ball of electricity, this ball will hover a few centimeters of the ground at the target destination. This ball will discharge energy damaging nearby enemies. The sentinel will prioritize targeting enemies caught within bastille. This precept is disabled during the exalted armor. * **Targeting relay**  pretty much Helios detect vulnerability, but it can affect 7 enemies at a time. This precept is disabled during the exalted armor. **Combine!** Recasting Blriot will disassemble the drone and equip it onto Vauban granting Vauban the fallowing benefits. * **Visual:** like nidus prinx skin Vauban will get unique armor parts added to his body. * Shoulder mounted ""Mini Amprex"" * Continuous, chains too nearby enemies. (Range 10 meters) * Average critical chance and Critical damage has high status chance. Low base damage. * This armor also has a pair of hover shoes changing his walking animation these shoes give Vauban 2 passive mobility skills. * \[requires electrical singularity equipped\] **Dash**  replaces Vauban dodge roll with a dash. Dash is faster than a roll but covers the same distance. Enemies hit by this dash suffer an electrical proc. * \[requires targeting relay equipped\] **Anti-Gravity Array**\- Replaces Vauban Aim glide with air walk, during you air glide gravity will be negated Vauban can move as if he was in the ground. Additionally, Vauban has increased movement speed. * All the sentinel precepts (guardian, medray ..) are active during this transformation * Combines the drone shield with Vauban shield to create a new bigger shield. * Adds the drone armor to Vauban armor **\[Argument\] Adaptable Systems (replaces perpetual Vortex )** Blriot can equip any sentinel or Moa precepts (including sentinel exclusive ones for example: you can equip Ammo Case, Arc Coil, Energy Generator, Whiplash mine, Stasis Field ). Additionally, Sentinel shield and Exalted armor Shield receive the Adaptation Effect (this adaptation effect caps at 50% damage reduction)."
30,vulnerability,Warframe,Simple zephyr rework suggestion,16,d8683v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/d8683v/simple_zephyr_rework_suggestion/,2019-09-23 23:01:57,"I love zephyr, shes a fun frame and unique tank with good mobility, while also having some DPS capabilities and good CC. That said she suffers from QoL issues and one useless ability. These issues have persisted for a long time and her air blast, which was added the last time she was taken a look at is basically worthless. The main issue with zephyr are these: * Tailwind: It gets you stuck on walls in smaller tile sets and the hover doesnt scale with duration. * Target Fixation: Damage decays to fast. * Airburst: Literally useless, not even worth using to buff the size of tornados. * Turbulence: Slow casting animation and no audio cue when it ends. * Tornados: Slow on their own and pretty uncontrollable. * Passive: Even though she has better maneuverability than other frames, in my opinion its still no enough thanks to her low gravity. That said, here is my suggestion to make her better: **Her passive(tweaked): Lightweight** Tweaks: * Increase maneuverability while airborne. * Add a 50% energy discount to any ability casted while airborne, instead of just tailwind and airburst. Note: Zephyr stick is being airborne, but the problem is that there isnt an incentive to stay airborne, thats why Ive decided to apply her energy discount to all of her abilities. In addition I always found her airborne control to be lacking, which is why I wish for this to change. **Her one (reworked): Tailwind** Ability description: Zephyr launches herself at tremendous speed forward. Colliding with world geometry will cause an explosion and negate any momentum she has instantly. Enemies caught in her path will be knocked down. Holding the ability will charge it and allow zephyr to hover, charge will determines Hight. Holding it while airborne will negate all momentum and allow zephyr to hover on the spot. Technical description: * Divebomb will now be triggered on world geometry collision, enemies dont count. * Hover will now scale off duration mods, rolling or performing a slam attack will stop the hover. * Damage, cost and range stay the same. New synergy: . Having turbulence on will guarantee a slash proc. Augment changes: Allow the duration to scale with mods and increase it to 4s. Note: the main issue with her 1 has always been the momentum, divebomb already fixes this which is why I think DE should just change how it triggers. In addition the hover has always been a useless feature, with these changes though that wont be the case. **Her two (new ability): Depressurize** Ability description: Zephyr depressurize an area causing a huge air pressure difference. Enemies passing through it are thus slowed thanks to the sudden change in pressure. Furthermore tornados are attracted to this zone and deal double the tick rate while in it. Low pressure zone shrinks over time. Enemies in the initial cast area will be knocked down. Technical description: * Range: 15m scales with range. * Duration: 15s scales with duration. * Slow effect: 20% scales with power. * Cost: 50 energy. * Recasting the ability will dissipate previous instance if active. * Tick rate of tornadoes are doubled form 4/s to 8/s. Note: Airblast was the only ability which couldnt be salvaged in her kit, since it was completely useless, it only served a quick soft CC and as a buffer to her 4. But thanks to it not outright affecting every instance of tornados at once, its value has always been bad. **Her three (tweaked): Turbulence** Tweaks: * Double the casting speed. * Introduce an Audio cue whenever the ability runs out. Note: Turbulence lack of indication combined with its slow casting speed can easily lead to a players death. While I dont think it should be a recastable ability, since I want her to have at least frame of vulnerability, her current state can make it hard for the player to notice that turbulence isnt on anymore. **Her four (tweaked): Tornados** Tweaks: * Make the effects of airburst a permanent part of the ability, since the ability isnt used anymore. * Change the casting area to only be on a 5m radius from where the player is aiming at. * Increase the casting speed by 50%. Note: Tornados are largely a good ability, its good CC and with the augment it has good DPS potential, especially with my depressurize suggestion, which gives us even more control over it. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Zephyr in my opinion is a frame that can be easily fixed in comparison to vauban or ember, since most of her abilities only suffer from QoL issues. I really hope that DE takes a second look at her when her deluxe skin comes out (which looks awesome in my opinion). That said, what do you guys and gals think?"
31,vulnerability,Warframe,Niche Frame (what to use each frame for) Attn new players,2,cx0hf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/cx0hf9/niche_frame_what_to_use_each_frame_for_attn_new/,2019-08-29 22:50:31,"The most common question likely asked by a new player is ""what frame is the best?"" the answer, is firstly subjective based on opinion, and secondly, I find it is best to view each warframe as a tool. All frames are technically viable for all content completion in the game, however some frames are going to be better suited to a task than others. This list is to focus on the highlights to each frame in comparison to other frames, which means, they can do a lot more than what is listed here, but we're focussing on what makes them unique, this is important because while someone's favorite frame can do a thing they probably find highly useful, it doesn't mean it's the best at it or it is terribly unique. Below lists each frame and what it""s good for: ASH: good for solo endless runs and also can pretty much easy mode the first star chart clear with minimal modding and effort. ATLAS: Primarily good for 1 shotting enemies and also has some defensive capabilities that are kind of useful in certain situations. BANSHEE: sound quake can trivialize a lot of low level defense, also good for damage-o-philes where it's not enough to one shot the enemy, you have to one shot it with as much damage as possible. BARUUK: good for players that want an involved play style with chaining combos. while this might not seem like a huge thing, but having an involved play style can dramatically increase the amount of fun you extract from the game and help prevent burn out. CHROMA: large boss fights like tri caps and exploiter orbs due to his damage bonus. EMBER: low level trash mob clearing. accellerant might also sometimes be useful in a defense. EQUINOX: trash mob clearing with room nuke build up over time, decent eso choice. EXCALIBUR: exalted blade spam is a viable offense that is pretty cheap to manage early on. for his umbra variant he can also lazy mode index for you. FROST: snow globe Is good for various defensive objectives (kuva, excav, def, mobile, def) GARA: has a decent room nuke and some good survivability. GARUDA: good for endless missions due to infinite damage scaling. somewhat involved playstyle with resource management as part of her play style. HARROW: a good babysitter frame for walking around newbies that need a buff and also a good frame to practice your head shots with. HILDRYN: shield gate is a nice thing, also a decent index point carrier. balefire charger is also pretty beast if you aren't already using min/max riven set ups. HYDROID: looter frame, decent cc INAROS: highest health pool, can regen health with abilities, decent budget Nidus option. IVARA: infinite stealth and makes all spy missions (except underwater) a joke with her augment, also good for getting easy simaris rep cap daily with stealth scans. one of the best solo endless frames because of noise arrow spam. KHORA: particularly useful with pilfer on her dome for endless excav (particularly for infested excav arbitration), can also lockdown choke points nicely for certain index boards. LIMBO: catabombing for syndicate medallion hunting is a thing, also in general defense (slightly better frost), also the frame you want for solo radiation mobile defense sortie, or defense sortie to banish the dude so you don't have to pick him up every minute or so. press shift to not care about laser traps/alarms. LOKI: excellent for early easy mode first star chart clear, also you'll want his switch for plaguestar runs to make them faster. disarm can also be handy in specific farm groups MAG: great for ending shields (shield sortie), also very effective at high levels once you invest in her a lot (would not suggest as starter frame pick). has some really intense weapon synergies. MESA: aimbot is a nice thing. particularly useful for index with a point carrying team mate, or for most boss nuking if you don't have very expensive better weapon set ups that clear bosses faster. MIRAGE: explosive legerdemain can be useful in eso, also a budget mesa since she's probably the cheapest prime frame. requires that you aim sorta with her clones, but also inflicts a lot of dps in general. NEKROS: looter frame, particularly useful in survival/excav missions with slash damage equipped. NEZHA: good all around frame, high solo speed and survivability, can also buff teammates as a babysitter frame. NIDUS: easy mode star chart if you get him early (ie, by with plat), perfect for hijack and no shield missions (and unlike innarros also has good CC) also a good frame for your first few endless runs. starts to shine with tons of investment where he becomes super viable for practically all missions except tri caps where you really should use something else. With exception to hijack and no shield nidus won't be ""the best"" pick for much, but he will be top tier for nearly everything making him an excellent all around default frame. NOVA: teleportation is nice. excellent for slow (if survivability is a concern) or fast (if it's not) farming and boss beat downs, particularly those that have erratic patterns or limited vulnerability like lephantis, thumpers, plaguestar, and similar. NYX: 1 button huge instant cc is nice. great for when you just want to run to extract to collect your pay day. OBERON: solo tri caps, team healing, massive AoE DoT OCTAVIA: perpetual team invis and other buffs, infinite damage scaling, arguably the best specter with arca plasmor equipped REVENANT: has a great tank ability that requires lots of upkeep, also can make shiny colors. RHINO: easy to use tank mode, can trivialize a lot of content and is gained early in game. also great for index point carry and thumpers. SARYN: Queen of elite sanctuary onslaught and super viable anywhere that killing stuff is important. TITANIA: good choice for weekly ayatan if your operator is weak and also highly desired for speedy plague star boss runs. TRINITY: queen of team support. easily the most nerfed frame yet still super strong. meta for tri caps. VALKYR: invulnerability can be useful around mid game. also good to pull your afk ally that is sitting just off extract VAUBAN: can lock down choke points nicely, but also pretty boss at solo interception. VOLT: speed is always good for efficiency. melee speed at endgame is godly. volt is also you relic runner which is your primary source of plat, because he doesn't just make you fast, he makes the team fast, and having everyone at extract vs. waiting a full minute each run makes a huge difference in your proffits. also has a beastly CC/eso nuke, and is a good choice for tri-cap meta. WISP: buff that team in the ways that matter. wisp is a great babysitter frame and also just welcome in general because of her easy access buffs. WUKONG: not dying is kinda cool around mid game for most stuff. his real power lies in his staff though, which is pretty gnarly until you start getting beast mode zaw rivens. ZEPHYR: generally decent for PoE mobility and where platforming is important, particularly with dojo obstacle courses. as of this time guass and grendel are not included as they are not yet released."

I mean hes a Sentient afflicted Warframe. Thats really cool! So cool I cant believe how well they nailed his concept. I mean, Revenant is SO Sentient his entire synergy is allergic to Tenno! Honestly, though I like Revenant. He looks badass and I like his abilities. I mean after all this time Revenants has become my most used warframe. But he has problems. One of which is the one hes had from day one and honestly the only one I seem to care about the most and that is. . . **Allies can always kill your thralls.** Like, instantly. Like, immediately, and this? THIS is a problem. Not all the time. But when its a problem its like a HUGE problem? Why? Because a lot of his important synergies are built on the question of, But do you have thralls? Revenant being able to choose how and when his thralls die is specifically important for this reason because. . . 1.Thralls draw fire away from Revenant. Improving his survivability by staggering the speed In which Mesmer Skin can be lost. 2. Thralls restore Mesmer Skin Charges when Reaved through without the vulnerability that comes with recasting Mesmer Skin. Both of these facts are majorly important for Revenants survivability. Especially at high level, and Arbitrations. But do you know who gets decide if you can use any of that? Other Tenno and I dont think thats fair. DE please change this. I dont mind if you tackle this problem through Augments. But Id like a solution to this problem. I thought part of the idea of warframe was being able to live out your own unique space ninja power fantasy. I really dont want that part of the experience to be something so easily impeded on. Suddenly losing all my thralls because of other Tenno, in a clutch situation can easily get me killed at times and thats the last thing anyone would want in a Arbitration. DE please take this into consideration."

35,vulnerability,Warframe,"[WARFRAME FEEDBACK &amp; SUGGESTION] Banshee: Sonic Vibrations and ""Body Sonar""",3,c2750v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/c2750v/warframe_feedback_suggestion_banshee_sonic/,2019-06-19 06:07:33,"**OVERVIEW** Banshee has been one of the older Warframes in the current roster and has been an interesting unit to use in missions. Although, there are things I wish to address and give some general feedback on Banshee at the current state of the game. &amp;#x200B; **POSITIVE FEEDBACK ON BANSHEE** * **Passive : Suppressor -** This passive makes it less likely for Banshee to be targeted by enemies whether engaging in long ranges or when in teamplay battles. It adds a moderately okay defensive element to Banshee. * **Sonic Fracture -** There are a handful of abilities that can debuff enemy Armor and this augment can completely to that (although temporarily and requiring around +140% Strength build) * **Sonar/Resonance -** Currently the highest damage vulnerability enemy debuff in the game with a max Rank damage vulnerability of 500%. Banshee's Sonar can effectively make things quicker to deal with enemies for herself and for her team. * **Silence/Savage Silence -** Outside of Silence, enemies will be alert if the hear their allies die. Silence's utility gimmick counters this enemy AI mechanic and with it following Banshee players can use it as a ""stun aura."" This is doubled with Savage Silence's mechanic which allows Banshee to unleash strong Finishers on Silence-stunned enemies, though this is best used with a low-Range build. * **Sound Quake/Resonating Quake -** A static low-level damage makes it quick to either stun and stall a room full of enemies or quickly kill off lower level content. &amp;#x200B; **NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON BANSHEE** * **Stats -** Banshee's stats are relatively low and her current kit has little means to protect herself from enemy aggression other than through using her silence perks. This is further double when dealing with enemies that could snipe from long distances * **Sonic Boom -** The ability is among the lowest damage-type abilities of and has a travel time limiting to an average-low range. It now serves as a low damage conical (180 degree) knockdown while there are other first-slot abilities that can do Sonic Boom's role but better. * **Sonar -** Recasting Sonar allows already affected Sonar enemies to expose more weakpoints, and personally I feel Resonance serves as a band-aid to remove the need to recast the ability. Though I feel an ability that is used to detect enemies should be one that actually follows the user. There is also the fact that unlike most ""Damage Vulnerability Debuff"" abilities out there (ex: Nova - Molecular Prime, Nekros - Terrify, Atlas - Petrify, Ember - Accelerant/Flash Accelerant, Equinox - Rage), Banshee's Damage Vulnerability debuff while is the highest in terms of damage bonus also requires to hit those spots which can be easily done if recasting Sonar so many times or by using Resonance. * **Silence -** Many argue that this ability deserves to be a recast ability in order to make it the defensive tool Banshee needs to cover her low vitality stats. High Range Silence makes for a great stealth utility since it won't alarm enemies of their surrounding dead unless they ""see"" them. Low Range Silence takes advantage of what Savage Silence provides for Finisher attacks, but I tend to see Finishers animations to be a rather hefty drawback for their speed and it also notes that lower ranges could mean more opportunity to be sniped. * **Sound Quake -** There upsides and downsides for having an ability that continuously pushes enemies away from the epicenter of an ability. However on the long run, Sound Quake begins to be nothing more than a wide-area channeling stun. Sonic Boom already is a small but relatively quicker stun ability which does not leave herself open to long-distant attacks much like Sound Quake. &amp;#x200B; **THE SUGGESTION FOR BANSHEE** *Banshee right now is designed as a high-skill ceiling Warframe that depends much on the Augments of her Sonar and Silence. Her Sound Quake and Sonic Boom are rarely used in combat unless in lower level missions, but their effectiveness in combat turns those two into abilities meant to just stall.* ***Banshee is more of a ""Glass-Debuffer"" Warframe than a ""Glass-Cannon.""*** *Glass cannons usually have abilities that quickly deal damage and finish off enemies fast before they get to them. Currently, I see Warframes like Ivara and her Artemis Bow, Mesa and her Peacemaker, and Garuda's blood style to be better examples of ""glass-cannons."" Banshee on the other hand sets up enemies for high damage with her Sonar or her Silence abilities. Her 2 and 3 make it so that even her teammates can capitalize on high damage shots making Banshee feel more like an ""Offensive Support-Type"" Warframe.* *I'll breakdown each of the suggested changes for Banshee's four abilities to try and make Banshee's kit focus on the specific theme of the ""applications of Sound manipulations"" while trying to not change too much of her kit but repurpose a few of them to cover her self-defensive weaknesses.* &amp;#x200B; **SONIC BOOM SUGGESTED CHANGES** * **\[\~\] Sonic Boom's Max Rank Damage increase :** \~100 Impact * **\[+\] Charging Up Sonic Boom for a more Focused Attack:** Holding down Sonic Boom reduces the conical angle AOE of Sonic Boom (current Sonic Boom has 180 degrees, max charge could reduce it to \~30 degrees) but gain damage multiplier and adds range and reduces travel time to Sonic Boom. ex: Damage multiplied = 1 + (180 - degrees shrunk \[max 30\]). Requires \~1.5 seconds to max charge * **\[\~\] Sonic Boom now affects enemies behind obstacles:** Sound vibration can travel through the air, ground, water, and any form of medium *This is basically to give an option for Banshee's Sonic Boom to either be a quick wide-aoe knockdown or a more powerful concentrated sonic attack dealing high damage. Originally, Sonic Boom does 50 damage at max. The charge mechanic is rather to be used as a more opportunistic approach to make sound-based abilities of Banshee all the more effective.* &amp;#x200B; **SONAR SUGGESTED CHANGES** * **\[+\] Sonar follows Banshee** * **\[\~\] Sonar pulses from Banshee reapplying Sonar's effect to expose more weaknesses, but mod more Duration to reduce the time between pulses** * **\[-\] Remove Sonar's casting animation** * **\[\~\] Sonar becomes a toggle/channel ability** * **\[OPTION 1+\] Sonar adds +X% Evasion \[Max 50%\] to herself per enemy detected within Sonar's range** * **\[OPTION 2+\] Sonar adds +X% Damage Reduction \[Max 80%\] to herself per enemy detected within Sonar's range** * **\[\~\] Sonar's Augment Resonance now adds +X.X range to Sonar each time an enemy is killed inside Sonar's AOE** *Having Sonar follow Banshee like an aura and giving Sonar a defensive component gives a more authentic feeling for Banshee's Sonar to behave like an actual sonar: a detection ability that prepares the user of incoming threats. The defensive buff suggestion is to make it easier for Banshee to capitalize on those weakspot shots and adds more needed self-protection to Banshee. Having Sonar now pulse every few seconds covers the necessity to recast Sonar over and over again sparing the energy and removing the casting animation making it a much faster ability to use.* &amp;#x200B; **SILENCE SUGGESTED CHANGES** * **\[+\] Silence causes enemies that attack with their guns inside its AOE to emit a concussive force reapplying the stun.** *This suggestion is to minimize the current function of Silence and its non-recasting ability but also give it a bit more payoff for Silence. Players tend to use low-duration builds for Silence so that the AOE ring of Silence can be used to re-stun enemies. With this Silence suggestion, the stun can be reapplied to enemies a bit more actively.* &amp;#x200B; **SOUND QUAKE SUGGESTED CHANGES** * **\[\~\] Sound Quake no longer becomes a channeling ability but a single shockwave attack which knocks down all enemies within range instead of pushing them away** * **\[+\] Temporarily infuses the ""Vibration"" buff to the weapons of Banshee and allies adding +XX% Multishot to their weapon and melee attacks per enemy hit by Sound Quake.** * **\[\~\] Resonant Quake now adds a chance to increase the duration of Sound Quake's ""Vibration"" buff each time an enemy is killed** *Banshee's current ability style can suffer against enemies that are immune to debuffing/CC Warframe powers. So, I have decided to suggest an ability that could directly buff the offenses of Banshee and her allies to handle those situations. Multishot buff is something to simulate* [vibration infusion](URL *powers where Banshee uses her sonic powers to vibrate her weapons improving their efficacy. In theory, vibrating weapons like blades have increased cutting potential due to their vibrating nature. Having Sound Quake to be a quick knockdown AOE makes the use of her 4th quicker but the damage buff it provides makes it more supportive for Banshee and her teammates.* &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; **ADDITIONAL COMMENTS** *TBD*"
36,vulnerability,Warframe,Problems with the Wukong rework and how I'd fix them,0,c35yqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/c35yqu/problems_with_the_wukong_rework_and_how_id_fix/,2019-06-21 14:15:44,"First of all, great job with the rework! He's really fun to play now, much more active and mobile. However, there're some problems with the way he handles/the abilities work (as expected from a pretty much new frame), so here's a list of stuff that in my opinion needs fixing - Controlling his clone The clone is a great addition and fits Wukong's theme very well, but getting it to do what you want is a real pain. Most of my problems come from the gimmick that makes him use melee when you're shooting and vice versa - at first I really liked it, but after some playing it turned out that the clone is near useless when using melee, so that mechanic ends up being frustrating and forces you into using one weapon more than anything (it also limits my primary/secondary gun usage, since if I want him to use a certain gun I can't use the other one). My suggestion would be to lock him into the weapon you're currently holding after using your 1 on him - this way the melee-gun switcheru would still be available for the people who want it. Also, please don't make him use my stick when I'm using it... I get it with 2 and 3, but his 4 just always leaves me frustrated. I think a better option would be to count it as any other melee, or to only make him use it when you're using it and use your 1 on him. - Limited passive usage I really dislike the idea of a passive that has a finite number of uses. I don't think the post-death boosts should be a thing that can be regenerated (players would probably abuse it), but I very much believe the revive should. Either have it on a timer (for example, have one charge regenerate after 5 minutes without dying), or have killing enemies contribute to recharging them. I'm sure there're a ton of other options to implement this, just please have a way to get the revives back - passives shouldn't work like that - Knockdowns, knockdowns, knockdowns This isn't really a wukong specific problem as much as it's a problem with warframe overall - the amount of knockdowns is EXTREMLY overwhelming and literally impossible to dodge, especially if you're a melee frame (like wukong is). However, it can be fixed easily in this instance, just make his 3 make you invulnerable to knockdowns. Please. It'd fit with both the theme of the ability and the way it's used in gameplay, and would fix a ton of issues with playing him (the most issues I had with this was in disruption, with how you usually only have few seconds to kill the demolyst, and this valuable time can be taken away from you just because some moas decided to gang up on you, with no way for you to react) - Nullifier vulnerability Again, this is a problem that the entirety of warframe is facing. I think that literally only one frame is affected by nullifiers in a way that is acceptable (Nidus, with his stacks slowly going away). Every other frame has its abilities just straight up deleted, instead of canceled or deleted in a time window. This makes me much less likely to play a ton of frames, especially the ones where you build up some stats over the course of the mission (gara with her 2 + 4 + 1 combo for example), or the ones that depend on the abilities to survive (rhino should just have iron skin disabled inside the bubble instead of instantly deleted). And well, new wukong unfortunately doesn't handle nullifiers in a way that would be balanced (again, like nidus). His clone disappears after you enter the bubble (Either make him not even affected by nullifiers or have him appear again after you leave the bubble), and his 3 gets instantly deleted (I believe a better solution would be to either accelerate the timer going down, or have it drain the armor bonus when inside the bubble. (Also, please look into the nullifying aura that demolysts have, it disabling exalted weapons or deleting stuff like iron skin feels just straight up unfair. I think it should only work on abilities that limit its mobility, so that they can't be stopped) - Melee Combos YET AGAIN, it's a problem with melee 2.9 overall, but I really think that gun switching instead of blocking/channeling was a bad decision, and affects wukong's combos negatively. PLEASE just replace it with instant switch between weapon without the animation, this way switching will still be much more fluid, but the combos will no longer be hella clunky, automatic blocking won't fuck over entire weapon classes, and quick melee will be back (pls my volt wants his polearms back)"
37,vulnerability,Warframe,[WARFRAME FEEDBACK &amp; SUGGESTION] Atlas: Rocky Brawler,9,c3ivzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/c3ivzj/warframe_feedback_suggestion_atlas_rocky_brawler/,2019-06-22 10:33:27," **OVERVIEW** There has been a lot of talk around Atlas's mediocrity, but so far I have seen the potential Atlas has as a tank and as an offensive CQC Warframe. However, there are some issues I do notice when it comes to a half of his ability kit along with some elements of his recently new added passive. I'd hope to break down what I can say and explain from here on. **POSITIVE FEEDBACK ON ATLAS** * **Passive : Immovable -** I've found this passive to be a bit of a staple for tank-based Warframes could use and on Atlas it has helped immensely against enemies that can initiate a lot of knockdown effects. * **Passive : Rubble -** Being able to gain more Armor gives Atlas a bit of an edge to reduce damage especially with the Rubble Armor passive having a max of 1500 Armor. Having around that amount of Armor can conclude \~80% damage reduction. The Health recovery of the Rubble is also a nice bonus. * **Landslide : The Main Attraction -** This is the ability that highlights Atlas. It has invulnerability during its attack, can scale with some Melee Mods (and even equipped Rivens), and with Path of Statues you can gain Rubble for either Health Recovery or more Armor. This ability alone has the massive potential that makes Atlas viable for some higher end content. * **Tectonics could potentially protect certain objectives -** Has its uses as a protective wall and the ""boulder"" attack portion of it can push away enemies from objectives. Trading off the boulders using Tectonic's Augment allows up to four multiple placements for protection. * **Petrify : an ability effective for Rubble Armor and has a ""loot"" Augment -** Currently one of the more surefire ways to inflict petrification on enemies completely immobilizing them and debuffing trapped enemies with damage vulnerability and a chance to drop Rubbles. The augment comes with both a niche in adding scanned enemies to the Codex and extra loot drop bonus. * **Rumblers are a decent distraction-** A good distraction to draw some enemy attention away from your teammates/objectives. The ability does come with its own 360 degree Petrify and the Rumbler summons can drop Rubble upon death. **NEGATIVE FEEDBACK ON ATLAS** * **A Somewhat trick management of Rubble Armor -** Atlas's Rubble Armor constantly decays over time, and the ONLY way to stall the decay is by collecting Rubble IF it adds Armor points to it (it won't delay the decay if Atlas picks up a Rubble that recovers his Health). * **Tectonics...one size, loosing some purpose -** There has been a lot of suggestions and arguments on the size of the Tectonics which I can understand the reasoning behind it. No matter what, modified Range will only increase the Tectonic's ""boulder"" explosions radius; the size of Tectonics will remain the same. At some points, this is a good thing since negative Range builds won't affect this ability (though this could heavily affect the other 3 abilities), but as an ability seemingly designed for protection it lacks a lot for its purpose. * **Rumblers -** Some players would complain about the low damage these summons can do. I see another major problem all together: the AI. ""AI-based"" Warframe powers have recently no received a good reputation for how wonky they feel to use and with some of them lacking much control for the players to direct them with. **THE SUGGESTION FOR ATLAS** *The most talked about abilities that a lot of players feel adamant on are mostly Tectonics and Rumblers. Usual arguments include how both abilities feel out of place with Atlas's current kit or just not as useful compared to the power Landslide offers and the CC Petrify contains. At any rate, Atlas has always been portrayed as the brawler/boxer Warframe with the power of earth manipulation. Throwing rocks and creating stone constructs are usual staples in earth-manipulating entities, but there are so many other applications this can go.* *In Warframe's current meta state, AI-guided abilities are starting to feel a bit of a wonky usage in the long run. Of course the recent Wukong rework and some companions like ""Venari"" are some special exceptions. Wall-based abilities are useful protecting objectives, but they will need to cover a large enough area to do so.* *So this is what I have suggested for Atlas, and what I will suggest adding to make his Rubble passive a bit more active...* **\[SUGGESTION\] ADDED EFFECT TO ATLAS'S PASSIVE** &gt;*Every step Atlas takes, he draws the earth along with him* * For every **1 m** traveled on the ground, **+15 Armor** is added to Atlas's Rubble Passive **Armor** \[This added Armor by traveling on the ground does **not** recover health. \] {Inspired by mechanics of Volt's Static Discharge passive} *Atlas excels in combat as long as he keeps his feet on the ground. This idea is to ease some of the upkeep of maintaining Armor for Atlas. The Rubble Armor will always decay and only briefly pauses if Atlas does not pick up a Rubble. The downside for this idea is how low his running speed is, but in combat I feel this can still make for a useful addition to the passive.* **LANDSLIDE SUGGESTIONS** *I wont include and changes for this ability as the benefits it has makes it a very useful ability against enemies in CQC. If there is something that could be added as an optional idea:* * **\[OPTIONAL\]** Atlas can hold down Landslide. When released, Atlas lunges forward with a right straight dashing forward to the aimed direction damaging and running through all enemies in his path. This ability can be used to traverse forward long distances. Atlas also adds X Armor per second to his Rubble Armor while charging. {Inspired by Excalbur's Slash Dash mobility and rushing through attack of Rhino's Charge} **TECTONICS SUGGESTIONS** * **\[CHANGING THE EFFECT\]** Activating Tectonics makes Atlas creates a **ring of stone** surrounding himself with a **Range of 10 m** * Maintain Tectonics scaling off Armor and Synergy with Petrify * **\[REMOVE EFFECT\]** Reactivating Tectonics will not create a Boulder, but replaces the Tectonics with a new one * **\[OPTIONAL EFFECT\]** Enemies inside Tectonic's ring receive **200%** more damage from Melee attacks * **\[CHANGE TECTONICS AUGMENT - OPTION 1\]** Tectonics wall has a **XX%** chance to create Rubble each time it is hit by enemy attacks * **\[CHANGE TECTONICS AUGMENT - OPTION 2\]** Atlas gains **XX%** **Movement Speed** and **Casting Speed** for **XX seconds** after casting this ability *I imagined an idea where Atlas...as a boxer/brawler...has the power to create his own ""fighting ring;"" his own special area where he can trap enemies inside and excel with his CQC prowess.* *Having Tectonics be a ring of stone improves the defensive application. A lot of players I have discussed with prefer using Atlas's Tectonics when it comes to his Augment so they can use it to defend multiple positions. While this is suggesting the removal of the ""boulder"" mechanic, you have something that has more ground coverage or one that can be used to trap enemies in and allow other allies to finish them off as well.* **PETRIFY SUGGESTIONS** *The petrification status suffers from preventing any future Status Infliction from occurring, however it is an understandable trade-off for the Damage Vulnerability and the Crowd Control it offers. Petrify is unaffected by Strength Modifications making the Damage Vulnerability a static 50% additional damage bonus.* ***However,*** *compared to Gara's Crystallization effect from Mass Vitrify which has the Damage Vulnerability scale with Strength Modifications, Petrify has the perk of being slightly longer in duration and drops Rubble* ***only*** *if they are killed.* *Enemies will come at players from all angles, and the 60 degree FOV can be seen as a bit of a hindrance to some. Turning Petrify into a 360 degree FoV \[in a similar way how Atlas can petrify enemies activating Rumblers\] is an option, but there may have to be trade offs...* * **\[OPTIONAL CHANGE\]** Reduce Range of Petrify to max Rank 8 m, and increase FoV to 360 degrees. **RUMBLER SUGGESTIONS \[FOR THOSE THAT DON'T WANT THIS AI ABILITY GONE\]** * **\[NEW FUNCTION\]** Atlas first rolls a large boulder infront of himself capturing and dealing damage to them each dragged along its path. Upon collision or after traveling a set distance, the boulder explodes then turns into a giant Rumbler. For each enemy captured by the boulder, the stats/damage of the created Rumbler increases. **OR:** The Rumbler summoned from the boulder has its Health/Damage improved based on **XX%** of the total Health of all captured enemies. * **\[Rumbler Specifics\]** Only one Rumbler can exist at a time. The Rumber is similar to the one of the Titanic Rumbler augment but will have 100% runspeed of a smaller Rumbler. Rumbler explosion radius is slightly increased. * **\[Optional Rumbler Augment\]** Detonating the Rumbler adds XXX Armor to Atlas's Rubble Passive. * **\[Optional Rumbler Augment\]** The Rumbler has a chance to petrify enemies it attacks. * **\[Optional Synergy Option : Rumbler + Tectonic Ring\]** Casting Rumbler from inside Tectonic's ring consumes the ring and improves both the damage of the rolling boulder and the stats of the Rumbler further. *Some discussions I had with players have said they kind of enjoyed the boulder idea, but wished the boulder had more usage for Atlas. For this suggestion, the summoning of Rumbler comes in two stages: First Stage involves rolling the large boulder which collects enemies and takes into account the number of enemies collected. At the Second Stage, the boulder explodes and turns into the golem which has its stats increased based on the number of enemies collected and has some synergy when used inside Tectonics.* *You do lose in having two Rumblers, but the addition of the boulder can give it a chance for that Rumbler to be much more powerful and scale a bit more based on how many enemies are captured by the boulder.* **NEW OPTIONAL FOURTH ABILITY SUGGESTION \[FOR THOSE NO LONGER WANTING AI-BASED ABILITIES\]** **\[New Suggested Ability\]** ***Boulder*** * *Atlas rolls and transforms into a Boulder* ***\[Katamri in Warframe\]*** * ""Boulder Atlas"" has a few seconds vulnerability absorbing damage converted to the Health of this bizarre form of Atlas. This ""Boulder Atlas"" Health/Damage scales with Armor. * The first 6 enemies rolled into by ""Boulder Atlas"" are captured inside the boulder and will receive increasing damage for each meter the bolder traveled. * Rolling into enemies with \[Primary Fire Button\] when ""Boulder Atlas"" captures the maximum enemies will ragdoll and deal damage. * \[Primary Fire Button\] pushed ""Boulder Atlas"" toward the aimed direction. \[Aim/Zoom Button\] causes the ""Boulder Atlas"" to slam down to the ground dealing AOE Blast damage if the boulder is in mid-air. \[Jump Button\] can cause ""Boulder Atlas"" to jump at large heights. * The Boulder's damage stacks for each enemy hit, but the damage stacks decays in small increments * Captured enemies killed in ""Boulder Atlas"" will simply jettison out of the boulder leaving a spot for it to capture another enemy * **\[Synergy with Tectonics\]** Activating Tectonics in Boulder state will cancel the boulder state but create a stronger stone ring. Surviving enemies captured by the boulder will remain inside the Tectonic Ring this way. * ""Boulder Atlas"" ends when its Health reaches 0 or when deactivating the ability \[Note: ""Boulder Atlas"" is considered a separate entity. After the Health of the boulder reaches 0, Atlas revers to his usual self with the Health prior to activating this ability\] *This is just a fun suggestion. I feel this is possible to make and can be both extremely unique and fun to actually have a ""Katamair"" like function in Warframe. You can use this to capture more troublesome enemies and make them receive continuous damage inside while you roll around the battlefield ragdolling and knocking away other enemies like pinballs in a bowling alley. This is just an optional idea.* **ADDITIONAL COMMENTS** * **{Giving Atlas a ""Valkyr Prolonged Paralysis \[Augment\]"" like ability}** This came to mind an idea where Atlas can even control the ground enemies stood on with his earth powers. I wanted to present the idea of a conical version of this ability, but this one would also damage enemies as they are slowly pulled toward Atlas's direction setting up for either Rumbler/Boulder tactics of a row for Landslide. I didn't have time to come up with a balanced version for this however. * **{New Petrify idea: Petrify Charges}** This was to make the status Petrify a charge-like effect. Enemies Petrified are given a set amount of charges. Each time they are hit by attacks consumes a charge and each charge consumes decreases the Status Immunity of petrify. I felt this would complicate things however. * **{Special Dodge Roll : Boxer Side Steps, Boxer Shoulder Tackle}** This was an idea to have side-rolling make Atlas side step like a boxer and forward rolling makes Atlas shoulder tackle which forced staggers the colliding enemies it hits. I set this one aside."

I remembered there was some kind of mission you got to play if he takes you down so I waited... fairly patiently... while him and a low level firing squad of corpus worked through 1,320 shields (twice thanks to my sentinel) and 920hp on my volt... with a whopping 15 armor to chew through. Alad made a comment about how my bones would make Zanuka a nice sibling, after the fighting I witnessed I'd be afraid that my skin would break the scalpel. &amp;#x200B; So the mission starts with you, completely unattended by ANY security force, being released from your Corpus restraints. How? Well that's never explained so either A.) Ordis hacked it B.) The restraints were so weak you broke them simply by moving C.) The Corpus intentionally let you go. There's letdown 1. No REAL threat of being dismembered, just a remark and a hollow one at that. How this guy built the first Zanuka I have no idea here. &amp;#x200B; After that you get a bit excited because ""Ok, I've got no weapons, no powers, nothing in my gear wheel. I'll have to be careful to avoid getting spotted or I'm a dead man..."". Yeah, great premise and all, except the enemies are level 14 and pose f-ck all of a threat. Your BULLET JUMPS are an overpowered weapon that should've been banned outright. I was the complete opposite of Solid Snake (Metal Gear anyone? No?) and not a single alarm was raised. So there's letdown 2. (Oh, and also you keep all your mods, so your shields and health that were so hard for Zanuka to get through are all there). &amp;#x200B; AND THEN you just randomly find your weapons scattered around, waiting for you to be picked up. Now if Alad were a sophisticated villain, you'd expect him to LET you do this to toy with you. He knows you don't pose a threat to whatever boss is lying ahead, so go ahead and collect your little toys, right?... except he spends the entire mission BEGGING you to stay, trying to bargain with you like the pathetic shrimp that he is, making it clear that you weren't supposed to escape and he's completely incapable of stopping you from just up and walking tf off his property. Same guy making amalgams on Jupiter ladies and gentlemen, and he wonders why he has no investors. &amp;#x200B; Now, you've gathered all your weapons. This whole time Alad's been begging you to stay. Surely, now that you're fully armed and the green dot that says ""extraction is this way"" has shown up, there MUST be some sort of boss or assassin as a last-ditch-effort to keep you, Alad's recently captured prize, from running away, right? &amp;#x200B; .... &amp;#x200B; Aaaand that's letdown #4. &amp;#x200B; HOW TO IMPROVE THIS. I'll say this much, the bones of this mission are enough to make its own profitable game out of, so imagine this... &amp;#x200B; After an \*actually difficult\* fight with the Zanuka hunter, you wake up strapped against a vertical examination table in a room filled with Corpus troops manning different computer stations, with a few nullifiers and other guards in the room. You strain against the energy holding you down, but to no avail. Alad V, Zanuka at his side, stands before you. He taunts you, tells you you're all alone, and then leaves giving the order to ""wear you down"". After all, it'd be a shame if that precious flesh of yours came to harm struggling on the vivisection platform. ""Come now Zanuka, we have other business to attend to..."". A corpus sends a command on a computer, your warframe seizes from a high voltage current, and you black out. &amp;#x200B; Gunfire. Cestras. Gorgons. ""GRINEER POWAH!!"". ""Corpus skoom..."" ""ATTAAAAACK!!"". Your eyes open to see a Grineer butcher ready to strike. You look to the side, bracing for the hit, and the blade comes down on your restraints. You look back to him and he prepares for another blow, this time freeing your other arm. Looking down you see that your feet have already been freed, so you step down and the camera returns to its usual position over your shoulder, the butcher joining his comrades in assaulting the enemy. &amp;#x200B; Ordis: ""Operator! I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting, it took time to convince \*thhhhhese self-righteous fools....\* the Grineer to come to your aid. But don't worry! Just find your weapons and get to extraction. Ordis will be ready and waiting!"" You of course then proceed to go through the map looking for your scattered weapons. Each of these is kept in the same sort of room as you would find holding key intel in a spy mission, requiring some parkour to retrieve. Enemies are still fairly low level (you lost to the f-cking Zanuka hunter after all), but they're numerous enough to at least make you appreciate the Grineer following you up wherever you go. (Don't worry, tripping lasers will sound an alarm but your weapons won't be destroyed). Ordis at some point informs you that your warframe appears to be affected by an emergency inhibitor preventing the use of your abilities, and Alad V angrily taunts you throughout the mission. ""I see your \*friends\* have decided to come for you after all... but no matter! Soon you'll be another pile of \*scrap\* on the floor. Such a shame, a prime specimen like you would have done \*so well\* as part of my... little project."". &amp;#x200B; Eventually you find all of your weapons and get to the green dot for extraction. But wait! Your orbiter can't come in for landing yet. Four anti-air turrets surround the extraction point, and they'll need to be taken out before the orbiter can approach. These are all guarded by various corpus troops, but nothing a well-armed tenno can't handle (with a mk-1 paris, a lato, a bo, and no mods. Because you lost to the f-cking Zanuka hunter.). &amp;#x200B; Should you at any point die during this mission, because we don't want you actually losing your warframe, any materials/credits/other rewards you've found will be lost but in the end you'll wake back up on your orbiter, having been saved by the Grineer. That said though, as you HAVE just epically failed twice in a row, the Grineer have taken advantage of your vulnerability and given you the same Grustrag bolt you would've had if the G3 had taken you down in the first place. This bolt is NOT applied should you complete the mission successfully, and win or lose Ordis explains afterwords that the rewards from your FIRST mission (when you initially lost to the f-cking Zanuka hunter), were used to bribe the Grineer into coming for you, and he gives you a release for whichever inhibitor you still have (be it the ability suppressing one from the mission or the Grustrag bolt). Ordis understands that it is a terrible inconvenience, but all is worth it to ensure the safety of the operator. Thank goodness that you're still in good health. :)"

Ability duration: 5/7/9/12s (affected by duration) Damage reduction: 2/3/4/6% per razorfly (affected by strength, capped at 8%) Damage buff duration: 10/15/20/25s (scales with duration) *since Tribute is now part of her passive, a new ability had to take its place. Divije protection will help Titania's survivability while also giving the player a playstyle choice: utility or protection? 3rd ability: Enchantment Titania generates a field of fairy energy. All enemy in this field are slowly getting more vulnerable to incoming damage. All lanterns in the field has 2x more chances to drop additionnal loot when being damaged. AOE range: 5/7/10/15 ^2m^2 (affected by range) Field duration: 10/12/15/20s (affected by duration) Initial damage vulnerability: 5% Damage vulnerability scaling: 1+ nb of enemies x 0.2(affected by strength) %/s *titania creates a square field in front of her to help her and her team to deal more damage. This will help her razorwing to scale and would synergize well with lantern and her razorflies 4th ability: Razorwing Titania shrinks and reveals her true form, summoning her poweful dex pixia and diwata. While in this state, Titania boosts her razorflies' abilities, healing them overtime and granting them additionnal speed. Razor wing healing: 5/10/25/100 hp/s Razorwing movement speed boost: 300% No change to other stats. Dex pixia: no change Diwata: +4 more base range Each hit has 5 instances of damage Reduced amound of hits needed for combo counter to go up by 60% *razorwing now follows the same control as my previous archwing 3.0 concept (link:URL Since Razorfly spawns was moved to her passive, the razorflies dont need to spawn on cast, but I wanted to make this ability feel like a full power mode. This is why razoflies sees a massive jump in power. The massive razorfly buff, tribute buffs and enchantment are all means to make her achieve this power fantasy. Additionnaly, I made several changes to her Diwata to make it more usefull."

42,vulnerability,Warframe,Wisp needs changes to fit her intended playstyle,0,btsk38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/btsk38/wisp_needs_changes_to_fit_her_intended_playstyle/,2019-05-28 08:55:21,"When I saw the Wisp trailer, I was pretty thrilled with the playstyle that she seemed to offer: an interesting balance of utility, stealth-based survivability, and respectable small-AoE damage (compared to the likes of Saryn/Mesa). So far, she delivers on the former two. That, together with her VFX and smooth movement have made her a very satisfying frame to play regardless of her lack of ability damage. It's disheartening though, to see her most expensive and flashy abilities doing chip damage on mid-to-high level enemies. Here are my suggestions, based on my interpretation of what the abilities were intended to do. To me, Breach Surge looks like it ought to be a crowd-melting ability that would synergize well with rapid fire, DOT procs, explosives, and punch-through. The intention is to use damage against one target to melt other targets nearby. However, besides the visually fun aspect of turning opponents into sparklers, the ability doesn't perform to that intention for a couple of reasons. The first issue is that ""damage dealt"" is post-mitigation, which means any damage reduction from armor will also reduce the damage dealt by sparks. Against a level 100 elite lancer (\~90% DR), your surge sparks will deal (1/5 \* Power Strength) of the original damage. Even with a full damage build, that only gets to around 3/5 of the original damage. If the multiplier was switched to be pre-mitigation damage, this ability would be much more viable. The second issue is that all damage is converted to radiation, which is more of a late-game-specific problem. Status procs and faction elemental weaknesses are key to killing high-level enemies, so dealing only radiation damage, even if it's multiplied 2x-6x, is not going to clear crowds very effectively if your weapon relies on status procs. If the sparks had the same damage type distribution as the damage that spawned them, they would be much more versatile and late-game viable. &amp;#x200B; The problem with Sol Gate is much more straightforward. With 300% power strength and all your mote buffs, you're dealing 4500 Damage on a one-second tick. There are weapons in this game that deal 50k-100k DPS. Weapons should not outpace the Sun when it comes to melting things. Oddly enough, the beam is much more effective when you aim it at the space between enemies, since the beam itself has a large radius, but the center of it will not punch through enemies. Adding about 3 meters of punch-through and reducing the tick rate to .1-.2 seconds will greatly improve the ability's handling. The amount of raw damage buffing necessary is difficult to gauge exactly. Based on simulacrum tests, I think the beam should have a base damage closer to 4000 per second, The ability costs a great deal of energy to maintain, slows Wisp down considerably, and keeps her visible, making her very vulnerable. The corrosive procs help take down Grineer, but otherwise, Wisp is counting on raw DPS and fire procs. Additionally, the fact that she has to acquire targets and aim in the midst of a massive light show (as well as the usual cluster-fuck that is Warframe combat) makes the ability more difficult to use than Maim or Miasma; therefore, it would ideally be more effective due to requiring additional effort. &amp;#x200B; TLDR: Breach Surge should be useful for more than just the CC &amp; melee stealth damage bonus, and Sol Gate should have a power level more proportional to the energy drain and vulnerability it imposes on Wisp."
43,vulnerability,Warframe,My idea for an ember rework,0,bwnirc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/bwnirc/my_idea_for_an_ember_rework/,2019-06-04 21:17:32,"Overall goal with this version of ember: The intention here is to create a stack-based frame similar to nidus (mutation) or garuda (damage). The idea being that every kill (through either abilities or guns under the effect of her 2) builds towards her stacks of ""supernova (working name)"". This is also less about ""starting fires"" and more about ""becoming fire"" Passive: supernova When ember kills with either her abilities or her weapons under the effects of accelerant , she gains stacks of supernova. Supernova is displayed as a counter above the abilities menu. The amount of supernova added per kill is based on the HP of the enemy killed (multiplier affected by ability strength, has to be a tiny percent, as enemy health can get crazy fast at high levels. diminishing returns?), this decays over time, more when ember hasn't got any kills, the amount it decays is based on a percent of total damage/s. Supernova deals continuous damage and has a chance to cause a fire proc (based on power strength). Ticks are every 0.2s. range is the same as ember's old 4's after it ramps up, as it stops ember from being able to just afk on a defense objective. This is inspired by Liliet's ability ""phoenix"" from borderlands 1. Ability 1: Napalm shield (crappy name, needs to be renamed by someone who's good at naming) Ember puts up a shield of fire in front of her, melting bullets/projectiles that go through it, reducing their damage by 90%. the range is a base 180 degrees, scaling with range, so that ember can cover 360 degrees with the right build. This causes a guaranteed heat proc for those it touches, does damage that scales with \[strength\] and NOT \[supernova stacks\] (not meant for damage, just survivability/mild cc. Base duration of 30s. Like a combination of Baruuk's 1 and Zephyr's 3. Ability 2: Accelerant Same as usual in terms of adding heat damage, but it no longer adds a heat vulnerability, as the damage from ember's passive should be enough. The new purpose of this ability is to aid ember in adding stacks to her passive, with a little extra heat damage on the side. Ability 3: Fire Blast Same as usual, but now it scales off of ember's passive. the damage done is: \[supernova stack\] x \[ability strength\]. pretty simple. Ability 4: Exalted FLAMETHROWER Ember forgoes regular weaponry and uses her hand as a flamethrower (shoots fire from her palm). It's damage is \[supernova stack\] x \[ability strength\]. the wideness and length of the cone of fire that she fires is based on range. Base 15 degrees, 10 meters. Works similar to Ivara's artemis bow in the way that it only consumes energy when it's being fired. The energy drain on this should be extreme (a base 25/s?), as it would deal a lot of damage. Can use alt-fire to use both hands to double the cost to a staggering 50/s and double the damage. &amp;#x200B; I'd be happy to take feedback into consideration. But overall I'd like to know people's thoughts on the idea of stacking damage with ember."
44,vulnerability,Warframe,Yet another Ember Rework idea,0,by0kke,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/by0kke/yet_another_ember_rework_idea/,2019-06-08 08:11:33,"Ember needs an identity. Something thats the thing she does. Damage cant be her identity, this is a game about doing damage. Everyone does damage. World On Fire, her somewhat archetypal identity of nothing is safe, everything is taking damage everywhere is just done so much better by Saryn. And thats fine, Saryn is an epidemic, spreading damage -should- be her thing, but that leaves Ember lacking in her own identity. So how about Everything burns. Just turn up the heat more.. Make her the near-infinitely scaling damage dealer. As long as you have energy, your damage will ramp up until it does the job. Passive - Immolation - Every time an enemy is hit by one of Embers abilities, it receives a stacking debuff increasing the damage of her abilities on that target and the damage they take from Heat procs. No limit (or some absurdly high limit) to number of stacks. 1 - Fireball - Launch a ball of fire at an enemy. Hold the button down to rapidly launch three (more?) consecutive balls of fire, at an increased (though not tripled) energy cost. Has a small-medium explosion radius. -Ranged damage, as well as a way to rapidly stack Immolation on single (or several tightly-packed) targets. 2 - Accelerant - All nearby enemies suffering from Heat procs have the duration of the proc extended and are dealt damage. Accelerant adds double the usual number of stacks of Immolation. -Manifests as a plume of flame jetting up from the ground at each victim, for clarity of which targets are being affected. Augment changed to - Fuel For The Flame - Enemies killed by Accelerants damage drop an energy orb. -The ability is meant to ramp up the damage vulnerability on them, not to nuke them, so if that aspect is wasted, at least it generates some energy so you can redirect that effort elsewhere. 3 - Fire Blast (or some better name) - A ring of flame rapidly expands around Ember, dealing damage to those through whom it passes. The curtain of flame lingers at the edge of the radius. Within the ring the ground is on fire, like that left by napalm. Shooting through the ring from within adds heat damage and very small explosions (or punch-through if this isnt able to be coded?) to allies shooting. -A point-defense option, the offensive counterpart to Frosts more defensive Snow Globe; enemies within the radius are continuously burned rather than slowed, enemies outside the radius are killed more quickly rather than having their shots blocked. 4 - Phoenixs Form - Drains energy per second. Surrounds Ember in an aura of fire damage and reduction to shooting damage inflicted on her (on any ally in the aura?). The strength of both effects (and radius of the aura?) increases the more stacks of her passive she inflicts while the ability is active (also increase energy cost?). While active Ember can not bullet jump or sprint (to prevent her just running all over the map doing damage, because thats Nezha). When the ability is ended (even if due to Embers death), projects a wave of flame outward at double the auras radius, with damage based on the strength of the aura at the time it ended. Augment changed to - Flare Eruption - While active, seeking tendrils of fire also randomly tag enemies outside of the radius (similar to the sparks from Wisps Breach Surge). Thoughts?"

I brought a Prisma Angstrum. I shot zero containers because the projectiles could not catch up to the thermia container. 3) Really don't let the coolant raknoids get anywhere near the Exploiter Orb. A single coolant raknoid can reset at least a third of the heat meter. 4) Coolant Raknoids seem to be immune to Rhino Stomp so check (chek?) your CC abilities actually work before you commit to a loadout. Other than that - the Exploiter is about as complicated as the Teralyst: She's a big, invulnerable boss and you earn vulnerability periods by spending some time performing a task, in this case splashing her with lava, but there's a mitigation mechanic (coolant raknoids) which you can interrupt via the medium of bullets. Good luck out there my fellow Tenno. May your runs be fruitful."
48,vulnerability,Warframe,Where to go from the Exploiter Orb: Further evolving Warframes Bossfights.,24,b1j3lk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/b1j3lk/where_to_go_from_the_exploiter_orb_further/,2019-03-16 06:28:57,"#Forward: There are going to be some criticisms here, but don't take it as me disliking the fight. The exploiter orb was simply the first step on the road to bringing Warframe boss battles up to being genuinely good. Now we finally have a boss which has a somewhat interesting path to killing them, where our own ability determines how often and strongly it is vulnerable to us. However, there are some ways this boss hasn't really evolved the warframe boss formula, namely how its attacks play out. Attacks are still slow, isolated, and do not flow very naturally. This is to say: Even if the bosses wanted to be aggressive, they are often too slow to be able to remain aggressive. What I am getting at is simple: The way bosses attack players in warframe tend to be fairly slow, extremely high commitment, and bounce between being too simple to dodge, or too hitscan to dodge. #Where too look part 1: Boss Multitasking. Most bosses only take a single action at any given time, which means the majority of the time is spent doing things which might only threaten one player, and given a bosses attack does successfully put one player in danger, the boss might switch targets and not finish someone off. To use the exploiter as an example: This means that when the exploiter fires its cannon artillery, it spends seven seconds aiming its cannon, then ten seconds pass as the artillery shell falls back down, and then a 5m area somewhere in the large open world explodes. During this time, the exploiter orb does little to defend itself against closer in targets. **Where can this improve?:** Start blending in the windup animations for big attacks into secondary animations/effects that serve as a visual warning while the boss takes other actions. This way, a boss can put pressure on players with its light attacks while it prepares a big attack, and once the big attack is ready, the animation can play through quickly, to prevent the fight from having windows where nothing is happening, while also providing players with *sufficient warning* that a big attack is coming such that big attacks being brief would not be awful. This would make bosses feel more dynamic to try and survive fighting. #Area of improvement 2: Better ""Light"" attacks for bosses. Many bosses lack attacks which are light or low commitment entirely, and others have fairly lackluster light attacks. More often then not, the boss uses a pre-canned big attack with a long recovery, move around for a bit, then use another big attack with a long recovery. This also feeds into some bosses (The eidolons, Sagas Ruk, ETC,) feeling very slow, and spending longer then they should almost totally idle. Others have some hitscan attack that is either not damaging enough to be worth taking cover against, or it isn't something you can avoid when you get caught in range of it at all. This is better then nothing, but it is still an attack that feels almost like nothing is happening, other then your healthbar possibly playing pong on certain tank builds. **How it could be better:** Light attacks should be meatier, trying to zone, disrupt, or stun players in defense of the boss. These secondary attacks should be made as frequent as they can justifiably be made to, ***and they should primarily fall into the category of being snappy punish to a player being too cocky, or an avoidable but aggressive attack that puts pressure down on players whom are playing it safe.*** The targeted punish style of attack make the most sense (But should not exclusively be) as a melee hit, say, if an Edidolon has you resting near its shins, it might quickly just kick you over to the next hill because you made it too easy. Sagras Ruk's flamethrower sweep attacks could also be made faster, and also serve as a response to the player staying greedily close. Lastly, bosses might perform a snappy snipe move on players who stay far away, but remain near totally still, as a final flavor of a ""Punish."" This might take the form of a quick elemental-opticor like attack for some bosses like Sagras Ruk, and the latest orb mother. With this style of attack, you could even add in ways for players to exploit them being used, such that with good aim of one shield zone, and a timed melee strike, you could send this attack flying back to hit something somewhere. The pressure type attacks would make sense as giving auto cannon attacks a slightly lower velocity, but giving them some blast radius. **These attacks should not feel hitscan,** *but should be dangerous enough to make players want to close in, or retreat, depending on the bosses preferred engagement range.* #Area of improvement 3: The scope of attacks and their effects. Many big attacks have a long windup, and have cool concepts, but hit tiny areas in relation to their announcing moves. See the howitzer attack the exploiter orb, it hits a tiny area relative to the massive open world you fight it in, and comes out infrequently enough that it basically loses its threat. Say, if this howitzer was used to shotgun areas in-between players and their objectives, to try and prevent players from approaching the baby coolant spiders, it could be a very interesting attack: Forcing players to navigate through a field of explosions in order to collect the coolant they need to win. Other attacks, such as the big old wall of fire hit a big area, but are completely non threatening crowd control attacks that just ask you to wait 20 seconds for something to happen. The big nova flavor of big attacks should instead be dangerous sources of status effects that ask players to wait less, and risk more. ***It should put the player in danger of being downed by a follow up, and not be a time waster.*** #Area of improvement 4: Statuses on players, and improved player interactivity with them. - **Knockback is non interactive,** but it could be made interesting, by giving players button inputs to escape certain flavors of being knocked around: Rolling when you hit the ground should end being knocked down, and jumping when you get hit by a large blast should let you escape the inability to act when you are launched by explosives. - *Cold* is completely non-interactive soft crowd control, but it could be much more. If cold had a greater effect on rate of fire, greatly increased player impact damage taken, and a lesser effect on players ability to dodge or move around, as this would instead be an interesting, interactive way to add threat to specific boss attacks: By putting the player on the defensive, and giving the boss initiative without making the players actions feel ""Bad."" - Fire and Toxin damage might add a Pierce, and Slash damage vulnerability respectively. Once again giving elemental boss attacks a chance to make otherwise non-threatening basic attacks into something to be feared. - Electric statuses could instead serve to reduce the window on knockback/launch type animation cancels, and make bosses more capable of cornering players. #Area of improvement 5: Better environment hazards. Bosses are often fought in unique rooms with lots of machinery that could be played up as hazardous and dangerous. Let them use the environment to make the room more stressful, dangerous, pressuring, and high stakes to fight them. The Thermia fissures in the orb mother fight are one such example of an environmental hazard that could be made great: Say it was not safe to approach them without having coolant on your person, and that you would be set ablaze passing through them. The last point established that fire could make you vunerable to pierce, and the orb mother could attempt to use sniper style light attack aggressively to try and knock out players whom carelessly set themselves ablaze on the environment. This would increase the stakes of a fight contextually, and make the fight much more intense. (Especially if more of her attacks made fissures spawn.) **However,** I do need to admit, the Hydrolyst actually does this reasonably well, as it can use environmental AOE's to great effect to try and put you in a bad spot. #Closing out. I would like to thank DE for adding a boss with a skill based approach to exposing its vulnerabilities, and I hope that more bosses from the distant past could be reworked to integrate this. At the same time, I hope you too can see that most bosses aggressiveness needs some work, and that speed is what is needed to make it so well balanced attacks have the ability to feel dangerous without being overdone."
49,vulnerability,Warframe,Hildryn gives me buyer's remorse.,0,b2a2m3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/b2a2m3/hildryn_gives_me_buyers_remorse/,2019-03-18 08:11:36,"Greetings Tenno, been awhile, I know. Since I decided to ~~take a break from Bungie's version of a particular MCU movie as a live event~~ see what all the raving about Hildryn was about, I decided to liquidate my inventory of Sculptures and acquire Hildryn. Thru ~~the benefit of having a 50% plat coupon and $10 saved on my Steam account~~ the diligence of trading valuable items to other Tenno, I was able to ~~play into DE's business model~~ have enough plat to buy Hildryn directly instead ~~desire to kill myself thru the rep grind of Vox Solaris~~ of wait several possible weeks to grind for her via farming. And while Hildryn is a very nice looking Warframe, various issues come to play in regards to how she functions in game. Specifically, she is **perfectly useless against an entire faction in the game.** Yes, I understand that she's the Shield equivalent of Inaros and Nidus, but [as I've stated in the past,](URL Shield Tanking is *literally* the worst form of survivability in the game. Slash bypasses shields, and has the best physical damage output. Toxic bypasses shields, and while you can mitigate against procs via Arcanes, the damage component of said damage still passes thru, mostly insta-killing Hildryn. By testing this in the Simulacrum, Hildryn has such an abyssal means of attacking and surviving damage from Invested that there is no reason to use her in said content. Now, I know people will instantly state ""she was meant for Fortuna, not for the Infested!"" Ok, I understand that. But what about future content, or just taking her along in Sorties (which *will* have unique elemental modifiers with enemies)? Even in situations with Ember or Mag where enemies can dump a ton of damage at once do they still have avenues to come out alive. Hildryn has *none* of this. If she takes damage on her shields, she has a 3s window with an Invincibility Phase to get [some](URL of it back, which even then can still be bypassed afterwords if enemies are doing the right kind of damage. I don't think I would be nearly as upset about this if it wasn't for the fact that the grind is extremely long for her parts to begin with. Or, the fact that this is the 3rd Warframe that's been released where DE has stripped a core component of gameplay to create a 'new gimmick'. It quickly falls apart the moment you see that there are fundamental flaws in how shields mitigate damage, and how unfun the Warframe becomes when you try to use it outside of the 'intended purposes'. For a game that gives us excellent options in customization, Hildryn feels like a step backward. Nidus and Inaros don't have this restriction in gameplay, but this Warframe feels like it does. If there were more options to give her a better buffer from the damage of her greatest vulnerability, this would be fine. But even with Adaptation, you can instantly die from Toxic/Slash if they alpha against you before the proc. Overall, this Warframe *really* does not feel worth the investment, be it either thru time and/or money. There are instants where she can be very dominating in a mission, but the inherent weakness with shields means she can be struck down very quickly. She feels like a gimmick, and not having options to improve her viability due to the removal of a core game mechanic is fairly upsetting."

Roar boosts 50% damage output off the bat while enemies marked by Blazing Chakram get damage vulnerability by 100% Both abilities are affected by ability strength. If for example, Nezha and Rhino both having 200%, would one be dealing more damage than the other for like, simply firing their primary at enemies? Thanks! URL URL"
51,vulnerability,Warframe,The Problem With Limbo,6,b2ps7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/b2ps7d/the_problem_with_limbo/,2019-03-19 10:31:34,"This isn't your typical Limbo post, because this is not coming from someone who had a Limbo leech in a public match or hates playing with him in the squad. I am one of those Limbo players (hopefully not leeching or trolling), and I make this post to point out how desperately in need of a review Limbo is. Theoretically his abilities are fine, my issue is in the execution. It seems that what can cross the rift is on a giant list that DE updates when they add new stuff, but they miss things. For instance, the Saturn Six fugitives are strangely armed with molotov grenades that pierce the void magic and burn him to a crisp. I suspect that the technology for these improvised weapons comes from the Kuva Fortress, where the traps have a similar effect on Limbo. The orb Vallis is a dangerous place for the top hat tipping frame as well, since the various large raknoids and re-skinned bosses pay no mind to the Cataclysm that has frozen their allies. They simply chug on and hunt the well dressed rift-walker down. I like Limbo, a lot, and I'm sure that I am not alone here. But I can't play him as much as I used to because of this issue. I was thrilled with the update, and Stasis, while flawed at first, was an exciting change. The way it *should* work now is, in my opinion, perfect. So what does Limbo need? Allow me to go through his abilities and make some suggestions. ###The Passive### Limbo can roll to enter or leave the rift. Great! I must admit that I was skeptical of the change at first, but it has become so fluid and intuitive that I now realize it is completely superior to the previous method of entering the rift, and with no duration limitations no less! Then there is the energy generation (that they kept) and 10 energy per kill on enemies in the rift, amazing! My only suggestion is to make this a state for Limbo, so that he will not leave the rift upon closing or leaving his Cataclysm. At high levels, the split second of vulnerability is all it takes to down him. Either that or an invulnerability grace period. Also I request that the only thing that can transcend the rift is void magic, or warframe abilities. In the future if DE wants to implement enemies that have a lore reason for damaging through the rift, then I'm all for it. As of now, there aren't any (maybe &gt;!Stalker?!&lt;) ###Banish This is where I start to disagree with some of the changes, but hear me out. Previously, Limbo could cast Banish to send a target to or from the rift, no matter which state he was in at the time. (I think, it has been a while but I'm pretty sure that's how it used to work) Now, Limbo must be out of the rift, to send them to the rift, or in the rift to send them out. An issue arises here, Limbo cannot safely draw his targets into the rift without using Cataclysm. This is more energy costly and covers a wider area, which may inconvenience Limbo or his allies. My suggested change is a tap of the ability key to banish and a hold to unbanish (maybe even purge all enemies in the rift?), no matter which plane Limbo is in. ###Stasis This one is almost perfect now! It no longer freezes allied projectiles and still holds enemy projectiles. My one complaint is that there are non-boss enemies that ignore Stasis. Jackals, Hyenas, Scyto and Kyta raknoids, Raptors, non-boss Ambulas, and probably others that I have forgotten or simply haven't encountered are on this list. The re-skinned bosses I am sure are on this list because the coding that protects them as bosses has not been disabled for those that fall out of the sky in the Vallis. The medium raknoids are there for reasons I do not understand however. Limbo has never been the frame that abuses his agility to overcome his foes, but his unique access to the rift. Being unable to freeze these literal walking tanks *as well as their projectiles* means that you are no longer playing Limbo, now you're playing a warframe with no relevant abilities. Kela and the Jackal bossfight allow Limbo a compromise; you can't stop the boss, but you can stop their missiles and bullets. I feel that he should get this compromise at the very least, but I firmly believe that enemies that aren't bosses should be frozen. Conculysts and Battalysts get frozen, but I guess the Corpus are better at making combat drones. ###Rift Surge### This is an ability that I do not like. Old Limbo got a boring damage steroid, but now he gets a tricky auto-banish that can cause you to go down unless you are paying absolutely perfect attention. Say that you cast this ability on a group of enemies on the edge of Cataclysm, and one dies from advancing forward as the bubble shrinks (this happens pretty often, even at high levels) due to constantly re-entering the rift. Now his allies are also banished, and probably under the effects of stasis as well (if they even can be). Great! No. Close your Cataclysm and be on your merry way to extraction, the next excavator, mobile defense target, etc., but now you are being shot. You failed to count every enemy that was automatically banished by Rift Surge. ""Just keep Stasis up all the time."" Maybe they're not enemies that care about Stasis, or maybe it expired for a moment, or maybe spamming Stasis is a band-aid for an ability that was just sort of slapped on to Limbo without much thought. He already has two far more controllable ways to bring enemies in and out of the rift, he does not need a third. The augment for this ability gives Limbo a lot of damage, but that is what it more or less did before. Now it eats a mod slot for an ability that might kill you because you weren't counting the enemies that got banished. My above suggestion for purging enemies from the rift could fix this, but fat chance of any of this being implemented. If not a reasonable change, maybe a new ability? A mark that makes enemies more susceptible to damage? Maybe Limbo steals their armor, shields and/or health? Maybe some other ability that is better than anything I can come up with? Until then, I'm just going to pretend that Limbo doesn't have a third ability. ###Cataclysm Awesome! I really like this one, it is very customizable. Want a tiny bubble that lasts a long time for mobile defense, so the nullifiers have to get really close to pop it? Can do! Want a HUGE bubble to banish everything? Go for it! Just want to pop open all the crates in your zip code and hunt for ayatans or syndicate medallions? Wish granted! I really have no suggestions for this one, it's great!"

Her is what I would change to make her more fun and frankly usable: *Passive: Gradually decays so you can maintain the buff more consistently *1: Remove the leap, doing any melee slam attack since melee 2.9 is simply better for mobility and damage. Shift all abilities up, so this is now Blood Altar. The altar now tethers up to X nearby enemies, stripping them of buffs and providing health to nearby allies when they die. Deactivating causes slash vulnerability debuff to those within radius. *2: Now also provides a flat damage reduction as well as the directional shield. No longer able to shoot the shield as this was clunky. *3: Halve charge time, able to walk whilst casting. *4: New ability. Whirlwind AoE that gradually builds up in movement speed, attack speed and energy drain. Killing an enemy restores health. Deactivating once the maximum buff level is achieved causes a wave of slashes procs. "
53,vulnerability,Warframe,Self damage and shield gating,0,bb6jqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/bb6jqe/self_damage_and_shield_gating/,2019-04-09 21:02:44,"Using Khora and her godly venari bodyguard augment just made me realize how desperate we need shield gating. While using the penta or phantasma I would at least blow myself up once every 20 missions, while using Khora though that problem basically became irrelevant, not only that it also mitigated so many oneshots that in my opinion every Khora build needs it. I know that the 4 seconds invulnerability is a lot stronger then simple shield gating, which prevents you from being burst down, but in warframe you dont die because of burst dmg, but against high spike damage from such units as Corrupted bombards and crewmen. What I'm trying to say is that shield gating would basically fix most of the self damage and oneshot issues in the game, giving frames with no outstanding damage mitigation a chance to react, while not changing much in the over all tank meta. The shield gating doesn't even need to have a vulnerability period, just negate the damage so it doesn't overflow to health, though a 0.5s invulnerability period would be nice."

A Magus is the result of around 8000 years of evolution as a result of exposure to a highly transmutable form of radiation known as Magic. It functions similarly to Gamma Radiation, but those who adapt to it become able to transmute it, using it for various purposes. The first Magi ended up leaving into another dimension, taking Magic with them. The most powerful lose their Human forms and become deities in terms of ability. Normal Magi retain a humanoid appearance, but they tend to develop light fur around the body due to leftover simian DNA activating. I'd go into more detail but that'd be rambling. "

The combination of survivability, extreme mobility, team value in Reaping Chakram/vulnerability application/strong CC, and hilarious accidental teleports has made for a really great time. However, I dont understand the way most people choose to build Nezha. I generally see suggestions to run both duration and multiple survivability mods, with some people opting for range as well (range is debatably useful considering how powerful a ~30m Spears can be with just a max stretch). Many builds require 3-4 Forma, which also makes very little sense. Even for level 100+, the most Ive needed to stay alive is a single survivability mod. I think duration is a bit of a waste considering his fast casting time and how easily he generates energy with Chakram/Equilibrium. I guess it can be a matter of play style, but given how spammy he is regardless, duration generally seems a bit overvalued. Personally, I enjoy a single Forma build with HC/Equilibrium (Synth Fiber sentinel)/Streamline/Umbral Intensify/Transient Fortitude/Reaping Chakram/Continuity (just to hang onto base duration)... and thats all he really needs. I have Rolling Guard and Streamlined Form slotted for QoL stuff, but both are unnecessary. Arcane Pulse is just awesome to offset hogging the health orb drops and constantly apply a large aoe heal."

High strength and high duration + Rage/Hunter Adrenaline (you can get around the last part by using energy restores); - The Orb loves magnetic procs. Arcane Nullifier for 100% resistance to them is great; - Since Chroma with two Nullifiers will have no way to heal outsude of periodical heal from Heat Elemental Ward (Heat gives the most EHP, so I recommend it), we pick Vazarin for Protective Dash. It was honestly a godsend. Alternatively, Magus Elevate arcanes can let you run Zenurik for additional energy; - Velocitus seems to be the most ammo-efficient archgun, and deals heavy damage to boot; - During the shield phase, the Orb's vulnerability may be switched at random using Void damage from Operator's Amp/Void Blast/Void Dash. This effect has a 4-second cooldown; - Bring crit or pure damage weapons. Status procs don't work; - A high-range melee weapon can massively help. You can use quick melee with archguns equipped - you can clear out the surrounding Corpus this way and get more archgun ammo (drops from Corpus soldier armed with Fluctus). I used memestrike Atterax, but most polearms would suffice even without MS; - Operator mode should be used extensively to get out of stcky situations/figure out what's happening/move across the battlefield. All in all, the fight may be frustrating (constant staggers/knockdowns from both the Orb and the Corpus), but definitely doable solo."

After taking down the shield the legs become vulnerable but only to Archguns. Thats nice because we all have fully modded Archguns just lying around since they are so much fun and ALL of the mods are easily farmable. And also the archgun deployer has a cooldown of 10 min. 10 MINUTES. Thats not a big deal right?  The Orbs attacks  The orb has huge aoe attacks. Homing missiles, giant blue knockback walls, lasers, aoe discharge and probably a few more. You have to constantly go to the front of the orb to see what damage it is vulnerable now and unless your frame had been bitten by a radioactive raknoid you wont dodge all of those attacks. So you have to tank majority of the hits. That really limits the number of frames you can choose from. But thats okay, we were expecting a meta anyways. Shouldnt be that hard.  The corpus harassment  Well now, youve brought your tanky frames. Your Rhino, Chroma, Inaros and now youre ready for anything. Not so fast, because while youre fighting the orb, horde of corpus enemies will do everything in their disposal to ruin your day. 10s of nullifiers, 2-3 scrambus, some wannabe Vauban trap disposers, some jackals, couple of scyto raknoids and a kyta raknoid dropping its electic net on the ground while doing its best revenant impression. And we also have magnetic proc out of nowhere. So yeah, good luck keeping your buffs up with all these clusterfuck.  Communication with your team  The orbs damage vulnerability can be rolled using your operator but guess what? Everyone will be doing that. So if you use your amp to switch the orbs vulnerability to (lets say) Corrosive, someone in your team will switch it again before you fire two bullets. And realistically there is no way you can type during the fight. So most of the time during the fight youll be doing no damage.  The reward  1 Crisma toroid, 1k Solaris united standing and some other junk (I got a radiant relic, dont know about the others).. TOTALLY WORTH IT. Sarcasm aside, the profit-taker is the worst boss Ive faced in a video game in recent years. I wont call it difficult, it is tedious, repetitive and frustrating. This finally solidifies the claim that DE cant make a decent boss fight. And if this is how every future boss fights will play out, Im not sure I can be that much hyped about railjack and other future updates. Restricting ourselves to a meta is not what makes warframe fun and this fight does this once again. After some hardcore farming after fortuna dropped I took couple of weeks break form Warframe. And now I come to this, an awful boss fights and some new weapons and a new frame which are locked behind the backwards bounty system of vox solaris. And I know there are many players who will be enjoying this update which is fine, I just feel doing all of these isnt really worth it. I will probably come back again later after they fix the stupid cutscene every time before the bounties. Fortuna 2 wasnt what I thought it would be. My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined. "

This is the first time I am posting a concept here. Now I am not a very experienced player (MR 13, playing since 3 months) but the one thing I love the most about Warframe is the abilities. I just got this idea, and I thought I'd present it to the community just for fun. Wanted to know what you guys think of it. - - - #Zaravin **Description:** *""Bounded by the crippled state of his crescent moon, Zaravin feeds on his enemies' souls to restore light to it, and unleash the wrath of the lost beast.""* **Gender:** Male **Theme:** ""Animagus""/werewolf **Role in team:** Buff, with some damage #Abilities ~ **PASSIVE** **Awakening:** ""When Zaravin has more than 10 energy, a moon appears looming far off in the sky. Every enemy killed by Zaravin feeds light to it, until it reaches its final state as a full moon."" **How it works:** 1)A white, holographic moon appears above Zaravin. It need not appear floating above his head like a carrier, and he can make it ""Hold Position"" if he wants. When he leaves the room, the moon follows. 2)Every enemy killed fills light in the moon, making it grow ""fuller"" in size (waxing). 3)*Important--* Every time an enemy is killed, the moon restores % Energy used by Zaravin in that kill distributed to the entire team. (Except for when using Ability #2, as described) 4)Zaravin stars the mission in his ""Day Form"". When the moon reaches its final state, Zaravin can activate Ability #4 and transform into his ""Night Form"", a werewolf. 5)As Nidus transforms according to his mutation stacks, Zaravin gradually develops wolf-like features. - - - ~ **ABILITY 1** **Binding Light:** ""Zaravin propels his moon towards the enemy, aweing them with its light and binding them in their place."" **How it works:** 1)Similar to Mirage's 4th, Zaravin propels the moon towards the enemy. 2)Enemies affected stay in their position until the duration of the ability, staring at the moon. 3)Enemies are open to finishers 4)Every enemy killed by Zaravin in this state consumes 10 Energy from him. Enemies killed by allies do not have energy costs. (Synergy: Point #3 in Passive) - - - ~ **ABILITY 2** **Energy Siphon:** ""Zaravin unleashes his shields to enter a state of vulnerability. All Energy collected in this state counts 1.2x towards the filling of the moon. However, none of this energy is distributed between allies."" **How it works:** 1)Zaravin sacrifices his shields to generate blast procs. A blue aura surrounds him while he is in this ""vulnerable"" state. 2)Shield regen is halted in this state. 3)Energy orbs collected in this state counts 1.2x towards the filling of the moon. 4)In turn, none of his allies are able to reap the benefits of his extra energy that they would otherwise get because of Point #3 in Passive. - - - ~ **ABILITY 3** **Exploding Skies:** ""Zaravin's moon explodes, dealing explosive damage to all enemies with the radius of effect, and returning to crescent state. All allies receive full shields and energy, and are granted a damage boost for 15 seconds.** **How it works:** 1)Zaravin is able to guide the moon with his reticle, and trigger it with a click. 2)When triggered, the moon explodes, dealing blast damage to enemies within radius of effect. 3)The moon returns to its original crescent state. 4)All allies are granted full shields and energy. Zaravin only receives 5% of the total energy and 50% of the total shields restored to allies. 5)All allies and Zaravin himself are granted a damage boost for 15 seconds. - - - ~ **ABILITY 4** **Zaravin's Revenge:** ""Zaravin transforms into a beast of the Void, using his terrifying stare and Moon Claws to unleash wrath upon his enemies.""** **How it works:** 1)Zaravin is able to enter his werewolf state. Aesthetics transform accordingly. 2)Zaravin's eyes glow red, and every enemy stared at is stunned for the number of seconds it was stared at. 3)The moon turns bright red. This is where it can be depleted to deal damage. 4)Exalted Weapon ""Moon Claws"" are wielded by Zaravin in this state. The Moon Claws feed off light from the red moon. 5)As the moon is depleted of energy, some % energy is lost by Zaravin and half of that amount is gained by his allies. 6)When the moon loses all light (crescent but red) it turns the ability off, restoring Zaravin and itself to their original state. - - - Let me know of any corrections/improvements that can be made to this.

She needs more synergy on her powers to generate gore stacks.* **Blood Altar Currently** * Currently as it stands, this ability is a decent heal with a terribly small radius and no benefit to her or her team other than % healing. great for big HP tanks like Inaros and Nidus, middling effectiveness on squisher frames as it provides no additional survivability such as Oberon granting addition armor, Trinity granting flat damage reduction, and so on. **Blood Altar Changes** * First off, increase the radius of the heal. 6 meters is far to small and limiting, especially in the open world locations. A 50% or 100% radius increase is necessary. * Second off, have it add damage to her gore stack. Currently the ability siphons off 1% of the enemies max HP per second when healing. Have this 1% of HP be applied to her gore stack so the damage does not go to waste. This helps relieve the necessity to spam her 1 to build up gore stacks. **Bloodletting Currently** * Sacrafice HP to gain energy. Simple and straight forward but it does too little for a gain of energy in a game were we already have plentiful access to energy gain such as Zenurik, Arcane Energize, energy pizzas, and of course a mod that does the same thing Rage. It also scales terrible with the % of energy gain on HP loss being affected positively by efficiency. As efficiency both reduces the cost of her other abilities while simultaneously granting her more energy on her energy regen ability on a game where energy regen is no longer hard to come by, we have a frame that double dips on efficiency unnecessarily. **Bloodletting Changes** * Have it grant 3 seconds of invulnerability to avoid death to stray shots from behind or DoTs from slash/toxic/heat procs. Currently you could cast this ability while still in the radius of her 2 and die to damage if the HP gain is either not enough, or badly timed and hits you before the heal tick. Too offset spamming this ability for constant invulnerability, have it necessary to lose 20% of Garuda's HP on cost to activate the invulnerability timer. So she can not spam it at 2 HP for it. **Seeking Talons Currently** * 50% global slash proc vulnerability is fairly decent on a forgiving modable timer, but it's scale terribly with mods as she needs 200% power strength to reach 100% chance vulnerability so the power becomes reliable. It also charges fairly slowly and cumbersome. Could use both QoL casting changes, and addition synergy. **Seeking Talons Changes** * Have an option in the settings menu to change casting from hold till release, to press on activate and double press to release. Increase charge speed. * Additional changes could be done to benefit gore stacks. I will add some that can be added either to the 4, or as a passive change. **Garuda's Passive, Death's Gate Currently** * Gain damage increase as your health lowers. The damage increase is based off your current HP, meaning only at low HP will you get a sizable damage buff. Garuda has no way to avoid 1 shots or access to any DR, so being at low HP is undesirable as dying becomes to prevalent and since you pretty much want to be near her 2 at all times, you won't get access to any significant multipliers. **Garuda's Passive, ability change Death's Harvester** ^^^numers ^^^subject ^^^to ^^^change * Enemies who die under the effect of a slash proc within 25 meters of Garuda, grant 1% of their max HP to her Gore Ball. **Reason for passive change** * Currently damage is mostly a none issue in Warframe due to our access to massive amounts of multipliers and obscene weapons. Garuda can already dish out fairly high damage and with greater access to gore stacking it would be unnecessary to buff the damage further. The idea behind the new passive is primarily to give her a way to build up gore stacks after casting her 4 and 1 combo to quickly start building it back up and keep the death going, and to gain gore stacks by simply using weapons or still gain stacks if an ally is murder stomping enemies anyway limiting her access to targets for her 1. If this passive is too strong it could instead be applied only to enemies under the effect of her 4 debuff and innate claw kills. "
67,vulnerability,Warframe,What can increase efficency of your gamestyle what is not so obvious for a beginner?,1,9x1e1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/9x1e1u/what_can_increase_efficency_of_your_gamestyle/,2018-11-15 03:06:15,"A lot of game has some kind of wall, not hidden, but for beginner players often blinded by the many information it is hidden. I have a stupid OCD kind shit in every game I played, not so differently in Warframe too. It is that I only want to use only gold or higher ranked mods (primed, raven, etc.). The problem is Im currently at Neptune and the difficulty of killing a standard enemy is increased meaningfully. For example sometimes I have to spend a whole magazine on a kill (Soma Prime), my abilities barely capable of kill enemies (Rhino Prime) even that they did killed them before, the only hard hitting weapon on that planet is my Helios Prime. Even my Orthos Prime proved underpowered compared to the enemies on Neptune. Im also using a Vasto Prime for its style. This is my mod list (all of them are maxed): RHINO PRIME (30) Power Drift Growing Power Undying Will Fortitude Intensify Streamline Flow Continuity SOMA PRIME (30) Fanged Fusillade Metal Auger Rifle Ammo Mutation Vital Sense VASTO PRIME (30) Steady Hands Seeker ORTHOS PRIME (30) Bleeding Willow Quickening Rending Strike Sundering Strike Energy Channel Heavy Trauma HELIOS PRIME (30) Detect Vulnerability Animal Instinct Assault Mode (bronze) Vacuum (bronze) Regen (bronze) I only use those bronze mods because they are undeletable and without it the Helios dies every time. Is there a big problem I cant see? How can I evolve, become stronger, level up to my enemies? Also looking for any advice on Rhino, I love its style, its abilities, the appaerance, everything, I just feel Im not competing with the evolving enemies. Thank you!"
68,vulnerability,Warframe,All I want for Tennobaum is just a little bit of reassurance,1,a44jug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/a44jug/all_i_want_for_tennobaum_is_just_a_little_bit_of/,2018-12-08 08:55:12,"Ah, the wintery time of year. When things feel a bit chillier and we find other ways to keep ourselves warm on the inside like [Tennobuam](URL Where we mask our [Hate](URL with a little bit of [sweetness](URL for the sake of getting along through the harshest time of the year. And a time for the developers to finally get some rest after another yearlong grind of producing new content, updates, and evolving the game at a breakneck pace! ... But the problem with that kind of pace is that things sometimes, well, break by the end of it. I'm in a reminiscing kind of mood and when it comes to writing I've got a bit of the gift of gab, so here's an early Tennobaum gift from me to you: A gigantic wall of words! Here's a little recap of winter breaks and updates past. ###2012 Dec. 18 through Jan. 2 | 2 (documented?) hotfixes in between [Update 5](URL appropriately dubbed ""The Big One"", was Warframe's biggest Closed Beta update. Excalibur Prime was added to the game, but more importantly so was the structure of the star chart, restructuring of upgrade systems such as mods, the addition of the foundry, the first alert missions, boss enemies, and more. This was before the time I was following Warframe closely and only really tried it through a friend's account. I honestly don't know if there were any significant problems or bugs. There may have been more hotfixes in between the updates (only ones I found were 5.0.1 and 5.0.5). The more notable thing here is that this marks the start of a tradition: Release a big update over the holiday break to end the year with a bang and to give your players a lot of stuff to chew through on their own breaks. ###2013 Dec. 19 through Jan.8 | 8 Hotfixes in between [Update 11.5](URL introduced Oberon and new tile sets for Earth (and an expansions for the Gas City on Jupiter). This was also the launch of the Cicero Crisis event. The first Open Beta winter break update was paired with an event with a long duration. There were a few issues with scoring, public matchmaking, and some technical difficulties, but the major lament expressed by players was the very grdiny nature of the event. The cumbersome nature of scan farming compounded by needing to stock up on a lot of codex scanners, being limited by the 6 hour day/night cycle, and the RNG of getting the plants necessary to craft the toxin injectors to spawn at all. Oh, and they hotfixed in a higher scoring toxin which very quickly invalidated all of the lesser ones. Personally I completely skipped the event because I was only very casually interested in Warframe at the time and the grind seemed a bit too much to me when described by friends playing through it. If you were to search this subreddit or the forums for topics on it, you'll find it wasn't exactly a celebrated event :V *Fun Fact: This was the update they added the aforementioned Spearmint Scythe* ###2014 Dec. 19 through Jan. 8 | 1 Hotfix in between [Update 15.8](URL Enter: Eyes of Blight. The winter break update in which so much went so wrong, DE had to reset leaderboards and then when that wasn't enough, they completely scrapped Clan trophy rewards. To frame things contextually: The Eyes of Blight was an event dedicated to protecting the newly added Relays from the oncoming Balor Fomorian assaults by Vay Hek (*who did nothing wrong*). The Relays were initially added for testing in Hotfix 15.5.3 and shortly after added in Update 15.6. A week later, Update 15.8 launched and the destruction of Relays was underway. Archwing had been released about 2 months prior to this, but was relatively poorly received by the overall comunity (*I fucking loved it though*). Almost immediately it was discovered there were ways to exploit the event's scoring system, even if unintentional, through use of punch through weapons and some archwing abilities. Scores shot up into the billions very quickly. The next day, DE pushed a hotfix and a [PSA that leaderboards were being reset](URL Turns out that didn't fix a lot of the issues. And they weren't particularly new mechanics/interactions of mechanics, so the flood gates kind of opened up and the score boards got bloated with ""exploits"" yet again. At the end of it all, DE posted a [post-mortem](URL and decided the Clan reward trophies would be scrapped  no gold/silver/bronze trophies, just terracotta participation trophies. The event also had issues with host/client consistency, public matchmaking, and was generally off-putting for anyone who hadn't already leveled archwing equipment. The participation system to receive rewards for the event were also very grindy between farming the disruptor parts and actually being able to do damage with your archwing gear. To top it all off, it was very quickly proven that the destruction of the Relays was scripted via [worldstate](URL information. We didn't really have a chance to get familiar or fond with the Relays and they were on rails to be destroyed or not. It felt... deflating. Perhaps the greatest issue was that there were only very short active windows to participate in the event so it could be very easy for someone to miss out on rewards because there were not enough opportunities for them to even participate. ###2015 Dec. 16 through Jan. 5 | 5 Hotfixes in between [Update 18.1](URL took a bit of a step back from the idea of releasing major updates or events to sit while they're away on winter break. Instead, we got a bigger update (The Second Dream) much earlier in the month and many hotfixes to iterate and fix potential problems through the course of the month. Seemingly innocuous, this update started off Sortie Season 2, released Nezha, brought a new deluxe skin (Loki), and a wide variety of cosmetics. Oh, and a minor change for Exterminate mission spawning algorithms to prevent mass group spawns if you rush to the extraction tile. Sounds harmless! Oh boy was it not. The Exterminate change was made in light of recent widespread use due to the very grindy nature of Focus farming and the very lucrative payout of gathering a huge group of enemies to decimate (with a stealth multiplier even) by rushing to extraction within 2 minutes. This change wanted to fix the flow of combat to be closer to what DE had meant Extermination to play like and remove this very glitchy-seeming cluster generation. The problem was that it made many missions impossible to complete. Note: I mean actually impossible. Before this update, if an enemy got bugged out and spawned in terrain or otherwise inaccessible, perhaps through a point of no return on an Invasion type mission, it would simply be moved to a new location later on the mission path. Now it would not despawn. It would not be replaced or moved to a new location. It was there *forever*. These issues were not publicly addressed until [Hotfix 18.2.2](URL and the first actual steps towards fixing it didn't occur until [Update 18.4](URL Note: This did not fully fix the issue and some game modes, such as Archwing Exterminate, remained bugged for an extended period of time (first steps towards fixes taken in [Update: Specters of the Rail](URL Two years and several iterations later, we still have issues with certain tile sets and Extermination missions where you will reach the end before enough enemies are generated to complete the mission. This was also the beginning of a series of balance changes made to the game based on the widespread use of stealth Affinity farming which the community embraced/shared with one another to overcome the very heavy grindy nature of Focus. But that's another topic. ###2016 Dec. 22 through Jan. 11 | 9 Hotfixes in between [Update 19.5](URL brought a new quest: The Glast Gambit. This came with the return of The Index  what was expected to be an event similar to Rathuum and had a preview run, but was repurposed for the quest. Along with Nidus came some more changes to the Riven Mod system with the long-awaited Kuva cycling cost cap, some big Conclave rebalances, and a couple of new weapons. Oh, which weapons? Hirudo and... and... Hema. While there were many issues with The Glast Gambit itself (most nitpickingly the issue with the Alignment system not being properly synced and thus ruining your profile emblem if you were picking responses based on alignment), the Hema takes the spotlight as the issue of this winter break. For those of you unfamiliar with this debacle, the Hema is a Clan research weapon which required an exorbitant, seemingly typo'd, quantity of resources to research. Please note that this kind of issue had happened in the past for *crafting*, not research, and would be corrected. That being said, there was also precedent for changing research costs much later such as the Itzal which was added in Hotfix 15.7.2 and saw undocumented research cost changes in Update Specters of the Rail (increased costs of Oxium and Ferrite dramatically). The way Clan research items are entered into the game files is done at the largest scale, Moon tier (1000 players) and then downscaled from there. For example, if the intention is to have something cost 1 Neurode for a Ghost Clan, it would be entered in the game files as ""100"" not ""1"". Now that being said, here are the research costs of the Hema as seen in game (in case you are unfamiliar): |Resource|Ghost Clan (1x) Quantity Needed| |:--|:--| |Mutagen Sample|5,000| |Plastids|10,000| |Nano Spores|45,000| |Neurodes|50| And here are the multipliers based on Clan size: |Clan Size| Ghost | Shadow | Storm | Mountain | Moon | |:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--| |Research Cost multiplier|1x|3x|10x|30x|100x| *Hope your Mountain Clan is ready to farm 150,000 Mutagen Samples, 10o!* I can, and have, dedicated research and time to other posts and responses going over the reasons why this was a major issue in Warframe. About the scaling, the trend, the responses to it, etc. If you want to read about them to get a better understanding: * [Fun Facts about Mutagen Samples](URL * [Analysis of Resource Costs](URL (includes link to spreadsheet which tracks all crafting/research costs over time... until I stopped bothering around U22.8) * [As a veteran player, I explored an alternative option for the Hema: A new Clan](URL * Or if you're really bored, [literally everything I had to say about the Hema](URL on this sub To put it concisely, this was an issue because the scaling was absolutely absurd as your Clan size went up. A single veteran player may have been able to solo fund the 5k for a Ghost Clan, but the higher your Clan tier goes the harder it is to obviously fund it. This sparked a widescale downsizing of Clans to be able to afford research costs - a similar concern which presented itself when Wukong and the Nitain resource were released and prompted the release of such a downsizing feature to begin with. Mutagen Samples are a very rare resource on the standard star chart and can only be readily farmed in the Orokin Derelicts, where they are still uncommon. The infamous ""raining in the derelicts' phrase from Steve is often cited as a disconnect between developer and player perception. It's not a mission type you can use public matchmaking for, it's relatively disconnected from the rest of the rewards in game, etc. On [The Second Stream Podcast: Episode 8](URL Rebecca shared that the Hema had been purchased via Platinum on the Market about as many times as it had been crafted. She later clarifies that crafting is the more common route in most cases, suggesting that this even spread was an outlier. The worst thing about all of this is that the developers seemingly used the winter break as an excuse not to change it. [Devstream 85](URL iterated that they would not be changed because some Clans had already completed the research. They never specified if any of the larger Clan sizes actually managed to do it... or what percentage of Clans had made decent progress or completed it. [DE]Taylor also [posted an official response](URL that the costs were intentional and here to stay. DE was basically saying that because a handful of people (out of thousands watching) commented on Twitch chat that they were able to complete the research, it would not be adjusted. It remains the worst grind in the game and is why /r/ResearchedHema is a thing. It's not a milestone or accomplishment, it's just a massive hill you have to climb if you're stubborn enough to do so. The easier solution is to just kick people from your Clan to downsize it, join a Ghost Clan to replicate the blueprint and leave, or straight up start your own solo Clan (like the thread I posted above). ###2017 Dec. 21 through Jan. 17..ish | 5 Hotfixes in between *(the ish is because they were back in the office for a while before the U 22.9 launched)* [Update 22.8](URL was a much more relaxed update by comparison. Learning from mistakes of the past, but still wanting to give players something to do over the holidays, DE launched the Ghoul Purge event and made a [news post about why a lot of content was being pushed back until after the break](URL The most groundbreaking features in this update included the operators personal quarters, the ability to invite squad members to your orbiter, increases to decoration capacity, operator animation sets based on Focus schools, and the Ghoul Purge event itself. A few other notable changes include repeating Bounties to gain standing Lech Kril vulnerability phase improvements. However, the Ghoul Purge event had quite a few bugs. Some of which were commonly shared with regular Bounty missions, some of which were new to the units spawning and the rewards (Journal Fragments). It wasn't *too* bad and players were reassured the event would be repeating somewhat often (... maybe too often) so they wouldn't have to burn out grinding journal fragments and other rewards in one go. All in all, a rather tame and enjoyable bit of stuff to play with over the winter break. Unfortunately, there were a couple of oversights which caused bigger problems. Well, one in particular... Eidolon hunting was impacted by the Ghoul Purge because ghoul unit spawns were competing with and taking over Vomvalyst spawns. It became very, very tedious and took way too long to charge up a single Eidolon Lure. Not quite as bad as the Plague Star event had been, but still enough to take 12 Teralysts a night off the table (this was before the Trio hunts existed). *Sidenote: This updated also marked the beginning of the end for IPS 2.0 which was later scrapped. Check the roadmap post above for a bit more context.* ###2018 What we know so far, and what was reiterated on today's Devstream, is that we can expect some upates for Fortuna *(Fortwona? For2na? 42na&gt;)*. What had been referred to internally before as ""Orb Heists"", now dubbed ""Orb Sting"" ? (I wasn't able to watch too closely at work and this post was prepped beforehand, aside from this last bit)  Whatever it's called, the upcoming Orb Vallis content with the giant Raknoid Orb enemies seems to be coming out later this month, possibly over the winter break. Seeing as how there are already a lot of spawning and enemy AI issues on Orb Vallis as it is right now... I'm a bit anxious to see what happens. *** **All I want is a little reassurance that we won't be left hanging in case something does go wrong again over the upcoming break.** Eyes of Blight and Hema were the worst of the lot and I want to be optimistic that we won't encounter those kinds of situations again, but historically speaking the only consistency is a bit of inconsistency. I would so much rather have something properly QA tested and reviewed at the cost of being pushed back later, but at the same time I can understand the pressure of wanting to release something semi-major for your players to enjoy over the span of the break. I think The War Within's launch was a much better way of handling it  releasing it at the start of the month so that players could have a lot to do over the break and the devs would still have time to iterate on it before the offices were closed. ##tl;dr: Whatever happens, happens. I just really don't want another Hema :V "

I aim at fixing the flaws of he's kit while bring in both of he's theme closer and synergistic, but first the issues. &gt;1. Thralls in their current state still feel useless. &gt;2. mesmer skin is still a slow and clunky ability even with it being recastable. &gt;3.  lack of synergy/ castability ^^^^(is this even a word lol) with danse macabre. By stating the issues I personally find, let's get into fixing he's kit. **PASSIVE** 10% life steal for all weapons. **ENTHRALL** &gt;1. Remove the duration based cast to a health drain one, thralls die in a capped 30 Seconds. &gt;2. Thralls will now secrete their own blood, leaving a trail of acidic blood in their path, dealing corrosive damage and enemies that take damage from this blood are converted into thralls. &gt;3. thrall cap reduced from 7 to 5. &gt;4. Enemies that die before the 30 Second expiration mark will explode, releasing acidic blood within 3 meters and drop either a health orb or an energy orb. &gt;5. When enthralled, enemies will drop their weapons and attack aggressively toward any non enthralled opponents. &gt;6.Allies can no longer damage thralls. **MESMER SKIN** &gt;1. Cast animation sped up to 1.5 Seconds. &gt;2. Whenever a charge is consumed, revenant releases a knockdown wave. &gt;3. Charges gain a 3 Second grace period between them. **REAVE** &gt;1. Reave cures status effects for any ally who comes in the way. &gt;2. Reave marks enemies, opening them to a 100% damage vulnerability **DANSE MACABRE** &gt;1. revenant leaves a trail of acidic blood, turning enemies Into thralls. &gt;2. When boosted, revenant periodically releasesp projectiles that home into enemies. &gt;3. Revenant can cast Mesmer skin while using danse macabre, but only if no charges are present.

75,vulnerability,Warframe,"Another ""Vauban Needs Rework, My Ideas!"" Sort of Post.",2,9a4471,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/9a4471/another_vauban_needs_rework_my_ideas_sort_of_post/,2018-08-25 14:14:44,"I want to like Vauban, but he's honestly a mess. I'm no professional game designer, but this is just my ideas of whats been rattling in the braincan, and if it can provoke discussion and/or inspire more proper rework designs, by all means. Issues: - CC-oriented, not enough self sufficiency as a Warframe. Big weapon-sort of guy. -Invests a lot of energy into one area, no way of reclaiming it. -Slow gameplay due to charging, switching, lots of hold mechanics that are cumbersome and don't actually add to gameplay in a significant degree, resulting in a gimmicky mess where you want to do something but aren't actually doing something. -An overloaded kit in all the wrong directions, Tesla is a charged ability but the charge itself isn't impactful and wastes time in a second-by-second game, Minelayer has four entire options that are all confused for what they should do and directly conflict one another, as well as being really clunky to work with due to trying to cram four abilities into one and pretending like it gives him actual power when only a fraction of these actually function in a useful way for the insulting energy cost. -Squishy frame identity, but keeps being visually sold as a beefy boy. This also has a lot to do with lack of identity, being that he's an engineer who does sort of engineer things but all of his engineer toys just don't come off as impressive. -Kit that overlaps on itself, where the first and second ability overlap in terms of status-oriented, and relatively few target CC, while the third and fourth ability focus on wide-spread CC. Redundant abilities means you have no reason to build for both. You build for one, and use one. Then you've got half a kit. Identity: -Engineer. This is fundamentally what Vauban is. We don't really have an entirely firm grasp beyond that, but we do know that he deals with a lot of energy doodads, seen in Tesla's electrics, Bounce's, well, bounciness, and Bastille and Vortex's existence. Then we run into the issue where Minelayer is a very on-hands, physical engineer with bombs and stuff. We need to choose a direction, I feel. We call his balls ""grenades"", but a supermajority of what Vauban does dabbles and deals with energy. It's a whole lot of stinking space ninja energy magic, and then we have this one confused ability which has 3/4s of it based in blowing people up with actual mines and bombs and stuff. Please pick one. So, based on the supermajority rule, and a smidge of what I personally feel like Warframe and it's cuckoo space ninja magic world has to offer, the right idea would be to choose the energy route. So I think we can revise the identity of Vauban to energy engineer. Basis: I've read a lot of crap about Vauban, and I personally am not an expert, but having built, played, and played with Vauban, his kit is summed up as inefficient, clunky, static, and confused. Fundamentally, a kit is supposed to be built with synergy, as we can point to the community fan favorites like Nidus or Harrow, and whatnot. In Warframe, a good Warframe design has to have a kit where all the abilities mesh together, obviously, but there has to be more to it than that. Good designs have a focal point, an ability that ties the Warframe together, and all the abilities happily work with that one ability. If at least 3/4 of the abilities can do this, the Warframe tends to be a success. I'm going to use three particular Warframes in this case, and maybe unfairly tie into augments a bit. First off, Excalibur. As a classic starter Warframe, Excalibur's big focus, per his namesake, is all about melee. This swordlad's big kit benefit all focuses on Exalted Blade. His first ability is a gapcloser with damage, while somewhat invalidated by the existence of bullet jumping, still works to bring Excalibur into melee range. Radial blind is a clean fit with melee, giving a short-medium proximity Warframe to blind units, giving safety, and also opening to finishers, another melee tie in. Radial Javelin is the bunk ability here, with a standard AoE damage function that doesn't scale aside from ability strength, hence falling off and sorting not meshing. Exalted blade, being Exalibur's personal, moddable powerhouse, is what allows all his kit to come together. And as a result, he's built around it. He's got a clear identity, a 2/4 - 3/4 functional kit, and the abilities all work together to say: melee playstyle but with a laser sword too, that's kind of cool. On the flip coin, not all Warframes have to be built entirely around being self-sufficient to be good. Rhino's going to be my example here. His Rhino Charge is a gap-closers that CCs enemies, allowing him to take less damage. With his band-aid augment Ironclad Charge (which should just be a thing in the base kit, but oh well), Charge ties directly into his second ability, which is the focus of his kit, and identity: Iron Skin. Iron Skin is what makes Rhino the durable, tanky, unstoppable Warframe he's meant to be. It makes him CC immune, it gives him a HP buffer, 3 seconds of invulnerability, and it allows him to just keep chugging along. Roar is his non-tied ability, but isn't useless. It still accentuates Rhino's reliance on weapons, providing a damage augment to all outgoing damage for both the user and team. Rhino Stomp is an AoE CC designed to stop enemies from moving or attacking, preserving his and his allies HP by making them not die to enemy hurt-bullets. (There's also an augment to make stomp give iron skin hp back, huh, what did we mention about focusing on a synergetic kit?) The last example (which will be much shorter, sorry) is Nidus. Nidus is a fantastic design because he does both. I'm not going to harp on it too much, but let's basically end it at the fact that Nidus is entirely built around his first ability, Virulence. All of his other abilities synergize with this ability perfectly, and combined with his passive essay, allows Nidus to be played to great success and enjoyment. For this section's TL;DR: A good warframe design will have focus on one ability to give the Warframe a direction. So after all that crap, I'd say that Vauban should have a deep-rooted focus on an ability that also accentuates his engineer-CC-bunker down design, without restricting him to energy starvation and seven years of building a new bouncy castle. I'm no number expert, and I'm not a game design expert, but this is my pitch at what could be done with the poor lad. Numbers are obviously tentative, because I'm not a master of game balance. Kit Proposal: Stats changes: Shield: 75 (225) / 100 (300) &gt;&gt;&gt; 150 (450) / 175 (525) Now, I'm proposing that he gets a shield bump, because there's no reason he should have so little, being this magical energy engineer. It's kind of absurd that this guy has all this power at his fingertips, and can't even protect himself with energy. Prime will have the Frost Prime level of shield bump. This is also leading into making his passive solve a big issue of his kit. Passive: Reactive Core Vauban converts 10% of damage on shields to energy. Upon shield break, Vauban becomes invulnerable for 1 second. This is a large push to patch his energy issue. With 525 shields on prime, getting 53 energy from a shield breach is pretty generous. This will also encourage shield stacking as a means to dimension a build, and make players think about taking that extra duration mod, or a shield mod. Some will even consider a shield recharge mod to make use of the invulnerability more often. The second clause is to allow this passive to be useful at high level play, where getting one shot is really to be expected, as well as giving our poor little no-health-Steve to actually have a breather. First ability: Tesla | Energy Cost: 50 Vauban sets down a Tesla tower with a base health of 3000/3250/3500/4000 and shields of 500/1000/1500/2000, which primes in 1 second. If an enemy approaches the tower within 6/8/10/12 meters, the tower will begin discharging, emmiting a constant chaining electric beam that deals 10/14/18/22 damage per tick, with a fire-rate of 12.0. The tower has a magazine of 50/100/150/200, that will recharge begin recharging after a 1.75/1.5/1.25/1.0 delay of inactivity, recharging at 25/50/75/100 ammo a second. If the magazine is depleted, the tower will cease firing until fully recharged. Vauban can place up to four Tesla towers, but each tower placed will divide the health, shield, damage and magazine recharge and capacity. The chain lightning can strike up to four targets (including host target), halving the damage each jump. The tesla has a base critical rate of 10%, a multiplier of x2.0, and a status chance of 25%. The base damage is electric, AND THE TESLA TOWER ACCEPTS RIFLE MODS, to be modified in the arsenal. The health and shield values of the Tesla are modified by Vauban's ability strength and respective Warframe mods. (Including shield recharge!) There is no duration on Teslas, only their health pool and hard placement limit. Range will increase the detection and arc range. Holding down the ability key near an existing tower will salvage the tower, destroying it and refunding 25 energy to Vauban. Multiple towers can be salvaged if standing in close proximity to them. Augment: Tesla Overload Tesla's base critical rate is increased by 10/20/30/40% (flat additive amount), but the status chance is decreased by 25/50/75/100% (base) So basically, I gave Vauban an Amprex to throw down that takes rifle mods. These numbers are in NO WAY FINAL (because I am ass at balance with double-scaling factors), but the concept is conveyed. The idea is to let Vauban lock down areas, either with a single potent tower, or multiple weaker towers. Status is high to keep in tune the fundamental supportive nature of Vauban, also enabling the ability to create corrosive towers to strip armor for that sweet end-game fantasy. To keep in mind energy economy, and the fact that you'll end up leaving these suckers behind in mobile defense, excavation, etc, I wanted you to get some returns on smashing them yourself. However, smashing them to place them down to bypass the reload wouldn't seem fair at a full refund, so 25 energy it is. The augment is to polarize the Teslas, giving you massive DPS bumps on them in exchange for their utility. At max rank augment, all of the tesla's status is lost at base, and it won't be salvagable with status mods. In turn, you can reach some pretty swit crit values. Great for those corrosive projection parties, huh? Second ability: Rampart | Energy Cost: 25 Vauban sets down a fortified energy wall that blocks enemy projectiles, and can be shot through by allies. The barrier has a base health value of 2000/3000/4000/5000, entirely composed of shield health type. The barriers will regenerate according to Vauban's shield recharge rate, and the health scales off of power strength and Vauban's shield mods. The barrier has a duration of 10/25/45/60 seconds, scaled with power duration. For ever Rampart that is placed, the cost of Rampart is increased by 25, capped at 100. This cost will go down as ramparts are destroyed or expire. When a rampart is DESTROYED (not expired), it will discharge, reloading all nearby Tesla towers to full. If EXPIRED, the rampart will dissolve and refund its full energy cost (includes cost ramp-up) to Vauban if he is in proximity. This refund and recharge range is affected by range mods. If Vauban is squishy, but is also supposed to be a fortress (Bastille? Citadel Deluxe? A fortress of style?), what's the other alternative? He builds himself his own sand castle, except because sand is coarse and rough and gets everywhere, it's an energy castle. It's basically self-renewing and recycling Grineer blunts, except energy too. The synergy of placing them near your Tesla towers is two-fold, because it protects your tesla towers, but also restores their batteries if it's destroyed nearby. Place it strategically and properly, and it'll reward you. Place too many, and you run dry on energy. If they end up being placed wrong, you can still opt to wait for the expiration for your money back. That should make some interesting negative duration builds, right? Third ability: Bastille | Energy Cost: 75 It's the same damn thing, with all the same scalings. I think Bastille is a fundamentally fine ability, but I'm going to add a few things to keep in touch with the kit I'm brewing. I think Bastille is a perfectly fine ability, fundamentally. It's got its bugs, but I'm not going to theorycraft with those in mind. Tesla will prioritize enemies in Bastille. Repelling Bastille's effect is now built into the base Bastille. Augment: Exposing Bastille Enemies standing in Bastille will take 10/15/20/25% more damage. The augment is straightforward, it's basically Vauban's old passive, but not quite. It gives vulnerability for the whole party, and in turn, Vauban and his little fortress. Allows you to eliminate priority targets who've breached your walls. Fourth ability: Overload | Energy Cost: 20 Vauban empowers all structures (Tesla, Rampart, and Bastille) within 5/7/8/10 meters for 5/7/10/15 seconds, spending 20 energy per structure. Empower range and duration are affected by range and duration mods, respectively. -Teslas will gain 20/40/75/100% increased fire rate and will reload regardless of firing state (but can still empty and be forced to commit to a full reload), and will gain 0/1/1/2 additional bounces (that still incur the 50% reduction per bounce). Fire rate bonus is affected by power strength. At the end of the buff period, all affected teslas self destruct, dealing 1000/1250/1750/2500 magnetic damage equal to the Tesla's range with a guaranteed proc. Vauban is NOT refunded for these Teslas. -Ramparts become invincible, but lose 80/65/45/25% of their remaining duration, before being destroyed. This self-destruction recharges Teslas, but also refunds half of the energy cost to Vauban if he is in range. The energy refunded is increased by power strength, up to 100% refund, and the duration loss is inversely affected by power duration (more duration means less duration loss). -Bastille becomes a Vortex, pulling every single target in the Bastille's range into the center. This Vortex is functionally identical to the current one, and inherits the remaining duration of Bastille. Augment: Extreme Overload Overload's bonuses and penalties are increased by 25/50/70/100%. I wanted to design something that works to augment versus being its own standalone thing, but also not something so clearly of an upside you end up either going max duration or spam it forever. This is an ability you have to think twice about using, as a last ditch thing, or something you time for the neat destruction of everything as you move to the next location. For the same reason, I wanted an augment that accentuates this big bang big consequence skill, and depending on someone's playstyle, may or may not be what they want. This might not be the best designed or organized trainwreck for what Vauban could be, and its unlikely any of this would actually ever come to light, but maybe it can inspire discussion and further community suggestion, and at least get Vauban to a spot where he's actually fun to play.

A resort on mars, owned by corpus elite. A bustling city hidden from the war, sort of as ""this is where all the credits go"" type of place. This would be a real city too; high rises everywhere, streets full of NPCs, Sort of corusant-esque. In order to sneak in we'd have to play as our operator (walking around in a frame would be a dead giveaway) And would give a sense of vulnerability to the player that's otherwise unfamiliar to warframe. You'd do spy missions, Perhaps it's orchestrated by Baro Ki Teer, as he's a regular at the city, so he sneaks you in.

78,vulnerability,Warframe,"Showerthoughts about the New War *Spoilers, invariably*",13,91l1cb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/91l1cb/showerthoughts_about_the_new_war_spoilers/,2018-07-25 06:23:58,"So by this point I think we can all acknowledge that the Sentients are going to show up in the origin system fairly soon, with a view to carrying out a little light genocide. The question is what happens when they do... The Grineer: Already a bunch of genocidal nutters and not long on brain cells, so deeply unlikely to consider anything as sensible as allying with anyone else. No doubt they'll fight, and given their low tech weaponry, sheer force of numbers, and ability to produce large quantities of battlefield ready units very fast, they may hold out quite well. On the other hand they're down a queen, the remaining one doesn't seem all that bright, and their only competent military commander is Sargus Ruk (not to knock Tyl Regor, but grand strategy and genetics aren't even vaguely in the same balliwick). Will be interesting to see how many rank-and-file Grineer turn out to be Steel Meridian sympathisers. The Corpus: Heavily tech reliant, riven by self-interest, and not all that good at war when it comes down to brass tacks. Given that one can't typically make a profit from beyond the grave, I expect that they'll either try to buy our protection or sell us weaponry (war profiteering being a venerable Corpus tradition). If allies, unreliable, if enemies, a badly timed irritant. In terms of named Corpus characters, the only one who can be trusted further than throwing distance is Darvo, though Alad V has been weirdly useful in the past. The Infested: A force of nature rather than a geopolitical grouping, therefore unlikely to consider allegiances. May provide useful locations in which Sentient assaults could be bogged down, or could potentially be seeded into their forces. That said, wars are great for spreading diseases to fun new host populations, so as likely to bite us in our shiny metal arses as it is the Sentients. The Syndicates: Ah, finally some allies! Each likely to be helpful in their own way and none really to make enemies of the Tenno as a whole. New Loka's objectives are a bit suss in that they align far too well with the Sentients' initial reasoning for revolt, but I doubt they fancy being dead either. Whilst unlikely to fall for the same trick twice, Suda has also shown vulnerability to Hunhow's influence in the past. The Ostrons: Not much they personally could do, but the Unum seems to have some protective effect against Sentient incursion? The Quills' time-space shenanigans and superior understanding of how, precisely, one fillets an eidolon might also prove useful. Other Parties: Of all these Teshin Dax will undoubtedly be the most useful, assuming he is a true Orokin era Dax. Whilst little match for our physical abilities, he has the benefit of centuries of experience; Teshin Dax knows his enemy. Wind him up and watch him go. Maroo and Baro Ki'teer have both shown a capability for enlightened self interest where necessary, but are as likely (IMHO) to gather their accumulated wealth and sit out the whole thing in a bunker somewhere. Simaris could go any way, depending on who he feels is most likely to advance the goals of Sanctuary. I don't personally trust the schemeing, holographic, bastard, but nor does that make him a traitor (yet). The Man in the Wall: A creepy fucker, whose motivations are both shrouded in mystery and unlikely to end well for anyone. The last eldritch abomination we need in our lives right now. All late night woolgathering really, so I doubt I'm entirely correct. I'm for bed; feel free to talk amongst yourselves."
79,vulnerability,Warframe,DE's Showcase of Fortuna Really Highlights the Flaws Warframe still Retains in Instanced Missions,4,92h94v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/92h94v/des_showcase_of_fortuna_really_highlights_the/,2018-07-28 08:57:07,"I want to preface this post by saying I love warframe, have played for nearly a thousand hours in less than a year and it obviously would be hypocritical of me to really say this is a bad game. BUT. My inability to find other hobbies and love for the game doesn't detract from the mountain of issues Warframe continues to have, which is _really_ going to hurt people coming into the game and expecting Fortuna to be accessible. And these issues are so incredibly numerous that it makes the bug reports in the hotfixes after Plains of Eidolon dropped look relatively small. I really want to draw attention to the areas that do need a pass before Fortuna drops to really maximize retention of those who will inevitably join (or have already) for this update. I won't be able to hit on everything, but I'm going to try to be thorough enough to outline the major flaws. **First Quest/Entry into Warframe**: We know this is a big issue, the enemy level and all is all over the place and the entirety of it is going to take probably a full-scale redesign. But let's talk about what specifically SHOULD be fixed early. 1. Story-line: The animations by Vor, specifically using the electrical attack on the power fist unit, are horrible. The FIRST THING people see when they open this game is Vor's weird-ass upward swing that kills the power fist who's apparently Vor's equal. The continuity with randomly switching languages is weird, even though it is understandable that Vor knows English, but not so much why his Grineer, who never speak English, understand him. This is why I state this is probably going to need a more full pass. It just is incredibly awkward in animation compared to the insane polish later in the game. Having a cinematic quest here as an introduction is basically what already exists, but it starts so cheesy no one really cares. 2. 1. Okay, also plot line for this should be... more in line with Warframe. Having Vor out to capture a warframe is fine, having Tenno-produced weapons sitting around on Earth is not. We all know that the machine Vor uses to get to the Tenno is the same thing we use in Void Sabotages to jump to different areas, so its safe to assume there's no reason for a Tenno-Designed weapons cash to be in this Grineer Forest area. Like with all the lore that has been put into it, these plot-holes make little sense, and are product of just how long this game has gone improving the end game. Like all of this would be improved if we just found the weapons in the same area of the warframe (a deserted Orokin area), or if we like actively killed the grineer carrying them out of the area. Or were the grineer honestly just leaving us handouts in the middle of a small passage on some containers? There are obviously more examples, and while it could be argued that it is just a beginner's quest, that's the main point. This quest is going to set the tone, and between how easy it is and the continuity issues (and the cheesy animation), it can be a bad first impression. 2. Moreover, melee 2.5? is near here, and Vor still has a sequence in the FIRST MISSION where you're just holding your block button and running around. Block? I mean, not only does that mechanic see almost no use in any of the content outside Excalibur just holding it while spamming exalted blade, I don't think it's returning. By the way, Vor just blew Ordis out of the sky with this thing, basically destroying our ship and we can block this beam with the Skana? What kind of ship are we trusting our lives with? Moreover, after shooting down the ship would be a great point to add a quick line of character for Vor, whether in expression or voice line. 3. Turn down the default sensitivity. The first thing people will do in this game is flail randomly or open their menu to change their sensitivity, immediately killing immersion. Almost everyone I've watched start this quest picks their warframe, looks around, pauses and lowers sensitivity. IFlynn on his re-playthrough went from 50 to 8. I halved mine to 26. IFlynn's DPI is way higher than mine, but in either case, these are DRAMATIC swings in sensitivity from the default. And playing on 100? Is anyone ACTUALLY doing that for anything but memes? It is WAY too high, and none of us are Stewie2k. 4. Change the floating text. It is strange that it just exists in the middle of the air. Having it pop up on your HUD like the mission-status (like the bar that fills up as you complete each task) would look way more polished. More importantly, you can EASILY miss some of these as current (the one about switching weapons in particular) because they're kinda shelved away to not be in the way while also not moving. 5. Reoccurring characters have limited introduction. Darvo, Vor, Lotus, Ordis (although Ordis is kinda excusable) all show up in this quest and none have any real characterization. This is a shame because at least three of them are really good characters (and Darvo has some of the best survival lines in the game). Why can't Darvo tell us what Darvo's intel suggests? It would legitimately add some character to the first few missions, which to that point has only had Lotus and Ordis droning on about shit the player doesn't understand yet. 6. The ""Defend your Ship"" part on the first mission, you can go into the enemy spawn room and legitimately watch them spawn. 7. The Side Objective in the Navigation Segment Quest legitimately does nothing. And moreover, even DOING THIS SIDEQUEST (as many new players will be tempted to do so due to morality and interest of something new), sometimes the Lotus will talk as if you let those people die. I don't get why this is even here when we're not doing any of the morality gauge work that comes up later, but also there's no bonus reward, no quest relevance, and no continuation of this kind of side mission popping up (outside that Natah quest? and then the Gustag three might do the same?) anywhere else in the game. If Syndicate reputation was available earlier, this might be an interesting way to introduce standing, and just give a generic overall increase to all syndicates by some minor, but meaningful, amount. 8. Of COURSE we have to talk about how easy these enemies are in Warframe. I got to Mars before even realizing where my health bar was because I never went down. It's not just a damage issue. The AI on the early quests is legitimately different: It stands there, intentionally misses and won't notice you if you're right next to it. It feels _so_ bad for someone to legitimately stand next to an enemy and them not notice. It's not stealth, it's just enemies intentionally set to easy. And for a game that makes so much on not holding hands, why are the enemies not only deceptive for their higher-level counterparts but also basically stormtroopers who converted to pacifism? Brute forcing some base damages to be a bit higher here and making the AI more aware would really be nice for immersion. Stealth in Warframe is still... in need of work because outside stealth frames, moving quietly through a map, even solo, is nigh impossible. **Earth and the Many Ways to Get Killed At Cetus**. Hello? Why are new players, who probably aren't even MR 4 and don't have the Hek yet, being told to visit ALL NODES ON EARTH to get to Mars, and inevitably going to this big, beautiful and different area called Cetus where they'll enter the plains of Eidolon and get obliterated? I remember going there at night because I didn't know any better, getting absolutely smashed as a team was taking down an Eidolon, and so I ended up seeing the spoiler from the second dream. What? DE, this CAN'T be your objective! Literally the biggest 'secret' of Warframe was spoiled to me, MR 4 with 2 warframes and the only guns to my name being the Hek and the Boltor. I understand that you should be able to visit Cetus, but restricting Cetus like you do for fighting Vay Hek would at least give people a chance to not come to the plains until they were somewhat prepared for the lowest level. Or making it clear that they AREN'T a prerequisite for Mars (and fixing it if they currently are) to allow people to skip what is objectively beyond them at that point. You can't transverse the plains quickly with any of the starts except Volt and even that is a stretch for low-level players who have yet to gain access to any of the Strength, Efficiency, or Duration mods to make that the slightest bit viable. **Your Bosses, Sans Any Sentient, Kayla and Lephantis, Suck** Well, stuff like the Hyena pack is okay. And the Raptor can be legitimately fun sometimes (other than it probably takes 2x as long to get to the Raptor than any other boss in the game?). However, as is true for even Tyl Regor, the rest of the bosses are almost COMPLETELY irredeemable for one simple reason: There is _zero_ clarity on what the bosses are doing, or how to stop their invulnerability. Alad V's Zanuka fight is... hard to understand on when Zanuka can heal Alad V and when Zanuka will just fail to do so or vice versa. Anymore, vets just oneshot the both of them using the rule of damage to brute force that fight. Specifically, Vay Hek's copter-ass form and Kril's entire existence are TERRIBLE offenders of this. My first time fighting Krill, I legitimately Wiki'd his weakness to find out his vulnerability mid fight because none of the four people I paired with understood him (+one person attacking while he's invulnerable, and then statusing him w/toxic or slash, will just make sure his vulnerability stays up for what seems indefinite). Not only did I wiki this, I then typed it out to the team and sat there with them as we waited. Sat there and waited for a boss to become vulnerable. Disgusting, boring, terrible design. Why does this exist at all? Kayla, the Raptor, and all of the teralysts (and even most of the spectres) are legitimately fun fights. Kayla is STILL buggy as hell, but that's so far beyond the beginner experience, it isn't worth mentioning. These bosses all need their clarity polished up. The Jackal, while boring, represented a really cool moment for me as a beginner as I defeated it. Even though it was an HP tank, it looks like it should be and had easy-to-read mechanics for units I had already fought (MOAs that stomp ground being the Jackal's primary weapon, rockets that are intuitive any way you look at it). Having the Lotus be more active in calling out weaknesses at the beginning of the mission (IE: ""Alad V's Collar seems to prevent him from taking damage. Remove it from him"" or ""Krill's backpack overheats and glows, making him vulnerable to damage"" would make these fights at least more understandable but is simply a bandaid fix. In the anatomy of any good boss fights, reusing concepts we have with common enemies and turning it up to 11 beats the hell out of invincibility. And invincibility only frustrates players who min/max to farm these guys faster. DE is _so far beyond_ this stupid boss style too. I mean, look no further than the Ambulas boss fight, the Teralyst, or Hunhow-Suda from Octavia's Anthem. Specifically the last one is a unique and incredible boss fight. Perhaps tedious and definitely not fitting of a node boss for a warframe part but super unique and the style of boss that Warframe should invest more into. I feel like the major fights in The Sacrifice were a bit of a regression in this respect, but they were probably more for cinematic purposes anyways. **Junctions and their Flaws** As I said, Spectres are really cool. Junctions, however, are not. Their concept is fantastic, a floodgate for players to stop them from getting ahead of themselves. They also come with good rewards... sometimes. But... Mercury...: Damaged Fast Deflection (unranked), Damaged Streamline (unranked) Really? These are two of the Mercury ""rewards"", aka Trash. Damaged mods are dumb, need to be removed, and need to never exist again. Giving them as a reward is insulting. These mods are simply OUTCLASSED by their undamaged counterparts, but moreover they also don't refund the credits people spend into them, not knowing any better. Can they be fixed? Of course not because if we learned one thing from The Sacrifice, there's no fixing damaged goods. So people spend credits and precious, precious endo on these for minor/insignificant boosts. At this point in time, they should be maxing a Serration, Point Strike, Hornet Strike, Fury, and MAYBE an Elemental mod like Cryo Rounds. So yeah, Boltor Blueprint == Really good. Damaged Mods == Really Bad. But then we have the requirements, and objectively one of the hardest set for a new player to ever understand: Phobos Junction. The three requirements are as follows: 1.Defeat 150 enemies in a single mission on Mars 2.Scan 3 Cephalon Fragments on Mars 3.Open 3 Lith Void Relics I have helped shuttle players through this junction because of all of these requirements. First, the void relic system is completely unexplained at this point in time. Yes, you get a Lith relic from the Mars Junction, but at this point in time you'll have no idea what they are, or what to do with them. Additionally, remember that almost all Prime weaponry becomes available at MR 7. Melee weapons are the exception, with Fang Prime being the ONLY reasonable weapon to obtain from a relic prior to MR 7 (even if Orthos and Ankyankos have lesser MR restrictions, they currently require Axi Relics). The Dual Kamas at MR 6 are also mostly doable, but this is far after Phobos where you'll be that MR most of the time. Of course, it is no surprise that even though most Prime Warframes are MR 0, there is almost no way to get them without at least access to Neo Relics. This also isn't including the fact that the MR 7, the Soma Prime, is vaulted. I think an easier way to introduce people to relics (perhaps as an addition to a main quest?) is needed, but that relics need to be listed as a low-priority mechanic to introduce players to. Now, the Cephalon Fragments. Notice, the 25 Scanners were also a reward prior, and so DE is trying to get people to understand ""Equip those, find blue thing, scan blue thing"". Except, in typical warframe fashion, none of that is explained. It's for the exploration of the gear system, which is neat, but _why not do this through Simaris_? Have the quest introducing Simaris like WAY earlier and have players learn scanning through her perhaps. Even barring that, Thief's Wit, the mod that can LOCATE a fragment more easily, is the _reward_ for this junction. This is backwards, you're giving a tool to assist with a quest after they've done the quest! Most people don't even know what these damn blue things are, as Warframe goes and never says anything about it. Lastly, the 'easiest' of these is the Defeat 150 enemies quest. Except, again, we're on Mars. On Mars, you can do this 1 of 2 ways (without shuttle). The first is a 10 minute run on Spear, which SHOULD net 185 enemies. The second is normally a four man run on the same (Spear, but Kadesh and Wahiba work too) with 20 rounds. This is assuming your squad mates don't steal everything by being vets and heavy farming morphics? I guess there's not a lot of reason for a vet to be on Mars outside of endless Augustus being a really good relic spot, but this is far more RNG and can maybe force a player into wave 25. I really think this one should be ""Complete Hellas (or Olympus) Solo"" as it basically accomplishes the same goal (slaughtering many enemies, maybe while defending an objective), just on a non-endless. Minor nitpick, Ceres Spectre is still Trinity, even though Trinity is now obtained on Pluto, and Excalibur on Mars. **Map Generation Nitpicks** This is definitely far down on the list of concerns, but the map generation in a few cases is really obnoxious. Snow Corpus for Destroyed Ships (Aka the tileset Raptor is found on) is awful to navigate, just like Infested Corpus ships, because of all the random ways you get caught on walls. The Corpus Ship has one specific room, the one with the triple level, double elevator on each side great chasm, that is a navigation nightmare. The navigation icon never transitions between levels, and acts as if anyone is going to use the elevators. This issue exists on the large Orokin elevator room, again a triple-level room where you don't technically need to use elevators. The tracker seems to struggle with elevation and elevators. On rooms where we CAN skip the elevator, have the marker automatically move ahead. This GPS system updates so slowly that you'll often just see players hopping around one room, waiting. The Infested Outbreak Assassinations on ALWAYS use the same tileset of the overrun Grineer Asteroid tileset. So when the offensive is at Tyl Regor's node, it's still a grineer asteroid. This may be like the few instances where Corpus maps on the planet of Venus or Pluto would show like they were in space, but it again just doesn't seem right. Not really a map thing, but the ""unrecognizable player"" bug still occurs too frequently. This is where enemies don't realize where you are. The enemy will always think you're in spawn, and if you're the host to a player experiencing this bug, you'll only see their Warframe there as well. This isn't an issue until you realize that THE GAME thinks you're in spawn, meaning no doors open up, consoles are impossible to interact with, and you basically go stealth Rhino on people. The way to open doors? Operators, since Operators are almost always recognized. However, new players can't do that and therefore will get trapped in rooms wondering how to unstuck from a bad host recognition. **Mods and Why this System Needs an Improvement** Okay so out of the thousands of mods in this game, maybe 150 mods get used. Outside of Augment mods, these are almost always the same combination of Damage, Multishot, Ability Strength/Duration/Efficency/Range, crit and elemental type mods. This means mods like Status Duration, ADS While Gliding, Extra Hacking time are nigh worthless. In reality, they will never be better because, let's be real, mod slot limitations are more punishing than a mod capacity limit. The only way to really let mods be ultra-diverse is to dual-stat mods or continue series mods. Projectile Speed is not useful to many people, but it WOULD BE a meaningful choice for the Supra Vandal if you had a dual stat damage/projectile speed mod vs. a damage/ADS zoom mod. Having specific mods in a series be incompatible would allow variety through having interesting and diverse second effects that otherwise would be overlooked. Also series mods like Vigilante, Augur and so on are good things and should be continued. I've already stated that **damaged** (not damage) mods are dumb, not only because of the fact that they're _weaker_ than regular mods, but also because the investment into them is super meaningful for people at that point of the game and they're essentially garbage mods. My opinion is that transmuting 2-3 damaged mods of the same name should create 1 undamaged mod of that name. That way, you can meaningfully invest into them, and the mods you get for gold (streamline, continuity) are not only great mods, but not exactly rare and therefore won't really disturb any loot system. Either that or entirely remove them and just don't allow gold mods to drop on Earth for that. **Elephants in the Room** Over the years, a few issues have cropped up that DE has refused to finalize or really even address. The major one the community remembers is Universal Vaccuum, the current reason Kavats, Kubrows, the new MOA pets, and Hemlisk chargers are all essentially _worthless_ in missions. This is a game about grinding, it is a game that moves at a lighting pace, it is a game that if you have the time to walk over the loot while _not using_ vacuum, you're too slow. There is also absolutely nothing fun about picking up loot. Hell, even picking up Ayatan Stars can be a bother, do you really think we want to run over everything? So we all run vacuum. But that just immediately kills an entire pet system (which, while the AI is dumb, at least is usable outside of Vacuum) and also kills a couple of frames (Namely, Titania trying to use her 4 for anything productive). This just _isn't_ good design. It's not even like we're buying resources with plat because of it (which would be _really suspect_ if this is what it was causing). There needs to be an open reason that pets aren't at least given something similar (and Titania's 4 the same) or why loot range is just so dumb in a game that is a _looter_. And while you may say ""This doesn't sound like a beginner problem"", it's going to be a problem for beginners far before they're ready for Fortuna, and it also kinda is, in the respect that it most likely will persist as an issue on the open world. There's other ones like the chat moderators in this game still being suspect (and the bot is kinda... iffy), but that's something that shouldn't be the biggest deal for new players (hopefully) even though in a game that's rated M having a censor on swears is dumb. I know I'm missing some issues. However, this is more just to highlight concerns than be an exhaustive list. DE has been pushing forward on adding new content, which is important for the life of this game by bringing in new money. However, it isn't good that this is at the expense of older content. Parts of this game obviously sit in 2018, which many parts still seem to lag 3 to 4 years behind. And as this gap continues to widen, as Warframe's identity shifts more and more in End-game content, the beginning of the game will become more and more alien and alienate people for differences in expectation before they have a chance to experience Warframe's full array. As this game skirts the edge of what it means to be a ""Triple A"" quality game, the entire package needs to meet that expectation to truly exceed that barrier. "
80,vulnerability,Warframe,[SPOILER] [SUGGESTIONS] QoL &amp; Buffs: Umbra &amp; Focus Edition,14,8rwgq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/8rwgq3/spoiler_suggestions_qol_buffs_umbra_focus_edition/,2018-06-18 13:36:06,"The title warned you. ----- So, as we know, Excalibur Umbra is capable of functioning independently of the Operator. What does this give us? Reasons to be outside the Warframe. Which gives us reasons to use Operator more. There are problems... both with Umbra, and with Focus. ----- *(1) Umbra is squishy in Spectre Mode.* - Lacking the invulnerability/damage reduction of other warframes in standby, Spectre AI isn't nearly as adept at damage prevention via mobility or blocking as a player would be. Now, this can be compensated for somewhat: Arcane Guardian (+600 armour) paired with two sets of Magus Nourish (+50hp/s regen) will keep it fairly tanky into decently high levels, so it's not THAT big of an issue. However, what is an issue is the fact that Umbra uses your active Warframe health, meaning that it is way easier to get yourself killed by transferring out with Umbra than it is with other warframes, since when it gets low, you're forced back into it like you would with any other warframe at low health, then it dies. ...But why, though? Being less tanky, there's no reason it should work this way. Maybe DE considers it a trade-off for the offensive capability, but it's an awful trade-off given that said offensive capability is hindered by lacklustre AI and scaling issues. *Suggestions:* 1. Active Umbra utilizes a secondary health bar as a Spectre. If it dies, then it goes into Standby and runs off the Warframe's primary health, like normal warframes. 2. Umbra can 'die' and bleed out, but not affect the Operator, unlike normal warframes. This would allow you to essentially revive your own warframe if you're already transferred out. ----- *(2) Umbra doesn't quite fight the same way we do.* - Example: Did you have Exalted Blade active before you popped out? Well you won't when you go back in! Umbra Excalibur will always shut off Exalted Blade in the very first moment it is given autonomy. This makes Magus Elevate a very poor way to heal via repeat transference when using this Warframe. *Suggestions:* 1. Umbra detects that Exalted Blade is active, aims and attacks with Exalted Blade as if he were using a rifle. 2. Exalted Blade remains active, but in stasis. When transferring out, Umbra will use your standard weapons, but upon re-entering, Exalted Blade will once more be active. **WARNING:** *Due to the proximity of Melee 3.0 shipping in the coming weeks, this may not be as much of an issue as it is currently perceived by this writer. It is unknown how Exalted Blade and weapons like it will be changing in Melee 3.0.* ----- *(3) The focus schools best-suited to operating alongside Umbra are lacking in lustre.* - What are you going to use as Excalibur? Not Zenurik - energy regen isn't active during Exalted Blade. Madurai's a good option while using Exalted Blade, but leaves something to be desired with regards to the Operator, particularly since armour resists void damage. Vazarin will let you heal Umbra at will without needing to use Magus arcanes, but that school has issues besides that make it unwieldy for an Operator. Naramon? There's not a whole lot of point until Void Melee is released for the tater tots, and we don't know how it'll be affected with Melee 3.0 reworking the combo system, and it's mainly used for melee and forcing finisher openings, but Radial Howl already does that AND stops enemy fire at the same time. So the last option here is the school best suited to team play - Unairu. Not only does it make Umbra just that little bit extra tankier, but it can cloak and reduce damage taken for Umbra (who often stays within range well enough to benefit from that) and the void blast can lock down weapons fire from certain enemies, which is nice given its large range. And the icing on top... It sunders armour! A full strength Sundering Dash rips off 75% of armour in a single dash, making enemies way easier to kill for Umbra! That's as many as 4.5 Corrosive Procs in a single action! Except... it sends enemies flying. Oh booooooy. Boy howdy jeez willickers. Honestly, this isn't Umbra's fault, but he just provides yet another angle to criticize the current Focus nodes. *Suggestions:* **These apply to Focus schools for both general usage and with Umbra in mind.** ----- **UNAIRU** - * *'Sundering Dash'* does not cause enemies to be sent flying when used on them, but will stagger them instead with an impact proc. This allows for repeat application without impeding the ability to actually make use of the benefit. Not unlike Madurai or Naramon's dash effects. * *'Unairu Wisp'* bonus is conferred to anyone within 25m upon being summoned, and the duration stacks for up to one minute. The Wisp floats behind the operator's back and is picked up immediately upon being summoned. Any allies who were not in range on cast will have an instance of the Unairu Wisp dropped as a pickup that they have to enter within 5m or vacuum range to acquire. * *'Void Shadow'* is reduced from 4 energy per each ally cloaked at max rank (going up from 1 per ally early on, making it more expensive the further it reaches) to simply 4 energy drained per second. Maybe 6. * *'Void Chrysalis'* is reduced from 4 energy per second to 3 energy per second. * *'Void Spines'* returns 2x damage taken as 'True Damage', bypassing armour and shields. * *'Stone Skin'* is bumped up to 100 armour at least and acts as base armour, affecting gains from armour mods like Steel Fiber, Gladiator Aegis &amp; Armored Agility. ----- **VAZARIN** - * *'Mending Soul'* gains a 90s cooldown upon all instant revives being consumed. Additionally, at max rank this allows Vazarin users to transfer out of a bleedout state and revive their own warframes, or for their warframes to drop to a bleedout state without forcing the Operator back into their vessel. * *'Guardian Blast'* confers 300 overshields and 50% damage reduction for 10 seconds at maximum rank to allies within 10m. * *'Guardian Shell'* does not drain any energy whatsoever for damage absorbed, since enemy damage scaling results in this completely annihilating Operator energy instead of actually protecting against anything. Instead, it drains energy whilst moving, with energy cost going down (4e/s unranked, 2/s at max rank) and movement speed going up as it's ranked up. Shield is additionally projected at a further distance, not unlike Volt's Riot Shield. ----- **MADURAI** - * *'Void Radiance'* will additionally cause affected enemies to suffer +75% additional vulnerability to heat damage, and stacks, capped at +95%. This is not a simple damage multiplier, but will *directly affect enemy resistances.* For example, Grineer Ferrite &amp; Alloy Armour types have a neutral resistance to fire, meaning they are not any better nor any poorer at providing adequate damage reduction. One flash will increase their vulnerability to Heat by 75%, meaning that only 25% of their armour value will apply to damage calculations in reducing Heat damage, and additionally apply 1.75x damage multiplier to Heat damage. Two flashes will increase Heat vulnerability up to +95%, meaning that only 5% of the enemy's armour will count in damage reduction calculations against Heat damage. This effect lasts for 10 seconds, twice as long as the actual blind. ----- **NARAMON** - * *'Void Stalker'* - Crit chance strength no longer decays along with the timer, remaining static for the full duration. Additionally, energy cost reduces to 1/s after the full bonus has been achieved. * *'Void Hunter'* - Rather than range decreasing over 5s, brightness/visibility of outlines decays over 10s. ----- **ZENURIK** - * *'Void Singularity'* will cause items in the area to also be pulled towards the Operator. Naturally, being a Void Mode function, this also applies to Void Dashes, allowing a Zenurik user to collect a large quantity of resources over a vast area without necessitating Sentinel usage."
81,vulnerability,Warframe,Harrow is Not In A Good Place (And Here's Why),1,8vepfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/8vepfo/harrow_is_not_in_a_good_place_and_heres_why/,2018-07-02 11:15:53,"Harrow is a warframe where any one of his abilities, in a vacuum, and in concept, could be ludicrously good. However, the execution of these abilities, condemn aside, makes him extremely lacklustre at best, and infuriating at worst. The core problem with Harrow, his abilities, and his augments, is one of conflicting interests. Teammates want to get the kills themselves, not let a teammate make a kill. Teammates want to jump around, moving, killing things, not standing still and taking damage. Harrow wants to maintain the duration or gain the bonus effect of each of his abilities, but in trying to do so, each one in turn saps away from the duration or opportunities of the other. Condemn alone is exempt from these issues, but is not faultless due to Penance's reliance upon it. --- *Condemn* This ability is far and away Harrow's simplest one, and is in a very good place as of this writing. No issues. --- *Penance* This ability strains his kit only a little bit. On its own, there's nothing wrong with it. If it were the only duration buff that requires charging in Harrow's kit, there would be no issues. Its reliance on Condemn to reach full efficacy is mildly bothersome, similar to Saryn's old 'synergies', but other than that it's fine all on its own. It's just that, compounded with how Thurible and Covenant work, it's another layer of tedium that distracts from making full use of his kit. --- *Thurible* Far and away the ability I take the most issue with in Harrow's kit. Putting aside that charging it puts you into a state of unparalleled vulnerability, it is wholly reliant on Harrow being the one getting the kills to create any kind of output. And given how large a period of vulnerability it presents and how much of your energy it can consume, it ends up being pretty thoroughly disappointing if you can't actually net any kills because Equinox is nuking everything or Saryn is melting everything or Nidus decides to larva everything in the area or Rhino decides to plasmor the exact 3 enemies you JUST condemned so you could get headshots or were otherwise jumping into range to melee. But now we move onto... ... *Warding Thurible* ...and let me tell you just how infuriating the experience of this augment is. Warding Thurible grants not only damage reduction for you and allies in range, but grants bonus energy charge when you or said allies take damage. That sounds like a straight upgrade, right? Wrong. Dead fucking wrong. Warding Thurible massively changes how you approach your build. Whereas before the whole point is to get Thurible's charge out of the way as quickly as humanly possible, whether it be by reducing your efficiency and increasing value per energy via Blind Rage or increasing cast speed via Natural Talent, you are now incentivized to make Thurible's charge time last as long as humanly possible, because neither of the listed effects will yield enough of a result to justify consuming a mod slot if the ability only lasts 4 seconds, not in a kit where Covenant exists. So buckle up and use Streamline and Primed Flow and get ready for a LONG charge time, during which you're going to be running around, following your teammates which will be killing the enemies that you need for energy charge, trying to avoid getting blasted by enemies because your are literally going to be incapable of doing anything during that charge time and even with the extra damage reduction Harrow doesn't have nearly enough health or armour to survive in later levels when he lacks the ability to use Condemn or recover health with Penance or do anything at all really. Oh, and be prepared to lose THE ENTIRETY of your Penance and Covenant bonuses while charging! Isn't life just lovely? ... *Result of gameplay mechanics &amp; Suggestions* Do you see what I'm getting at? Either Thurible is eating up the bonuses you need to live or do damage in exchange for the opportunity to gain energy back only if your teammates aren't hypercompetent, or it otherwise completely locks you out of doing pretty much anything for a ludicrous amount of time and thus forces you to build your kit back up again. * *Thurible:* If killed enemies in range gave quarter value up to a maximum returns cap of 12.5e for getting killed by your allies, this ability would be shored up pretty thoroughly. * *Warding Thurible*: Do you remember when, before Harrow was released, but his work-in-progress build was being teased and shown off, that he would have this kind of GHOST ARM that charged Thurible off to the side while he did things in combat? Yeah, give that to this. If you're going to encourage overly-long charging times, return the ability to actually do things while charging. This way Harrow basically has a period where he has stupidly high energy gain, and a period where he's reducing damage, and he's almost always in either one of those two periods (sort of like with Covenant). Cap out energy return per kill at like 50-100 (200-400 on headshots) and let Harrow regain energy through standard methods like Rage or Energy Orbs while charging while using this aug. --- *Covenant* This ability seems like it's pretty cool. And it is! Using power strength reduces the amount of damage you and your teammates need to take for a full charge, which should handily solve what might otherwise have been a problem. That said, the duration is not great. Any number of other warframes have way more reliable team-oriented damage output buffs than Covenant, for far longer durations at that. And either they typically don't need to charge it, or they have ways of maintaining it. ... *Lasting Covenant* Gosh is this a hell of a double-edged sword. On one hand, it pretty thoroughly solves the issue with Covenant's crit buff duration. On the other hand, there's no invulnerability, and like Thurible, it makes Covenant into yet another ability dependent upon Harrow making the kills to get the bonus. Except it's even more tedious than Thurible, REQUIRING headshots. And let me tell you, if it's easy for teammates to screw up just getting unaimed body kills, it is a cakewalk for them to completely fuck over your headshots, the ones you need to keep their buff that makes them do so much extra damage active in the first place. And to top it all off, you are out of the invulnerability phase for the entirety of the bonus, and given how long it can get if your teammates don't manage to screw you over, that can mean a pretty big period of vulnerability. ... *Result of gameplay mechanics &amp; Suggestions* * *Covenant:* Ultimately, I would suggest that Covenant's crit duration not be tied to its cooldown duration. Having the crit bonus last for twice the cooldown seems like it'd be a reasonable buff. * *Lasting Covenant:* I would suggest that, Lasting Covenant give half duration when Harrow makes non-headshot kills, and that like my Thurible suggestion, affected teammates within affinity range are capable of contributing to the effect, giving roughly one fifth of the listed headshot kill duration for any kind of kill at all, and a third of the listed headshot kill duration for making actual headshot kills. --- As it currently stands, Harrow's kit is best-suited to a solo playstyle since that allows for minimum disruption from teammates. And yet he lacks the sheer dominating crowd control or the ludicrous constitution oft-expected from other warframes that solo higher level content to make such a playstyle work beyond the standard star chart levels."
82,vulnerability,Warframe,"Improving Ember: Fire Blast, World On Fire, Accelerant... and Overheat.",150,8vqabz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/8vqabz/improving_ember_fire_blast_world_on_fire/,2018-07-03 17:28:35,"What is *Fire Blast?* It's an ability that causes everything around you to jiggle for four seconds on fire and knocks back anyone too close to you, then leaves a little ring of fire with a radius that cannot be modded that damages things only as they pass through the ring or stand on it. Also it adds a little heat damage to projectiles that pass through it. While its CC is undoubtedly useful in a pinch, for 75e it's pretty lacklustre, especially compared to the 50e Accelerant that staggers everything in a way wider area, makes things weaker to heat damage, and has an augment that gives all allies more heat damage on their weapons no matter where they're aiming and lasts for a significant duration. So, here's my suggestion. 1. Move World on Fire to be Ember's 3, and move Fire Blast to Ember's 4. 2. Give Ember a graphic like Nidus &amp; Saryn as her World on Fire charges. Call it ""Heat"". Show exactly how the stats of WoF are changing on a second-by-second basis, maybe. 3. Remove the energy cost from Fire Blast. 4. Rename Fire Blast to ""Overheat"" 5. Overheat vents the heat that has been building up, resetting WoF's charge (+efficiency, +range, -damage) and emitting a Fire Blast that not only generates a ring of fire (radius moddable) but also scorches the ground within that ring to also deal DoT, while at the same time granting Ember a duration buff. Energy cost goes down and duration/strength of buff go up as more heat is vented, as does damage of the Fire Blast. 6. Overheat's full-strength buff, called ""Radiate"" consists of: 25 seconds of 40% heat damage resistance, +33% movement speed, and a passive effect where heat procs suffered will last twice as long as normal, heal Ember instead of hurting her, and slow World on Fire's energy drain by half for their duration. Primarily the idea is that players have an in-kit way of maintaining World on Fire's range without simply turning it on and off, while also giving Fire Blast a hefty buff worthy of being an ability on the 4 key. Furthermore it becomes a viable tactic for use against Hyekka Masters and Napalms to increase survival chances against them. --- Now, moving away from Fire Blast/Overheat &amp; World on Fire... How about we look at *Accelerant?* By all measures, a flawless ability. Simple and effective, apart from one teensy little oversight. Armour resists heat damage fairly effectively and Ancient Disruptors disrupt debuff duration and ability damage output, making Accelerant and World on Fire both pretty lacklustre against the very factions Ember is described as being designed for. So here's the idea: 1. Reduce Accelerant's damage multiplier by half (stick with me here) 2. Grant Accelerant a 40% Heat Damage *Vulnerability* debuff What do I mean by Damage Vulnerability? Well... all health types in this game essentially have multipliers against various damage types. The higher their multipliers, the more damage you do. The lower the multiplier, the less damage you do. This is natural to understand. However, when it comes to armour specifically, there's another factor. Let's look at Alloy Armour and Radiation damage. Do you think it only gains 1.75x damage against it, making it somewhat lacklustre at higher levels? You certainly wouldn't be faulted for thinking that's how it works. But it's so much more than that. Against armour, any damage type which is benefited by a positive damage multiplier, is *also* granted the benefit to *ignore that same percentage of armour in damage calculations.* What this essentially means is that Radiation damage, with its 1.75x multiplier, acts like Bombards only have a quarter of the armour value that they actually do, ignoring 75% of their armour. The idea behind Damage Vulnerability is to directly modify those resistance values on the topmost layer of health types. Accelerant granting 40% damage vulnerability means that Grineer armour would go from a neutral 1x to a beneficial 1.4x, where not only does that mean that heat damage gains 1.40x damage against whatever enemy is being subjected to it (in addition to Accelerant's natural damage multiplier), but the final heat damage value is essentially ignoring 40% of the armour's value in damage calculations. The idea is that with 250% power strength, Ember's Accelerant would make affected enemies take 2x heat damage on top of said heat damage basically completely ignoring armour, never mind the additional damage multiplier she'd have going, which would ordinarily be something like 6.25x at 250% power strength."

Damage reduction stack gain 10% per each enemy upto 50% where further stack gains shift to 3% to 75% (25% DR gain) until it reaches 1% per enemy until 99% where no more stacks can be gained. Enemies damaged with a hammer while marked heals you for 5%/10%/15% of the damage you deal.

During the animation. Titan: Locks Vulcan in a 2 second animation to spawn another Titan with the same number of Temper charges. Newly spawned Titan can be doubled again by the tap cast (if not at 40). 150 energy Concept Notes Vulcan was created with the idea that he needed time to set up to get the most out of his kills rather than out right just smacking everything everything. With this in mind, I admit, he wont be as effective without Arcane Energize or Zenurik, but I think its to the benefit of the concept since he needs these preparations to truly excel and he really wouldnt exist without the more freely spent uses of energy gain. Vulcan was born after thinking a bit on the new melee combo counter and reworked melee mechanics with a heavy dose of plagiarism to Nidus mutation stacks, that one bug where you could equip Sentient weapons and Hammers. Vulcan is a damage frame, whether his damage is too high. It takes a lot of prep to get to that state. The Damage Resist is to help his already pretty hefty survivability. Though Id like to make it tedious enough that you wont seriously go for it on your quick runs. Maybe it is tedious for anything though. "
87,vulnerability,Warframe,A different take on the design of a sentient themed warframe,0,8o054q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/8o054q/a_different_take_on_the_design_of_a_sentient/,2018-06-02 22:11:23,"Preface: I understand that the new Warframe is probably unlikely to become anything near this design, however this is an attempt to channel my expectations on first seeing [the artwork](URL and [model for 'Vlad'](URL into a warframe design. More of a fun thought exercise than serious suggestion. I drew heavily from the game Prototype, and various other [tropes ](URL work as great inspiration. My direction was more 'sentient warframe' than 'eidolon warframe' \- focus on adaptation and a 'sentient curse'. [**Passive \- Sentient Resilience:**](URL Taking damage from any source applies a stacking buff, reducing damage taken by 1&amp;#37; per stack. Stacks up to 30 times. Enemies affected by your abilities are also 'cursed' and explode on death, damaging nearby enemies and healing your warframe. [**Ability 1 \- Frontal Slash:**](URL Your warframes arm morphs into the shape of a blade/claw/hammer/laser, slashing enemies in an arc. *Your average damage ability. Affects enemies in an AoE cone.

Running into enemies knocks them down, also applying 'cursed'. Consumes X energy per Y damage blocked. *The warframe is still vulnerable to rear attacks, however combined with 'Sentient Resilience' may achieve 100\% frontal damage resistance.

Possibly augments other abilities while in use.* I'll stop here before I get into too much detail behind my thought process, but if you have any questions, suggestions or criticism then feel free let me know!"

A 1-shotting festival is not fun, neither is a full tank meta. * We need momentum, maximum turning speed and possibly animation smoothing on enemies so that we can have eidolon-esque small-scale enemies and more difficulty isn't a synonym for more armor&amp;instagib-damage anymore, but can be about aiming as well. As it stands, with the current enemy movements this would be a sh1tfest."

91,vulnerability,Warframe,Dev Workshop: Endless Kuva Survival &amp; Kuva Guardian Changes!,467,86d2vo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/86d2vo/dev_workshop_endless_kuva_survival_kuva_guardian/,2018-03-23 03:58:12,"Greetings, Kuva-thirsty Tenno! Since The War Within launch on November 11th, 2016, Tenno have been introduced to the continually roaming Kuva Fortress. But contrary to its name, no Kuva can be acquired directly from Kuva Fortress missions. Instead, Kuva Siphon/Flood missions on nearby Planets are what offer that delicious Kuva if completed accurately. Kuva is a unique Resource with a particular acquisition method, and we want to make sure the addition of Kuva to the Fortress followed that design intent, while offering players a much requested avenue to acquire it outside of the Siphon/Flood mechanic. Our solution comes in the form of a **permanent Endless Kuva Survival mode on Taveuni in the Kuva Fortress!** This mission will start out like any other Survival mission, but now with a twist! Marked enemies will drop something new: **Kuva Catalysts.** **Developer note:** A Kuva Catalyst carrying enemy will spawn per Life Support tower as either an Eximus or Kuva Guardian. [Kuva Catalyst Drop](URL Picking up this Kuva Catalyst and simply walking up to an unactivated Life Support Tower, transforms the Life Support Tower into a **Kuva Harvester.** Now you must protect this Kuva Harvester for 1 minute (as indicated on your UI) as enemies will now logically and forcefully attempt to destroy it. If they succeed in destroying the Kuva Harvester, you will lose out on both Kuva and the Life Support Tower - they dont mess around with their Kuva! [Kuva Harvester](URL Once the Kuva Harvester is complete, you can grab your successfully earned 200 Kuva from the completed Kuva Harvester. Completed Kuva Harvesters also give a small percentage of Life Support to aid in your literal Survival. **Developer note:** Deciding to make the Kuva be a physical Koolaid bottle-looking drop allows for Resource Boosters and Smeeta Kavats Charm to apply! [Kuva Drop](URL **Please ignore the Clem transmission in place of new Lotus transmissions for completing a Kuva Harvester* The design intent and goal for Kuva Survival is for players, both Public and Solo, to balance risk and reward as they sacrifice their Life Support Towers for precious Kuva. Carefully managing available Life Support Towers and Life Support dropped by enemies becomes increasingly important in order to obtain as much desired Kuva possible. You can see the original work-in-progress version from Devstream #108 here: URL **FAQ from Devstream #108:** * 200 Kuva is awarded per Kuva Harvester- **this value is still subject to change with continued testing/feedback.** Considering the Endless Survival aspect, this number will allow Kuva Survival to sit in the middle between Kuva Siphon and Kuva Flood in regards to the amount of Kuva rewarded. Tenno who want a quicker Kuva routine can still play Siphon or Flood missions, but those who want to acquire this Resource via familiar gameplay (with a twist) can jump into an Endless Kuva Survival! * Kuva awarded per successful Kuva Harvester does not increase as the Endless Survival mission progresses. Our intent is for Kuva Survival to mimic the mechanic of Excavation/Defense with the intensity of Survival. * Kuva Guardians and Kuva Jesters (as seen on Devstream #108) also have a chance of spawning. These enemies add to the twisted variety for Kuva Survival, and gives you a place outside of Siphon/Flood to fight them. Plus, these enemies have been conspicuously missing from the Kuva Fortress.... **Kuva Fortress Survival Improvements:** * Removed cramped and maze-like Kuva Fortress tiles that felt unsuitable for an Endless Survival with an Excavation/Defense twist. * Added a repurposed Fortress Defense tile to Kuva Fortress Survival with improved enemy navigation and traversible areas. **!!NEW!! Kuva Guardian Changes:** In light of all these changes surrounding Kuva, we felt it necessary to make improvement tweaks to the Kuva Guardians (or onion babies as Megan likes to call them). When faced outside of The War Within quest, their mechanic required to turn them vulnerable has been met with some confusion. As an overall change, Kuva Guardians are now easier to turn vulnerable, but will become tougher to kill once they are. **Previously vulnerability flow was:** * Operator Void Blast to stun, then Void Dash when stunned to disarm their Kesheg and turn vulnerable. **NEW vulnerability flow:** * No stun state required. Operator Void Blast OR Void Dash to disarm their Kesheg and turn vulnerable. **General Kuva Guardian Changes:** * Increased base Health from 300 to 400. * Slightly increased the Fire Rate of their Twin Rogga . * Guardian Health type is now in line with the rest of Grineer. * Weaker against Heat and Viral but more resistant to Gas. * Added a red glow around the Kuva Guardian to depict when it is invulnerable. **Please keep in mind that everything you read/see in this Dev Workshop is subject to change as we continue testing and reading feedback up until launch.** We hope to ship this as early as next week, but we of course welcome your constructive feedback and suggestions!"
92,vulnerability,Warframe,Analysis of consequences for implementation of Universal Vacuum,131,87ryqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/87ryqh/analysis_of_consequences_for_implementation_of/,2018-03-29 00:39:14,"People have been asking for UniVac for years and so far, DE has been stubborn about the issue. I decided to analyse what would happen if they just implemented it, and both short term and long term consequences from player and DE standpoint. Note: When talking about mod and prime item prices, I mean the trade value in plat. #Pets With pets becoming a fun and viable alternative, the effect will feel as if they got newly introduced, all over again. These are several interesting points:  Immediate astronomical increase in pet usage. Basically a ""Pet rush"", if you will.  Due to the above, astronomical increase in sales on companion slots and cosmetics, as well as forma and orokin reactors.  Increase in Affinity booster sales due to people Leveling their pets.  Substantial increase of Kavasa Prime collar set price.  Increase in demands to make Pet customization more advanced, like separating armor pieces ala Warframe armor and syandana customization. ( Speculation - Rise of FashionPetFrame.)  Increase in demand to fix retarded Pet AI. (Speculation - probably one of the main reasons why UniVac hasn't happened yet.)  Noticeable increase in Earth and Derelict missions played, due to increase in farming for the pets.  Increase in price of different pet imprints.  Increase in companion mod prices, especially the Hunter set.  Player wall around Master Teasonai in Cetus. Expect perfomance in Cetus to be even lower. #Sentinels While Sentinels lose what used to be their main niche, they still remain usefull due to still bringing a lot of utility, staying close to you and being an additional *gun* on the battlefield.  Marginal decrease in Sentinel usage in the long term due to aforementioned utility and not being hampered by bad AI.  Small decrease in Sentinel related purchases- slots and cosmetics. Mostly affects newer players, as the veterans very likely already got all of those after Vacuum Within. Also, due to Pet Slots being more expensive, still gives a positive to the developers.  Due to Sentinel death no longer being a huge detrimental to the fun of the game, there will be substantial reduction of ""suicides to get the Sentinel back"".  Decrease of demands to give ability to revive dead Sentinels.  Due to the Sentinel death not being such a huge deal anymore, expect price decrease for Primed Regen mod.  Due to the same reason, increase in times a weapon is equipped on the sentinel with its attack precept (because weapon usage on sentinel increases its threat level, making it more likely for the enemies to target and kill it). Small increase in Orokin catalyst sales due to this.  Carrier Prime is dethroned from being the defacto king of the Sentinels (and by extension, companions), due to Sentinel tankiness not being such a huge factor anymore. Coupled with recent weapon changes, Ammo case becomes more situational, lowering the usfullness of Carrier on the whole, making equipping it what it was supposed to be - a choice.  Due to this Diriga and Helios (Prime) become marginally more viable as well.  Marginal decrease in Carrier Prime set price.  Marginal increase in Helios Prime set price.  Increase in ""Detect vulnerability"" mod price.  No change in ""Looter"" mod price because it's meh anyway (OP's own, pretty biased opinion).  Expect increase in number of posts like -""Prisma/Wraith Diriga. When DE?""  Decrease in Shade (Prisma) usage, as Huras Kubrow invisibility outclasses Shade's. Still viable to use and mostly dependent on player choice.  Atlas won't require to have a sentinel equipped anymore for maximum effectiveness. Edit: as well as does Nekros, especially with Despoil+Health conversion build.  Dethcube becomes even more forgotten and neglected. (Time to call Sentinel protective services) #Gameplay and monetisation This encompasses most of the game and is a substantial improvement on nearly all fronts, but mostly focuses on new player experience, as most experienced players run with Vacuum equipped ***anyway***.  The game arguably becomes more fun to play. Not needing to stop zipping around, being a space ninja wizard, to pick up individual loot pickups like a peasant farmer makes for a much better gameplay flow.  Kinda makes the detailed individual resource models pointless, as there will be little chance to observe them. On the other hand,it doesn't matter much since they can be used as decoration anyway.  The begining becomes easier for new players as they can collect ammo, health, energy and resources much easier. No substantial difficulty change to veterans since most of them run with Vacuum anyway or straight up don't need it at all due to being extremely powerful and rich (I guess ChadFrame is a thing).  There is a point to be made for people who dislike automatic pickups of energy, health and ammo, as the pickup might waste some resouces. Can be alleviated if the UniVac could be customized ( for example, different levels of range for each aspect. Don't tell me it would be hard to code, they already talked about splitting Vacuum in 3 parts before and there are already stuff thst isn't being vacuumed).  Huge increase in new player retention(for example, yours truly was on the verge to stop playing Warframe after a month, but after building Carrier and getting Vacuum, I have been actively playing Warframe for 2 years now ^^^^^^Pleasehelpme. ). The starting burn out on being short on resources and mods ( or needing to sweep the floor for them, which is not a fun gamplay) gets pretty much elliminated.  Small decrease in resource boosters being bought by the new players. Speculation - probably another main reason why UniVac hasn't been implemented as DE fears the loss of revenue because of less booster sales, which is, in my personal opinion, misguided. New players who buy resource boosters to alleviate the begining grind, will probably soon write off the game as ""Pay2Win"" or ""Pay2Progress"" and soon leave the game eventually anyway. Veterans and experienced players who need resources run Vacuum anyway (or Kavats, but most of the time those needed resources are automatically collected anyway, like Kuva, or are rare and therefore likely to get marked. And those people probably already are swimming in other resources.) in CONJUNCTION with the boosters. There is no change there.  Decrease in weapon, mod and resource sales from market due to easier farming at the begining - basically newer players will fall for the plat traps much less frequently. In short term - this is a net loss for DE, and forms another basis to why UniVac hasn't been implemented yet. On the other hand, pretty much most of beginer's guides call Market prices a scam, so if the player is serious about playing warframe, there little chance for them to actually fall into the trap of spending on most market items. And those who fall there anyway will still benefit the game if they stay longer, since they are willing to be the whales.  With increase in player retention, long term profit will increase substantially.( But one of the things that will be required to be done would be to re-evaluate market prices, as it's pretty much a scam on most items. Most of the items need their prices cut in half at least. This in turn will also increase the value of Darvo Deals and increase in visits to relays (which DE is desperately trying to achieve. And they don't give us access to simulacrum from arsenal because of that).)  Slight Decrease in Prime Access Pack sales by begining players. This is a big one. As you all know already, the begining experience can be daunting for newer players. And with knowledge that the Market is a scam, there is basically one choice left - buy Prime Access Pack to alleviate begining problems. A lot of players start playing Warframe with purchasing Prime Access, as it is arguably the best cash deal Warframe offers. The thing is, if a player stays for longer, there is higher chance for them to pay for it out of ***WANTING*** it instead of thinking that they ***NEED*** it to make game enjoyable. The real impact is debatable tho, as the pack still retains its good value, but neceesity is decreased somewhat.  Basically, I think the decision of implementing UniVac or not stands on the fact of which type of profit DE prefers - Short term or long term. Before Warframe went huge, there might have been more argument with preferring the first option, as no one knew how the game would do. But times are changing. It's been 5 years ( of open beta, mind you). Warframe is more popular than it has ever been, with constantly being in Steam's top 10 most played games and 30 million registered ~~loosers~~ users to boot, and there is no sign of slowing down. The more long term players Warframe gets, the more chance to get them to become whales. I think it would be in game's best interest. In the end, I think UniVac is unavoidable. Same way as limited revives per day of old got replaced by revives by missions, I think UniVac will arrive eventually. I hope this wall of text was enjoyable to read through. If you think I missed something or dissagree with any point, any criticism is welcome."
93,vulnerability,Warframe,Yet another Ember rework proposal,4,87tpgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/87tpgl/yet_another_ember_rework_proposal/,2018-03-29 04:18:18,"I was working on that rework proposition for quite some time, it is far from perfect and I wanted to play some more Ember before posting it but since Im burning out (ah ha) on the game I decided to post it now. &amp;nbsp; - **Passive** - Ember get passive energy regeneration. - **Fuel the fire**: 50% resistance to heat damage, Heat proc on Ember heals her. - **Overheat**: Heat proc generated by Ember bypass some enemy status resistance. When inflicted*^1* Heat procs generate Overheat. - **[1] Fireball**: - (*tap*) Launch a fireball at the target. Repeat quickly to rapid fire. - (*hold*) Charge a large fireball that consume Overheat. Explode on impact and leave a patch of fire. - **[2] Accelerant**: - (*tap*) For each enemy in the area, if they are affected by an Heat proc, stun them then consume said Heat proc to inflict the total remaining damage as finisher damage. - Restore energy for Ember depending on how many enemies where affected. - **[3] Hyperthermia**: - (*soft channel**^2*) Air around Ember get heated at extreme temperature reducing incoming damage. Each blocked attack drain energy from Ember. - **[4] Eruption**: - (*tap*) Ember release a heat wave damaging enemies in the area. Consume 10-25% Overheat. - (*hold*) Ember release all her heat into the ground releasing highly damaging pillars of fire in the area. Consume all Overheat. &amp;nbsp; #### Augments: - **[1a] Fireball Frenzy**: No idea for that one, so same as current. - **[2a] Flash Accelerant**: Same as current - **[3a] Flare**: Damage absorbed by the shield are stored. On deactivation release said damage in a flash damaging, blinding and lighting enemies on fire. - **[4a] Vapor Wave**: (channeled) Consume Overheat to generate multiples geyser of vapor dealing gas damage in the area, stun enemies and make them vulnerable to heat damage. Increase range, damage and Overheat consumption after a while. &amp;nbsp; *^1* - Generate Overheat if the status *would* proc, which mean that even if enemy is immune to heat proc (i.e. Eidolon) you will gain Overheat. *^2* - Soft channel, by lack of a better term, means that energy is deducted only on hit. So, energy regen still work while this is active. &amp;nbsp; ------------- ## The skill set in details **Fuel the Fire** is thematic, give some Resistance to heat and Heat proc heals you. **Overheat** is made to give an additional resource for Ember to give her some form of scaling and counteract the weaknesses of Heat proc. On weak enemies Overheat gain will be limited (like Nidus for example) but for them you have your main abilities that only need energy, which you should have plenty. Status immunity bypass works on non-boss enemies for Embers abilities and weaponry. **Fireball**, see Staticor, but better, or see Vegeta ki spam if youre into Dragon Ball. Charge time should be one second at worst. Only loss compared to base is that its a two-handed ability (with hand alternating with each Fireball). It should be possible to make it one handed, like if you shoot only one FB you can keep reloading, but the second one will interrupt actions, but its mostly technicality at that point. **Accelerant**: I wanted to make a sort of finisher ability, damage scales with Heat proc on enemies. It also helps you sustain quite a bit with energy regen. Of course, you lose the heat damage scaling, but it is moved to an augment which is fair I hope. **Hyperthermia**: Overheat reborn! But the name was already taken so it had to evolve. Speaking of evolution, the main goal it to give a defensive option to Ember while not making her invincible. To avoid the machinegun effect (making you OOM in a split second) the energy cost should have a cool down per enemy. Like if a heavy gunner hit you it will consume energy on the first hit and then not consume energy on subsequent hit for like 1 or 2 second. Multiple enemies will still melt your energy bar though. **Eruption**: Tap version is a single wave WoF that hit all enemies in range (instead of only 5) and cost a fraction of your Overheat, need line of sight. Charged version is Sargas Ruk Inferno on steroid, it need 50% Overheat at least to be launched and becomes more powerful the more Overheat you have, you need to spend it all for each cast (or maybe you spend 25-50% initially and then you spend more the more you hold, open to discussion of course). &amp;nbsp; For **augments** Im not entirely sure for *1* and *2*. *1* staying the same would be more in line with the other elemental frames. *2* is useful so I dont like changing it, maybe giving more fire damage boost if you hit enemies with it. **Flare** (*3*) Im not so sure of how useful it would be, but I like the idea of Ember having something not scaling on Power Strength. In this iteration it would need line of sight like Excalibur Radiant Blind. It would also act like a CC that activate if you're out of energy. **Vapor Wave** (*4*) is a way to bring back old Firequake WoF. It uses Overheat so you cant use it for long at lower levels. Gas damage is to avoid it making you gain Overheat as it shouldnt auto sustain itself, also it should help teammates differentiate the two version from. Heat vulnerability is the cherry on top, makes some sense since FQ was mostly useful in accelerant builds. Also, it would be nice if Heat vulnerability would NOT scale on Power strength, but on duration for example to keep build diversity. &amp;nbsp; ### In short The main moment to moment idea is to use Fireball to damage fodder enemies while building Overheat, then finishing remaining enemies with Accelerant to regain some of the energy spent. Having Hyperthermia up to protect you the whole time. When there are a lot of enemies use simple Eruption to gain some Overheat. Then when there are lots of tough enemies release your full power Eruption and finish the survivors with your Accelerant. ------------- ## Problem with Ember's current set **Ignition**: Gain energy and power strength while ablaze. Energy regen dont work while channeling, Ember might very well not survive the heat proc, self-damage for heat proc is boring gameplay and require the use of specific weapons. **[1] Fireball**: Damage + AoE on impact. Chargeable. Slow to use, low damage, dont scale with range, charge time is stupid long (2.5 sec). **[2] Accelerant**: Make enemies vulnerable to fire damage. Good ability if costly, scale well with power strength. **[3] Fire Blast**: AoE knock down + Ring of fire Worst ability by far. Ring do bad damage, knock down range is low BUT launch enemies out of the range of your ring. Bonus damage for firing in the ring is nice (and stack with multiple rings) but restrict your movement too much to be useful. **[4] World on Fire**: All the fire, but with lower range. Not that good of an ability in hindsight, too much limits to be useful at higher levels (range, cost, number of targets). Still bullshit strong at lower level though. &amp;nbsp; **[1a] Fireball Frenzy**: Nice idea but you need to hit allies with a fireball Good luck with that. **[2a] Flash Accelerant**: Nice boost to self and teammates, maybe a little short (at least on teammates). **[3a] Fire Fright**: Lesser firequake, also panic can be quite unreliable. Also, how is status chance not CORE to the ability. **[4a] Firequake**: Good augment but with WoF range nerf it is less useful. Also gimped by targeting restriction of WoF. &amp;nbsp; ### Overall 1 and 3 are redundant with 4. 4 is easier to use and more powerful that those two combined. 2 is the only really solid ability. &amp;nbsp; ---------- ## Conclusion In my experience current Ember set is twofold. At lower levels she is a caster frame with limited gameplay that give you intensive amount of power *even* after WoF nerf. At higher level her WoF just cant dish out the damage necessary to do much. As such she is more of a gunner frame that use Accelerant to weaken enemies to your specially build Heat weapon. In both those cases 1 and 3 are barely useful and you mostly use them because you *want* to. The goal of this rework is to make Ember a true caster frame akin to Nidus at all levels, while also avoiding the same issue of her current ability set. Thus, all the skills are made to be used without necessitating weapon use alongside. My idea was to have to favor strength focused builds to use the main ""caster"" version and to have range or duration focused builds concentrated more on weapon usage with overall lower damage but better team utility. The main flaw of this rework, I think, is the loss of scaling with accelerant. I am afraid it might make Vapor Wave mandatory or create a double scaling problem that would make Ember super OP. "

This gamemode offers players a much requested avenue to acquire Kuva outside of the Siphon/Flood mechanic, and on the aptly named Kuva Fortress! Players, both Public and Solo, now balance risk and reward as they sacrifice their Life Support Towers for precious Kuva. The current Kuva awarded per successful Kuva Harvester is set at 200. A plethora of test runs and acquired stats showed that 200 Kuva sat safely in between Kuva Siphon and Kuva Flood missions. This value is not set in stone - we are eager to read your feedback from your own playthroughs! How it works: - Taveuni on the Kuva Fortress is now the new home of Endless Kuva Survival. - A marked enemy carrying a Kuva Catalyst will spawn per Life Support Tower. - Picking up this Kuva Catalyst and simply walking up to an unactivated Life Support Tower, transforms the Life Support Tower into a Kuva Harvester. Now you must protect this Kuva Harvester for 1 minute (as indicated on your UI) as enemies will now logically and forcefully attempt to destroy it. If they succeed in destroying the Kuva Harvester, you will lose out on both Kuva and the Life Support Tower. - Once the Kuva Harvester is complete, 200 Kuva is awarded to everyone! Completed Kuva Harvesters also give a small percentage of Life Support to aid in your literal Survival. - Worth noting that this 200 Kuva is awarded the same way as Kuva Siphon/Flood missions, as opposed to a physical Kuva kool aid bottle drop that was proposed in the Dev Workshop as. Meaning, you do not need to return to the Tower to physically pick up your Kuva, it is instantly awarded (still affected by Boosters and Smeeta Charm). [Check out the full Dev Workshop here for examples and FAQ](URL **Kuva Fortress Survival Improvements:** - Removed cramped and maze-like Kuva Fortress tiles that felt unsuitable for an Endless Survival with an Excavation/Defense twist. - Added a repurposed Fortress Defense tile to Kuva Fortress Survival with improved enemy navigation and traversible areas. - Improved enemy spawn flow and navigation in the Kuva Fortress Survival tilesets. *Kuva Guardian Changes:** In light of all these changes surrounding Kuva, we felt it necessary to make improvement tweaks to the Kuva Guardians. When faced outside of The War Within quest, their mechanic required to turn them vulnerable has been met with some confusion. As an overall change, Kuva Guardians are now easier to turn vulnerable, but will become tougher to kill once they are. Previously vulnerability flow was: Operator Void Blast to stun, then Void Dash when stunned to disarm their Kesheg and turn vulnerable. NEW vulnerability flow: No stun state required. Operator Void Blast OR Void Dash to disarm their Kesheg and turn vulnerable. **General Kuva Guardian Changes:** - Increased base Health from 300 to 400. - Slightly increased the Fire Rate of their Twin Rogga . - Guardian Health type is now in line with the rest of Grineer. - Weaker against Heat and Viral but more resistant to Gas. - Added a pulsing red glow around Kuva Guardians for a few seconds to depict when they are vulnerable (similar to the Teralyst).

95,vulnerability,Warframe,[SUGGESTION] Creating weapon boosting elemental warframe damaging skills,3,7z6djv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7z6djv/suggestion_creating_weapon_boosting_elemental/,2018-02-22 02:33:15,"It is no secret that some caster warframe fall of pretty badly in term of damage at higher levels. While I'm sure that this isn't the first time something similar as been proposed I want to propose weapon that would allow warframe that deal element damage to scale into the late game. ## The main goal The main idea is simple: Create a way for some caster frame damage to scale into the late game without having to have built in scaling mechanics, while avoiding breaking the game at the same time. ### The weapon should: * Allow you to boost the **elemental damage of the skill** you use. * Allow you to **chose which element** to boost (either an aura mod, or in construction if build like a zaw/amp). * Allow you to **modify/buff your elemental proc** (duration, damage, immunity bypass, armor reduction, vulnerability to other damage type, etc.). * Have infinite ammo. ### The weapon shouldnt: * Scale with frames/abilities that already scales well (i.e. nidus or nova 2). * Be mandatory for certain frames. * Be super hard to obtain / build (The goal is to allow certain to see more play for everyone, not just veteran after a ten-month farm!). * Be powerful by themselves (Since the goal is to emphasis ability use). ## The weapon in practice The weapon boost one of the four main elements (fire, cold, electric, toxin) but only while in hand. You can mod that weapon to raise the elemental damage boost and modify elemental proc. It can also attack, benefit from elemental damage enhancement and proc but has low/no crit chance and/or damage. ### Effect on caster frame * **Ember** is, of course, a straight forward frame to showcase this weapon concept on. All damage is fire based so all damages are boosted. * **Volt** and **Frost** are pretty straightforward also, even though it may make them a bit too versatile. * **Saryn** is where problem starts. Her kit does 3 types of elemental damage, Toxin, Corrosive and Viral. Problem is, either we make staff give bonus (like 50%) to elements its combine into with risk of breaking others frame, or we make exception for her (like build it in her passive). * **Chroma** could be in interesting case. Not broken since 1 and 4 deals lackluster damages. * **Nezha** would scale, but I dont think it is interesting to do, nor should it cause problem (unless Im misjudging). * **Oberon** and **Mag** are also problematic. While those two abilities could benefit for buffed damage, Radiation boosting staff cannot exist else we will have lots of problem and Magnetic can also become problematic is left unchecked (also it would be inconsistent with the 4 elements rule). Build in passive can also be a solution but I dont like making so many exceptions. * **Banshee**, **Limbo**, **Mesa**, **Nova**, **Nidus** and **Octavia** wouldnt scale (nor do they need to). * **Hydroid** (is a casting frame?) could be a maybe but damage types doesnt fit. * **Equinox** wouldnt scale and would be a big can of worm if she could. And I'm pretty sure I forgot some frames... ## The Form of the weapon So, what would it look like? Like [this](URL More seriously it would take two main form. * Two handed: The most powerful * One handed: Less powerful but can be used in off-hand while dual wielding (with secondary or melee). Obviously in that form it would use the primary slot. ## Problematic So that idea if, of course, not without issue. **First**: Creating a weapon that would be useful to maybe six or seven frames (by pushing it) would be wasteful. Yes maybe, but at the same time it is opening the door for more caster frame with more focus on ability dealing damage or on the elemental proc aspect. **Second**: It would force certain frame (Ember and Saryn mostly) to wield them in order to be viable. Well ... Yes ... I admit that, outide of a clever rework, it is clearly a possibility. I still think that ""at least they would be viable"" but I very well can understand that it would be a concern to some. **Third**: Wouldn't it be simpler to simply make weapon mods that do the same thing? Yes and no. Yes, it would be simpler, same way some frames use stat stick, but at the same time designing those mod (quite a lot of them at that) in a way that does not interact with others weapon mods (specifically proc modification) could pose a lot of problem. That way both are separated and won't have bad influence on each other. **Fourth**: People wouldnt want to replace their primary weapon. While it will clearly be a problem for some I'm sure it won't for other. Even in that case the important part is the overall concept, it doesn't *need* to be in the primary slot. ## Conclusion (tl;dr) The creation of a weapon that buff elemental skill of frames would allow some frame to see more play and allow more diversity in the way to build and play those frames. It is also a way to cater to the mage loving crowd and to those who like the idea of Ember and Saryn being monster at higher levels. It also open opportunities for more caster frame in the future. Bonus it could have some fun implication with Damage 2.5/3.0. ----- Even though I have no real hope to see that concept into the game (being realistic, also I do it for fun) I'm interested to have your opinion on it or alternative you could have. I have also some idea for reworking certain frame (Chroma and Ember, I promise it is a coincidence!) made to work with that weapon that I'll maybe post at some point. "

Lets me start this post by providing you with my warframe background. I've played WF since the closed beta in October of 2012. Currently a pretty high MR, I've seen its many iterations from the long since forgotten skill trees to Acrid being the best weapon in the game(now a 6 forma waste of space, DE pls y u do dis?) to the release of the start chart to now. That being said, sometimes shit just can't be fixed. It needs to be redone. Shields. (stfu about armor and damage being a problem this post isnt about that) The current problem with shields, at their core, is that they do not scale into endgame. Regardless of shield mods you will never exceed 5k effective shielding without manipulating your squad comp to some degree. This equates to dying after 2 hits from anything in a sortie 3 mission. Adding armor to shields only further screws the armor problem up so lets not make that worse. I propose shields are changed to pips. Individual charges that each absorbs a single hit of damage. A very simple concept that would allow caster frames to scale much better with endgame content. Enemies with rapid fire weapons would directly counter this mechanic as a way to offset its effectiveness. Change existing shield mods to the new pip system, for every 100 shielding 1 pip? Harrow and trin now add pips instead of overshields. New mods could easily be implemented to synergize with the new system. Mods such as: The final pip of shields provides immunity to status. (Ie. All shields must be removed before status vulnerability is allowed) Reduce shield recharge delay. (Why the F isnt this already a mod?) Plus 3 pips. Increases recharge speed. (New nightmare mods) Using an ability regenerates a pip. Using an ability without energy consumes a pip.(no you cant use this at the same time as the one above it, you savages) When a pip is removed, a condition is removed. Movement speed is increased 10%. Now, counter arguments to this. With so many pips, shield frames would be almost unstoppable and are not meant to be tankier than inaros, oberon, nidus, or rhino. Yes, you are correct. So lets start casters with 7 pips, and add or reduce the base pips after some player feedback? Dps start with 3 or 4 pips. Enough to give time to counter that fatal blow. Certain frames like valkyr only 1 or 2 pips for their abilities to be used but leave them as health tanks. There isn't anything wrong with shields, you don't need a massive change like this.

99,vulnerability,Warframe,WHAT IF: Puncture Procs (+ Armour),10,7slgen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7slgen/what_if_puncture_procs_armour/,2018-01-24 18:24:18,"WHAT IF: ----- ...Puncture Procs increased enemy vulnerability to every damage type by +15~20%? As armour works right now, any damage type that gains bonus damage against armour *also* ignores that same percentage of armour. Radiation, for example, is only affected by 25% of a Bombard's usual Alloy Armour value because it's 75% weak to it. Puncture is only affected by Ferrite 50%. Functionally, this would mean that with enough puncture procs, Radiation would do 1.9~1.95x extra damage against Alloy and also ignore 90~95% of the armour, and Puncture would be 1.65~1.7x and ignore 65~70% against Ferrite. This way, instead of having to adjust armour calculations directly, you could strike two birds with one stone by making Puncture procs actually useful. Corrosive procs would be an alternative for weapons that don't have good puncture. *(Also magnetic procs could get the damage output debuff that Puncture loses in this idea, up to 90% like the initial rework would have made happen.)* "

I only have Grineer bosses covered (in general) and these are just suggestions. If you have any others, please share if you'd like. If you want to suggest a change in one of mine, go ahead. Just keep things civil and avoid negativity or comments just based on opinions. I'm just trying to lock down on actual solutions/suggestions. What I have so far are as follows: **Vay Hek on Earth** * Shoot three (OBVIOUS AND BIG ENOUGH) points on his body within a time limit (similar to Kela's buttons) to open up his weak spot to break invulnerability. * Shoot three spots so little drones pop out and if you hit those three drones, they get confused and attack him, making him vulnerable and distracted. * For the arena fight, first stage: Do a simple hack somewhere, or insert a datamass (that Lotus drops at a set location) into a control tower to make his orbital stroke drones come out and call strikes down on him, breaking invulnerability. * OR A specialized turret could be hacked and used to hit him with a marker, and the orbital strikes come down on him. This breaks invulnerability and leaves slows him down/stuns. (it would also be a nice kick in the ego for him. i can imagine his outraged dialogue) * Reduce or remove the energy drain of his red beam attacks (or make them very rare, or based on a limited number of charges). **General Sargus Ruk** * At the very least, make the exhaust point less blinding/confusing (clear that you need to hit them) or make them easier to hit (bigger?) * Have a way to lure him to something. You activate it to lure him, then make it explode/shoot intense flames, which overheats his suit immediately and makes him vulnerable (either directly or through his exhaust). * Use a machine to call something into the room that you can use to cause his suit to malfunction (shocking arc-traps) to make him vulnerable. **Lieutenant Lech Kril** * A line of cable or track transports items (heavy metal beams, explosive barrels, etc.) through little gates above the stage. There are points below them that are obviously lining up with the cable/track, specifically where you can lure Lech Kril (maybe make a console to hack to summon a harpoon like turret to the location. Grab Lech with it and hold him in the right spot). With timing, break off one of the items being transported above to land on Lech Kril for a vulnerability period (bursting a pipe/hose on him). * Make melee attacks more effective towards slicing/smashing the hoses on his back (make them more obvious, maybe glowing or highlighted. A lot of people simply don't get what they are supposed to do). * Make large equipment hang over the stage where it can be damaged to fall on him (less timing, more so an issue of just getting him under it)(I really just want some irony where he gets squished. Stupid hammer...) **Tyl Regor** (not massively annoying, but still has periods where he is not in the arena until manics are killed, or he is in stealth) * Stage 1: Make a way to break his stealth, through using Arc-traps spawned and shocking puddles in the area, or some other trap. * Stage 2/3: Make traps/lures for the manics/manic bombards (so players are less likely just trying to find them in stage 2) or make a way to push them into the surrounding water reliably and shock them (stage 2 to stun so you can attack, stage 3 to kill). * Destroy points on his statue (middle of room) to drop during first stage to stun enemies with a shock-wave that are running around, maybe hit them for knock-down These are just Grineer bosses, and I skipped Kela and Vor since their fights are either well done enough, or generally simple. Kela, though the rollers are flippin obnoxious, has a more direct way of bringing her into vulnerability. Vor is more simple; all you do is kill the Grineer he summons to make him vulnerable again. Corrupted Vor is always vulnerable in his glowy bits and though he teleports about, he's not too bad, just well armored with more health. "
101,vulnerability,Warframe,"Guns are for killing, NOT Crowd Control (IPS Changes)",1259,7ko3lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7ko3lw/guns_are_for_killing_not_crowd_control_ips_changes/,2017-12-19 07:54:05,"I don't understand the nature of these changes. Making impact ragdoll enemies everywhere sounds counterintuitive to killing everything quickly, it just makes things difficult. And puncture reducing damage of enemies is irrelevant if they're dead. Most people don't spend over 10 seconds killing a single enemy, they spend 10 seconds killing tens of enemies and puncture procs hardly reduce any of that damage since it only applies to the target you're aiming at. Instead, puncture procs should give enemies vulnerability, making them take more damage from sources. Impact procs should deal a flat burst of your weapons damage in an AOE (A proc would deal 5+/- bullets worth of damage) or strip armor, but corrosive would need to be changed. I think DE is too adamant about having CC effects for guns. CC effects aren't bad, but they certainly should not be the main point of guns like DE is changing puncture and impact into. When a gun is too much about CC, you get guns like the Glaxion which have been irrelevant for the longest time, and forever will be if it's damage is complete crap in comparison to the higher (or even mid) tier."
102,vulnerability,Warframe,What we can do with Impact/Puncture instead.,82,7kolvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7kolvj/what_we_can_do_with_impactpuncture_instead/,2017-12-19 09:08:51,"Personally, I think a better idea for these damage types is to give them a unique but competitive way to KILL ENEMIES FASTER. While CC has its place, the fact of the matter is that we use weapons by and large to kill our targets, not subdue them. Impact should inflict Break, a proc that takes off a flat amount (based on the weapon's Impact damage) of Armor or Shields and staggers the enemy. Repeated procs would amplify the Break's damage each time, and increase the stagger duration. Puncture should inflict Vulnerability, causing parts of the enemy's body to be highlighted and take additional damage. Bigger hits would cause bigger damage zones with higher damage multipliers, while repeated smaller hits would stack up to create a large spot as well. Corrosive could also be changed to inflict a percentage-based Armor eating DoT that stacks, in order to give Impact and Corrosive each their own niche."
103,vulnerability,Warframe,Damage 3.0: What Even Are Crits?,0,7dnlbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7dnlbw/damage_30_what_even_are_crits/,2017-11-18 07:06:06,"I noticed in devstream 101 that there is now open discussion on the prospect of damage 3.0. This seems like a good time to focus on something that has bothered me for a while: what distinguishes critical hits in Warframe from simply increased base damage? Sure, crits have a level of uncertainty to them, but I *dare* you to entertain for even a moment that that is why people use them, or even relevant to the gameplay experience of people using crit builds. Warframe doesn't have a strong competitive scene, which is why noone has gotten upset about the random aspect of crits the way they do in other games. But what is the argument *for* crits? Ultimately they are just a means of damage buffing a weapon that requires two stats to be raised simultaneously to be efficient. They don't have any interesting effects other than making your damage text fancy colours. I have seen a few suggestions for damage 3.0 from fans, but they are all focused on status, as, I think, are the devs. But considering what a massive change damage 2.0 brought to the way the game functions, I think it is worth taking a hammer to a little more than just underappreciated status effects. Obviously I wouldn't have raised this if I didn't have some sort of proposed change, but I would welcome any alternatives that also make *critical hits an interactive mechanic distinct from raw weapon damage*. Crit 3.0 Critical Damage Multiplier: This, much as before, would be the multiplier your damage receives when it is a critical hit. Crit 3.0 Critical Damage ""Chance"": Functions very differently however. Your critical damage chance reflects the functional size of enemies 'head' or head equivalent hitboxes, which are the area that you must strike for a critical hit. Not so much as a volume thing (We have bullet attractor to let people shoot several metres to one side of an enemy and headshot them), but much as Sonar and Target Vulnerability allow weakpoints to be painted onto targets, higher critical chance could allow for enemy necks, shoulders, and eventually even the entire upper torso to be included as 'headshots', which in this case would just be 'critshots'. Exceptionally low crit chance, under 15%, would result in areas smaller than what we would traditionally think of as the head being the critical hit zone. Eventually the measly 2.5% weapons would need to strike a small point in the centre of the forehead. As you reach 100% critical chance, a maximum critical hit area equal to about half of the enemy model is reached. Upon exceeding that, a new orange/red crit box is created which expands out to a maximum of one quarter of the model, then one eighth, IE each 100% crit you reach, there are diminishing returns in terms of the area covered, but you have no diminishing return on the amount of multiplicative damage that allows you to do as you have now. There's already a lot of things with heads that aren't uh... headlike in the game. Doubtless some enemies would be incompatible with this approach, which would lead to them being crit immune in the same way some already are, and some other things are currently status immune. Ideally the system might apply to some extent to other weakpoints, though that is a dangerous road since it could potentially render Lephantis invulnerable to certain party layouts etc. Weird crit effects like the Vigilante set bonus? Can be kept as is. If anything, it would be much more exciting when it is so much more distinct from the normal crit mechanics. Anyway, I open discussion to your thoughts on the matter. EDIT: In view of the first few responses, I should make it clear that I am aware of the effect that critical hits have on the headshot multiplier already. Technically your critical damage is currently non-interactive with headshots, which leaves your critical chance as the chance that you get a 4x multiplier on headshots rather than a 2x multiplier. IE, making the damage boost from headshots unreliable. I think this is a weird and undesirable dynamic."
104,vulnerability,Warframe,"With the Companion Rework announcement, here's an old idea with a new twist",15,7dvilo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7dvilo/with_the_companion_rework_announcement_heres_an/,2017-11-19 07:29:33,"#####Preface This post isn't going to address the AI problems. That's a whole different issue. My goal with this post is to provide an expansion to the current Companion system, the first half of which may or may not be tricky on the DEveloper end, but the second half of which should be relatively easy. Here's the first half of my suggestion, which you've probably seen before. #Let us use Sentinels and Pets at the same time. Neither Pets nor Sentinels contribute much to our power as a player. While they give utility like Vacuum or Santuary and Shelter, I doubt that we'd suddenly reach new levels of overpowering if we could use both. To be honest I think a Reactor or Catalyst or even a mandatory mod like Serration or Hornet strike adds more to our power than even a fully built Pet or Sentinel. #####I think it's a big opportunity to further players' build diversity that wouldn't shift the power bar by much. If we could use both, it'd be cool to see how people would expand their build outside the currently static builds made of staple mods. For the most part it seems Sentinels provide more defensive options, while Pets provide more offensive ones. So with that sort of theme in mind, it wouldn't be too far-fetched to use both, one for offense and one for defense, or two offensive or defensive options if one were so inclined. *For example,* since you'd only need to run Sanctuary or Shelter, and one Animal Instinct, you could fit more Precepts or class-wide mods on your other Companion. You wouldn't necessarily need to run Guardian if you're using a Raksa with Protect, or Dig on your Sahasa if you're using Ammo Case on your Carrier. So, going forth on the assumption that using both wouldn't make or break the meta, there is a problem. **Mod diversity.** Even with the extra space, there wouldn't be a ton of change to current combinations, just because of the sparsity of Pet/Sentinel mods that aren't breed/class specific. It'd be nice if this rework introduced some new generic mod abilities, ala Scavenger for Pets or Looter for Sentinels(if they made it non-specific to Carrier.) If it did, I think the companion system could really shine. &gt;For example edit: I usually use Helios Prime. 99% of the time my build consists of &gt; Enhanced Vitality | Primed Regen | Targeting Receptor | Detect Vulnerability | Investigator &gt; Vacuum | Sanctuary | Sacrifice | Animal Instincts | Guardian So under the proposed system Animal Instincts, Sanctuary, and possibly Guardian would be able to be handled on the Pet side. That's 2(3) mod slots in which I could fit other mods. However, while it could certainly spice things up, my only options are Accelerated Deflection Calculated Redirection Fired Up Coolant Leak Medi-Ray Self Destruct Shield Charger Spare Parts While I certainly wouldn't complain about being able to slot these mods in at all, that list does leave a little bit to be desired. Accelerated Deflection, Self Destruct, and Spare Parts are not great as far as mods go. Coolant Leak isn't either, but I think it's pretty cool so I'd rate it above those three. Fired Up is kinda niche as far as I know, useful on the Deth Machine Rifle, but I wouldn't use it with Deconstructor Prime. So that leaves Medi-Ray, Calculated Redirection and Shield Charger. Good mods, but if everyone just slots them into their Sentinels that's not exactly diversifying things is it? &gt;My typical Smeeta build is as follows &gt; Animal Instinct | Medi-Pet Kit | Link Health | Sharpened Claws | Bite &gt; Swipe | Link Shields | Shelter | Charm | Maul Using my Sentinel for Shelter and Animal Instinct would free up two slots for Link Armour Link Shields Loyal Companion Pack Leader Pounce Scavenge Sense Danger Territorial Aggression Of these, I'd probably only consider Link Shields, Pounce, and Pack Leader. So not a whole lot of diversifying there either. The Companion mod pool is sparce. There's not a whole lot of mods that capture your attention, and you can fit most of the ones that do into the 10 slots we have available. Thus the other half of my idea is this. #New Sentinel-wide or Pet-wide ability mods. Here are a few ideas after a quick brainstorm. &gt;* Enemies killed by your Companion have a chance to drop Health orbs. &gt;* Sentinel will periodically generate an Energy Orb &gt;* Sentinel highlights Eximus/VIP targets &gt;* Pet will rush to your aid if knocked down or grappled &gt;* Pet will release knockdown AoE if surrounded by ""#"" or more enemies &gt;* Added seconds to hacking That last one sounds familiar right? Oh yeah it's *Intruder,* a underused Warframe mod. Going with that tune, an easy way to expand the Companion mod pool would be to move some of the widely under-utilized Warframe Mods to the Sentinel mod pool, or add in Companion equivalents. If I could have the effect of some of those mods from equipping them on my Companion instead of my Warframe, I might actually use them. Things like &gt;* Warm Coat &gt;* Antitoxin &gt;* Master Thief &gt;* Rapid Resilience &gt;* Retribution To take the idea to an extreme, they could even give them an Aura slot. Medi-Ray already functions kinda like an Aura, and so does Coolant Leak to an extent. A range limit would make sense, and anything like Energy Siphon would probably be broken, but some of the Auras that tend to gather dust could work. &gt;* Emp Aura &gt;* Infested Impedance &gt;* ""Weapon"" Amps &gt;* Physique &gt;* Shield Disruption &gt;* Speed Holster &gt;* Scavenger Mods(for non-Carrier users) Short of an actual Slot, they could still add some of them to Companions mod pool. Not only would this diversify the mod pool for our companions, giving us competition for those 10 slots we have, it'd also probably be easy to reuse the assets from the Warframe mods on a Companion mod. #####The Last Word This isn't a be all end all solution. I'm definitely in the boat that thinks the Companion AI needs improvement. There's also plenty of reason why this wouldn't happen, like it effectively giving us Universal Vacuum^(TM), or the DEvs wanting players to have to choose between one or the other. As for that second reason, I personally believe that the choice between **which** Pet, Sentinel, and Sentinel weapon, to use would be enough, but that's just my view. ###TLDR; &gt;Let us use Sentinels and Pets at the same time. Neither are great outside of utility, and they wouldn't break the game if we *could* use them both. Also, **make new mods** for them, and consider letting us get the effects of some of the underused Warframe and Aura mods, like *Rapid Resilience* or *Speed Holster*, from our Companions by adding those mods, or their equivalents in new mods, to *their* mod pool.

105,vulnerability,Warframe,Naramon can disarm enemies that normally can't be disarmed.,56,7ik747,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7ik747/naramon_can_disarm_enemies_that_normally_cant_be/,2017-12-09 14:01:26,"In addition, from my limited testing, it seems operator powers in general (confusion by naramon, zenurik slow, etc) ***do not face the same restrictions*** as warframe powers do (i.e. diminishing returns, immunities, nullifiers, etc.). I really hope that this is intended function rather than a bug, as it gives operator powers arguably the *only* advantage over using warframe equivalents. Now with that said, before you attempt this for yourselves, be warned that disarming *does break some boss fights*, primarily those revolving around temporary vulnerability triggers. By break, I mean that ***it renders the boss fight impossible to progress***. This doesn't include bosses that are invulnerable between phases (like Vor). I'll tabulate this at the bottom of this post, but you can have a look at some of the results in [this album](URL But as a second warning: for some bosses, despite being disarmed, they're able to *spam their melee attacks* ***ridiculously fast***, at least 5 strikes a second. This includes Captain Vor, Kela de Thaym, and Tyl regor; Lech kril uses his baton normally, but doesn't freeze himself; the rest either use their normal melee attacks (like zanuka) or don't attack at all (like raptor).

106,vulnerability,Warframe,[Suggestion] Some ideas on how to make Mass Vitrify more viable,20,7imuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/7imuit/suggestion_some_ideas_on_how_to_make_mass_vitrify/,2017-12-10 00:58:30,"I think we can all agree that the recent update to Gara's Mass Vitrify made the ability pretty much useless on more difficult missions even with a build dedicated to durability. I'd like to pitch some ideas to remedy the situation without making the wall completely invincible. Foreword: spare me your preach of MV being a crowd control ability. With the sluggish expansion, high energy cost and immediate vulnerability to weapons fire from unaffected enemies, it's just not good for CC. &amp;nbsp; **Idea 0: massive buff to health, or damage absorption (like Snow Globe)** The most obvious and laziest solution. A buff to the wall's health would solve the immediate issue of MV being akin to wet tissue paper, but it wouldn't solve the issue of *balance*. A wall that's nearly invulnerable to enemies on Belenus in wave 1 would be just as bad against a horde of enemies in wave 20 and beyond. Let's not consider this as a complete solution. &amp;nbsp; **Idea 1: shield-like regeneration.** Like the player's shield, damaged or broken segments could reform and regenerate health over time when not under fire. This would give an alternative (more importantly, a *choice*) to dropping and re-casting the wall. Then, should the player choose to try and repair the wall, they'd be forced to be more present in the situation. It would also give Spectrorage better synergy (we all love synergy, right?) with MV. &amp;nbsp; **Idea 2: Fortress of Deva.** The idea is not new - it has been pitched several times. It's also present in Transylvanian folklore. Enemies that are vitrified take damage over time (scaling with armour, of course). Damage done to those enemies heals (or reinforces) the wall and maybe even repairs broken segments. Once again, this would encourage players to do more than just raise the wall and stand by. It would benefit them to cast the wall when several enemy units can be vitrified to maximize its durability. Proactive players could even keep a kennel of enemies using Spectrorage. &amp;nbsp; **Idea 3: channeled reinforcement** This idea would allow the player to channel more glass into the wall by re-casting MV - a little like Snow Globe's stacking mechanic. It works in two stages. The first stage is identical to the current casting mechanism of MV. The player begins casting, which forms a wall that expands until stopped by the player, the time limit is reached, or the energy is depleted. The resulting wall is thin and fragile, each segment having the base health that depends on armour and ability strength. The second stage reinforces the wall. While inside the cylinder, the player can cast MV again to layer more glass onto the wall, increasing its health and repairing broken segments. To prevent the player from reinforcing the wall ad infinitum, health gain is a logarithmic function of current health (the same amount of health gain takes longer the more health the wall has, eventually capping out) and energy consumption per second is an exponential function of the wall's health (higher health means faster energy consumption). This would create an effective health cap where very little health is gained, and also give players a choice to raise a quick, fragile wall or spend time and energy reinforcing it. The caveat here is re-casting the wall. The player would either have to smash it with Shattered Lash or leave its radius. Illustrations: URL There's also a political joke that I'm not going to make. *edit*: grammar is hard."

108,vulnerability,Warframe,[Spoiler] Putting the Ninja back in Space Ninja Wizards,21,70jp5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/70jp5b/spoiler_putting_the_ninja_back_in_space_ninja/,2017-09-17 08:01:14,"My Idea for an Operator Rework On a devstream some time back, one of the devs (DE Scott?) explained that part of the reason why they created the Operators as a game mechanic is because the team was frustrated trying to come up with new challenging content when not every frame has the same level of utility available to them. The Operator gives them some room to create a handful of skills that every player will have available to them at all times. **Idea focus #1: Operators are Toolkits** Warframe is advertised as Space Ninja Wizards, but frankly it feels a whole lot more like Demi-God-of-Death Genocide Simulator. The stealth side of gameplay is sorely lacking. Aside from a very small handful of frames, it seems like DE's idea of stealth is, ""You can't pull the alarm if you're already dead."" **Idea Focus #2: Every player is a Ninja** Aside from the ""Angsty Emo Teen"" aesthetic, a big problem a lot of players have with using the Operators is it interrupts the flow of play and slows it down compared to using the frames. A significant part of what makes Warframe unique is the high-speed momentum style. Using the Operator should increase your mobility, at the cost of vulnerability, which can be sidestepped with high-level skill. **Idea Focus #3: Sharpen the Risk/Reward balance** The general idea is this: if our warframes are the all powerful Wizards, then our Operators should be the Ninjas. a) Charging your Void Energy while in your warframe is no longer just timer based, but can also be built up through Melee attacks. b) Operators base movement mode is running, and the base run speed for all Operators should be 1.20 on the warframe speed scale. c) All current parkour abilities (Slide, Roll, Bullet Jump/Void Dash, Wall Hang, Wall Run) will translate over to the Operator in some fashion. While performing these parkour moves, the Operator shifts into the Void just like they currently do during Void Dash. While in the Void, the player's Void Energy will rapidly recover, and any attack moves made will shift the Operator back into normal space. Take note that while in the Void, the player is still visible to all enemies, and susceptible to certain enemies (Enemies deal greatly reduced damage, Boss attacks and Nullifier Bubbles drop the Operator back into normal space). d) Doing a Slide Attack will perform a Void Cyclone, drawing enemies in a moderate area together towards the player and knocking them down. Using Void Dash to pass through enemies will continue to restore a large portion of Void Energy. Using Void Dash and Void Cyclone will no longer consume Void Energy. e) Void Beam and Void Blast remain largely unchanged, but will now deal Void Damage, an independent damage type that bypasses both Shields and Armor, and deals a flat amount of damage plus an additional 5% of the targets total HP per damage instance. Bosses and Nullifier Bubbles are immune to the additional percent based damage and stun effects. f) While in Operator form the warframe will be taken over by Specter AI. g) Tangential Sidenote: Completing a mission (designated by the completion of the mission objective, instead of by extraction) without allowing any alarms to be raised will apply a random credit, affinity, or resource booster to the endscreen mission results rewards. **Hotkeys 1-4 will now provide new Operator abilities focusing on Utility.** 1) Shroud: The Operator's form becomes translucent, making them invisible to enemies/cameras/laser traps, but reduces movement speed to 0.8 on the warframe scale. Animation switches to crouched/walking speed, and a screen filter will be applied to signify use of Shroud. Dealing or receiving damage, or making contact with enemies will return the Operator to visible status. While active, the warframe will also become invisible, and will follow the Operator at a moderate distance while refraining from engaging enemies. Parkour moves can be used while maintaining Shroud so long as you continue to avoid making bodily contact with the enemies. 2) Union: Only useable on lesser Grineer or Corpus humanoid enemies that are unaware or that have been stunned with Void Blast. Requires close range and a short uninterrupted channel time, during which the target will remain stunned. The Operator transfers their conscience into the body of the target. If the alarm has not been raised, and no enemies are within eyesight at the end of the channeling, the Operator may continue the mission within this body without suspicion. While within this body, one can walk and interact with consoles without setting off the alarm. If one wishes, they can use the equipped weapon of the body and start attacking enemies, returning to Operator form upon the body's death. Parkour moves are disabled while Union is active. The Operator can leave the body early by performing a Void Dash. Using Union on a second body while the first body is still active will vaporize the first body instantly, leaving a short window of vulnerability to the Operator. Elite enemies (Eximus, Bombards, Techs, Bosses, etc.) and those affected by Nullifier Bubbles are Immune to this ability. Abilities 3 and 4 to be determined as need be. I'm sure everyone has tons of ideas for these slots. Remember, Void Abilities should be focused on Utility, not Damage or Defense. "

Never the less, you have to find this ridiculously ambiguous enemy (which is RNG to even have spawn), within a mission in which the fight is not even the main objective. The fight itself is lacking in general; it is essentially a bullet sponge boss will an extremely brief window of vulnerability.

110,vulnerability,Warframe,So you want to play Equinox?,95,6qiug9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/6qiug9/so_you_want_to_play_equinox/,2017-07-31 04:09:14,"Oh boy, this one's gonna be a doozy. It's time do do another review, this time for everyone's favorite gender-swapping frame; Equinox. To a new player, Equinox seems *very* intimidating due to a kit jam-packed with abilities. Equinox boasts a whopping seven abilities, and two forms. The gist of what Equinox really does is supporting with auras. As before, this guide is aimed at players that have never played Equinox before, or did and felt overwhelmed. You Equinox mains out there will undoubtedly be more versed in her (his? xyr? attack helicopter?) most effective builds, so share below if you think I'm stupid or if you just want to add to the conversation. Please remember that we are all trying to learn here, and most of all, have fun (it is just a game after all) Other guides [here!](URL #Stats HEALTH: 100 SHIELDS: 100 ARMOR: 100 ENERGY: 150 SPRINT: 1.15 POLARITIES: -(aura) D V #Abilities ###Passive Equinox converts 10% of health and energy orbs to restore energy (from health orbs) and health (from energy orbs). Choosing light colors (in the default palette, this only applies to white and light grays as far as I have noticed) will cause Equinox to start the mission in Day Form, and dark colors (the rest) will cause our androgynous friend to start in Night Form. These passives aren't huge, but with certain frames that cause energy and health to drop more frequently (Oberon and Nekros mostly) Equinox can stay relatively healthy. ###Metamorphosis Equinox Switches forms, temporarily silencing itself(?). Upon switching to Day Form, Equinox gains a boost to weapon damage and movement speed for a short time. Switching to Night Form grants a boost to armor and shields temporarily. Only one set of these buffs can be active at one time, so rapid sex changes have no benefit. Abilities also cancel if Equinox changes Forms, so that 80% peaceful Provocation aura is now gone because *somebody* wanted to sit down to pee. The Form that Equinox is in determines the abilities she (definitely female) has access to. **Augment** [Duality](URL Upon switching, Equinox leaves a copy of herself that occupies the form that she changed from, wielding the weapon she was using when switching. This clone deals greatly increased damage. If you're playing alone, this augment can give your opponents something to shoot at that isn't you, plus it deals a ton of damage, sweet! However, I have seen very mixed results with this augment, depending on how Warframe is feeling on a particular day, the clone can be an aimbot or [*literally bend bullets away from its target,*](URL  la the movie; Wanted. Use with caution I suppose. Knowing when to be in which form is one of the most important concepts to master if you wish to play Equinox. It may be tempting to stay in Day form for that sweet boost to power strength and just be a Maim-nuking monster, but sometimes the team or situation will call for the CC and defensive buffs of Night Form. If your team is face-rolling, run Day Form and help them roll faster. If your team is going down constantly, go Night Form and try to keep them alive. It may take practice to get it just right, but I believe in you. ###Rest (Night) and Rage (Day)### **Night:** Equinox puts enemies in a target location to sleep, upon taking a certain amount of damage (50% of health at max rank, unaffected by power strength) they will awaken and resume fighting. **Day:** Equinox enrages enemies in a target location, causing them to take additional damage and move/attack faster. **Augment:** [Calm &amp; Frenzy](URL Killing enemies affected by Rest or Rage causes the effect to spread to nearby enemies for the remaining duration. The range value is affected by your power range, and the duration is too (obviously). This augment is great for afflicting a whole room for the cost of one cast if your duration is high enough. This augment is solid, so feel free to work it into one of your builds. The application of Rest and Rage, like with all of Equinox's abilities, depends on your situation. Is your team going to just blast their way through a room? Use Rage. Do they plan to sneak around or avoid conflict? Use Rest. Rage increases the damage an enemy takes, so it synergizes well with Maim; cast Rage just before you release Maim for massive damage. On the other hand, Rest opens enemies to finishers, which also deals massively increased damage. If you have a dagger, use [Covert Lethality](URL to kill them for sure. The only warning is to recall that Rage increases enemy speed, so be sure that the boost to damage will be enough to kill them or they will close the distance faster and demolish you. ###Pacify (Night) and Provoke(Day)### **Night:** Equinox projects an aura that reduces enemy damage. The potency of this aura is higher the closer enemies are to Equinox. Since the drain of this ability is based on the number of enemies within and not the time it is active for, Equinox can still gain energy from [Energy Siphon](URL Trinity's [Energy Vampire](URL and other sources of energy regeneration. **Day:** Equinox projects an aura that increases ally power strength, the potency of this aura does not diminish with distance however. Like with Pacify, Provoke still allows the gain of energy while active, due to it using energy per ability cast within its aura instead of a per second drain. **Augment:** [Peaceful Provocation](URL This is one of the BEST. AUGMENTS. PERIOD. In Night Form, Equinox slows enemies more the more they deal damage, which sounds underwhelming. But their damage is reduced as well, so using this augment in Night Form basically neuters your opponents. While your allies mow down these slo-mo fools, you get to sit there and [watch the destruction unfold like a maniac](URL But that's only half of it, in Day Form, Equinox increases the power strength granted by Provoke every time your team deals damage. This bonus can increase to *80%* with high enough power strength, making your team a deadly force of tube-man slaying skoom. I highly recommend working this augment into your build, especially if it is support focused, your team will greatly appreciate it (unless there's a Speed Nova, then they'll hate it). At this point I think you get the idea, Night Form is defensive where Day Form is offensive. Use Pacify if your team is struggling or is just not killing everything, and use Day Form if you *are* planning to kill everything. Equinox only seems intimidating because she has two sets of abilities, but running a few missions will get the point across. Practice makes perfect. ###Mend (Night) and Maim (Day)### **Night:** Equinox begins channeling an aura that captures up to 75% (flat, not affected by power strength) of the health and shields of enemies killed within. When Equinox releases this aura, the stored health and shields are divided among all allies (companions and operatives included) restoring health before shields if there is not enough stored to fully heal. **Day:** Equinox channels an aura that inflicts a slash proc on all enemies within the aura and upon those that enter for the first time. Like with Mend, the aura stores 75% (not scaling) of the health and shields of enemies that die in the aura. Releasing the aura unleashes the accumulated damage, becoming less damaging the further away targets are. Unlike Mend, Maim's damage is not divided. Mend can heal a lot of damage, but it is not instant, so you have to pre-load your heals while in Night Form. In Day Form you can store absurd amounts of damage, killing entire rooms of enemies even at the highest of levels. In fact, higher levels build damage and healing faster due to enemies having higher health and shields. Using Rage before releasing Maim assures that your targets will die, and one should try to position themselves as near to the center of the action to maximize damage. If Equinox is downed while Mend or Maim is active, then the healing/damage is releases instantly (suicide bomber much?) so your allies can safely pick you up. A strategy known as ""Maim-swapping"" has two Equinoxes casting Maim, one starts theirs just before the other releases to gather the health and damage of all the enemies that will be killed by the first Maim. Maim deals slash damage, so it is great against all factions. #Build Equinox is a very well-rounded support, granting CC, damage reduction, damage increase, healing and the ability to nuke rooms of enemies. This makes builds for Equinox pretty flexible, and up to preference. Equinox at the end of the day is really meant to be a support, so keep that in mind, a squad that asks for Equinox will typically want her to use Provoke with the [Peaceful Provocation](URL augment, but they might want Night Form's Rest ability too. Being able to adapt is an important quality in Warframe generally, and doubly so with Equinox. **Strength:** [Intensify](URL Strength increases the damage vulnerability of Rage, the damage reduction and power strength buff from Pacify and Provoke respectively, and the damage from the initial slash proc of Maim. With enough power strength, Peaceful Provocation can grant +80% power strength, my build achieved this using all three power strength mods: Intensify, [Transient Fortitude](URL and [Blind Rage](URL It may be possible to achieve the 80% bonus without one of these mods, but I haven't done the math. **Range:** [Stretch](URL Range is very important on Equinox, as it extends her auras and allows her to slow more enemies, and absorb more damage. Stretch is a great idea, and the loss of strength from [Overextended](URL can be partially mitigated with [Peaceful Provocation](URL and a strength mod like Intensify. **Duration:** [Continuity](URL Extending the effects of Rest and Rage are the main functions of duration on Equinox, as well as preserving the buffs received while changing Forms. If that sounds good to you, slap some duration on your build, if not, to each their own. Keep in mind that [Narrow Minded](URL will reduce the range of your abilities, making your auras less effective. **Efficiency:** [Streamline](URL Equinox has the potential to cast a lot of abilities over the course of a mission, so efficiency is a no-brainer. Using [Fleeting Expertise](URL will compromise your duration, but will allow you to keep Mend and Maim active for much longer. If you use [Blind Rage](URL to maximize the slow or power strength boosts of Pacify and Provoke, be sure to compensate with some efficiency mods. Having a larger energy pool may accomplish this, but Equinox has a sizeable energy pool, even without [Flow](URL so that depends on personal preference. **Armor:** Equinox has 100 base armor, which becomes 210 with a maxed [Steel Fiber](URL granting a ~41.2% damage reduction on Health, up from the 25% damage reduction she has at base. With Metamorphosis, Equinox gains 250 additive armor before power strength. With that Steel Fiber, Equinox's armor becomes 460 and grants ~60.5% damage reduction on health. With Intensify, that number becomes 535 resulting in ~64.5% damage reduction on health. The numbers get higher with more power strength, but it starts to plateau. Furthermore, this massive boost to armor is temporary, and will require to cast Metamorphosis two more times to refresh the armor buff. These numbers aren't huge, but I can't say that building armor on Equinox is pointless. If more armor is something you want, go for it. Most builds will be successful without additional armor, so don't feel like you need it either. **Health/Shields:** With Equinox's relatively high base armor, more is gained from [Vitality](URL than from [Redirection](URL Shields do not receive armor (currently) so health is really the superior choice here. **Sprint Speed:** Equinox already gains a boost to speed from switching to Day Form, so more sprint speed would make you go even faster, but sprint speed is a preference stat on most builds. #Gameplay ###Preferred Mission Types### Equinox's versatility makes her incredibly adaptable. There are no missions that Equinox cannot excel at, though there is always a bigger fish when it comes to versatile frames. Frost will have an easier time of defending a cryopod, but Equinox can do it too. Maim breaks containers, so if you want to hunt for ayatan stars or syndicate medallions, then Equinox is a great choice. For the most part though, Equinox is a support and finds the most success in a squad. ###Your Role### Step one is to identify what sort of situation your team is in. It's the infested, and your team is tasked with exterminating ~200 Infested units. You may switch to Day Form because the Ash on your team wants more Bladestorm damage and the Volt is casting Speed to get through the mission more quickly. As the mission progresses, your squad alerts the Juggernaut and you switch to Night Form to slow him down and reduce his damage. Adaptation is key to successfully supporting with Equinox, and only through practice can you learn what the proper form for each situation is. Once you have identified the specific challenge laid out before you, now you must work with your team. Don't use Provoke while Speed Nova is trying to accelerate your enemies, use Rage instead. Charge Maim and really speed up that run of Akkad. Work *together* with your team, because no one likes a troll. **Aura Support:** High range and efficiency are important here, as well as [Peaceful Provocation](URL to increase the effectiveness of these auras. Your allies will appreciate the boosts and you'll feel good for helping (maybe, no promises). If you're going for a maximum power Peaceful Provocation build, you will need high power strength too, so remember to account for the negatives that come with using corrupted mods. **Nuker:** Range and efficiency are the most important stats here, a minor loss to strength can be mitigated with [Peaceful Provocation](URL or Intensify. [Overextended](URL is pretty important, and the loss to power strength does not affect how much damage Maim accumulates. Remember to cast Rage before releasing Maim, for maximum damage output. The main drawback of this build is that you have to kill a few things before you can kill a few more things. This build, like most Equinox builds, succeeds most in a squad."
111,vulnerability,Warframe,[Discussion] Dealing with Self-Damage once and for all,12,6r94dg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/6r94dg/discussion_dealing_with_selfdamage_once_and_for/,2017-08-03 11:50:30,"#Unimportant First, i'm going to explain why it's a problem (though i doubt it's necessary, since anyone who has ever played with an explosive weapon before knows all too well WHY, but i will just in case). No one likes to die, especially because of unpredictable factors, such as another player or companion popping up in front of you, simply misclicking or misjudging distance between you and your target. A lot of things could result in a suicide from the use of explosive weapon, yet it's never a proportional punishment for a simple mistake, or a situation where contributing factors were out of your control. And the fact that Warframe is a fast paced game, involving a lot of corridors of all shapes and sizes, makes it so much worse. Of course there *must* be a drawback. High damage AoE weaponry is very effective in a game like this, where you have to deal with multiple enemies simultaneously most of the time, and if there are no significant drawbacks, such weapons would dominate meta, rendering everything else obsolete. But insta-suicide is just bullshit, such drawback is quite literally an overkill. I personally never see people with grenade launchers anymore, be it primary or secondary, even the most popular weapon of all time Tonkor pretty much fell out of use as self-damage mechanic was added to it. Of course this is just my observation (correlating with experience of the players i know), but i don't have any reasons to doubt that on a large scale this situation is any different. Players like to have more viable options. I'm also pretty sure that when such content falls into obscurity, it makes people involved in the creation of said content sad, and it definitely doesn't generate any profit. So more people using these weapons is a win-win situation for everyone involved, right? #The Actual Thing Anyway, what are we gonna do about it? Let's share our ideas with each other, and, hopefully, developers. I'll start: My suggestion: Self-damage is limited by a certain percentage of (remaining or total?) health and/or shields (if amount of self-damage exceeds remaining shields, it takes the rest from the health pool - health and energy are pretty much treated as one large health pool by this mechanic, at least until shield-gating becomes a thing), followed by ~1.5 seconds of immunity to self-damage (to account for cases with stuff like multishot and delay between projectiles, cluster bombs and such). This way player won't be outright killed. But it will be easier for enemies to do it instead, so that's the penalty - added vulnerability. Not sure whether self-proc should be removed, that must be discussed. Another [interesting idea](URL was suggested by /u/Claptovaughn : Upon receiving self-damage, player is knocked down instead. No damage taken. Also vulnerability, and it could be very risky during combat. I assume that quick recovery mods won't affect this, otherwise it might be way too forgiving. Both ideas could be combined, perhaps, with status self-proc removed (replaced by a knockdown), self-damage is limited by a lower percentage of (remaining or total?) health/shields (not 50%). I assume that determining specific numbers would require extensive in-game testing. Now it's your turn!"

I didn't like it. I *really* didn't like it. Not the update. By all means, I think Earth looks much nicer and Harrow and his gear looks great (both aesthetically and functionally). But the actual quest? I honestly preferred Octavia's. I have Detect Vulnerability, I've synthesized a lot of things in my Warframe playtime, but this quest is ridiculous. After having performed the same mission (synthesize the same thing three times) three times in a row (yes, *nine* times) while being chased by a super scary spoopy ghost, the Operator vs Red Veil troops fight just killed it for me. You can't lose the fight. At all. You just jump back in, with enemies as weak as they were before. This is because DE were either unable/too lazy to balance the Operator (some health regeneration would work wonders, DE), so they just let you have infinite attempts. I didn't find this engaging or fun, and after the third ""death"", I was just bored. If DE are going to force us to not use our fun, speedy, and deadly Warframes, they need to design future Operator sections to actually engage players. As it stands, playing as a poorly voiced space kid doesn't really compare to controlling a Warframe. So, what did you guys think (of either the quest or the update in general)?"
114,vulnerability,Warframe,Launchers and Self Damage Suggestions/Opinion,3,6kq6k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/6kq6k6/launchers_and_self_damage_suggestionsopinion/,2017-07-02 09:27:12,"I can understand why DE has self damage in the game. Launchers are suppose to be a risk/reward type weapons, giving lots of damage and AOE, but other stats are weaker compared to rifles like mag size or fire rate. Self damage is to be an additional risk. However balancing this risk is hard since if the damage is too low, the risk becomes trivial (like the old 50 self dmg from the Tonkor), but if it's too high (like it is right now), having a teammate run in front of your shot, or just misjudging the distance because of how fast paced Warframe can get ruins the fun since you don't get any chance to recover from your mistake, or just bad luck. So what could we have that keeps the risk/reward playstyle, while not feeling too oppressive a risk? Knockdowns. Or at least some state of vulnerability where there is a chance of taking damage, or dying. This way you keep the risk, but aren't punished so much that you have absolutely no chance at fixing the situation. There are some problems with just making a guaranteed self blast proc the replacement for self damage, at least in a sense of balance for every frame/build. Handspring will greatly counter this, and with how prevalent knockdowns are in Warframe, I personally use Handspring as my Exilus mod almost all the time. Thus making the risk almost non-existent. Mods that give a chance to avoid knockdown and Atlas also reduce/remove risk. Stagger could be used instead of knockdown since there are fewer instances of stagger than knockdown, making Pain Threshold a possible solution, but not quite as strong as Handspring. Instances when frames are CC immune would also counter staggers/knockdowns. So does this mean that my idea isn't worth considering by DE? Well to be honest, I don't know. These changes can be implemented fairly quickly as it doesn't add anything new to the game, meaning less work for DE, faster launch of the mechanic, (possibly) happy community. But perhaps an ""Ideal knockdown"" or a knockdown that bypasses all other immunities/reductions (like Bursa knockdowns not always being affected by handspring. Not actually sure when this is, but I'm pretty sure this is a thing) couldn't be developed and implemented. This would take longer, and requires more effort on DE's part (which they are unlikely to spend). Personally I would find that the best way to balance the risk/reward of launchers, but opinions differ. You may now amend or argue my opinion as you see fit. I am only one person, the more input we get, the better chance at change. TL;DR - Knockdown/stagger replace self damage. Perhaps some other (new) type of CC that can't be blocked or reduced, but act like a knockdown effect."
115,vulnerability,Warframe,Harrow's Thurible could use a few tweaks. Suggestions inside.,0,6npq8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/6npq8c/harrows_thurible_could_use_a_few_tweaks/,2017-07-17 10:24:17,"As I get more and more into Harrow, the issue I'm finding with his Thurible is twofold. Firstly, you're put into a state of vulnerability and uselessness when you channel the ability since you can't fight during the channel. In high level missions, this begins to become a problem when mobs can swarm you and you still need 10 seconds to get a full channel. Secondly, the energy rewarded per time channeled seems exceedingly low to me. Even with a duration/efficiency build, you have to channel an exceedingly long time to even get an energy payout that is worth using the ability. Don't even get me started on how this is completely stomped by EV trinity. What I suggest is to firstly make the Thurible channel a passive state, something like the damage soak timer from his 4, so that you can fight during it. Secondly, I'd like to see the energy/second channeled increase so that you aren't forced to run pure duration/efficiency if you want to play around his 3. Just some thoughts. Really I'd like to see Harrow buffs mainly to get him to a point where he can rival other supports. Other than the cc from his 1, I'm not seeing much of a reason to ever pick him over Trinity at this point."
116,vulnerability,Warframe,My greatest fears and hopes over Shield Gate.,11,6fb0i9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/6fb0i9/my_greatest_fears_and_hopes_over_shield_gate/,2017-06-05 10:56:14,"All shielded corpus enemies will now feature shield gates, heavy units will feature multiple shield gates instead of armor. Shielded bosses more so in multiple layers of shields that have to be defeated in order before health can be effected. This amount of gating rises expotentially with enemy levels. New shields prevents health damage on both enemeies and allies as long as shields are up. Shield regeneration delay has been adjusted throughout all warframes and cannot start until the invulnerability period on shield break ends. The new delay to be on average much longer than currently. Select 'scout' like frames may retain close to original delay. Sheild gates having a cool down or minimal shield requirement before it is allowed to trigger again. My greatest hopes are : Enemies or allies affected by magnetic proc are stripped from shield gate effects allowing for full damage to bleed into the next layer. Mag warframe does more magnetic damage and procs its effects. Removes shield gates on polarized enemies. and provides protection against the debuff within her polarize or magnetize effects. Sheild distruption aura buffed to also shorten hostile shield gate invulnerability phase by a flat rate (4 would remove hostile shield gate capility completly on normal enemies and may remove a number of health bar layers on bosses) Pets and sentinels will retain normal shield regenerate rates as well as shield gating. By default overshields will also be a shield gate itself on passing into normal shields Deflection Density Mod : add an additional shield gate at n% of your shields per level (1 gate 50% 2 gates 33% 3 gates 25%) Shield gating centric warframe on the same manner nidus is health only (ghost frame?) Shield gate break invulnerability time is based on % of shields restored before it started to deplete again. (So if you have 10 seconds from 100% shields a 10% recharge would provide 1 second) Another new shield gate mod that increases vulnerability time. Shield and sword melee buffing adding a gate of its own as a bonus effect? My rational expectations? DE just slaps it on everything with shields and say have at it and don't do much with it for a month after fixing any bugs especially that one obscure enemy that regenerates shields during the gate break making it effectimely invulnerable.

I highly recommend taking 4x Corrosive Projections to strip armor, but if you're running solo a high-status Pox works wonders thanks to the nature of ticks. Radiation damage is recommended on your primary (like a Tigris Prime). Take a Helios (Prime) with the Detect Vulnerability augment for a makeshift sonar, too (though it's not necessarily reliable)."

It appears that there has been a certain growing trend: In one side, we have these Assassination Missions where the theme is more like ""reach this single enemy, kill the enemy, then get the hell out of there."" Even now, bosses like Captain Vor, Krill, Ruk, Jackal, Alad V, and some of the older bosses have this type of Assassination Missions. In their average difficulty, they can practically be 1-hit destroyed or in some regard take time to find their weakspot like Ruk. In the other side, we have these what I would like to call ""scenario boss fights."" Boss fights that seems to play a unique sequence to defeat the Assassination Missions. Whether it is the phases of Tyl Regor, the weird wheels of Kela, the factory destruction of the Raptors, or even the big fleet destruction during the recent Ambulas Reborn. These are missions that give away the enemy vulnerability and make the boss fight feel bigger than it appears to be.

Maybe, but let me elaborate. **The original Razorback Armada event was met with considerable community feedback both on the official forums and elsewhere about the problematic nature of invulnerability phasing, the way that there was too much hacking and not enough fight, and how the Bursae were not engineered to be consistent in fulfilling their mechanical purpose.** Razorback Armada has the following problems: * Invulnerability phasing is still there, rather than some more nuanced mechanic like scaling armor toughness that could be Bursa-mitigated or an emphasis on locational vulnerability to damage and despite *a massive outpouring of community displeasure every time the developers have mentioned this as a potential mechanic for anything* * Each Bursa takes 1-2 successful hacks to satisfy the boss mechanics. During this time the number of enemies is largely trivial, the Bursae can be one-shot by a half-modded &lt;insert endgame-appropriate weapon&gt;, and the Razorback is basically just a big environmental hazard instead of a boss * The Bursae show no evidence of any attempt at bugfixing to improve their consistency in the boss mechanics. It seems almost utterly random whether a given Bursa will render the boss vulnerable by itself or just sit and fire at a wall. The result of these problems is a boss fight afflicted by jarring, badly-paced mechanics - only in this edition you also get a mandatory Archwing grind to fight the boss. While I understand that recycling content is part of an MMO's natural development process over time, it seems as though a developer should generally want to *improve* old content with simple fixes, especially considering that they have feedback available from the original iteration(s). I guess someone prefers to just CTRL+V large sections of Warframe's old code instead."
123,vulnerability,Warframe,[Concept] The Chroma Overhaul -- A Balance of Greed and Power,0,6bk1fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/6bk1fn/concept_the_chroma_overhaul_a_balance_of_greed/,2017-05-17 06:31:15,"This is a concept of an overhaul for Chroma. Chroma is a unique warframe with unique strengths and weaknesses. Let's talk about him a little bit. &amp;nbsp; **The Identity Of Chroma** a) Chromas performance is extreme in both dealing and taking damage. b) Chroma separately incorporates all basic elemental types into his functionality. c) Chroma tries (dont be mean) to be a supportive tank. *The above make Chroma Chroma.* &amp;nbsp; **The Problems Of Chroma** a) Chroma only has one decent ability, Vex Armor. Elemental Ward only finds its success with Vex Armor. Spectral Scream and Effigy have little to no use in high level content. He is kind of a one and a half trick pony. Well, dragon. b) Cold outperforms the other elements by a vast margin in overall usefulness leaving little room for flexibility in high level content. c) Vex Armor has an unmistakable hole of vulnerability. It must be recast and rebuilt after some time. In high level content, its not always viable to do that. Death can occur in this hole. *The above make Chroma sad.* &amp;nbsp; **My Goal In This Overhaul** a) I will simplify and redistribute the components of strength Chroma needs to, well, be Chroma into more sane places. b) I will remove any hole of vulnerability Chroma has, allowing him to confidently get his job done, but also sanely balance it out from another direction. c) I will make Chroma what DE wanted him to be, the supportive tank, by greatly enhancing his supportive capability. d) I will make Chroma truly versatile. e) I will stop Chroma from being absolutely dependent on certain mods (e.g. Narrow Minded) but sanely balance it out from another direction. *The above make Chroma shine.* &amp;nbsp; **Passive** All enemy killed within the affinity range of Chroma guarantees credits dropped. All credit drops are also doubled in amount. &amp;nbsp; **First Ability**: **Spectrum** This ability is **toggled**. Chroma picks his element of choice. It works similarly to Ivara's Quiver and Vauban's Minelayer. An aura with the effect of the chosen element is activated which affects Chroma, his companion, all teammates and all allied companions within the affinity range. When I say companion, I mean sentinels as well. Switching elements will immediately cancel all previous effects and replace them with new ones. Reactivating abilities isn't necessary. Abilities can remain active, but their effects will be changed immediately on the fly with nothing lingering. Chroma's energy color has no effect here. **Cold**: Base armor is increased by 25/50/100/**150**. **Electricity**: All attacks regenerate shield. They can also create overshield. **Heat**: Maximum health is increased by 20%. **Toxin**: Reloading and swapping weapons are sped up by 50%. This ability also affects **Wrath of Greed** and **Domination**. *This ability is affected by Power Efficiency and Power Strength.* &amp;nbsp; **Second Ability**: **Wrath of Greed** This ability is **timed**. Chroma indulges in his greed for power activating an aura for 11/14/17/**20**s. He enrages as he accumulates credits from his victims. His wrath increases the damage he deals by 50/100/200/**300**%. He starts out with no wrath. Each time he acquires credits, he gains 10/20/40/**60**% damage. How much credits he acquires is irrelevant. The count matters. It takes 5 to reach his full potential. As a bonus, Chroma also deals 30/50/70/**90**% additional elemental damage. This does not scale with credits nor does it combine with elements on weapons. It remains purely independent. The element in effect corresponds to **Spectrum**. Chroma's energy color has no effect here. *This ability is affected by Power Duration, Power Efficiency and Power Strength.* &amp;nbsp; **Third Ability**: **Dragon Armor** This ability is **channeled**. It drains 2.5 energy/s. This ability is largely similar to Vex Armor from the original kit. However, only the defensive capability (i.e. Scorn) remains. The offensive capability (i.e. Fury) has been entirely removed as Chroma now gains his offensive strength elsewhere. [Look at this image which highlights the parts that were kept](URL As this is now a channeled ability and no more leaves Chroma any hole of vulnerability, this compromise was made to prevent him from being overpowered. We simply cannot keep Vex Armor in its current state while also making it channeled. You understand. On a brighter note, it's a smaller compromise than it seems at first glance since his offensive strength is kept in its original power level but through other abilities. I just didn't think it deserved the limitless potential which comes with channeled abilities. Let that be on a timer. This is better saved for defense. *This ability is affected by Power Duration, Power Efficiency, and Power Strength.* &amp;nbsp; **Fourth Ability**: **Domination** This ability is **timed**. Chroma roars and breathes out a ball of elemental energy which transforms into a flying dragon largely resembling his own shape. The figure stays afloat in a location affecting all enemies within a 8/10/12/**14**m radius around it for 11/14/17/**20**s. Its much smaller than Chroma in size. Its color and effect correspond to **Spectrum**. Chromas energy color has no effect here. **Cold**: All enemies function 50% slower and have a 50% chance to have their attacks entirely deflected. **Electricity**: All enemies have a 50% chance to get electrocuted upon entering. Additionally, all attacks on all enemies have a 100% chance to electrocute them. **Heat**: All enemies killed heal Chroma and his allies for 10% maximum health. **Toxin**: All enemies killed explode dealing 30% of their maximum health as toxin damage. *This ability is affected by Power Duration, Power Efficiency, Power Range, and Power Strength.* &amp;nbsp; **Important Notes**: a) All values above are base values. They will surely be higher or lower than they are written here after you mod Chroma to your liking. Which Power stats affect which abilities are mentioned above. b) These values are rough ideas I made to keep the concept flowing. The values aren't big a deal. Developers will know where to increase or decrease the values. So, if you think some of the values are too high or too low, remember that they matter a lot less than the concept itself. The values can be tweaked as fast as you think of tweaking it. That's not an issue. c) If some of these abilities look too powerful to you because you're not used to Chroma, remember that Chroma only has access to one element at a time. Yes, this kit allows him to switch on the fly, but he can never make two elements stack. So, think of his different elemental capabilities separately for a real picture. d) If there's anything you don't understand about how this kit functions, please feel free to ask. e) If you have suggestions, that's always welcome. &amp;nbsp; **Thank you for reading.**"
124,vulnerability,Warframe,Why Helios Prime?,0,5vcwio,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/5vcwio/why_helios_prime/,2017-02-22 04:46:50,"I kind of feel like Helios , out of all of the Sentinels, feels like the worst choice to be primed. One of the Helios' main abilities is scanning enemies, an ability that gets less useful the farther into the game you get (completely ignoring the fact that just using the wiki is still 100 times more effective). I have done most of the scanning by now, so this ability is pretty much useless to me. Yes there is the follow up mod ""detect vulnerability"", which creates a small weakpoint... but it doesn't activate often enough, is too random in it's targeting and is smaller than Banshee's Sonar, all while only targeting a single enemy. All in all a massively inferior version of Banshee's Sonar, the Frame Helios Prime will be bundled with... Yes, thematicaly it may fit to Banshee. but since it's one ability is massively outshined by Banshee, i feel like Diriga or Djinn would have been much more fitting. Djinn can give better survivability by pulling focus and pacifying enemies and Diriga would have combined Sniper and CC as well, both things that work well for Banshee. I personally just feel a bit underwhelmed by Helio Prime and would have prefered any of the other Sentinels."

126,vulnerability,Warframe,Addressing Limbo's Cataclysm: Suggestions for the upcoming rework,7,5udr7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/5udr7k/addressing_limbos_cataclysm_suggestions_for_the/,2017-02-16 20:07:43,"I just wanted to throw out some ideas for the upcoming Limbo rework, being I'm a Limbo main and want the best for him, and am also looking for feedback for my ideas. I apologize, ***this post will be on the long side***, as I want to jot down all of my ideas. I also definitely am looking forward for the rework, as I have faith Limbo will receive the QoL changes he needs for his rift mechanic to be useful. In this post, I won't discuss the large number of problems inherent in his other abilities, as in some way or another they all tie in to his Cataclysm, and his inherent playstyle as well. Limbo's Cataclysm is a very paradoxical ability in his kit. Situationally at it's best, it can be used to lock down entire groups of enemies, secure a defense objective, and provide a rather large damage boost with enough power strength. At it's worst, it can get you killed, make it very hard to manage enemies in the Rift, and even harder to allies to manage enemies alongside Limbo. Yet Cataclysm is an ultimate ability that takes 100 energy, has a 2 second cast time and is cast-and-point in an area. I'm sure it's half the reason people complain about Limbo in the first place, his ultimate feels almost useless at times in comparison to many of the other game-breaking ultimates out there. I want to list the good points about Cataclysm, and come up with some buffs for the ability based on these points, since I'm sure DE will want to keep in mind the core aspects of a Warframe when designing a rework. ~ ***Cataclysm provides a way to isolate multiple enemies*** Sure, it's a rather inefficient, risky way to banish multiple enemies, but it works to an extent, and since it affects an area, it can be used in some really creative ways to outmanuever enemies. It forces you to use the ability effectively, and create an adaptive playstyle.(ex: running in and out to avoid fire from either side, Rift Walk from far and sniping enemies in the bubble) A common suggestion is to allow Banish to banish multiple enemies, but then this enhances the inherent problem of having to micromanage 3 people instead of 1, whereas Cataclysm, you manage an area, which is pretty straightforward. Also replacing Cataclysm altogether would require a lot of brainstorming in terms of direction and what exactly we want from Limbo and the Rift plane mechanic as a whole. ~ ***Cataclysm can act as a shield against enemies outside the Rift*** Cataclysm can block fire as long as it's outside of the rift, which can effectively create a sort of 'arena', a 'shield', or a 'rift zone' if you don't want your teammates killing a group of enemies. The 'arena' playstyle heavily revolves around a mid-high range Cataclysm tied in with Rift Surge, and the 'shield' Cataclysm heavily revolves around high duration, low range Cataclysm, with maybe even the Cataclysm augment, Cataclysmic Continuum for longer duration. I tend to prefer low-range Cataclysm with gunplay, as I find it a lot of fun to have to constantly adapt to enemy movements and switch between planes based on the given condition. ~ ***Cataclysm provides benefits for staying inside*** 2 energy per second is basically pretty average. Playing with low-efficiency and high-duration makes this passive very useful, as it allows for you to use Rift Walk and consistently regen energy to spam abilities. The additional move speed, reload speed, and holster speed buffs are decent, but of course cannot be utilized to their full effect without being in the rift. Although Cataclysm has a high base cost, a high duration Cataclysm can potentially restore the energy you spend using it. ***So what's the problem?*** Cataclysm doesn't do any of these things extremely well. In fact, it only situationally gives these benefits under extremely specific conditions. Issues such as late-game scalability and practicality, flat damage falloff, and being a nuisance to allies prove to outdo the benefits from Cataclysm. I want to mention some general solutions to make the ability more viable, and some specific ideas within these solutions. I don't think that all of these should necessarily be incorporated, or even be the best solution, but I think they would make Limbo's kit a lot more interesting and fun. ~ ***Benefits for placing and/or eliminating enemies within the Cataclysm*** As of right now, the flat damage dealt by Cataclysm by itself, is not bad. However, it has the same issues of power scalability as levels increase, and it also puts enemies in the Rift, which as mentioned has it's +'s and -'s. Cataclysmic Continuum is a pretty mediocre example of this. What's the point of extending the duration of Cataclysm, it if doesn't do anything good to begin with? Some sort of defensive buff by attacking enemies in the Cataclysm would justify the risk/trouble of putting them in the Rift, For example: - Casting Banish also knocks down all enemies in Cataclysm(basically extra CC) - While Rift Surge is active, enemies' projectiles cannot go outside of the Cataclysm, and are reflected back at them. ~ ***Benefits for being inside the Cataclysm*** The benefits Limbo gets are overall a bit mediocre, and it only hinders allies. Cataclysm must be ally-friendly, or else his whole mechanic has no meaning. For this part, Banishing allies into the Rift/Cataclysm should provide huge benefits and incentivise targeting enemies in the Cataclysm. Cataclysm is a crucial part of the team part of Limbo's kit, and it should be incentivised as something I would want as a non-Limbo teammate. - Banished allies gain XXX health on banish, and gain all the Rift bonuses Limbo does. Additionally, for each enemy an ally kills in the Rift, the Cataclysm grows bigger, and adds stacking health regen to allies inside the Rift. - Cataclysm provides Limbo and allies a passive buff. Whenever an ally takes damage, and are in the Rift, they gain a defensive bonus(maybe health regen, armor, stacking % dodge up to 50?). This bonus is shared among players, and as long as someone is in the Rift the buff stays. (I personally think this could be really cool in terms of a support direction for Limbo, this could similarly give an offensive buff like energy regen or damage and be geared towards an interesting assassin/support kit for Limbo, or a mix of both!) ~ ***Debuffs on enemies inside the Cataclysm*** Some examples of debuffs besides taking more damage through Rift Surge would be, as mentioned in Devstream #86, manipulating enemies in the Rift/Cataclysm through stopping/slow time. While this would definitely solve a pertinent vulnerability issue with casting Cataclysm, and in my opinion, would be dope as ****, it wouldn't be a solution which would make Limbo's role any more unique or interesting. Nova and Nyx can crowd control much more efficiently, and it would also make Limbo's kit a rather awkward mixture of scalable damage and crowd control which could potentially be game-breaking if done wrong. My personal suggestion, to switch things up, would be to altogether remove the base damage from Banish/Cataclysm, remove Rift Surge, tone it down and make it inherent to the Rift, and add another debuff. - Enemies inside Cataclysm can be manipulated by Limbo. If Limbo casts Rift Surge, enemies in the Cataclysm are dealt a surge of damage over a small period of time, scaling with Power Strength. At the end, enemies are stopped for a period of time, scaling with power duration. - All enemies who step and are currently in the Cataclysm exit their alerted state. They resume patrol within the bounds of the Cataclysm, and can only detect warframes in the Rift alongside them. (this could result in some really counterintuitive builds, but with the right balancing it could be an interesting mechanic) - Each enemy in Cataclysm receives a mark, on detonating the mark through attacking the enemy, the enemy takes extra damage on detonation, and the Cataclysm reacts, growing bigger and slowing everyone inside per enemy hit. One of the main problems I see with the design and kit of Limbo at the moment is that he is very much a jack-of-all trades in terms of utility, and lacking in the offensive and defensive departments. I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming Devstreams so we can see the progress on the rework as is. If you read this far, I salute you, and thanks a lot for taking the time to read through my ideas! I know some of these ideas might be a bit out there, but I think if there's anyone who should have a weird, crazy kit it would/should be Limbo. Let me know what you think down below :D TL;DR: I ask DE to fix Limbo's Cataclysm by making it more rewarding to use, and make it viable for co-op play while keeping his core theme of being the 'Master of the Rift'.

127,vulnerability,Warframe,"""Stealth"" has been ruined for me. (Warning, slight wall of text inside)",1,5kjciz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/5kjciz/stealth_has_been_ruined_for_me_warning_slight/,2016-12-27 22:41:33,"Hello r/Warframe. In game I'm Avalon206, I've been playing this game since... about March 2015. I know, not the greatest time compared to the Veterans, but I think I've experienced my fair share of this game. Now, I'd like to start this... rant? Wall of text? Whine space? saying that I'm not a game developer. That means that, while I can certainly give ideas and feedback on certain mechanics, I have no experience whatsoever on game balancing and similar topics. With that being said, I want to open up the discussion (Of any kind, seeing other people's perspective is really helpful) in regards to the stealth changes that have ocurred since The War Within. So this is from **Update 19 - The War Within** patchnotes: *Fixed some general behaviour with enemies regarding awareness of their environment: *Nullifiers now notice and investigate their bubble taking damage *Enemies will notice and investigate corpses *Enemies affected by Coolant Leak will notice that they've been frozen/slowed As you can see, enemies are now supposed to be more alert to their surroundings, which in theory should make for a more realistic Stealth experience. The problem that arises, for what I have seen, is that enemies seeing corpses *or* hearing any kind of shout/noise put them instantly on a minor alerted state. This should not be a problem in and of itself, but the problematic here is that **any kind of alert level will instantly wipe your stealth affinity multiplier**. Enemies that haven't seen you will maintain this state for a good while, more often than not beyond the 30 seconds of multiplier that you are given for each stealth kill. Unfortunately there's not a way to accelerate this process beyond sleeping the enemy, which on second cast will remove the alert state from them. This limits our viable choices of frames to use to a grand total of 2: Ivara, with Quiver's sleep arrow, and Equinox, with Rest. While there's certainly other frames that can use stealth techniques (Ash, Loki, technically any Naramon user although that's trickyish) and certain companions (Shade, Huras Kubrow) can help out from time to time, they aren't capable of taking the enemy out of their alerted state. I think the main problem here is two-fold. Enemy behavior is rather unpredictable at first glance, with no actualy activity from them sans wandering around and huddling close together at times, while we as players have little in the way of tools to affect this behavior (Again, a great example is how Ivara's Noise Arrow works, which further illustrates her suppremacy on stealth). This is coupled with an inability to remove corpses from the vicinity of a kill (Unless you are using Ash's Bladestorm ability, an attack that **cannot induce any stealth affinity multiplier whatsoever**) which means that after each succefull execution you are left with a window of vulnerability *that you have no control over* in which enemies can (and often will) take notice. This if the enemy cry as it dies didn't alert their allies as well. This makes for a hard experience in the current iteration of stealth, since you theoretically need to wait for the perfect moment to strike in order to perform a succesful stealth kill (not a bad thing itself) but doing so will more often than not kill your multiplier (which is one of the main rewards of a stealthy gameplay, besides, obviously, the fun of it). Coupled with the lack of control on the player's side in regards to the enemy behavior, right now stealth gameplay has died for me (which is a total shame, I really liked it as an alternative to the meta xp farm groups). So I can hear some of you saying ""Well, git gud, its not so hard if you know what you are doing and are patient"". That's what I thought too. Who knows? Perhaps I *was* doing something wrong and simply needed to relearn the game? So I went and spent the last 2 hours trying to understand a grineer exterminate in order to maximize my efficiency in it. I took my new rakta dark dagger with cover lethality to ensure damage wasn't the problem, and a Fatal Teleport Invisibility Ash to test things out. Out of perhaps 20/25 runs, I didn't manage to maintain my stealth multiplier *for a single full room* if there were more that 2/3 enemies on each side of it. Its maddening. Its truly taking the fun out of the game for me, and the other alternative is going to the Akkad/Bere groups (which I'm really sick of due to repetition) So I wanted to ask of you guys (I'm always amazed at the sheer creativity of this subreddit when it comes to fixing things in this game), what would you guys change / add to the core stealth mechanics to make it both and enjoyable and rewarding way of playing the game? Which thing would you do away with? Do you believe there's hope for DE to change the way stealth work this next year? Any and all feedback is really appreciated. Have a good day everyone. PD: Please excuse any typos you might find above. Argentinian here, so my english is sometimes shoddy."
128,vulnerability,Warframe,I really liked the direction they went with the operator in The War Within,57,5lo442,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/5lo442/i_really_liked_the_direction_they_went_with_the/,2017-01-03 09:36:16,"When I finished Second Dream, I was very interested in the idea of The Operator and hoped that DE would actually utilize this character. Rather than just being this voice that spouts dialogue during missions, I wanted The Operator to be more. I wanted DE to give them an actual personality and undergo character development. I figured DE would do more and have quests oriented around The Operator but I was fearful that this character would be boring and not as fun to learn about as opposed to the Warframes (Similar relationship with Desmond and Ezio in Assassin's Creed, for example) Anyway, after taking a break from Warframe I came back and started TWW and I am really happy with what they did. They immediately started having The Operator get involved with the characters and events happening. They had The Operator voice their own opinions and give their own input. The Operator displayed emotions like getting mad and worried. Basic things, I know, but for me, it shows that DE is going to give The Operator an actual character and have them involved. They also did something brilliant with The Operator and took them out of the Warframe (albeit mentally) and show vulnerability. I was really interested in moving around as The Operator and learning about their vague past. I got to learn about this character and was interested about them. I was so used to blazing through missions in my Warframe not giving a fuck about who or what my character was, but being able to watch the Tenno struggle slowly and overcome obstacles gave them depth. This character was able to show that they could stand on their own two feet as a Tenno without the need of a Warframe. And then finally at the end when they've finished the journey, they've acquired new powers and actually earned the right to command the Warframes. As Teshin put it, they are no longer a child. In conclusion, I'm happy about how this character developed and I'm excited to see more cinematic quests involving them"
129,vulnerability,Warframe,Zephyr Rework Idea,1,5n1zjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/5n1zjn/zephyr_rework_idea/,2017-01-10 12:35:52,"Hi all! I am known among us tenno as Darkspine77 and the following is my idea for a Zephyr warframe rework. This rework is aimed at giving zephyr's kit more flair instead of just relying on one ability to basically make her invincible. Please leave any thoughts or comments in the comment section. **Passive** &gt;Windstream &gt;&gt;Zephyr is significantly lighter in comparison to other Warframes, dramatically altering her airborne physics. Specifically, she descends slower and has improved aerodynamics which can be used to control her midair movement with greater ease and agility. Additionally, any enemies ragdolled by her melee attacks are given a similar modification to their physics for 7 seconds. **Ability-1** &gt;Tail Wind &gt;&gt;20 Energy &gt;&gt;Zephyr propels herself with a blast of energy. If Zephyr is on the ground when Tail Wind is cast, she will be propelled upwards. Enemies on the ground within 3 / 4 / 5 / 7 meters of Zephyr's launch point will be dealt 25 / 75 / 125 / 175 Impact damage. Additionally, Enemies and Zephyr will be launched to a height of 5 / 7.5 / 10 / 12.5 meters. &gt;&gt;&gt;Launch damage is affected by Power Strength and decreases with distance. &gt;&gt;&gt;Damage does not bypass obstacles in the environment, and affected enemies suffer a Ragdoll effect. &gt;&gt;&gt;Launch height is affected by Power Duration. &gt;&gt;&gt;Blast radius and Launch range is affected by Power Range. &gt;&gt;If Zephyr is in the air when Tail Wind is cast, she will be propelled in the direction of the HUD's target reticle. Enemies within 1.5 / 1.6 / 1.8 / 2 meters of Zephyr during the air dash will be dealt 150 / 175 / 200 / 250 Slash damage. &gt;&gt;&gt;Damage is affected by Power Strength. &gt;&gt;&gt;Speed and ""flight"" duration are affected by Power Duration. &gt;&gt;&gt;Striking radius is affected by Power Range. &gt;&gt;&gt;Activating Tail Wind multiple times allows Zephyr to propel herself farther into the air, effectively simulating flight. There is a slight cool-down between ability activations. &gt;&gt;Can be used to pass through Laser Barriers unharmed in most cases. &gt;&gt;If Tail Wind is cast on the ground it will not interrupt reloading. However, if Tail Wind is cast in the air it will interrupt reloading. **Ability-2** &gt;Gale Assualt &gt;&gt;15 Energy &gt;&gt;Zephyr swiftly pounces onto an airborne targeted enemy suspending both herself and the enemy in mid air. The ability can then be recast to kick the enemy, shooting them like a projectile towards the player's recticle. The attack deals 100/ 200 / 300 / 400 Finisher damage and forces the enemy into a knockdown upon coliding with terrain. Upon colliding with terrain, the enemy will create an explosion that deals 75 / 150/ 225 / 300 Blast damage to enemies within 7 meters. &gt;&gt;&gt;Damage is affected by Power Strength. &gt;&gt;&gt;Target range and Blast radius are affected by Power Range. &gt;&gt;&gt;Requires direct line of sight to a small part of the target. &gt;&gt;&gt;Can be used in the air. **Ability-3** &gt;Slip Stream &gt;&gt;60 energy &gt;&gt;Zephyr releases a concentrated burst of fierce winds that envelopes a radius of 15 meters. Enemies in the area have their accuracy reduced by 20% / 25% / 30% / 35%. While in the area, Zephyr gains 30% / 30% / 40% / 40% melee weapon range, 10% / 10% / 20% / 20% evasion and slam attacks cause enemies to be rag dolled directly upward. This ability lasts for 15 / 18 / 23 / 27 seconds. &gt;&gt;&gt;Area radius is affected by Power Range &gt;&gt;&gt;Area duration is affected by Power Duration. &gt;&gt;&gt;Enemies that leave the area are not affected by the accuracy reduction. &gt;&gt;If Slip Stream is cast within the range of a previously casted Slip Stream, the Duration will be set back to the maximum for both the new and old Slip Stream. Otherwise, the other Slip Streams are not affected. **Ability-4** &gt;Tornado &gt;&gt;100 energy &gt;&gt;Zephyr forms a tornado within a radius of 20 / 25 / 32 / 40 meters that violently pulls in enemies. The tornado inflicts 50 / 75 / 100 / 120 Slash damage per second to affected enemies and lasts over a duration of 10 / 12 / 15 / 20 seconds. Damage ticks occur at a rate of 4 per second.

The Peaceful Provocation Augment has two effects, one is slowing enemies in night form and the other is additional power strength in day form. Here are the results of a two Equinox test with both Equinoxes in the same aspects: Peaceful only applies the first one in range and does not prioritize by power strength. Example: If negative power strength Equinox with max range and a positive power strength Equinox base range are right beside each other, and both have Pacify cast the enemy will only be under the effects of the negative power strength Equinox since that will be the first and only one to affect them. Solution: Make Pacify have priority between two Equinoxes based on higher power strength. With Provocation the test had a +40% and a +50% power strength provocation modifier. The results were that either the higher power strength one takes priority over the lower one, or additional power strength stacks are reduced by 80% effectiveness. (1.2 rage vulnerability went to 1.25 with both power strength modifiers in range. Also pacify went from .21 to .2.) So with the second possibility in mind the math for the effects of multiple provokes might be: Base Provoke 40 + (second Provoke 50 * 0.2) = 50 Or it's prioritizes by power strength and the only higher strength applies. A second test shows that it only counts the provocation with the highest power strength. (80% power strength and 70% power strength."
132,vulnerability,Warframe,[Spoiler] {Mechanic Concept and Discussion} Expansions to Operator Mode,39,5fjtrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/5fjtrl/spoiler_mechanic_concept_and_discussion/,2016-11-30 04:11:27,"**INTRODUCTION** After The War Within, we are gifted with a new mechanic to use our Operator Forms in missions for specialized situations such as Kuva Siphons and debilitating Stalker/Sentient powers. [DE] has mentioned in the last Devstream their plans to correlate the new ""Operator Mode"" with the Focus System and further expanding their uses. I wanted to take one opportunity to think up and brainstorm the possibilities of the Operator Mode in terms of Focus System and other practical uses. **PERSONAL NOTE IN COMPARING OPERATOR MODE TO WARFRAME MODE** I feel that while The War Within has expressed the strength of the Operator, I believe it is important to not hope for Operator Mode to be more powerful than Warframe Mode. It is important to show how Warframes are designed to deal with regular combat while Operator Mode is more geared to more specialized situations. However, as of now the Operator Mode is an extremely fragile form and could benefit from a few defensive perks. **CURRENT COMMON OPERATOR POWERS** * **Void Beam** (Primary Fire): the Operator's default power, the Void Beam is an energy beam made of pure Void energies that extends up to 20 meters, dealing 40 damage per tick to enemies with a 1 meter radius of its impact point, and dealing an additional 50% damage on critical hits. Void Beam consumes energy for every second it is active, and can last up to 9 seconds with a full gauge. Void Beam is silent and will not alert enemies. Void Beam can also reset Stalker/Sentient Damage Reduction Buffs. * **Void Blast** (Quick Melee): The Void Blast is a forward arc area-of-effect attack that knocks back all enemy units caught in its 4 meter radius, and also stuns enemy units . The ability deals negligible damage, with damage being dependent on distance. With a full Energy Gauge, up to 5 Void Blasts can be performed until depletion. * **Void Dash** (Crouch + Jump): Void Dash is a mobility power that allows the Operator to perform a short-range teleport within the direction of aim, which will also pull enemies and damage objects caught in its path. With a full energy gauge, the Operator can perform three consecutive dashes before depletion. * **Void Mode** (Hold Crouch): When activated, Void Mode turns the Operator invisible, preventing them from being seen and detected by enemies and various sensors (but not Corpus laser barriers or Grineer energy barriers), and also protects against any incoming damage, including fall damage and Status Effects. Void Mode is not disabled by nullifiers. Void Energy is gradually consumed every second that Void Mode is active; with a full gauge, Void Mode can last for 9 seconds before depletion. **ADDITIONAL NEW POWERS/PERKS THAT CAN BE CUSTOMIZED** * **Void Shield** (Passive): A specialized rechargeable Shield of Void energy when a player enters the Operator Mode. Can be upgraded to a maximum amount. * **Void Protection** (Passive): When entering the Operator Mode, the Operator can leave behind its Warframe with a protective Shield of its own. This would offset the inactive Warframe's vulnerability to damage when players enter the Operator Mode. **OPERATOR POWERS UNDER MADURAI TENNO SCHOOL** * **Burning Void** (Passive for Void Beam): Slightly increases Void Beam's Damage and can cause a special damage over time effect at a XX% chance. Can also target a Warframe granting it a special damage buff. * **Magma Dash** (Passive for Void Dash): Void Dash will now explode in a high blast of Void Energy knocking back enemies upon arrival dealing damage. * **Void Ember** (Charge Melee Attack): Charge the melee attack to unleash an AOE attack that curses nearby enemies with a debuff of making it more vulnerable to damage when affected by a Status Ailment. This debuff will also make affected enemies more vulnerable to Status Ailments. **OPERATOR POWERS UNDER VAZARIN TENNO SCHOOL** * **Mending Void** (Passive for Void Beam): Void Beam can recover a targeted Warframe's Health and grants a weaker version of Vazarin's Protective Ward for a few seconds. Upgrading this ability also grants the Operator increased revival range and increased revival speed. * **Tidal Guard** (Charge Melee Attack): Charge the Void Blast to knockdown surrounding enemies and grant nearby Warframes extra Overshield. While charging this ability, Shield Recharge of the Operator's Void Shield is increased. * **Second Wave** (Passive, when the Operator's Warframe is in Bleedout): When a Vazarin Warframe enters the Bleedout state, the Operator has a XX% chance to instantly pop out of the downed Warframe causing nearby enemies to be stunned temporarily upon exit. This creates the opportunity to revive a Warframe. **OPERATOR POWERS UNDER NARAMON TENNO SCHOOL** * **Hidden Void** (Passive for Void Mode): Reduces Void Energy consumed while in Void Mode and can turn the Operator's inactive Warframe invisible. Operator also gains increased crouching speed while in Void Mode. * **Shadow Dash** (Passive for Void Dash): Void Dash causes Confusion to enemies and knocks down Enemy weaponry. * **Mind Charge** (Charge Melee Attack): Charge the melee attack to unleash an AOE debuff on enemies stunning them and adding charges of Trauma. **OPERATOR POWERS UNDER UNAIRU TENNO SCHOOL** * **Hardened Void** (Passive for Void Beam): Void Beam can cause enemies to be petrified and can reduce their armor. Targeting Warframes can grant the Warframe increased Armor. * **Stone Guard** (Charge Melee Attack): Charge Melee Attack creates a barrier of stone protecting the Operator from frontal attacks and also grants the inactive Warframe a set of Rock Barriers that grants X% change to negate damage. * **Crushing Dash** (Passive for Void Dash): Dashing through enemies will steal enemy Armor. When the Operator enters the Warframe, the Warframe temporarily gains Armor based on the amount stolen. There is a limit to the amount of Armor that can be stolen. **OPERATOR POWERS UNDER ZENURIK TENNO SCHOOL** * **Void Stream** (Passive for Void Beam): Void Beam can grant Energy to targeted Warframes. Enemies hit by Void Stream will be temporarily suspended. * **Temporal Charge** (Charge Melee Attack): Charge Melee Attack releases an AOE pulse which temporarily stuns and reduces enemy speed and increases the Ability Cast Time of nearby Warframes. * **Umbra Barrier** (Passive): Entering Operator Mode grants the Operator and the inactive Warframe a small temporary aura dealing damage to enemies within range per second. **FEW QUESTIONS TO ASK** * [DE] has mentioned plans to have more missions/quests which will involve utilizing the Operator Mode more often such as the Orokin Maw. What are your initial thoughts on this plan? * The War Within has a part where the Operator has to use their Warframe powers to open passages (ex. Ayatan Sculptures and Doors). Do you think this mechanic can be included in the Void Tileset to unveil hidden challenges? * Do you feel that the Operator Mode needs some form of protection/sustainability? * With the Operator Mode as is, do you feel that the Focus System should be divided into categories?: (Warframe Focus Abilities: Mostly Passives for Warframes each time they enter a mission, unlocked in the Second Dream), (Operator Focus Abilities: Concept above where players can upgrade their Operator Mode and the buffs they can give to Warframes, unlocked in The War Within), and (Focus Attack which is activated by holding the Focus button, unlocked in the Second Dream)? * What other Operator Mode perks would you like to see?"
133,vulnerability,Warframe,Weapon Idea: The Heliotron,26,58zbwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/58zbwl/weapon_idea_the_heliotron/,2016-10-24 03:30:14,"After seeing what DE did with the Gazal machete and making sentinel/weapon synergies I had an idea for another weapon that could have synergies with our beloved Helios. ""The Heliotron"" (Pretty lame name but that's all I got) would be a new sniper rifle that has synergy with Helios. After an enemy has been fully scanned into the codex by Helios you will be able to scope in with the Heliotron and see weak points, like banshee sonar and the already existing Helios detect vulnerability mod. This effect would only show up if you had Helios equipped and the targets are already fully scanned into the codex. I think it would be a fun new interactive way to use sniper rifles and add to the small list of currently one sentinel synergy weapons."

Why not have buffs reserve energy* instead (as an option, not exclusively, so ppl can decide which they prefer), and having the amount of reserved energy be dependant on the efficiency and duration too, so you can't just dump duration completely or have to use both efficiency mods. Added difficulty would be that you can have other channeled abilities out (like Effigy or Peacemaker) for a shorter amount of time, seems kinda balanced to me. Could this work, or is it too op? Nullifiers etc. will still purge your buffs, so that kind of ""difficulty"" wouldn't be touched. It would however remove the small window of vulnerability between casts, that I have to admit. **tl;dr: Make buffs (optionally) use reserved energy instead of being duration based?** Maybe the recasting thing is just annoying to me and noone else though, in that case - nvm. *in case you don't know what that means: A skill reserves a set amount of your total energy, that can not be used while it is active."
135,vulnerability,Warframe,Sentinel Parameters - to help you decide!,27,565fxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/565fxs/sentinel_parameters_to_help_you_decide/,2016-10-07 00:46:10,"Here are my opinions about sentinels. A while ago I did a research on them in the simulation to help me decide what to replace carrier with. Time well spent, I guess? Anyway, one thing to note is, sentinel ranges are based on their precepts, and NOT on the weapon that is being used. As far as the weapons go, for short range I recommend Sweeper for obvious reasons, and Deth Machine Rifle for medium/long range ones. Deth Machine Rifle can be modded to become a bubble-popper especially, consider that. Also, the range of your sentinels can be further increased by putting on Zoom mods. Eagle Eye for example, will increase the range of your sentinel if slotted on the weapon it is using. One thing I don't know is, the sentinel mod ""Fired Up"". While researching that, I noticed it increases the heat damage by 60% on Deconstructor. Which made me consider if this is how this mod works for every weapon. On wikia, it is stated that every weapon has different overheat and cooldown parameters. What I'm thinking is, Deconstructor may have 0 overheat time, and thus the bonus from Fired Up may be adding and showing even at the modding page. If that is the case, unless you have heat damage, don't use Fired Up, because it doesn't add heat damage from the base, it adds to the existing heat damage (and derived elementals, if I recall correctly... been a while). Another case is, Fired Up may be giving a special bonus if the weapon is Deconstructor, so it is only for Deconstructor. It is very hard to test as I cannot see the sentinel damage numbers, but I'm betting it's the former case, not the latter. Dethcube --------------- **Defenses:** Balanced Shields, Health and Armor **Swift Deth:** 30m range, 0.5s-1s idle **Vaporize:** 30s cooldown, 4m range, single target?, deals high radiation damage and stuns the enemy temporarily If Wyrm Prime wasn't here, this would be my #1 choice probably. Good defenses, good range. Vaporize is somewhat useless on high level enemies, especially due to the range restriction. Diriga --------------- **Defenses:** Very High Health, Very Low Shields, Normal Armor **Calculated Shot:** 70m range, 0.5s-1s idle **Arc Coil:** 10m range, ?s channeled duration, low chance for stun, low damage, up to 7 targets **Electro Pulse:** 10m range, ?s channeled? duration, guaranteed stun, single target Diriga is a sentinel that I avoid due to very low shields. Arc Coil is unreliable, and Electro Pulse is single target. I'd recommend either picking Electro Pulse or Arc Coil, but not both. Or better yet, don't pick any of those two precepts, and put more defensive stuff on. If you want a high range sentinel, I'd recommend Djinn instead. Djinn --------------- **Defenses:** Balanced Shields, Health and Armor **Thumper:** 60m range, 0.5s-1s idle **Fatal Attraction:** 30s cooldown, 5s channeled duration, 24m attraction range, 6m low damage range after attraction, enemies walk towards the sentinel for the attraction duration Djinn is my #2 choice. Very good range, standard defenses, and Fatal Attraction is fun to watch. While attracting enemies, Djinn will not shoot. Helios --------------- **Defenses:** Balanced Shields, Health and Armor **Targeting Receptor:** 10m range, 6s-8s idle **Investigator:** Scans unfinished codex entries, very helpful **Detect Vulnerability:** 30m range, 10s duration, single target, shooting marked area increases damage by 175% Got something to scan? Then ignore everything else, and grab Helios. The Nightwatch event recently for example, picked Helios, and just did the missions. In the end, I had the scans for all of them. A fair warning though. Even though Deconstructor is a very powerful weapon, due to (what I suspect to be) a bug in the Helios' offensive precept limits Helios immensely. Whereas other sentinels can rapidly switch between targets, Helios will stay idle for a looooooooong time. Shade --------------- **Defenses:** Very High Health, Very Low Shields, Normal Armor **Prisma Defenses:** Higher (2x) Shields **Revenge:** 30m range, 0.5s-1s idle, defensive **Ghost:** 10s cooldown, 10m range, 1+ target to activate, grants invisibility Normal Shade shares same defenses with Diriga. That's why I would avoid it. Prisma Shade however, has good range and good defenses. Has a defensive precept rather than an offensive one. If you want extra *sneakiness*, this is your choice. Otherwise, there are better options, in my opinion. Wyrm --------------- **Defenses:** Balanced Shields, Health and Armor **Prime Defenses:** Lower (.5x) Health, Higher (3x) Shields, Heavier (3x) Armor **Warrior:** 30m range, 0.5s-1s idle **Crowd Dispersion:** 15s cooldown, 10m range, 2+ targets to activate, puts enemies in a ragdoll state Wyrm Prime is my #1 choice as it offers moderate range, some CC for enemies that come too close, but out of all that, the highest shields. If there is a way to heal your sentinels, things may be different, but until then the sentinel with highest shields is my #1 choice. If you want some more HP at the cost of shields, normal Wyrm and Dethcube is your pick. Carrier --------------- **Defenses:** Balanced Shields, Health and Armor **Prime Defenses:** Higher (2x) Health, Heavier (3x) Armor **Striker:** 10m range, 0.5s-1s idle **Ammo Case:** +25% ammo capacity, rank 3 ammo mutation mod efficiency, 3d mutation delay, doesn't stack with ammo mutation mods (will be overridden) **Looter:** makes the sentinel attack the containers around Very good defenses, but its offensive capabilities are limited by the precept. Sweeper is your weapon of choice for this one, for obvious reasons. I'd avoid looter as it also destroys explosive stuff. Ammo case is great as it performs as a rank 3 ammo mutation mod, saving you a mod slot on the weapons itself."

137,vulnerability,Warframe,Sentinel 2.0 Suggestions + Ideas,44,5718i5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/5718i5/sentinel_20_suggestions_ideas/,2016-10-12 10:58:29,"(**TLDR Will be at the bottom, as this is a long post. I also will want to post some ideas for Kubrows 2.0 eventually, as they need some help**) These are my thoughts and ideas for a Sentinel overhaul. Just base plans for DE and such to use as a template or so to speak. I'm not hard set on anything in particular, outside of my Dethcube Overhaul lol. Just wanted to get this out in the air for them to see, and fellow Tenno as well. The main goal here is to provide Sentinels with more viability, as well as more mod options, and build diversity. Thoughts, suggestions? Let me know! So first things first, here's some additions/alterations to them. All sentinels now gain 50 Evasion, like that of Titania's Razorwing, this will help with general tankiness, while making sense considering their size, and that they float around. All Attack Precepts now become innate to that sentinel, as they are redundant since you can remove a weapon to stop them from attacking. **This does not affect Looter** (See below for Looter alterations as well) This only affects Revenge, Striker, etc. Making them innate to that specific Sentinel. They will still act as if it's on, without needing the mod to do so. Taking a weapon off will stop them from attacking. So it's a redundant mod. Sentinel weapons not using duplicate mods could also be very beneficial. **Sentinel's EHP Adjustments** (Stats in parenthesis are for the Prime/Prisma version of that Sentinel) I didn't want them buff them too much considering the evasion stat, but some stuff still needed to be higher on average in my opinion. So the baseline of Armour is 100, which is 25% Damage Reduction. And the lowest shields at 100 as well. **Carrier** Shield - 100 Power - 100 Health - 300 (400) Armor - 100 (200) Range - 15m **Dethcube** Shield - 100 Power - 100 Health - 300 Armor - 200 Range - 40m **Diriga** Shield - 100 Power - 100 Health - 350 Armor - 150 Range - 70m **Djinn** Shield - 200 Power - 100 Health - 250 Armor - 150 Range - 60m **Helios** Shield - 300 Power - 100 Health - 200 Armor - 150 Range - 15m **Shade** Shield - 300 (400) Power - 100 Health - 200 Armor - 100 (150) Range - 30m **Wyrm** Shield - 200 (300) Power - 100 Health - 200 (300) Armor - 150 Range - 30m **New Precepts, Roles And Passives** So, with most Sentinels having only Precept, I came up with ideas for them to have three total. So each sentinel has more of a niche and own playstyle/feel to them. I also came up with minor passives, more meant for flavor with a small beneficial effect. I've added mod decriptions and stats, and added additional details when needed. **Carrier** Continuing his ammo focused theme, granting him minor CC as well as additional ways to benefit you. Passive Enemies killed by Carrier have a 10% chance to drop an additional drop of ammo. Ammo Case Stays the same Ammo Deprivation ""Carrier targets a nearby enemy and drains the ammo in their magazine, forcing them to reload."" Cooldown - 15s Range - 10m Reload Time - 2.5s Bandolier Ammo is added directly to your magazine, for a limited time. Cooldown - 15s Duration - 10s Activation Chance - 50% Interval - 30s **Dethcube** Dethcube will now become more of a cube of death, focusing on reliable damage, and less on CC. He's got single target, and AOE attacks, as well as being somewhat bezerker like. Using him should make it feel like you have something deadly by your side. Using percentages instead of flat damage allows Dethcube's Precepts to be equally effective regardless of level, instead of OP early and bad late game. Passive Enemies within 5m have a 5% chance to spontaneously combust. (Chance applies only on the first time they enter the radius, and doesn't repeat if they leave.) Deth Harmonic ""Dethcube Launches a volley of missiles at a targeted area, insuring destruction."" Cooldown - 15s Range -20m Explosion Radius - 4m Damage - 25% of target's max health. Missile Count - 4 Swift Deth ""Dethcube becomes enraged when health is low, invoking bloodlust."" When Dethcube is below 50% health, damage is increased by 250% with the Deth Machine Rifle. With an additional 5% for every % of health missing below 50%. Vaporize ""Dethcube will deal fatal damage to an enemy who gets too close, while burning nearby enemies in the process."" Cooldown - 15s Damage - 50% of enemy's max health per second. Beam Duration - 4s Activation Range - 5m Burn Range - 2.5m Burn Duration - 4s Burn Damage - 6.25% of targets' max health. **Diriga** Stays the same for the most part thematically, and precept wise as it fits. He is still Electric focused, while his new precept is about focused, single target damage, on high priority enemies. Passive Getting struck by lightning strikes grants 25 energy. Arc Coil ""Diriga zaps multiple enemies within range."" Alterations: Range - 10m Proc Chance - 50% Damage - 100 Electric Electro Pulse Stays the same Calculated Shot ""Diriga charges a powerful shot, firing at the strongest enemy in sight."" Cooldown - 15s Charge Time - 2s Damage Bonus - 250% (Uses same selection process as SoTD) **Djinn** Maintaining and furthering his role in mind control/tricks, while also making him more of a debuffer. Passive 5% Evasion for your Warframe. Fatal Attraction ""Djinn draws your enemies close.."" Increased the effectiveness of the CC, by adding a ""Wake Up Threshold"" to enemies, so they don't wake up from the trance the moment djinn starts it from random damage. I also altered it so shielded enemies take a Magnetic proc, while armoured enemies still take the Corrosive proc. Cooldown - 30s Range - 20m Minimum Enemies - 2 Health Wakeup Threshold - 20% Damage - 250 Corrosive Corrosive + Magnetic Proc Illusion ""Creates a decoy on the opposite side of your Warframe, causing chaos and pain."" Cooldown - 60s Duration - 15s Activation Range - 15m Damage Reflection - 50% Thumper ""Djinn corrupts an enemy's mind with cruel force."" Applies a Radiation Proc like effect to a target, when the duration ends, the affected target is debuffed and damaged. Cooldown - 30s Range - 15m Duration - 10s Damage - 500 Corrosive damage Corrosive/Magnetic Proc **Helios** Continues the focus of scanning niche, while adding more utility to Helios. Passive Speeds up your scanning by 10% Detect Vulnerability Adjusted range, and damage percentage to balance it out and allow him to scan faster, and to apply to multiple targets rather than one. Range - 25m Damage - 200% Scan Time - 1s Max Targets - 5 Shielding Rerouter (Suggested by /u/B_Psycho2) ""Helios provides restorative shields to the user and nearby allies for a limited time."" Grants Helios the ability of a Shield Osprey. Cooldown - 30s Shielding Range - 15m Shielding Duration - 10s Investigator Only adjustment idea is to add the ability to rescan plants at half the normal range. Surveyor ""Helios Periodically scans an area, marking the enemies on the mini map."" Cooldown - 30s Range - 50m Scan Time - 5s Mark Time - 15s **Shade** Added more focus to stealth, and allowing him to pilfer at a reduced rate than that of an Ivara. Passive Enemies have a harder time seeing you. (-10% Detection Range) Ghost Alterations: Range 12m Cooldown 8s Pickpocket ""Shade uses Telekinesis to Pickpocket a nearby enemy for loot."" Range - 6m Pickpocket Time - 2s Chance for Loot - 75% Shadow Gift ""Shade grants the user enhanced stalking capabilites for a limited time."" Adds a bonus to Wall Latch and Aim Glide. Cooldown - 30s Activation - When using Wall Latch or Aim Glide Duration - 15s Enhance - +50% **Wyrm** Passive Melee attackers have a 5% chance to be repelled. Crowd Dispersion ""Wyrm unleashes a damaging radial blast, pushing nearby enemies away."" Adjusted stats slightly to be more desirable Alterations: Cooldown - 10s Range - 15m Damage - 250 Impact Minimum Enemies - 2 Dragon's Breath ""Wyrm unleashes a burst of flame, igniting nearby enemies."" Cooldown - 10s Range - 10m Max Targets - 3 Damage - 100 Fire Hoarder ""Wyrm's greed briefly grants more credits from slain enemies."" Cooldown - 30s Credit Multiplier - 2x Duration - 10s **New Mod Ideas And Adjustments** Wanted there to be more desirable effects on some of the older mods, while also adding newer ones for more choice and potential builds. Circuit Rewiring Decreases Precept cooldowns by 25% Calculated Vigor +100% Health +100% Shields Coding Extension Increases Precept Range by 30% Hacker ""Robotic enemies have a chance to be converted."" Chance: 10% when entering radius (first time only) Radius - 10m Looter ""Destroys nearby loot crates."" Cooldown - 0.5s Range - 10m (Now works on all Sentinels) Self Destruct Range - 25m Damage - 2000 Blast Damage Regen ""If your Sentinel is killed, it will rebuild itself back after a cooldown."" Initial Cooldown - 15s Uses - Infinite Cooldown increases by 5s after each death. (Will proc Self Destruct after each death if equipped) Coolant Leak ""Sentinel has a small freezing aura slowing enemies down."" Didn't want it being too strong, just upped the slow while keeping the shorter range. Range - 3m Slow - 10% Firewall Bypass ""Sentinel grants a bypass to enemy systems."" Sentinel will use a cipher if needed on a nearby console or Bursa. Cannot be used in Sorties. Cooldown - 30s Range - 15m DOS Software +4 Seconds to Hacking **TLDR** **Added Evasion for sentinels to dodge damage better, adjusted EHP, removed the generic attack precepts, and added new ones to push their roles/niche more, added new mods for them, as well as adjusting older ones to be more desirable, and made Dethcube a scalable cube of death.** If downvoting, could you state a reason why, as feedback leads to better ideas. Preferably a statement that isn't, ""x is bad/stupid"". Cheers. "

You may think, ""Well, just be careful and manage your timers then, like with Mesa, right?"" Wrong. Vex armor gives the armor bonus as Chroma's shields take damage. Therefore, if it runs out and you have no shield at that moment, you can't get back Chroma's damage reduction until your shields have regenerated, even if you immediately recast. This leads to extended periods of time during which Chroma is extremely squishy. Not good for a frame whose tankiness is his only real asset (Effigy for credit farming doesn't count.) Many have suggested allowing Chroma to recast his Vex Armor while it is in progress, but DE doesn't generally allow recasting of Damage Reduction abilities that potent (see: Shatter shield, Invisibility). So what's the compromise? Whenever Chroma casts Vex Armor, it should instantly restore his shield. Not his health, just his shield. That way, he still has moments of vulnerability when he has to recast, but won't suffer from the inconsistency that has plagued him since release. It will put him more on par with Valkyr and Wukong as a tank and increase his usability overall."

Either way, I'm gonna toss what I've been ruminating on for a while now despite knowledge that the end product of what DE actually does will probably have nothing similar to these ideas but it's kinda fun to come up with nifty ideas and changes. First off, I think the role that Limbo has is a divided one due to the current Cataclysm. Either he's an assassin-type, a defensive-type, or a glorious dapper spymaster who carries pubs in sorties because the rift don't care about lasers. The thing is, In order to play him at his most effective, you actively hamper the rest of your team. There is no getting around that fact. If you attempt to use Limbo in regular play like other frames, you are anti-team synergy. And this isn't just talking about drops or what have you. It's locking down enemies in another dimension that only you can hit or otherwise forcing players to play by the arbitrary rules that Limbo follows.. So it's clear as to why, rather than saying 'Oh nifty, a Limbo!', people are all 'Oh god, a Limbo..' and suddenly cats are sleeping with dogs and the moon is falling and both hell and high water are on the horizon (Unless it is a spy mission, of course). My aim here is to try and consolidate Limbo's rather odd kit into something that flows rather than clanks as well as being actively beneficial to team play if not at least neutral (Which is honestly going to be an upgrade either way) So let's get started being an actual fracking space wizard, aye? ----- First off, The Rift: For the time being, we're gonna leave it unchanged. Mostly.. This might sound strange but hear me out later on, okay? The Rift itself is actually fine in how it operates in my opinion. It's just the way we currently interact with it that's the problem. Limbo's passive: This is also staying the same. Now, about now I'm betting you're thinking 'Okay, so what are you actually going to do?' Well, the reason behind this is because you are going to want to be inside the rift as much as possible and thus getting those nifty bonuses as a nice side benefit. Now for the bits we actually want to work on: ----- First off, all skills with duration have been changed to have the following duration progression: 15/20/25/30 seconds. Because the weird way it was before was just silly. ----- **BANISH:** Banish now has a 'tap' and 'charge' usage that seems to be all the rage these days. No, Riftwalk is still it's own thing and rolling the two together is a terrible idea based upon casting times. Banish still operates as it currently does in it's Tap usage. For it's Hold usage, Limbo charges his weapons full of tasty Rift juice. Hitting an enemy with a weapon so charged will suck said foe into the same plane of existence that Limbo is on at the cost of 10 energy (Reduced by efficiency mods, of course). Why do this? Well, Banish now is able to do the same work as it has before as well as operate in a way that lets Limbo more fluidly kill things rather than 'Banish-shoot-banish-shoot-etc' the BANISH status effect (Below) also applies before weapon damage takes place if Limbo is also Riftwalking. Furthermore, Banish (As well as Cataclysm below) has the following effects: *Foes under the BANISH status effect suffer a 200% vulnerability to all damage types (Affected by Power Strength) Allies within 5 meters (Unaffected by mods) of a Banished foe can roll in order to Opt-In to being banished themselves, gaining all benefits of being in the rift for the remaining duration left on the given foe's banish timer.* That's right. No more 'Last Foe Standing' with a troll Limbo keeping your team from advancing to the next wave of Defense. Plus, you know, More energy and some immunities when you want them and on your terms. Yes, you can still roll to exit banish as well and the augment is unchanged.. Though allies being able to Opt-In to the Banish state means that they will be able to heal themselves as long as a banished foe is nearby. Personally I think that makes the augment totally worth considering now. ----- **RIFTWALK:** This sucker is pretty much unchanged save for one thing: Zero casting time. Seriously, it shouldn't be faster for Rift-Master Space Wizard Limbo to send some poor schmuck into his personal hell-dimension than he himself can get there. If an Augment were to ever be applied to this skill, then I would say that it would probably make it work a bit like Mesa's shatter shield in that attacks that would strike Limbo while he's Riftwalking are instead redirected to another enemy in range. ----- **RIFT SURGE:** We're just keeping the name here, folks. The bonus damage has been moved to the Banish status effect now.. Plus the whole team can take advantage of it if they so choose. Nah, what we're doing here is something short, simple, and sweet. I will agree with others that Limbo really could do with a movement ability and teleportation is a wonderful thing. Rather than carting people around, Limbo's teleport should be a simple, no frills, 'Get me there right now' sort of thing not dependent on some other enemy needing to be a target. Quick cast. 50 energy. 50 meters range (Affected by mods). We're done here. Or are we? Augment time! Rift Torrent now, rather than it's silly damage bonus, will knock down all foes within a 4/5/6/7 meter radius of Limbo's endpoint and Banishes them. Not unlike a bolt of lightning, this lets a Limbo flash to where the conflict is and make a mess out of a small cluster of dudes. ----- **CATACLYSM:** The big one. That giant swirly energy dome of.. Lackluster 'I just used my 1 skill but now it's bigger and oh hey I guess we might not need a frost IDK.' Screw that noise. Let Frost do his thing. No, we're not here to gimp some other frame's style. We're here to be a Goddamn Space Wizard and we want something that properly makes every goddamn enemy that dares intrude upon our, yes, OUR domain into our BITCH. Cataclysm now does the following. Limbo himself becomes the rip between worlds, unleashing his personal hellscape and it's arcane laws upon the world around him. The swirly energy dome is now centered on him.. Though maybe a different effect might look better but that's not the point at this moment. Limbo is treated as being In the rift while this skill is active. However, any enemy that is also within the dome of effect is NOT automatically treated as being Banished. Let's break this down so it doesn't get too complicated, yeah?: * Cataclysm still has a slowly shrinking area of effect and still has it's baseline ranges. I'm keeping this for reasons of balance as the things are about to get a little crazy: * Limbo treats any enemy within the range of Cataclysm as being Banished for the purposes of damage and any other effects tied to the Rift that are beneficial to him. Limbo is unable to do anything to any unbanished enemies outside of the bounds of Cataclysm. * Unbanished Enemies treat Limbo as if they are Outside the Rift. They can aim and shoot but it ain't doing anything. However, if they are within the bounds of Cataclysm, they Can be damaged by Limbo. * If an ally is within the range of Cataclysm, they are not automatically pulled into the Rift. Instead, any attacks directed towards them have a 20/30/40/50% (Affected by Power Strength, max 95%) chance of just being eaten by the whirling energy vortex that surrounds Limbo. An ally Also gets half the energy regeneration of being within the rift by staying in the boundaries of Cataclysm. This also applies to Limbo himself if there is a Banished enemy in the area and shooting at him. * An Enemy that is in the bounds of Cataclysm that is shooting at an ally outside Cataclysm also incurs this effect. * If both an Ally and an Enemy are within the bounds of Cataclysm, then the ally deals bonus damage equal to half of what they normally would if both they and the foe were Banished. * Finally, an ally may roll within the bounds of Cataclysm to Opt In to being Banished and gain the full benefits of such in addition to being able to damage enemies that are within the bounds of Cataclysm that are currently not banished. But wait, that's not all! Cataclysm, when active, acts as a mutator on some of Limbo's skills. * BANISH: Now affects a small area rather than one target. Blast away outside that slowly shrinking boundary! * RIFTWALK: Does Nothing. Why? Because you aren't currently IN the Rift. Right now, you ARE THE GODDAMN RIFT. * RIFT SURGE: Leaves behind a medium-sized pool of residual rift energy, restoring 2 energy per second to any ally standing in it. Maximum of 4 pools and they all disappear the moment Cataclysm ends. And, of course, the Augment: Cataclysmic Continuum works exactly the same EXCEPT that it also RESTORES the boundaries of Cataclysm (Like it friggen already should do) to where they would be for a given duration. In addition, like Valkyr's Eternal War, you can get up to 50% more duration (And, by proxy, size) than what you start with if you murder enough things hard and fast enough. ----- And that's it! You want to be an assassin? Now you can do it better by zipping over to the poor fool and wasting his ass in half the time! Want to aid in defense? Now you can be a mobile bunker that protects and aids your allies without them bitching about not being able to grab pickups! Want to be able to unload and be the Badass Goddamn Space Wizard you always knew you were? WELL NOW YOU'RE A DAPPER GOD OF YOUR OWN DAMN REALM AS IS YOUR BIRTHRIGHT! And *that* how I would rework Limbo. Feel free to supply your comments and questions!"
140,vulnerability,Warframe,The problem with Energy,5,51dfjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/51dfjf/the_problem_with_energy/,2016-09-06 14:06:37,"... or rather, the problem of the lack of it, is a major issue with the current state of Warframe, one which has been brought into view for most of the community by the recent Darvo missions and the presence of constant Magnetic procs and other ability-blocking powers. This post (which might turn out article length, and if it does I apologize) will seek to pinpoint why the often oppressive scarcity of energy is a problem in Warframe bordering on a design flaw. I will also suggest some paths DE might take to fix the issues without disrupting the current ecosystem too severely. Before I begin, I would like to mention that I am MR 16 and currently own or have used the base or prime version of every frame except for Wukong and Equinox. I am less versed in Archwing because the 6DOF navigation gives me motion sickness, so this will focus entirely on on-foot Warframe missions. First off, the concept of Energy is far from new. Every MOBA has something similar, be it called Mana or Energy or something else, and its use, careful rationing, and the opportunity costs of using it are key components of balance in any game which uses it or any similar system. The use of Energy in Warframe is fairly standard in that context: every frame has a pool, the size of which is a balance point. Every frame uses abilities, most of which use Energy in varying amounts as another balance point. Where Warframe differs primarily is in two key points: * Warframes do not naturally accumulate energy; rather, without the use of mods, consumable items, or the sparse few energy-regenerating powers possessed by frames, the only source of energy to replenish that which is spent is the random appearance of Energy Orbs from enemies and containers. * Many systems exist with which to drain all or part of the Energy pool, down to zero, even when the player does not commit a misstep. Both of these are problems. Neither one, taken by itself, constitutes a design flaw necessarily; after all, mods like Rage, Energy Siphon, and Equilibrium allow for the restoration of lost energy passively, and Limbo's Rift powers and Trinity's Energy Vampire allow players to actively restore their own or their teammates' energy pools. Unfortunately, both taken together, especially given the slowness of Energy Siphon, the rarity of health orbs for Equilibrium without specialized Warframe powers to force them to drop, and the capacity of enemies even as low as level 30 to quickly deplete health pools, constitutes a problem because without methods of restoring energy, many frames or any frame without the proper loadout will be at the mercy of RNG in the form of Energy Orb drops to be able to use any abilities at all. This brings me to my next point: Without energy, every frame in the game plays about the same. There are some differences in speed, tankiness, etc., as well as the unique passives of each frame, but overall the experience of playing Warframe with no energy is a homogeneous one. Powers and how they're used are what make frames unique, and taking away the capacity to use those powers also takes away that uniqueness. That homogeneity is further increased by the fact that any frame can equip any weapons; a Rhino with a Soma Prime, Vaykor Marelok, and Dragon Nikana will play only slightly differently than a Mesa with those weapons, assuming neither uses powers. To clarify, I am not speaking out against Nullifiers/Combas/Scrambuses, but rather against effects like Magnetic procs, Parasitic Eximus enemies, and Energy Leech Eximus enemies which attack the energy pool directly. Magnetic procs are by far the worst offender, if for no other reason than because a single magnetic proc can drain a full energy pool to zero in an instant with no counter except pre-existing proc immunity of some sort. However, all three are problematic for the following four reasons: * Losing energy makes frames all alike, dependant on loadouts and passive stats as previously mentioned. * Significant Energy can be lost even if no error is made on the player's part; simply being in a room with a Parasitic or Energy Leech eximus drains your energy, with no recourse but to kill the offending enemy as quickly as possible. * Much more energy is lost than can be regained without pre-game loadout choices; if no energy restoring item, frame, or mod is present, the player is at the mercy of blue orb drops to restore Energy. Even then, magnetic procs do not prevent picking up and 'wasting' blue orbs, but still do prevent energy gain from them. * Losing all your energy is, above all else, non-interactive and **not fun.** With the problems in the current system established, we can begin to seek solutions. The most important goals are to make the energy system, in both gains and losses, more interactive without significantly disrupting the balance of the current system. To that end, I have a few ideas, some or all of which would greatly alleviate the un-fun-ness of energy loss and gain. * Make energy regeneration passive across all (or at least most) frames. The amount could be altered from frame to frame, as another balance point; caster frames would likely get higher regen values, while passive tank frames like Inaros would get lower ones. Energy Siphon would still function as an Energy restoration aura, but could either be a flat supplement on top of the passive gain, or could scale the passive gain of each frame by a percentage. With this system, while losing all your Energy to a Magnetic proc or similar effect would still hurt, you would have a better chance at being able to accumulate enough Energy to use your defensive abilities by backing off from the fight and regrouping. * Make Energy-leeching enemies refund the stolen energy on death. They would still be priority targets, because if they aren't killed quickly you could easily run out of energy with all the vulnerability that entails, but killing them would be rewarded by putting you back at whatever energy level you were at before they showed up. This makes them more like Combas/Scrambuses in that they still disrupt bunker strategies and force players to make tactical choices/communicate. * Alternatively, make Energy Leech enemies immune to Warframe powers entirely, like self-only Nullifiers, or give them a power-immunity aura without the Nullifier bubble or canceling passive powers. This would disrupt many non-interactive player strategies (Banshee/EV Trin Berehynia, anyone?) and give players a good reason to prioritize them as targets before nuking to clean up, without the frustrations associated with the Nullifier bunker bubble. * Make Magnetic procs only destroy shields. Really, they should be this way anyway; for most frames that's already a pretty big deal, especially any frame without innate healing powers and double-especially any frame without healing powers or with a shield-dominated EHP pool. 100-&gt;0'ing a player's shields and their energy is both uninteractive and unnecessary. In any case, disregarding high-level silliness, Warframe seems to be a game about mobility and attrition, and in the absence of healing suddenly losing your regenerating buffer so any further damage taken is to your static health pool is plenty punishment enough. In conclusion, I believe that attacking a Warframe's Energy pool directly is a mistake on DE's part, and that at the very least Energy should be at least as easy to come by as it is to lose. This post has turned out to be article length despite my best efforts, so I apologize; however, I think this all needed to be said, and if anyone wants to repost it on the official forums or otherwise bring it to DE's attention they are welcome to, provided I am given credit. tl;dr stop taking my energy please, i need that to have fun with"
141,vulnerability,Warframe,[Fan Concept][Second Dream Spoilers] Focus 2.0 Two in One/High Risk High Reward,37,4vtscn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4vtscn/fan_conceptsecond_dream_spoilers_focus_20_two_in/,2016-08-03 03:53:56,"**Focus 2.0 Pre Walls of Text Hype/TLDR** Welcome to my concept of Focus 2.0. Theres a lot to read but I tried to make all of it pertinent to the idea. The basic premise of this concept is showing the Tenno and their Warframe as a unified pair, moving together and striking across the battlefield as one with the immense power of the Tenno often characterized in the lore. To gain the massive power of the Focus Merger, a Ritual must be done near the center on the ground of a large tile on a map. This is more of a rule for gameplay as opposed to anything story based, the reason for this is because completing a Merger grants one of three sets of rewards. Compared to the powers we use now in Warframe, the concept of a Focus Merger, the Tenno and Warframe fighting together, would be like dropping a nuke. Warframes are briefly given a grander set of abilities to crush those before them. Still, Mergers are not invincible, team work will help to use the powers to their fullest, and proper timing can grant rewards such as mission duration resource or credit boosters, player chosen relics, void traces, and more. Of course, such rewards and power come with costs. The power of Focus Merger can create difficult circumstances on the battlefield, and can cause consequences in using particular damage types. Please note that none of my math is accurate in the sense of balance, simply close guesses. Hope the Warframe community enjoys this project that I have put a couple weeks of work into. **Focus 1.0 Comments** Warframe is a loved game crafted by a wonderful and endearing dev team, the likes of which is quite rare, but there are always issues with a game that presents so much growth. I am certainly not the first and definitely wont be the last to point out the successes and flaws of the first iteration of Focusso, with that in mind, Ill mostly keep the critical analysis short. One Hit Wonders  Most of the Schools of Focus are one hit wonders, this is typically an often highlighted flaw, but still can be viewed as one of the most redeeming qualities of the first version of Focus. Increased energy per second, instant revives, increased survivability, chest beam, and of course Shadow Step. While the schools had few highlights, most of these abilities allowed Warframe players to take play to new levels, heights, and hours for those who choose to go that far. (Of course I recognize that there are abilities that are still quite useful beyond the highlighted five, but these are abilities that are still mostly underwhelming when compared to the abilities that most choose to focus on) Two In One  Unfortunately the idea of this within the use of Focus falls completely flat. Between Tenno and Warframe it is a fascinating idea that seemed to be expressed as companionship, a bond, a unity if we could stretch the context that far. Personally I even recall someone from a Dev Stream calling it two in one but I havent been able to find that snippet in my rewatching of some eight streams. Anyway, this idea never did leave me after The Second Dream where I felt it was realized quite nicely, two entities functioning together to be one. It was demonstrated in the image below in Dev Stream 66, and I captured these images from my own instance of The Second Dream: [Dev Stream 66 Concept Image](URL [Image Captured from my Playthrough](URL [Second Image Captured from my Playthrough](URL Sadly after that story arc the idea has not been realized through gameplay and using Focus feels contradictory to the title of the game: Warframe. When Focus is activated the Warframe falls limp to the ground and a small child/teen floats through the air for what is likely a brief second unless you prefer the use of a chest beam or your Focus Schools primary ability. This comes across as more a separate pair that can benefit one another, or one simply acting as the controller than a true unity to find power. Here-in lies the premise of much of the concept I will posit below: Two In One. **Focus 2.0 The Ritual** In my opinion (obviously, this is my concept but Ill say that anyway because the internet) Focus should center around the operators apparition emerging to fight WITH the Warframes, the two almost joining and Warframes becominng super charged. Focus shouldnt just be worth activating, it should 100% be worth turning on and wanting it to stay on as long as possible, and worth the cost of activation. That cost should be risky but momentous as well! So, I put forth the idea of the ritual as pictured below: [Hand Drawn Image of a Focus Ritual](URL The idea is a period of inactivity and vulnerability in which the apparition of the Tenno and Warframe must charge up together, forming a Merger [pictured in Power, below]. The Ritual could last anywhere from 20 to 60 seconds, the length of time determined by the number of perks that could activate or how upgraded the Tenno/Warframe Merger is. The Tenno and Warframe are placed in a shield for the duration of the ritual and if the shield is not destroyed before the ritual is completed, the Tenno and Warframe Focus Merge energies and the Warframe is empowered with abilities even beyond our current, generous imaginations. During the Ritual, the only survival mechanic is a shield bubble that surrounds the Tenno and Warframe until the Ritual is completed, or the bubble is broken due to damage and the Ritual fails. No items will affect the shield bubble and cannot be restored via abilities. The shield's strength can be increased with upgrades to each Warframes Ritual unlock in their designated Focus School; more details contained in the Focus 2.0 Schools section. It is worth noting that Rituals can at least be defended by fellow Warframes, by any means other than healing. As a rule to complete the Ritual, players must be near the center of a large room or area on the map. If the player attempts to activate the skill and is not close enough to an activation zone, one could be highlighted visually, and on the mini map. This would prevent hiding in safe locations or high up on ledges to allow for easier acquisition of Focus Rewards. **Focus 2.0 The Merger/Power** *Open your eyes, Excalibur!* -The Operator [Hand Drawn Image of a Focus Merger](URL For now, the example Ill be using is Excalibur as I made an image for a Tenno Focus Merging with Excalibur. The idea of this Merger is as simple as a players Tenno touching the shoulder of a Warframe, much like in The Second Dream, but still very symbolic. Light surges from the Tennos hand, passing massive amounts of energy between the two, and they stay connected through that bond for the duration of the Merger. The Tenno tells the Warframe to open their eyes, and energy surges from locations on the Warframes Synoptics (PCs current name for Helmet) in the form of eyes, as well as other locations on Warframe bodies. NOTE: I did not add additional energy coatings in the picture above due to time constraints on producing the image. The length of the Merger and powers would depend upon upgrades within particular Schools but would likely last anywhere from 40 to 90 seconds. The circle of the Focus Meter will be filled with a timer, and if the Warframes health or survivability mechanic is not reduced to zero before the timer expires, a finisher move will be completed and Focus Rewards will be granted to the entire team. Excaliburs Tenno Focus Merger: The Tenno places their left hand on Excaliburs right shoulder and they brandish his exalted blade, and Excalibur becomes able to wield The Blade of the Realm. The Warframes abilities become as follows: (Note: Health, Shields, Armor, Energy and Ability Duration, Efficiency, Range, and Strength would not scale with mods but School upgrades) Energy Pool: 1000 Health: 1000 Shields: 750 Armor: 850 Exalted Dash: (Active) (25 Cost) When activated Excalibur with his Tenno in tow dash to the targeted enemy, both slice through enemies within a 6 meter radius and chains up to 10 additional strikes upon activation on enemies up to 20 meters away. Chained attacks have reduced cost. Unyielding Light: [Active] [100 Cost] The Tenno teleports between fellow Warframes on the battlefield, casting unobstructed blinds at each players location, blinding up to a 35 meter radius. Radial Onslaught: (Active) (50 Cost, 5 Energy Channeled Per Second) Excalibur thrusts The Blade of the Realm into the ground and holds it there until deactivated. Light images of Excalibur dash outward from the blade, thrusting themselves at enemies to deal damage or finisher damage up to 8 enemies every 2 seconds, within a 50 meter radius. The Tenno hovers above the kneeling Excalibur using the Exalted Blade to cast unobstructed blinds every 5 seconds within a 35 meter radius, allowing for finisher damage from the light apparitions of the attack. The Blade of the Realm: (Passive) Excaliburs only weapon when empowered through the Focus Merger of a Tenno, using quick melee attacks causes both Excalibur and his Tenno to swing in multiple directions sending out energy waves that widen as they travel up to 30 meters. Once the merger timer expires, Excalibur will emit a global Unyielding Light, 7 Light Apparitions will summon around Excalibur and will dash outward to assault enemies. Excalibur and the Tenno will both grasp The Blade of the Realm and will flourish it in all directions releasing waves of light that travel up to 50 meters. The assault concludes with a spiral of the blade, then plunging it into the ground releasing a massive, expansive beam of light that damages any enemies remaining on the map. (Another Note: Theres no math behind these stats, they are just meant to seem very grand and impressive as thats what I feel could really make Focus a central point of the game) The idea of this is to create a lavish, empowering move set that is worth holding onto to until the right moment to help push a solo player or team to the next level of their missions. Quite literally in fact, if this next part doesnt come across as too radical to the devs :\ Completing a Focus Merger will immediately jump the team to their next tier of reward within a given endless mission. This would mean moving from minute 37 of a survival to minute 40, from wave 28 to 30 in a defense, and other ways in which the mission progression will jump that can be read about in greater detail in the Focus Rewards section. To elaborate a bit more on that example: If a team is in a survival, they are at minute 37 and 18 seconds when a team mate finishes a Merger, the timer would then be jumped to minute 40 to receive the minute 40 reward as well as two Focus Rewards. IF a Merger is occurring before a reward drops, and is then completed after the rewards are granted then it will jump to the next set of rewards. So, to continue with the example: A team in a survival is at minute 39 and 21 seconds, and a Merger begins, as long as that Merger completes any time after minute 40 then the timer will jump to minute 45. There in, great timing can be very rewarding, and poor timing can be a waste of time. Completing a Merger distributes Focus Rewards, and players can choose to evacuate if they like or stay and attempt to drive the mission forward, however, with great power comes great cost. These proposed nuclear like powers of Warframes also cause enemies to scale with the mission progression. So, if you were fighting level 32 enemies, and suddenly you face level 45 enemies, try not to be too surprised. There is a 10 minute cool down from the start of the mission until a player can activate their Focus Merger and another 10 minutes until the next opportunity for the player that used a Merger whether it is completed successfully or not. Additionally, if a player uses their merger and they are on a 4 player team, their three teammates are given a 180 second cool down/wait timer until they may use their Focus Merger. The team could choose to fight on, at risk against higher level enemies, but progressing through rewards faster while also gaining additional, greater Focus Rewards. Items cannot be used while the Merger is active, nor can players using a Ritual or Merger be healed by any sources. As previously stated, if the survival mechanic [health, shields, energy] drops to zero then the Focus Merger fails and the player must wait ten minutes to attempt another merger. Enemies must be slain to maintain the Focus Merger until the conclusion. If enemies are not slain within a short time period, the energy of the Merger will disperse, and no Rewards will be gained. This is to emphasize the use of these abilities in endless missions as opposed to entering a spy mission, for example, and using a Merger simply to gain Focus Rewards. URL Not gonna lie, at 35 seconds the up tempo extended portion of The Second Dream soundtrack would fit really well for the Ritual charge up and the assault during the Focus Merger :] **Focus 2.0 Rewards** Focus Rewards drop upon completing a Focus Merger as stated above, the power of a Merger forces the match type to the next reward drop. Heres an attempt to detail this within the endless match types: In a defense, if a team is between waves 6 and the end of wave 10 and a team mate uses and completes a Focus Merger before the end of wave 10, whether thats in wave 6, 7, 8, 9, or even 10, the team will be jumped to the end of wave 10 once all enemies are cleared. On the wave completion screen (ya know, the screen where you choose to stay or evac) the wave 10 reward will be displayed, followed by the two Focus Rewards, marked by Focus Reward above them as opposed to Wave #. Here is photo shopped example image of what this could look like: [Photoshopped Defense Wave Complete Screen with Focus Rewards](URL In the above image, this would be a great mission to try to complete additional Mergers as no disadvantage was created as a result of the first merger. In a survival, if a team is between minutes 5 and 10 and a team mate uses and completes a Focus Merger before minute 10, then the timer will jump to minute 10. Once the timer jumps, enemy levels will go up to where they should be at minute 10 within the given difficulty of the mission, the survival reward for that time would appear on the left hand side of the screen, and additionally, two more rewards would be shown, both of which would be labeled Focus Reward above them. Here is a photo shopped example image: [Photoshopped Survival Rewards Screen with Focus Rewards](URL *NOTE: I had to reshape the way rewards would look for Survival and Excavation type missions because showing three rewards at once would massively crowd the screen, AND Im not really a fan of flashing reward after reward for 3 seconds each. This method takes design cues from the end mission screen and would likely display for ~8 seconds.* Interception is the easiest, as if a Focus Merger is completed then it will simply jump to the end of the interception wave, and at the wave completion screen (like in defenses) there will be two Focus Rewards following the Wave# reward. While the image would be very similar to the one pictured above, I made another to further exemplify this concept: [Photoshopped Interception Rewards Screen with Focus Rewards](URL In the example image above, this was a Tier 2 set of rewards. The first tier gave focus points and ignited the battle field with fire and explosions (I couldnt get Draco to light on fire for this example image). The team chose to fight through the additional complications though to gain the Tier 2 reward set. Excavation is a bit more difficult to balance conceptually, as the rewards of the endless mode is meant to depend on the players, be faster and amplified. My first attempt at a balanced idea for this mode and my concept would simply be to drop a new invincible excavator at the nearest location to the Warframe and Tenno, and that excavator is given priority to the enemy onslaughts AI. This allows fellow team mates to either bolster the defense, theyd be defending the Focus Merged Tenno and Warframe as they can still die, or move to the next regular excavator location. If the Merger fails then the excavator is destroyed, but if the Merger is successful then a regular excavator reward is gained, as well as two Focus Rewards and 300 cryotic. The 300 cryotic scales the enemies as intended, allowing a faster progression of rewards but also offering a greater challenge if the team wants to continue and access the higher tier Focus Rewards. Here is an example image of what this could look like: [Photoshopped Excavation Rewards Screen with Focus Rewards](URL In the example above, the reward and Battle Shift consequence would likely influence the team to leave as the enemies would become more difficult and the Magnetic instability would likely cause too great a consequence against the weapons the team probably brought with them to fight the corpus. You can read more about these Battle Shifts and their consequences just below in Tier 1 Rewards. As for Spy, Hijack, Hive, Mobile Defense, Rescue, Sabotage, Assassinations, Exterminations, Captures, and any other non-endless modes I may have missed, these missions do not allow for Focus Rewards beyond Tier 1 rewards. The reason for this is because they are not mission types meant to have scaling enemies. Now one item I have highlighted a few times is that the rewards get better the further players go. This idea is that there are three Tiers of rewards, with different items to be gained from each. Dependent on the initial difficulty of the endless mission, the Tier of rewards that will be awarded on completing a Focus Merger will scale up to Tier 3 as the mission becomes more difficult. The first Focus Merger within any mission will always give Tier 1 rewards/consequences. After that, if the enemy difficulty level is sufficient, the next Focus Merger completed by any team mate will award Tier 2 rewards, and again when the enemy level is high enough any completed Merger after that will grant Tier 3 rewards. Once Tier 3 rewards are gained, any mergers after that will continue to give Tier 3 rewards. Youll know what level of rewards youll be gaining as the Focus Ring in the lower right hand corner next to the energy bar will indicate this to you and any teammate with a charged Focus Ring. If that didnt make much sense, heres a chart that hopefully this doesnt make things worse: Enemy Lvl Enemy Lvl Tier 1 Rewards -----&gt; 1  35 -----&gt; Tier 2 Rewards -----&gt; 36  70 -----&gt; Tier 3 Rewards Here are the rewards I have in mind for my first pass at this system: Tier 1 Rewards 3x Rare Resources. 10/12/15/18/20 Bronze Cores. 5000/7500/10000 Focus Points. 2x Experience for the remainder of the mission. 2x credits for the remainder of the mission. 2x resources dropped for the remainder of the mission. 2x resource pick-ups for the remainder of the mission. Unstable Transference: The Mergers energies irradiate the battlefield. -Radiation afflicts the environment and lightning surges throughout the battlefield periodically like in a radiated environment, radiation has a chance to proc to fellow players and as well, enemy to enemy. Electric surges can occur throughout the battlefield, striking any in their path causing electric procs and will increase in frequency with the use of Shock ammo. Atmospheric Destabilization: The Merger breaks coolant pipes freezing the battlefield. -Ice afflicts the environment slowing all who touch the ice and cutting all shields in half. Using ice element rounds will slow the user. The high pressure of puncture rounds is destabilized in the low pressure environment and can proc the user, friend or foe. The rounds must be primarily impact, not a small impact stat. This does not apply to melee type weapons. (NOTE: Puncture ammo used with Archwings, used in zero pressure environments, would not be the same as Puncture ammo used on the groundthis is for the sake of argument. Archwing puncture, impact, and slash ammo cannot be used in pressurized environments, why? Because reasons.) Magnetic Instability: The Merger causes a magnetic storm on the battlefield. -A magnetic storm is left in the wake of the Focus Merger, creating unstable pockets of magnetism across the battlefield that cause Impact proc to metals, knocking down players, friendlies, or enemies, all of whom can be knocked down multiple times in a field. Weapons that fire primarily impact damage (not melee) and magnetic rounds also have a 15% chance to proc their user. (NOTE: This is distinct from the magnetic fields created on Hive missions. The reason I chose to make this a different modifier is because there should be a consequence for this Battle Shift as well as an advantage dependent on the adversaries a team faces when it activates. If it was just magnetic procs, then that really only effects the team, not so much different enemy factions.) Exploding Blaze: The Mergers energy causes fire and explosions that spreads across the battlefield. -A fire from the heat of the Focus Merger spreads across the battlefield, igniting any who come into contact with it. Smoke coats the atmosphere reducing visibility for all. Explosions from unstable gas sources in the environment i.e. walls, floors, ceilings, causes blast damage and procs to all in the small range. Using heat damage has a 10% chance to cause a fire around the user and using blast damage can cause explosions to occur at or near the users location. Cannot occur on the ice Corpus tile sets. Ruptured Containment: The Merger breaks open a toxic containment on the battlefield. -The energy of Transference ruptures the sewage, toxin and gas containment systems of the environment, creating toxic pools and gas clouds across the battlefield. Any who touch the pools or gas clouds receive a toxic proc. Using Gas or Toxic attacks have a chance to create a gas cloud at the users location. Cannot occur on the Void tile sets. Corrupted Life Support: The Merger breaks life support causing contaminations to spread. -The forces from the Focus Merger break life support systems, causing corrosive and viral gas clouds to spread across the battlefield. Blue clouds cause corrosive procs and orange cause viral procs to any who touch them. The gases can also cause any who pass through them to bleed with a slash proc. Using corrosive or viral damage has a chance to cause a cloud to spawn at the users location; causing damage to an enemy with primarily slash damage has a chance to create a cloud at the damaged targets location. Cannot occur on planetary tile sets. Pancakes [cuz Tennos gotta eat] The concept behind Tier 1 rewards is to give influence to teams whether they should continue or not with their mission. Continue within difficult circumstances or/with additional resources, experience, or credits. This is my attempt to further highlight high risk high reward. The high rewards come in the next two tiers, especially the third tier; or at least theyre meant to. Tier 2 Rewards 5/8/10/12/15x Silver Fusion Cores 12500/15000/17500 Focus Points. 1x Nitain Extract Blueprint 2x Forma Blueprint 1 sigil per Focus School Undetermined Void Trace Amount 20 Ducats 1 of 10 selected Relics chosen by the player in the Void Relic Refinery 1 yet to be released Avionics 1 yet to be released Fuselage Tier 3 Rewards 2/4/6/8/10x Gold Fusion Cores 20000/22500/25000 Focus Points. 1 emblem per Focus School Forma Undetermined Void Trace Amount 30 Ducats 2 of 10 selected relics chosen by the player in the Void Relic Refinery 1 yet to be released Ship Engines 1 of three new air support drop charge blueprints equippable with any ship. *Emblems, Sigils, Ship Engine, Ship Avionics, Ship Fuselage  Only obtainable once **New Air Support Charge Blueprints  Only obtainable once per mission, each blueprint would create 10 charges. ***Only one Booster and Battlefield Condition can be activated per mission per team. All last for the duration of the mission. Rewards and the Tiers they are in would likely be unlocked as progress is made through the players first Focus School tree. This could not only make it lucrative to unlock whole trees but also to experiment with different abilities offered in each School. The first Ritual unlocks would likely unlock Tier 1 rewards, the second Ritual unlocks would unlock Tier 2 rewards, and abilities unlocked near the end of branches would open up Tier 3 rewards. **Focus 2.0 The Schools** Schools will mostly maintain a similar appearance in upgrade style and will be upgraded at the Operators Somatic Link in the back of the Orbiter. Potentially a rewards interface could be added to the left or right at the seemingly small consoles that flank the Tenno. These could be used to view unlocked rewards and what one time rewards have been received and which ones could still be acquired. A Focus section should also be added to the Arsenal to more easily swap Schools, passives, and active abilities before and between missions. Here is an example image of what Madurai would look like: [Shopped Madurai School Tree with this Concept's Changes](URL One of the largest changes I feel should affect all Focus Schools should be passive energy gain. While Shadow Step is incredibly powerful, I feel Zenuriks four energy per second dwarfed most perks for most Schools, and a similar statement could be made for the ability to instantly revive teammates in particular match types. Obviously these were meant to be highlights of Zenurik and Vazarin, but I feel that these can be spread out across all Schools while making all five of the Schools even stronger, and still making the that pair excel in their own way. All classes will have a passive that can help defend Warframes while being revived or while reviving team mates. Focus 1.0s Pool mechanic would be replaced with a School level; examples: Madurai Level 1, Naramon Level 3, Unairu Level 5. Here is a list of what is gained for each Schools maximum level of 8: Madurai: 3 energy per second, 2 active ability slots, 3 passive ability slots, +15% Power Strength Naramon: 2 energy per second, 2 active ability slots, 3 passive ability slots, +20% Power Duration Zenurik: 4 energy per second, 2 active ability slots, 3 passive ability slots, +10% Power Range Vazarin: 3 energy per second, 2 active ability slots, 3 passive ability slots, +15% Power Efficiency Unairu: 2 energy per second, 2 active ability slots, 3 passive ability slots, +20% Power Strength When Warframes use active abilities from the Schools there will be a glowing hand or hands on the Warframes to represent the strength of the Transference needed for these powers. Another option for this is that the Tenno apparition will manifest to use the power while holding onto the Warframe as they move. Personally I prefer the first option but this would obviously be up to the devs. Rituals will likely have three tiers of power and three upgrades, which would likely be added as the game continues to expand and the Tenno and their Warframes face greater and more dire threats. All Schools are equippable with any Warframe, however, the Schools in which Warframes unlock their Rituals are the only ones they can use Mergers with when said School is equipped. Example: A player could go into a mission with Excalibur equipped but chooses to equip Unairu for added survivability; Excalibur could use any Unairu actives and passives, but would not be able to use a Focus Merger as Madurai is not equipped. As some of the upgrades are more powerful, they could potentially require more than just Focus points, possibly resources as expensive as Forma to unlock or upgrade. Rituals would likely be adjustable in three levels to allow for different styles of play. Lower level Rituals would have weaker shields, and the Merger would have less survivability and attack power, BUT if completed with a proficient team these shorter Mergers could be more beneficial. As with most things in Warframe, the players will find multiple effective methods. Madurai (Assault)  Mirage, Ember, Mesa, Hydroid, Excalibur, Ivara, Zephyr Phoenix Gaze  (Active) (Non Upgradable, only changed through Passives) Unleashes a 20 meter Dragon Ball Z beam from the palm of the Warframes hand for shits and giggles that deals 2000 fire damage per second, for 20 seconds. Using the beam slows a Warframes movement by 30%, aiming while the beam is active reduces Warframe speed by 50% but increases beam width by 20%. Phoenix Gaze can be used once every 150 seconds. Can be used while in active ability states (i.e. Peacemakers, Exalted Blade, Hysteria, Artemis Bow, World on Fire, Primal Fury). Blazing Rage  (Passive) (Non Upgradable, only changed by the number of players on the team) Increases Slash, Impact, and Puncture damage by up to 20/25/30/35% additive damage to all friendly allies dependant on the number of Warframes on the field up to four, within a 30 meter aura radius. Does not scale to trials Warframes with 8 players. Rising Ashes  (Passive) (Non Upgradable)While being revived or reviving a fallen ally, if an enemy is or enters up to a 15 meter radius, an explosion is triggered from the Warframe dealing 500 damage to enemies and leaving a field with 100% status chance burning any enemies that enter it. Madurai Mastery  (Upgradable) Reduces the activation time of equipped passives. Likely reduces the time it takes for passives to activate down to 150 seconds. Passives just naturally activate, with some kind of visual indication for the player. Ritual of Zypher and Hydroid  Allows the Tenno to activate the Rituals for Zypher and Hydroid. Again, these Rituals would likely be upgradable up to 3 times improving the strength of Ritual shields, possibly even granting a defensive passive during the Ritual. These upgrades would also affect survivability and ability strengths. Note: Rituals could be up and down graded, no cost after max, to alter time for the most proficient players; this would apply to all Warframe Rituals. Meteor  (Passive) (Upgradable 3 times) Adds an additional 15/20/25% beam width to all Phoenix Gaze beams. Corrosive Phoenix  (Passive) (Non Upgradable, Could require resources to unlock) Adds 50% Corrosive element damage to Phoenix Gaze, and its variants. Phoenix Talon and Dragon Fang  (Active) (Upgradable up to 3 times, Could require resources to unlock) Equips the Warframe with a sword and dagger weapon set with its own stance. Deals 125/250/375 fire damage at an attack rate of 1.25, has a 20% critical chance and a 200% critical multiplier with a 75% status chance. Charge attacks damage all enemies in a 120 degree forward arc, up to 8 meters away, every second charge attack will throw the dagger at the targeted enemy, and after 2 seconds the dagger will explode in a 12 meter radius dealing 1200/1800/2200 fire damage with 100% status chance, the dagger returns to the player after 5 seconds. The specialty weapon set is effected by passives like Corrosive Phoenix, is equipped for 90 seconds, and has a 60 second cool down. Ritual of Excalibur and Ivara  Allows the Tenno to activate the Rituals for Excalibur and Ivara. Phoenix Flash  (Passive) (Upgradable up to 3 times) Reduces the distance of Phoenix Gaze to 10/12/14 meters, but movement speed is increased by 10/20/30%. This would mean, when aiming while the beam is active, Warframe movement speed is reduced by only 20%. Blast Phoenix  (Passive) (Non Upgradable, Could require resources to unlock) Adds 50% Blast element damage to Phoenix Gaze, and its variants. Phoenix Wings  (Active) (Upgradable up to 3 times, Could require resources to unlock)Releases Phoenix gaze damage in two expansive waves that travel up to 10/20/30 meters, dealing 8000/10000/12000 damage per wave. This ability is influenced by the elemental passives such as Radiated Phoenix. Cannot be equipped with Phoenix Gaze, instead replaces it. Cooldown is 90 seconds. Ritual of Ember and Mirage  Allows the Tenno to activate the Rituals for Ember and Mirage. Dragon Fire  (Passive) (Upgradable up to 4 times)A fiery trail remains in the path of the Warframe while Phoenix Gaze is active, burning enemies that cross through it for 1000/1150/1300/1500 damage per second for 20 seconds. Dragon Fires trail is 1 meter wide and can be widened by using Chimera Breath which leaves three 1 meter trails across roughly 5 meters. Radiated Phoenix  (Passive) (Non Upgradable, Could require resources to unlock) Adds 50% Radiation elemental damage to Phoenix Gaze, and its variants. Hades Touch  (Active) (Upgradable up to 4 times, Could require resources to unlock)Ignites the Warframe with Fire status, dealing 100/80/60/40% status damage over 30/40/50/60 seconds, and has a 120 second cool down. Ignites any enemy within a 15 meter radius for 100% status damage. This is meant for Embers passive, 100% honesty. (Note: math is not approximate, but activation and accumulated damage should be worth the gain) Ritual of Mesa  Allows the Tenno to activate the Ritual for Mesa Chimera Breath  (Passive) (Upgradable up to 4 times) Splits Phoenix Gaze into three separate beams, one fired from each hand of the Warframes hands, the third fired from the Warframes eyes. Beams deal 15/20/25/35% of the original damage (300/400/500/700 damage per second). Aiming focuses all 3 beams into 1 large beam that is 200% the size of the original beams size, and meteor can be applied to this as well. Magnetic Phoenix  (Passive) (Non Upgradable, Could require resources to unlock) Adds 50% Magnetic elemental damage to Phoenix Gaze, and its variants. Searing Reach  (Active) (Upgradable up to 3 times, Could require resources to unlock) A Phoenix Gaze beam that has a reduced width of 50/30/20% but can be fired up to 35 meters. Shares all of Phoenix Gazes passive modifiers and damage, but cannot be equipped at the same time as Phoenix Gaze. **Focus Sentient Arms** I know about the Sentient Arms from the PAX Panel, however without knowing about how they work, and by simply looking at the only evidence we have them, I assume they arent a union between Tenno and their Warframes. They are simply another weapon for the Warframes, and almost appear to be more of an addition than a rework. So, until we know more about them I will simply consider them a Focus weapon, another segment of the focus system, and my concept revolves around reworking the core system.

142,vulnerability,Warframe,[Warframe Concept] Hephaestus,11,4q8ssg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4q8ssg/warframe_concept_hephaestus/,2016-06-28 20:44:15,"Since I didn't have anything to do for a few hours I decided to create a blacksmith themed melee based warframe. I'm leaving it to this subreddit to come up with the stats for his powers. Please leave some feedback! Hephaestus Health:300 Armour:350 Energy: 225 Shield:150 Sprint Speed 1.00 Passive: Blacksmith. Enemies hit by Hephaestus melee have their loot drop chance increased by 20%. Powers: 1. Furnace Energy Cost: 25 Hephaestus fires a superheated AoE bolt at a target, melting and removing some of their armour temporarily and making them more vulnerable to damage. Armour reduction and damage vulnerability is affected by power strength, time for the target to be vulnerable is dependent on duration and rang is dependent on power range. Cost is affected by efficiency. 2. Stolen Protection Energy Cost:50 Hephaestus rips the armour and/or shield generators off the last 6 enemies attacked and coats himself in the armour or shields. The shields and armour have an active duration. Cannot be recast when active. Affected by duration and efficiency. 3. Metal Absorption Power Cost: 75 Hephaestus receives a damage reduction to all ranged weapons and attract enemy aggro. As he is being shot, he and his allies in a certain radius gain increased IPS damage to all weapons. Guns have extra multishot (to indirectly buff elemental damage) and a larger ammo capacity. Melee gains a 30% chance to inflict a blast proc. Damage reduction to Hephaestus and IPS increase, multishot and mag capacity affected by power strength, duration affected by power duration, cost affected by efficiency. 4. Blood Iron Cost: 25 (channelled) Drain 2.5 per sec. As Hephaestus hits his enemies with his melee weapon, iron is drawn from their blood. The iron drawn is stuck to his melee weapon and increases his melee damage, attack speed, reach (up to 250%) and armour. Upon activation, a bar appears on the HUD that needs to be filled up for the full extent of the increase to appear. Every melee hit on an enemy fills up 5% of the bar. Every enemy killed fills up 20% of the bar. Bonuses are affected by power strength, activation cost affected by efficiency, energy drain affected by efficiency and duration. [Edit 1] From the feedback I received from Ryanj3 and Foxboy93 I'll make a few tweaks to his abilities. His 1 would be an AoE projectile attack. His 3 would include an additional multishot bonus for guns as well as a mag capacity bonus for the duration of the ability, melee having a 30% chance to inflict a blast proc and Hephaestus attracting enemy aggro. I'll lower his sprint speed to 0.9 from one considering he's a tank. "
143,vulnerability,Warframe,[Warframe Suggestion] Limbo: Altering his Theme?: Time-Space Manipulation,16,4s84pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4s84pj/warframe_suggestion_limbo_altering_his_theme/,2016-07-11 10:02:53,"**THE CONTROVERSY OF LIMBO** *Limbo has been a repeated topic when it comes to rework, and there are many reasons as to why players want Limbo's ability set to be redone. I believe in one core problem when it comes to Limbo:* *Limbo's theme as a dimension hopper and the Rift System connected to him is the core issue with Limbo.* *Aside from the very popular argument that Limbo shines in Rescue and Sortie-Defense Missions, when it comes to other missions including many objective-focused missions it can be quite a workhorse to get Limbo right in those situations. The Rift itself prevents anyone inside to pick up Data-Modules and hack into Doors/Consoles. Combat-wise Limbo users will need to micromanage picking enemies off and can take so much time for him to do in combat compared to other players, and Limbo's stats doesn't help much in combat.* *Limbo's current theme makes his gameplay feel a bit clunky and in the wrong hands can be a deterrent for effective gameplay. I would like to propose an alteration to this theme.* ________________________________________________________________________ **THE PROPOSAL OF THE NEW THEME OF LIMBO** Bear in mind when talking about changing the theme of Limbo, I am talking into **heavy consideration** the following: * The current lore of the Limbo Theorem * The current ability kit of Limbo and his Augments * An easier teamplay tactics with a Limbo This new theme I am suggesting will add an ""alternative reason"" behind the Limbo Theorem lore and can encourage a more combat-support teamplay style. As for the current Augments of Limbo, I am trying my best to fit the effect of those within Limbo's new theme. This theme is: TIME-SPACE MANIPULATION ________________________________________________________________________ **WHAT IS TIME-SPACE MANIPULATION?** In the most general explanation: it is when a user is capable of distorting temporal and spatial forces and their continuum. Such a power can also be said to be the combination of manipulation of space (boundless three-dimensional extent) and time (measurement of flow of events), but in actuality the effect is much more powerful as it can alter reality and existence itself. In relation to the events of the Limbo Theorem, Limbo experienced an accident that caused his parts to be separated across the Origin System. This event could also have Time-Space powers interlocked with this quest as it can show the devastation of Limbo's capabilities. After all, teleportation is not the only limit when it comes to time-space. ________________________________________________________________________ **THE NEW ABILITIES FOR LIMBO IN SPACE-TIME THEME** **The Passive** * The Rift Plane mechanic will be removed with this current theme, but only some evidence of its capabilities will be added into a few of its abilities. However, the ""separation of planes"" will be absent. * The Rift Efficiency grants the Holster and Reload Speed Buff which will be the main passive for Limbo. This would maintain the space-time theme within Limbo. **The First Ability: Quantum {Single Target, Category: Buff/Debuff}** * This ability has two effects based on the target. Enemy: Limbo applies a temporal energy that slows down the targeted enemy's movements and attacks. Ally and Self: Limbo applies a temporal energy on an ally that increases their movement, spell casting speed, and health/energy regeneration. Limbo can apply this effect on himself by holding down the command. * The previous Augment Haven makes Banish restore a portion of an injured ally's health. We will keep this effect for Quantum's Augment to emulate Limbo ""rewinds the state of himself/ally."" * Since this is in a sense of combining Rift Walk with Banish but instead in the theme of Time-Space, we can create a whole new ability for Limbo to have. However, we are moving Cataclysm to a somewhat adjusted space-time version of itself. **The Second Ability: Distortion {AOE Reticle Target, Category: Damage}** * Limbo summons a dome of time-spacial stasis energy that banishes enemies that enter it and attacks that hit it acting as a barrier. After a short duration, the dome disappears and indicates as a buff accumulated damage added to the dome. Limbo can cast again reversing the space-time continuum direction to release a powerful shock wave in the direction of the reticle. Damage the shockwave does is based on the accumulation. Enemies that are banished in Distortion grant XXX additional damage for each enemy that enters it. * Enemies banished in Distortion receive double the damage from Distortion and they return on the spot of the shockwave. * Limbo can only hold onto Distortion after the dome disappears for a few seconds. Failure to recast the ability will cause the shockwave to occur where Limbo is located. * Cataclysm's Augment that causes increased Duration can be adjusted into Distortion's Augment in some way. **The Third Ability: Restoration {Summon, Category: Movement, Buff/Debuff}** * Limbo creates a temporal crack where he stands as a ""save point."" As long as Limbo is within reach of the crack, Limbo will auto revive when killed and will be teleported at that save point with the same Health stat he has with an additional few seconds of invulnerability. * Ally players can also be given the same effect if they press the [X] button to gain its effects. * A player that is revived this way cannot be revived again this way for 60 seconds. There will be a timer to indicate this on a player. **The Fourth Ability: Suspension {AOE, Category: Buff/Debuff}** * An AOE cast ability where Limbo releases the highest level of space-time energy around him causing enemies within the range to be frozen in time. While an enemy affected with this ability do not receive damage, all damage will be accumulated and then dealt to the individual enemy once the ability ends. The damage received at the end of the ability is also multiplied by XXX%. This emulates that there is some sort of ""temporal recoil"" event being present with this ability. * Rift Surge's Augment can have some effect into Suspension. ________________________________________________________________________ **PROS AND CONS FOR THIS SUGGESTION** *PROS* * Introducing a new playstyle that is a lot easier to understand and is also teamwork-friendly. Less clunky * The theme space-time powers can fit well not only within the Warframe lore, but explicitly to the Limbo Theorem Quest lore * Probable minor changes to Limbo's current augments to be applied to these new abilities *CONS* * Suggestions of the removal of the Rift Plane can cause some outburst and there are players that still feel fine with the way Limbo is now * Limbo's stats are fragile and while his current theme he can be both vulnerable in the Normal and Rift Plane, the vulnerability is also in this new time-space theme * Possibility of no one accepting the new change to the theme and would prefer creating a ""separate Warframe with the same theme or with a Time-based theme."" ________________________________________________________________________ **CONCLUSION** *Basically, I am suggesting the change of removing Limbo's current mechanic of ""existing in a separate plane where he can rule"" into ""time-space manipulation that can delay, store, and displace damage."" This is just my general idea."
144,vulnerability,Warframe,[TCN] Analysis of Warframe Abilities: Duration and Range Base Values,20,4sukit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4sukit/tcn_analysis_of_warframe_abilities_duration_and/,2016-07-15 03:46:56,"Every month on TCN I take a deeper look at some of the game's features, mechanics, or systems. This month's topic is Warframe's ability design. Unlike some of the other pieces I've written in the past, this article is much more opinion oriented. The central focus of this article is to highlight issues with base duration and range on a variety of abilities and the disconnects they cause in gameplay. Warframe has grown in the past few years to have a very mobile and fast-placed combat system. A variety of new mechanics have been added to the game and there have been massive changes to the core design of the ability system in general. The result is a gap which continues to grow between various abilities as they once were when first added and what they have become as the game has grown beyond them. This article will make the case for why the Duration and Range attributes should be adjusted for a variety of abilities. This post will be a somewhat abridged version of the main article. You can read the full thing on [tennoclocknews.com](URL *** If you're on this subreddit, I'm assuming you have some basic knowledge of Warframe and the various warframe abilities. If not, the intro on TCN has more information on the basics. The article is a bit lengthy and Reddit formatting makes walls of text very... blocky. I would recommend checking the site version over this plain text. *** #FOREWORD In Warframe, you control a character which has access to a variety of abilities which grow in strength and magnitude as you play. Your progression is marked by a notable increase in power with these abilities which can make a substantial difference in the flow of combat. The abilities differ between each class of Warframe  the powered suits which the players control  and provide combat utility, support for allies, or pure destructive power against your enemies. These abilities can be further modified using upgrade modules players can earn through gameplay as well. The focus of this article is to analyze a variety of these abilities with a primary focus on base values for Range and Duration effects and how they are used. As a general preface before the article, I just want to say that I am aware of many of the more recent issues players are experiencing and reporting in regards to Specters of the Rail but I have not had the time to properly digest or prepare an editorial on the topic. The general rule of thumb for me will be to wait at least a month before addressing new content in the game. However, I am concerned with many of the changes made to the Market and the apparent disregard to addressing the issues of affinity generation. I have addressed both of these topics in the past here on TCN as well. If interested, you can view them here: - [The Roles of Affinity in Warframe](URL - [Analysis of Warframe's Market Prices](URL And as a final note: Hotfix: Specters of the Rail 4 addressed my main concerns with usability and presentation of information in the market. Expect a follow-up to the article linked above in a few months from now. *** ## The Inherent Flaws of Ability Design For this topic I decided to cut straight to the heart of the matter rather than dance around the intent. This article will address the base values of Duration and Range for a variety of abilities; what they are, why they are a problem, and how they could be improved. My intention is to objectively identify conflicts between design intent and realized gameplay in hopes of inspiring discussion and change. However, this entire piece is opinion and not to be treated as fact. The core of my point of view is simple: Warframe is a fast-paced game with a great deal of emphasis on mobility and high quantities of enemies. Many abilities simply fail to be reliable enough for use without a heavy reliance on mods or energy restoration mechanics. This is problematic for both new players and experienced players as it can lead to misinformed first impressions or lead to modding in a way which renders some skills useless. Many of the cases below are unsurprisingly about the older Warframes. The ability system used to require Mods to use which made it possible to use a Rank 3 ability when your Warframe was still Rank 0. It wasn't until Update 15 that the current system was introduced and the old ability mods were removed from the game. The old system still had the problems listed below, but they were not much of a hindrance because you could essentially pick the rank you wanted to use. ### Case Study 1: Ash - Smoke Screen ## **The Core of the Problem:** The base duration is too short for lower ranks. Smoke Screen has a casting time of roughly 1.5 seconds. At Rank 0, the invisibility lasts for 2 seconds. Each rank adds 2 additional seconds to the base duration of this ability; 2/4/6/8 seconds duration at ranks 0/1/2/3, respectively. Though the energy cost is much lower than many other #2 abilities, this ability is nearly useless at low ranks due to the long casting animation. However, the duration at Rank 3 is acceptable for what this ability seems to be intended for; 8 seconds is enough time to re-position after staggering enemies and getting in a few hits before being revealed once again. **Suggested Changes:** Increase the base duration per rank from 2/4/6/8 to 5/6/7/8 and consider reduce the casting animation to 1.0 or up to 1.2 seconds. With this change, the end-game use of Smoke Screen will more or less remain the same while simultaneously providing a much better experience at lower ranks. Smoke Screen is clearly not intended to be a permanent invisibility tool due to its lower duration relative to other invisibility-oriented abilities; it is meant to apply some minor crowd control to enemies surrounding Ash to give him time to either adjust his position or stealthily deal with enemies. These changes would not interfere with the augment functionality. ### Case Study 2: Banshee - Sound Quake ## **The Core of the Problem:** The energy costs are too high at lower ranks which results in a very short duration at lower ranks. Without modding for efficiency or extra energy capacity, when you unlock Rank 0 Sound Quake at Banshee Rank 10, you can only keep this ability active for roughly 5 seconds. Even then, that is assuming you were at max energy before casting. Though it is apparent it was meant to encourage players to earn ranks on this ability, the result is that this ability is simply not feasible for gameplay. I will make note of the vulnerability issues and lack of mobility when using this skill, but I do not think those are design flaws. Sound Quake is an ability meant for defensive or stationary events whereas the rest of her kit is mobile and fluid. It encourages you to choose wisely when you want to use the ability and is meant to be a supportive crowd control for allies to attack the affected enemies. **Suggested Changes:** Adjust the energy costs per rank to be a normalized value of 12 energy per second. Players should expect to be able to use this ability without fully draining their energy for at least a few seconds at a time. Many of the newer warframes which use energy drain toggle abilities have a similar design where the drain does not change per rank - as do many of the reworked warframes. I do not think it is necessary to adjust the augment; the energy costs are justified. ### Case Study 3: Chroma - Elemental Ward and Vex Armor ## These two abilities share the same core problem and will be addressed together. **The Core of the Problem:** The base duration is too low at low ranks. As a preface; I find it problematic how Chroma's elemental affinity selection works. Regardless of that, both of these abilities share the same duration growth: 10/15/20/25 seconds at ranks 0/1/2/3, respectively. 50 Energy is difficult to come by every 10 seconds in gameplay, let alone 75 or 125, and make these abilities difficult to maintain or justify using often when no energy replenishment sources are available. Considering the barren descriptions on the abilities page in game, the short duration compounds the difficulty of understanding what the ability even does when used. However, that is not to say that these abilities should be expected to have 100% of the time. It's more of an issue of the base duration being too short to feel as if it is being useful against enemies. There should always be a cost to the benefit. **Suggested Changes:** (1) Allow these buffs to be re-cast at will so that when you do have energy you can preserve the benefits (particularly from Vex Armor). (2) Increase the base duration per rank from 10/15/20/25 to 18/20/22/25. (3) Alternatively to the second suggestion, adjust the base duration to 15/16/18/20 and add new mechanics which can extend the duration based on combat. For every time an enemy is afflicted by your attuned element (Heat, Cold, Toxin, or Electric) _status effect_, extend the duration by 0.5 seconds (scaling with duration mods) up to a maximum of +20 seconds (scaling with duration mods). For every enemy killed, the duration of Vex Armor extends by 1.0 seconds (scaling with duration mods) up to a maximum of +20 seconds (scaling with duration mods). This change to Elemental Ward could potentially give Spectral Scream a new opportunity to synergize as well. 10 seconds is not enough time to really make use of either of these abilities and that should be addressed. Chroma does boast a larger energy pool than other similar tanky warframes, but even he struggles to use these abilities in conjunction. The third suggestion plays into Chroma's feral aesthetic; by lowering the base values but adding duration on kill with a cap, players would still have to re-cast the abilities and utilize his sizeable energy pool. ### Case Study 4: Ember - Fire Blast ## **The Core of the Problem:** The range of the ring of fire limits the viability of this ability. Ember's kit has gone through some awkward transitions in the past, though ultimately the current version of her World on Fire ability has earned her a spot as one of the most reliable choices for Exterminate missions. Fire Blast, on the other hand, has become an ability which does not mesh well with her other skills. Though I won't be addressing damage balancing in general, it is worth noting that Fireball deals double the damage of this ability. The ring of fire left behind after casting is too impractical in standard gameplay as well. **Suggested Changes:** (1) Add functionality to the space within the ring of fire and _possibly_ (2) allow range mods to affect the size of the ring of fire. As a stationary ability, a base radius of 4 meters is difficult to make use of in the first place, but tying the damage and effects to the ring itself is unreliable in most forms of combat within Warframe. By giving the inside of the ring some functionality - be it damage, crowd control, or utility - players would have an incentive to use the skill. Examples of utility could be to apply Ember's Passive ability when inside the ring or to cast Accelerant (at half range) when enemies are killed within the ring. If the ability remains stationary it should provide a more profound effect than being a mild inconvenience for melee opponents which dash through its circumference. ### Case Study 5: Excalibur - Exalted Blade (Radial Blind) ## **The Core of the Problem:** The base range of this utility functionality of Exalted Blade is impractical. For half of the cost of a Radial Blind cast, you will blind enemies within 20% the range of Radial Blind. Though it could be argued that the energy cost is the larger problem with this ability, the effect is ultimately what weighs it down. 5 m insignificant in the flow of battle and is a poor base value for scaling values with mods. **Suggested Changes:** (1) Adjust the blind radius to 5/6/8/10 per rank of Exalted Blade (or Radial Blind). (2) Alternatively, increase the blind radius to a flat 10m at all ranks. As it stands right now, the slide attack is simply too expensive for the benefits it gives. Adjusting the energy cost could improve the situation as well, but it still leaves you with a very impractical effect which barely covers your immediate vicinity. I think it's justifiable that the Radial Blind cast should be more potent as a crowd control effect, but not by this magnitude. The slide attack, as it is right now, is a detriment to Exalted Blade channeling. ### Case Study 6: Mesa - Ballistic Battery ## Though this ability is not affected by it, there is a flaw in its design in regards to duration. **The Core of the Problem:** This ability takes far more time to prepare than the payoff is worth. A single shot fired is not worth the time it takes to charge up this ability. It effectively limits your equipment options if you choose to utilize the ability, though I would recommend ignoring the ability entirely. **Suggested Changes:** (1) Change the ability from affecting the next single shot to affecting all shots within a short duration of 3 seconds at all ranks (scaling with duration mods). (2) Alternatively, add an effect that empowers all of Peacemaker's shots by consuming the stored power on cast. This ability does not synergize well with anything else in Mesa's kit or with over 80% of the current ranged weapon options. By allowing it to affect multiple shots or empowering Peacemaker, it could become far more useful in the flow of combat. ### Case Study 7: Oberon - Hallowed Ground and Renewal ##### Hallowed Ground ## **The Core of the Problem: **The rectangular shape of the field lends itself poorly to defensive gameplay. The beneficial effects from this ability are impractical to maintain as a fresh cast would have to be placed as allies continue to move through the fray. It is an ability far better suited to stationary gameplay and most notable useful in defense-based objectives such as Interception or Defense missions. **Suggested Changes: **Improve the base width of the ability from 2/2/2.5/2.5 to 2/3/4/5. (2) Alternatively, change the range of the ability to be radial as opposed to its current rectangular shape. Oberon is often referred to as the jack of all trades and master of none. This adjustment would not do much to change that, but it would improve the usability of this ability on defensive missions. A more interesting way to expand the coverage on this ability would to add a way to expand the size of the Hallowed Ground by using other abilities as a form of synergy. ##### Renewal ## **The Core of the Problem: **The healing over time is removed from allies once fully healed, regardless of duration. Though potentially a useful ability for dealing with Nightmare missions with No Shields or Health Vampire and other similar mechanics were health drain is a concern in the mission, it is ultimately limited in effectiveness by both the energy drain and its tendency to end before you would want it to. **Suggested Changes:** Allow the buff to persist even while at full health. The nature of this ability is so that adding bonus duration _reduces_ the overall duration of this ability. While that may be somewhat non-intuitive, it does create an interesting duality between the choice of optimizing immediate healing or providing lesser but long term healing. Removing the maximum health component as a factor in the duration would create more opportunity for optimization between those desired effects. ### Case Study 8: Rhino - Roar ## This particular case covers other abilities with similar buffing mechanics such as Valkyr's Warcry and Volt's Speed. **The Core of the Problem:** The base ranges are too low for mobile gameplay. The problem these types of abilities face is that through the course of gameplay you and your allies will ultimately spread out and sometimes venture beyond the affinity sharing range, let alone the range of these skills. **Suggested Changes:** (1) Allow these skills to be re-cast at will and consider to (2) increase the base range to 50m (affinity range) for all ranks. Either one of these changes would be sufficient, though it would certainly improve the gameplay experience by doing both. As seen elsewhere in this article, being able to re-cast abilities at will is recommended as a solution for buffing abilities once again. ### Cast Study 9: Vauban - Bastille ## **The Core of the Problem:** The base range at lower ranks is too small. When Bastille was first added to the game it did not have a limit on the number of enemies it could affect. A tiny Bastille could be a massive net of enemies webbed together. This was changed in Update 9.8, but nothing else about the ability was adjusted. **Suggested Changes:** Increase base range to 10 across all ranks. The intent is not to cover an entire room, but affect more than a closet. With the target cap changing from an infinite amount to being 6/8/10/12 enemies per respective rank, a larger base range will not impact the feel of this ability. However, out of all of the other abilities recommended to improve the base range, Bastille is perhaps one of the few where increasing the range per rank gives a feeling of progression and growth to the player. ### Case Study 10: Volt - Speed ## **The Core of the Problem:** The base duration on lower ranks are too low. Though at a much more manageable cost of 25 energy and being able to cast it again at will, 5 seconds of 10% movement/melee speed does not translate well into gameplay. **Suggested Changes:** Increase the base duration to at least 10 seconds across all ranks. Though the effect would still be weaker than most might notice, increasing the duration would lend to improving the experience of the ability that has long been attributed to Volt as the core of his unique skills at lower ranks. As both a combat and mobility skill, 5 seconds is not nearly enough time to deal with enemies or traverse the mission. *** ## A Shift in Design Philosophy ### Many of the cases listed above stem from a change in design philosophy over the years; ability design from three years ago does not hold up as well with what the game has become. Newer warframes and reworks have been built around the idea of efficiency and filling a niche in gameplay with utility and mobility which make for interesting progression and use with the new skills presented. Many of the abilities listed in the case studies above have not been updated in light of what the game has become and remain relics of what the game once was. Some of the abilities listed above are flawed by concept; they're interesting and unique but impractical for gameplay. This is not a problem that can be solved, only treated, because Warframe is an ever-changing game. A review or analysis of Warframe a year ago would confuse players that started just recently; massive changes are commonplace in Warframe's development and the developers constantly build atop of what the game once was. Many abilities would benefit from a flat baseline range or duration across all ranks. Rhino's Roar was changed in Update 16.10 to have a flat 30 seconds base duration across all ranks and has in turn made modding for and utilizing the buff much easier. Though Valkyr's Warcry is in a much better state now with the [Eternal War augment](URL its base duration of 7 seconds is insignificant in the scope of the length of a full mission and the 75 energy required is expensive to come by. These two abilities are similar in that they are meant to empower you and your allies and though they differ in what they present, they share the problem that applying the buff to others in a standard mission can prove quite difficult without halting mobility to gather for the buff. Especially for Valkyr with such a low base duration, it can be difficult to utilize this buff or re-apply to all allies once it falls off. It is my opinion that the focus of ability design should reflect the mobility of gameplay. If an ability is meant to be defensive or otherwise stationary, it should offer a meaningful reason to remain stationary. Comparing Ember's Fire Blast to Vauban's Bastille may be somewhat indirect, but it is my opinion that Fire Blast should provide a more tangible effect to control the area it is set in similar to Bastille's utility in combat. If an ability is meant to empower allies, it should be capable of applying to allies without forcing them to stop and wait in a confined space. I think Digital Extremes shares this viewpoint as well - the more recent reworks to Mag, Volt, and Trinity in particular all showcase this ideology of improving the mobility of abilities and the feasibility in buffing your allies. Not every warframe ability needs a complete rework, but many could stand being brought up to the current standards and expectations. ## Closing Thoughts ## Aside from all that was mentioned above, I still have deeper concerns that I would want to see addressed in the future. Warframe continues to grow and add new toys, new mechanics, and new environments in which to experiment with everything provided, but relics of older systems and mechanics continue to weigh down the abilities and weapons that were created back in those times. Forma resetting a weapon to Rank 0 is no longer a major concern due to the changes with starting equipment capacity relative to Mastery Rank in [Hotfix 18.13.2](URL but having all of your Warframe's abilities reset still feels clumsy when compared to the pre-Update 15 mod cards. Earning your ranks the first time you level a frame from 0-30 should allow you to retain some of that power when applying the forma, especially with the aforementioned recent changes to starting mod capacity. The energy system is feast-or-famine; either you have too much energy and you spam your abilities rather than using them strategically or you're so starved for energy that you cannot use any abilities. The old system of 25/50/75/100 for skills #1/#2/#3/#4 has been challenged many times in the past, but it needs to be revisited again entirely and particularly for abilities designed to buff allies. However, changes the energy _costs_ alone will not accomplish much; energy generation would have to be addressed in some form as well. Players do not have a meaningful method of earning or generating energy through combat and are instead either reliant on abilities, team energy restores, or just pure luck from opening containers or killing enemies (both of which are inconsistent at best). Warframe will continue to grow and change in the future and I am optimistic enough to believe that these concerns can and will be addressed in the future. These are not crippling problems that will drive players away, but they are parts of the game which could be improved to create a better experience for more satisfying and rewarding gameplay."
145,vulnerability,Warframe,Improvement and Balance of Melee Combat,2,4mcab0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4mcab0/improvement_and_balance_of_melee_combat/,2016-06-03 20:36:04,"**The Goal of the Proposal** The goal is to have melee combat as a viable alternative to gunplay. While these changes won't instantly provide you the efficiency of mass murder with a Tonkor and Synoid Simulor nor the burst of Vaykor Hek and Sancti Tigris nor the safety of Dex Sybaris and Latron Wraith, it is a step in the right direction in my opinion. I think the changes I have brought up to you will help melee combat at least move several steps towards that goal if not anything else. Melee combat is a prime example of high risk/high reward gameplay. This specially holds true in high level content. You sacrifice every inch of your safety and fight in the thick of the battle in melee range. There's nowhere to run. If you mess up, you die on the spot. You must be provided the tool to combat this vulnerability. DE knows that. That's why they provided melee combat with unique tools for compensation; Life Strike and Naramon passives. While their hearts were at the right place, they probably had too many things on their plate (as is normal since it is a very big game) and overlooked how some of their tools were heavily biased towards one type of melee weapons; Critical weapons. Due to various mods which were released later on including the bias of these tools, a stigma has appeared in the community. And, this stigma isn't irrational. Critical weapons are clearly better than Status-based weapons in most cases. Hybrid Critical/Status-based weapons are quietly walking around with smiles on their faces about somehow escaping the stigma, but they aren't exactly the talk of the town either even when they have the potential to be. I plan to change all of that. And, I don't plan to do that by ""nerfing"" anything. This isn't Status supremacy. This is equality between Critical and Status-based weapons. We already have a problem of having too many mandatory mods (e.g. Pressure Point, Serration, Hornet Strike, etc). And, I don't plan to address that. I'm sure DE will already take care of it in the future Damage 3.0 whenever that appears. Instead, I plan to address ""band-aid"" mods. These mods have clouded people's builds leaving them no room for customization without massively penalizing their potential damage output. For now, I'd like to take a look at the worst of all ""band-aid"" mods, Body Count, and hopefully relieve some pressure from such airtight builds. **Deadly Intent (Naramon)** **Before** Mind Spike grants 15% / 20% / 25% / 30% increased Critical Chance with a melee weapon for the duration of the mission. **After** Mind Spike grants 5% / 10% / 15% / 20% increased Critical Chance and 3% / 5% / 7% / 10% increased Attack Speed with a melee weapon for the duration of the mission. **Shadow Step (Naramon)** **Before** Mind Spike grants 5 / 6 / 8 / 10 seconds of invisibility when inflicting Critical damage with a melee weapon for the duration of the mission. **After** Mind Spike grants 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 seconds of invisibility upon inflicting a Critical Hit and a Status Effect with a melee weapon for the duration of the mission. *(Note: Even if a particular melee attack produces both a Critical Hit and a Status Effect, the buff will not stack upon itself within a single attack. For example, it'll still be 8 seconds of invisibility, not 16 from one attack. The buff can be refreshed as usual.)* **Berserker (Mod)** renamed to **Lethal Arrogance (Mod) - 9 cost** **Before** The Berserker mod increases a melee weapon's attack rate by 5%/10%/15%/20%/25%/30% (R5) for 4/8/12/16/20/24 (R5) seconds on a Critical Hit. **After** The Lethal Arrogance mod increases a melee weapon's Attack Speed by 5%/10%/15%/20%/25%/30% (R5) for 4/8/12/16/20/24 (R5) seconds upon inflicting a Critical Hit and a Status Effect. *(Note: Even if a particular melee attack produces both a Critical Hit and a Status Effect, the buff will not stack upon itself within a single attack. For example, it'll still be 30% Attack Speed, not 60% from one attack. This is not to be confused with the actual stacking mechanic of this mod since that'll remain untouched allowing the same old 75% maximum Attack Speed upon stacking it three times. The above rule only applies to a single attack which satisfies both conditions of producing the buff. The maximum state of the buff can be refreshed as usual.)* **Weeping Wounds (Mod) - 9 cost** changed to **14 cost** **Before** Weeping Wounds is an uncommon Melee mod that increases Status chance as the Melee Combo Multiplier increases by 7.5%/15%/22.5%/30%/37.5%/45% (R5). **After** Weeping Wounds is an uncommon Melee mod that increases Status chance as the Melee Combo Multiplier increases by 10%/15%/20%/25%/30%/35%/40%/45%/50%/55%/60% (R10). Additionally, each Melee Combo Multiplier after the total Status chance of the weapon reaches 100% increases its base damage by 10%. *(Example: You are running Voltaic Strike + Virulent Scourge + Weeping Wounds on Lesion which has a base Status Chance of 30%. With Voltaic Strike and Virulent Scourge, you get 36% more Status Chance totalling to 66% Status Chance. 60% of 30% is 18%. Therefore, you need 2 stacks of Weeping Wounds to reach above 100% total Status Chance; 102% to be precise. That means, when you reach 2x, the very moment you reach 102% total Status Chance, you get +10% base damage. When you get 2.5x, you get +20%. When you get 3x, you get +30%. Theoretically, when you reach 6.5x, your base damage is practically doubled as you get +100%, but let's not try to hit that number, okay? I'm not responsible for your medical bills. And, it goes on and on. Remember that this buff is a percentage-based buff straight to your base damage just like Pressure Point and Spoiled Strike. So, every other damage mod including Elementals will scale with it. Of course, if you use a weapon with even higher Status Chance, you'll start the buff's counter faster. Technically, if you reach above 100% Status Chance with just regular mods, you'll start with +10% from naked 1x. Also, of course, your buff and its stacks decay and disappear along with your counter since your total Status Chance changes.)* **Body Count (Mod) - 9 cost** **Before** Body Count is a common Melee mod that extends the duration of the Melee Combo Counter by 2/4/6/8/10/12 (R5) seconds. **After** Body Count is a common Melee mod that slows down the decay of the Melee Combo Counter by 5%/10%/15%/20%/25%/30% (R5). **Melee Combo Counter (Game Mechanic)** The default duration for Melee Combo Counter is now 15 seconds. During this period, the counter does not decay. The period can be refreshed by hitting any target as always. However, upon hitting nothing and, therefore, producing no combo in the counter for 15 seconds straight, it starts to decay at a rate of 10% per second. *(Note: This 10% varies according to the counter. The drain is always 10% per second no matter which multiplier you're on. That means, it always takes 10 seconds for a complete multiplier to decay, less if it wasn't full. The number of hits that represent that 10%, therefore, changes along with the multiplier you're on. So, if you had just reached exactly 5x and stopped doing anything for 15 seconds, you'll start to decay and go down to 4.5x in 10 seconds. In 40 seconds, you'll go down to 3x. In 80 seconds (1 minute 20 seconds), you'll drop from 5x all the way down to 1x, your starting counter.)* **Description of the Changes** Some of the **Naramon** passives (**Deadly Intent** and **Shadow Step**) have been modified in order to equally support both Critical and Status-based weapons. Necessary restriction has been applied to ensure that hybrid Critical/Status weapons do not get any unfair advantage over the rest without hampering absolutely anything from the original passives' offerings. **Berserker** has been renamed to **Lethal Arrogance** in order to better fit its updated theme. While the buff it provides and the mechanism it uses remain entirely unchanged, it is now equally suitable for both Critical and Status-based weapons. Necessary restriction has been applied to ensure that hybrid Critical/Status weapons do not get any unfair advantage over the rest without hampering absolutely anything from the original mod's offerings. **Weeping Wounds** has been greatly enhanced both in effect and in requirement in order to provide Status-based melee weapons its own counterpart of the popular mod, **Blood Rush**. Up until now, many of us have felt forced to run **Blood Rush** on some Status-based weapons in order to have some scaling. While it helped a little bit, it was always strictly inferior to what it offered to the Critical giants. Well, there's no need to borrow groceries from the neighboors anymore. Status-based weapons now have their own, and it's tailored to work with them just as **Blood Rush** is tailored to work with Critical weapons. Attention has been paid to check whether Critical weapons could abuse **Weeping Wounds** in addition to **Blood Rush**. They cannot due to the steep requirements. The sacrifice they'll have to make will cost more DPS than gain. Sorry, this is for Status-based weapons and to a degree hybrid Critical/Status-based weapons only. **Fragor Prime** can't have this particular cake. In the end, Critical weapons will still deal the biggest numbers with their red Crits, but that's fine. That's what Critical weapons do. We're just neutralizing the disparity, so that we can also say the name of a Status-based weapon when suggesting John what weapon to farm besides **War** and **Nikana Prime**. **Body Count** is completely changed since the old ""band-aid"" doesn't make sense anymore with the rest of the changes. It is now useful in some niche situations with some niche builds but far away from being mandatory. The tyranny of the old **Body Count** ends here, and a flexible new mod slot is now available for all melee enthusiasts to further customize their builds. **Melee Combo Counter** mechanics have been updated to incorporate intuitive quality of life features which work as the foundation for the rest of the changes to bring melee combat up to speed. *A guess at an everyday Critical build after all of these changes (e.g. War, Nikana Prime, Fragor Prime, etc):* *Pressure Point + Blood Rush + Organ Shatter + 90% Element # 1 + 90% Element # 2 + Lethal Arrogance + Primed Reach + Life Strike* *A guess at an everyday Status-based build after all of these changes (e.g. Lesion, Lacera, Ninkondi, etc):* *Pressure Point + Weeping Wounds + 60% Dual-Stat # 1 + 60% Dual-Stat # 2 + 90% Element # 1 (or 60% Dual-Stat # 3 based on the weapon) + Lethal Arrogance + Primed Reach + Life Strike* *A guess at an everyday hybrid Critical/Status-based build after all of these changes (e.g. Mios, Jat Kittag, Prisma Dual Cleavers, etc):* *Pressure Point + Blood Rush + Weeping Wounds + Organ Shatter + 60% Dual-Stat # 1 + 60% Dual-Stat # 2 + Lethal Arrogance + Primed Reach/Life Strike/Dual-Stat # 3* *PS: Everyday builds aren't maximum DPS builds.* *PS#2: I'll tweak the numbers if I feel they're necessary. Do leave your comments, because several heads are better than one. Some of these things may seem a bit confusing specially to players who don't use melee weapons a lot. Do ask me about anything that was unclear.*"

147,vulnerability,Warframe,Enemy Scaling: Realistic Solutions,0,4p8tj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4p8tj0/enemy_scaling_realistic_solutions/,2016-06-22 14:13:49,"After reading /u/_Violetear 's post, I got to thinking about scaling, specifically enemy level. At high-enough levels, enemies will one-shot you regardless of your defensive mods. This is poor game design as their is no counter besides 'cheese methods': spamming abilities that prevent you from taking ANY damage. However, this post is **not** for complaining about the current scaling problems, but rather a discussion about **solutions.** &amp;nbsp; **Here is my proposal: Enemy level continues to scale indefinitely. However, changes occur based on the current enemy spawn level in mission.** &amp;nbsp; ##Changes - **Level 40**: Squadrons start spawning. Squadrons are bonus small groups of a specific enemy that are more difficult to deal with. Example: 4 bombards. These are in addition to regular spawns. - **Level 40**: Damage cap. Higher level enemies do not deal additional damage. - **Level 50**: Armor cap. Higher level enemies do not mitigate any more damage. - **Level &gt;50**: Warframe powers begin to have a diminishing effect. Perhaps something like 50/X where X is the current enemy level. That way, a level 100 enemy receives 50% of the power's effectiveness and a level 500 enemy, 10%. This applies to Focus abilities as well (I'm looking at you, Shadow Step). And certain abilities, like Ivara's Prowl, will have increased drain as their 'diminishing effect' - **Level 60, 80, 100, 120, etc**: Increase enemy spawn frequency. Eventually, this may cause performance problems. Alternatively, only increase squadron spawn rates (and squadron size). &amp;nbsp; ##Additional balance changes: - **Increase enemy leveling/scaling rate.** Make it exponential, or at least non-linear. - **Increase rewards for fighting higher level enemies** as an incentive to push your limits. This has been long discussed, and these changes should remove cheese elements from the game. &amp;nbsp; The goal of these changes is to remove the frustrating elements of endless scaling while still providing a challenge. Now, enemies will eventually overrun the Tenno by sheer numbers and reduced vulnerability to Warframe powers rather than near infinite health pools and insta-kill damage. &amp;nbsp; *All of these numbers are rough and flexible.* The concept is more important. What do you guys thing and what other suggestions do you have that allows Tenno to push the limits without resorting to cheese methods? &amp;nbsp; EDITS: - Formatting, I suck at it. - Math changes.

148,vulnerability,Warframe,I hate Carrier.,0,4d4qcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4d4qcp/i_hate_carrier/,2016-04-03 13:34:15,"I hate it. No, no, let me back up. I hate the goddamned cult that's sprung up around it being the be-all, end-all companion, let alone sentinel. Let's look at the facts. Discounting prime and prisma, we have seven sentinels: Carrier, Dethcube, Diriga, Djinn, Helios, Shade, and Wyrm. Seven distinct ways to equip a Sentinel. Of their weapons, Deconstructor can only be equipped on Helios, but any other weapon can be equipped to any sentinel. So no sentinel gets any points for its weapon but Helios. Speaking of Helios, let's talk about what he gives you. He gives you access to the Deconstructor sentinel weapon, which, I've heard, is pretty bitchin' if built right. But let's talk precepts. His attack precept has a similar range to Carrier, though can be buffed further by applying Reach to his trademark Deconstructor. His utility precepts include Investigator, letting him scan even some of the flightiest enemies into the codex for you, and Detect Vulnerability, which can scan a target with a complete codex entry /for free/ to create a weak spot on that enemy, akin to Banshee's Sonar ability. So, we have a utility sentinel with a restricted attack range that is nonetheless capable of hitting hard, and applying damage multiplication to a single target at a time. That has its uses. Next, we have the Dethcube. This sentinel is the only sentinel with two true attack precepts, Swift Deth and Vaporize. Swift Deth is your standard attack precept, this time with a max range of 30 meters. Vaporize has a very short range, only up to four meters, but will hit for 900 damage in between volleys from the main equipped weapon. Is there a place for a purely attack-based sentinel? I'm not sure. I'll have to tinker more. The Shade has access to the Revenge attack precept, which also has an attack range of up to thirty meters. It has the interesting wrinkle, however, of never firing first - the Shade will only attack targets that attack you directly. Its Ghost precept, however, is where Shade really shines, automatically turning you invisible for up to an /entire minute/, provided that there are enemies within up to 10 meters of Shade, and you do not launch an attack of any sort. A perfect tool for those tense revives and getting past a clot of enemies you really don't want to tangle with. The Diriga is my personal favorite, but I'll attempt to judge impartially here. It comes with the default attack mod Calculated Shot, with a range of up to 70 meters, the longest attack range of any sentinel. While this pairs well with the sniper rifle it comes with, the Vulklok, it can nonetheless be used with any sentinel weapon other than the Deconstructor. Electro Pulse will repeatedly stun a single target within 10 meters, keeping them periodically immobilized and mostly incapable of attack, until they either die or end up separated from the Diriga by 15 meters or more. Arc Coil, meanwhile, can zap up to 7 targets within 10 meters, dealing 100 electric damage to each with a small chance to proc the electric effect. Next up is Djinn, the only Infested-based sentinel. His 'Thumper' attack precept clocks in at a max range of 60 meters, giving him a very respectable attack range. The main event for Djinn, however, is his Fatal Attraction precept. This precept temporarily prevents enemies from firing, drawing them in towards Djinn for five seconds, at a maximum draw range of 24 meters. If enough enemies (possibly as low as 2) are within 6 meters, a radial DoT effect sets in, dealing 150 damage in total over 4 ticks, while also stunning those enemies. This provides a useful localized crowd control, both preventing nearby enemies from attacking, and drawing them into a cluster for easy group killing. Then, we have the Wyrm. Its default attack precept is Warrior, rounding out the 30 meter max trio. But all sentinels get at least two unique precepts, and Wyrm also gets Crowd Dispersion. If there are two or more enemies in range, with that range being as high as ten meters, it will release a low-damage blast of magnetic damage that ragdolls all enemies in range, knocking them back. Which, finally, brings me to Carrier. It's default attack precept, Striker, has a maximum range of only /ten meters/, regardless of which weapon is equipped to it, giving it the shortest attack range of any sentinel. It will not attack targets at a distance greater than ten meters, and any damage done to an enemy beyond ten meters was done accidentally while Carrier was aiming at something closer. His core precept, the reason for his being, is... Vacuum. Items within up to twelve meters will fly up to carrier, provided the tenno is touching the ground, and automatically loot those items for you. A task which you could accomplish by moving those twelve meters /yourself/, which can easily be done while still engaging the enemy. And, finally, we have as an option, Looter, which causes carrier to, every three seconds, shoot at a loot container within up to 16 meters of it. With its gun. Which you probably didn't silence. Carrier's only purpose seems to be trivializing an already trivial part of the game, picking up loot. Meanwhile, it has no defensive or crowd-control abilities, and is in possession of the smallest attack range of all sentinels, preventing it from ever picking off all but the closest threats. I am amazed - no, not amazed, /appalled/ - that this sentinel repeatedly makes it to the top of tier lists, as the be-all end-all end game sentinel. You're running around with a glorified roomba, instead of being able to crowd-control in three different ways, turn invisible, act as damage multiplication, or just straight-up do more damage. It's not critical to playing the game. It's a crutch, one you put there yourself, because you're being too lazy to just take half a second out of your time to move into the middle of that group of enemies, disrupt them with your powers and guns, and move on. Or even just turn around to grab that loot behind you - or better yet, run just a foot to the right so you'd pick it up without having to turn back. And while you're running that little extra bit out of your way, your Dethcube is annihilating some mook. Your Shade is turning you invisible to sneak past that crowd. Your Djinn, Diriga, and Wyrm are doing three different flavors of crowd control to let you pick the group apart. And if your Helios has been good and fully scanned those enemies into the Codex, then some poor enemy just got a big glowing target painted on them. Seriously people. Carrier. Is not. End. Game."
149,vulnerability,Warframe,Late Night Cuppa Thoughts: Noob Frame,0,4dcx4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4dcx4m/late_night_cuppa_thoughts_noob_frame/,2016-04-05 06:19:24,"It rained tonight. The city is wet and quiet. And, so, I got a cup of tea, lit up a cigarette and started to think. I think about noob frames. What is a noob frame? Well, a noob is just a newbie. A newbie is a new player. A noob frame would have to be a frame that's ideal for a new player. But, then again, what is ""ideal for a new player""? Easy to use? Perhaps, easy to obtain? Perhaps, both? Let's get right to the point. The Warframes (also known simply as ""frames"") which are the easiest to play in Warframe follow: **a) Ash** Largely automated. Very strong base scaling. Requires very little interaction to be effective. Very simple mechanics. **b) Ember** Almost entirely automated. Subpar base scaling. Requires almost no interaction whatsoever to be effective. Very simple mechanics. **c) Excalibur** Very good base stats. One build is used only for spamming one ability standing in one place. Another build has arguably the best melee weapon (while it's outdamaged by Hysteria's overkill damage), it has, unlike Hysteria, huge coverage of waves in every swing that covers the map and has no falloff in damage. There's a big range panic button that blinds everything that you can see and that can see you, and opens them for finishers if necessary. With an augment, this dramatically increases damage output even without finishers. Very simple mechanics. **d) Frost** The most commonly used build is almost entirely automated. A snow globe is used for protection from everything. With an augment, it chills everything down that tries to get inside it. It scales with Power Strength and armor, and can be recast as many times as wished. Incredibly simple mechanics. **e) Mirage** One build spams one button standing in one place for the entire mission that blinds everything in the map indefinitely as it's spammed with low energy cost. Wow. The other build gives unmatched defense for a glass cannon with hilarious damage multipliers for weapons. Incredibly simple mechanics. **f) Nova** Both builds spam one button standing in one place. That's it. She either slows everything down to a crawl or speeds it up for others to kill them. Incredibly simple mechanics. **g) Trinity** Two equally overpowered (in the actual sense) builds. One build fills up everyone's energy bar in barely a second or two. Constantly. Indefinitely. She spams it and its cost is nonexistent since she gets more than she spends. She does nothing else. The other build gives everyone 99% damage reduction. Wow. However, the other build has a small window of vulnerability. And, it takes a little bit of practice to produce self-harm and reactivate. So, the first build has incredibly simple mechanics while the second build has intermediate mechanics. **h) Vauban** Both builds spam one button in one area or several areas, and that's it. It either stops everything from moving in or puts it all in a small bundle. Incredibly simple mechanics. These Warframes are the easiest to play out of all Warframes as long as their viable builds are being used (each usually has two). You can make them a bit harder to play with more complex mechanics if you attempt non-meta builds such as a damage Frost or finisher Ash or Tesla Vauban, etc. But, for the vast majority of players, the meta builds are encouraged and used for obvious reasons. Here's the funny thing. Noob frames are usually Rhino and Valkyr. Yet they cannot make the game easier than anybody in the aforementioned list. It takes Rhino all four of his abilities to handle himself in most scenarios. Valkyr on the other hand suffers from having no long range CC which hampers her capabilities in defending objectives as well as meaningful ways setting off timers. All of the aforementioned Warframes, however, can either kill everything everywhere, stop every enemy from doing anything, stop every enemy from walking more than a step per minute, gives endless energy to everyone to spam every ability, gives near invulnerable damage reduction to everyone, gives 6-7 times more damage to any weapon, can kill everything from 30 meters away and more. All of their mechanics are just as simple as Rhino and Valkyr. But, because they make the game easier than Rhino and Valkyr can make, their easy mechanics provide more bang for the buck. Yet the above Warframes are the ones mostly used by the elite community (which I'm guilty of myself in many scenarios -- yes, I take Mirage to Interceptions and Vauban to Infested Defense). And, this is the same community that looks down upon Valkyr and Rhino, both of which are ""harder"" to succeed with while costing the same level of skill input. Neither of them can stand in a place and do anything. Neither of them can do everything with one button (this specially holds true for Rhino). What's a noob frame again? It must have something to do with the ease of obtaining it, because judging solely from skill sets and effectiveness, Ash, Ember, Excalibur, Frost, Mirage, Nova, Trinity and Vauban are the actual noob frames. And, except for Ash, Mirage and Vauban, the rest are just as easy to acquire as Rhino and Valkyr. Public squads can easily carry anybody through any boss fight as well, because people like me often kill Salad V for a quick pair of Neural Sensors or Tyl Regor for Gallium. Many people are killing bosses all the time for different reasons. So, the next time, when you give advice to new players about which Warframe to get, please ask them go get one of these Warframes instead of your default answer (i.e. Rhino and Valkyr in most cases). Because, you aren't making the game easier on them with those two. You're making the game a lot easier on them with the OTHER ones. You know why? Because, they're much easier to play than Rhino and Valkyr. Their mechanics are on the same level, but their effectiveness is better -- therefore, easier. Their initial Warframe will be fully capable of clearing enough planets to get a hold of any of those ""noob frames"". Oh, and also, don't use the word ""noob frame"" unless you specifically mean Warframes which are easy to obtain as a new player. At least, don't call a Rhino or Valkyr a noob frame while using any of the above Warframes. That level of irrationality should be illegal. PS. I hope I didn't offend anyone. It was just a thought. I wanted to let some people know that it's okay to play a Warframe they like to play. I wanted them to feel comfortable. I wanted them to have a valid logic to counter elitism when they suffer from it. I have no personal agenda. I don't own Valkyr (I sold her a long time ago for a slot back when I was poor since I rarely played her anymore), and my Rhino is chilling in the back with his Palatine Skin. I'm mainly an Ivara/Saryn main. Thanks for reading. My cup of tea has gone cold. =S"
150,vulnerability,Warframe,Grindframe vs. Skillframe,114,4ekd8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4ekd8w/grindframe_vs_skillframe/,2016-04-13 16:31:22,"Alrighty So everyone knows this game is pretty much grindframe where its all massive aoe damages vs hella annoying enemies or overpowered enemies. Some people like that, I did for a while but I want to add an element of challenge. Something difficult, something thrilling and fun. Space ninjas was originally the go to ""thing"" to describe the tenno, but we couldn't be further from that. I made a previous post about changes and counterplay for annoying enemies. THEN I REALIZED, they dont need nerfs, they need fun counterplay that brings uses the mechanics we already have Heres a link to the first post talking about counterplay to nullifiers. URL . TLDR: easily broken null bubbles for anyweapon, that regen 100% after a couple seconds, to give a window of vulnerability for skills and guns to kill weak nulls. That didn't really bring us back to the roots yet, but what if we incorporated some elements of parkour 2.0 into the enemies. These are all speculations but for each ""overpowered"" enemy they'd have some sort of easy weakness to exploit. 1. If you get above an artic eximus (preferably with bullet jump/time) and ground slam you instantly break their shield and one shot them. Artic eximus arent over powered enemies but you get the idea. 2. Bursas already received their nerf, but that removed the difficulty p much. I agree that the spawn rate had to drop and everything, but lets say you buffed their power again. But now you make it so that if you shoot the head of the bursa X times or deal X damage to the head you can short circuit the bursa for a short amount of time allowing you to run behind deal bonus damage. 3. Parasitic eximi aren't limited to any type of unit, but since they steal your energy they've got to keep it somewhere right? What if all parasitic eximi had a ""sonar"" mark on them glowing blue, in which attacking it would deal bonus damage (essentially combusting the stolen energy) and on death would restore energy back (or always drop an energy orb). OH YEAH THIS BLUE MARK WOULD ALSO PINPOINT IT ON EXIMUS STRONGHOLD SORTIES YEAH!?? 4. Scrambus aren't a huge problem either but those slidey things seem AWFULLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO SLIDE ATTACKS. Slide attacks would knock them down opening them up for finishers. (ahahaha just kill me. this was a joke... not really) 5. High level sapping ospreys. Whelp... i have no idea how to fix these overpowered pieces of shit. Going by the name sapping, maybe they could have their health linked to allied corpus and they actually survive by sapping the ~~souls~~ shields of nearby corpus or environmental electric devices. Shooting out the lights or something would kill these guys and their devil spawn orbs of death. (Seriously this one is a joke though. I have no idea) Of course, these are just my thoughts. You can think of other ways to add fun or skill or balance into the game. I'm sure there are many of you who may agree with this, and enjoy your mass killing and i have nothing against that, i do enjoy killing groups of mobs with a max forma tonkor or wipe a room with a max power/range nezha. However, without nerfing the power of enemies, and adding in counterplay that forces us to use our mobility and aiming to defeat enemies is more of my type of game. (I mean you could still brute force your way through everything if you want). Food for thought considering all these ideas would take a lot of effort to implement i think. Comments and criticisms? This is just my take on how balancing would work. Lets not make anything fodder, but lets not make anything anti-fun either."
151,vulnerability,Warframe,"DE, control your crowd control.",0,4feul2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4feul2/de_control_your_crowd_control/,2016-04-19 10:02:14,"DE, control your crowd control ~~NOW!!!~~ when it's convenient for you. =) Crowd control in Warframe has slowly spiraled out of control. Did it really? No. Did it a little bit? Yes, sir, it did. Crowd control is an incredibly important game mechanic. Games like these always have three umbrella mechanics; defense, offense and crowd control. Defense is purely defensive. Offense is purely offensive. Crowd control is neutral. It can be used both defensively and offensively; often at the same. Crowd control exists in almost all video games worth some salt. It encourages strategic gameplay. Is this the case in Warframe? Yes and no. Yes, it is the case for majority of our Warframes. No, it isn't the case for a minority. Unfortunately, a smaller amount of Warframes doesn't change the gravity of the problem, because the VIP seats are usually taken by a small amount of people. And, I don't just mean that for a video game. It doesn't stop a Warframe or even a weapon for that matter to be all over the game doing something bad *just because* it's the only one. It really only takes one. Therefore, the minority argument is null and void. There are many types of crowd control in a game, but they can generally be categorized in two umbrella forms; soft and hard. Soft crowd control lets an enemy do what they do less efficiently. Hard crowd control stops an enemy from doing anything. Clearly, hard crowd control is a very powerful tool. And, usually, it's balanced. How is it balanced? You have higher energy cost and lesser base range for hard crowd control. You have lower energy cost and higher base range for soft crowd control. This simple formula is used by many, many games (think of the difference between a Fingers of Frost proc and a Frost Nova if you ever played WoW back in the days). And, Warframe is no exception. Well, it is no exception except some major exceptions; Mirage and Rhino. Mirage's Prism and Rhino's Stomp are hard crowd control abilities. They both have an unusually large base radius for a hard crowd control ability; 25m. With Overextended, Stretch and Cunning Drift, this becomes 62.5m. Mirage is usually used more than Rhino due to having more durability through abilities with a bad Power Strength build compared to Rhino with a bad Power Strength build. So, Blind Mirage will be used as an example here over Stomp Rhino, but they both need to be looked at equally. Anyway, this is very bad. At the moment, missions like Mobile Defense and Interception have become irrelevant. Even a raid like Law of Retribution uses this as a crutch, but I'll be more lenient about the raid since it's a raid and has many other puzzles which must be overcome independently of hard crowd control anyway. So, it's cool, I guess. You can choose to recruit players and deliberately avoid Blind Mirage players in your squad, but that's only experiencing 50% of the whole co-op experience since the other 50% is matchmaking. That solves nothing. The higher level the content, the more tendency of a Blind Mirage appearing in any Mobile Defense or Interception mission. It's pretty much become a staple for Sortie Mobile Defense, Sortie Interception and T4 Interception. Nobody's doing anything there, DE. I highly doubt you intended to introduce Sortie missions, your daily endgame dose for us, to have people stand around and wonder about their lives looking at a percentage counter. I will not be lying if I said that it takes more effort for a fully min-maxed squad without a Blind Mirage to do a Mobile Defense or an Interception mission in Ceres than it does in a Sortie 3 mission with a Blind Mirage. Do you see the problem here? &gt; It encourages strategic gameplay. Most crowd control abilities in Warframe encourage strategic gameplay. In my opinion, these two abilities do not. They do far too much to far too many targets. They are doing the opposite of encouraging strategic gameplay. They're encouraging you to do nothing of value and get free rewards. That needs to be changed for the health of the game's longevity. Am I here to whine and ask for nerfs? Do I want these abilities to be removed? No, absolutely not. I use a Blind Mirage every now and then. I know what she can do, and I'd like her to keep her charm. They shouldn't be removed. In fact, their mechanics needn't be changed either. I want them to be more in line with other Warframes in the game. In fact, if I have missed any, please do mention their names including their abilities in question in the comments as well at your will. The point of it all is to have balance and harmony. This little paragraph is my personal point: &gt; Soft crowd control lets an enemy do what they do less efficiently. Hard crowd control stops an enemy from doing anything. Clearly, hard crowd control is a very powerful tool. And, usually, it's balanced. How is it balanced? You have higher energy cost and lesser base range for hard crowd control. You have lower energy cost and higher base range for soft crowd control. This simple formula is used by many, many games. And, Warframe is no exception. 62.5m is big, DE. It covers the entire map zone of any relevance and then some more. And, in that entire area, nothing is happening. That's bad. Even more so, because we have many Warframes with soft crowd control abilities that have less coverage. That's really bad. So, I think it's going to be fantastic if we balanced Prism and Stomp a bit more. Since they're already Mirage's and Rhino's 4th abilities, their cost needn't be changed, only range. They should have 10/13/16/18~19m base range to more in line with others such as Nezha's Divine Spears which is yet another hard crowd control ability. That means maximized modding should take that to 47.5m which is still quite a big area but may encourage the Mirage and Rhino players to spread their abilities a bit more around them in order to cover the effective zone. This also opens up small windows of vulnerability which is healthy. And, while we're at it, increase the base range of certain soft crowd control abilities such as Equinox's Pacify &amp; Provoke because of Peaceful Provocation. I think, Nova's fine with her Molecular Prime as it scales with Power Duration. I think the suggestions are fair and balanced. What do you think? Thank you for reading. PS: I'm sure there are more soft crowd control abilities just like Equinox's Pacify &amp; Provoke with Peaceful Provocation which could use a bump in range. Take her as an example, not as an absolute selection. =) "
152,vulnerability,Warframe,"Mixing up Warframe abilities, if your choice of Primary/Secondary focus school could change their effect.

So, when you go to your ability menu, you can opt to keep your normal ability effect or switch to an effect that has been changed by your selection of Primary or Secondary selected Focus school.)* **This time, my example is Saryn.** (Having some fun with this.) *Madurai ""Reckless Attack, speed and savagery""* *Vazarin ""Counter opponents' attacks""* *Naramon ""Knowing the enemy""* *Unairu ""Endurance, outlast enemy""* *Zenurik ""Dominate, choke resources, overwhelm""* **Saryn - Spores** * Madurai - Reduce duration drastically and keep overall damage. (The negative effect, losing duration, means you might not be able to spread spores fast enough or pop them fast enough with Melee. So, instead, you get faster damage.) * Vazarin - Popping spores heals self and allies in a short range of the explosion. Viral status chance reduced. (Vazarin is about countering the enemy during the battle and its main ability is a healing wave, why not mimic it? Otherwise, I had a hard time settling on an effect) * Naramon - Enemes affected by spores, receive more vulnerability to their I/P/S weaknesses - impact for Corpus, slash for Infested, and puncture for Grineer. Negative effect, spores cost is increased slightly and popping range is slightly reduced. (Naramon is all about knowing your enemies, spores is all about debuffing/weakening them, made it go a step further.) * Unairu - Damage from spores is removed, enemies affected by spores now deal less damage. (Instead of the DoT weakening enemies resource of health, have it reduce their offensive resource. Unairu is about outlasting the enemy) * Zenurik - Viral status chance reduced dramatically and enemies affected by spores, now move much slower. (Zenurik is about overwhelming the enemy or cutting off its resources, I couildnt think of a better way.) **Saryn - Molt** * Madurai - Duration drastically reduced, damage increased dramatically. (Madurai is all about offense. With the short timer, you want to make the Molt count by getting close to enemies. Description of Madurai includes being reckless, thought this would fit it well) * Vazarin - When Molt explodes, it blinds all enemies in the same explosion radius, range is also increased. The negative, damage is decreased and duration is decreased. (Vazarin is about countering your enemy, blinding them allows you to run away better or to do the opposite and gun down the helpless.) * Naramon - Melee attackers have a chance of being hit with the damage of Molt without causing it to explode. When Molt does explode, theres a chance that a large chunk of toxic organic matter left over and delt a nice chunk of damage (more than the original explosion damage). The debris will have a larger radius than the normal explosion, to be able to have a chance of hitting ranged attackers better. Downside of the change, increase power cost, duration decreased, and range is decreased. (This change covers infested groups and dealing with the other factions ranged attackers) * Unairu - On initial cast, Saryns max health is increased and she receives a small armor boost for a set duration. Negative change, damage and range reduced. (Akin to any animal that sheds its skin, they come out nice and shiny, ready for the world again. This will help Saryn outlast her enemies that much more) * Zenurik - On explosion, Molt stuns enemies in an increased radius (from the base explosion radius). Negative changes, power cost is increased and damage is decreased. (Similar to the Vazarin change, this lets you overwhelm a large group of enemies.) **Saryn - Toxic Lash** * Madurai - Damage is increased, hitting enemies with melee gives you a temporary attack speed bonus. Downside, popping spores no longer returns energy. (I feel like this fits the theme of increasing your offense while being reckless.) * Vazarin - A paralyzing toxin cloud follows you around, enemies affected by the cloud are stunned every few seconds. Downside, damage bonus is reduced to nothing or removed. (I feel like this fits the bill, when trying to counter the enemy by stunning anyone inside or slightly outside your melee range. You can spread spores, try to recover some energy, and spread toxin status still with this change.) * Naramon - Popping spores on Infested has a chance to proc a Blast status, Corpus - magnetic, and Grineer - corrosive. Energy return from popping spores is reduced and duration is decreased. (taking suggestions for this one, it could go in many directions) * Unairu - After popping spores, receive a temporary damage reduction boost. Damage bonus is removed. * Zenurik - Weapon range is dramatically increased and Saryn receives a small movement boost. Downside, damage bonus is reduced as well as duration. **Saryn - Miasma (Didn't spend a whole lot of time on this one, could go many ways)** * Madurai - Damage increased. Decreased range. (get closer, deal more damage) * Vazarin - Stun lasts longer and range is slightly increased. Decreased damage. * Naramon - Duration is increased. With each tick, Infested enemies have a chance of receiving viral and cold status, Corpus have a chance of receiving Magnetic status, and Grineer have a chance of receing either Puncture or Corosive status. Overall damage should be the same but should be reduced slightly and power cost is increased. * Unairu - Enemy weapon effectiveness is Corroded and they deal a lot less damage for an extended period of time. Overall damage is decreased and the temporary stun is removed. * Zenurik - Stun lasts a little bit longer, damage is now toxin based and has a chance to proc a toxin status. Enemies hit by Miasma will release another, smaller, Miasma. Range and damage are decreased and the power cost is increased slightly."

154,vulnerability,Warframe,The worst enemy designs in Warframe,1,43fp1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/43fp1a/the_worst_enemy_designs_in_warframe/,2016-01-31 07:09:03,"We've had a lot of enemies added to the game over the years. Some better than others. Some definitely worse than others. Many are in dire need of updating or reworks, but either way I want to highlight the worst of the worst in Warframe. I'll exclude the more general things like overall tracking/alert status mechanics. So, in no particular order of grievance: *** ###Juggernaut (and variants) **Combat:** The biggest problem with these guys are the animations. **(1)** They will start their wind up animations facing one way but then attack you by tracking you without moving. **(2)** Their vulnerability state is tied to a random attack animation with a very short window which you may end up missing if you're using line of sight to avoid damage from the first issue or if you got knocked around a bit *or* if it just happened to charge away from where you were fighting it. Warframe has always been fantastic when it comes to visually communicating combat animations, but this is one huge exception to that standard. **Spawning:** Generally not a bad thing with how it works, but sometimes you'll get a second one almost immediately after the first. Could probably stand to have a bit of a longer cooldown especially when we have to deal with the RNG nature of waiting for their vulnerability animation. **Vulnerability:** While the Juggernauts are not 100% invulnerable and there are some cheese options available to kill it through their armor, these things are nightmarish for newer players / undergeared players. It's nice that we have a way to avoid having them spawn on some mission types, but it doesn't really make up for the fact that we have no method of triggering vulnerability. **Recommended Solution:** Fix the attack animations first and foremost. Add a way to trigger the vulnerability state. Maybe add a way to flip the Juggernaut over by having it charge into a wall or something. Maybe add a way to damage its legs so that the next time it charges it falls over. Something. *** ###Nullifier Crewman (and variants) **Combat:** Bullet sponges. Literal bullet sponges. The way the shield decay works requires quantity moreso than quality of bullets, but if you shoot it too much in a short time you're effectively wasting ammunition. Likewise, weapons with a low rate of fire will struggle to deplete the shields. Any mission with a Nullifier Crewman will limit your options for an effective loadout. **General AI:** They don't seem to try to give their allies cover (nor do their allies try to stay within the shield). They just sort of walk at you. Makes them easier to deal with but seems kind of odd for a support unit to behave this way. **Recommended Solution:** Just change them to behave like the Grineer Disruptor Drone. Physical-based weapons ignore the shield. Or at the very least remove the shield decay mechanic and allow quality hits to break the shield in significantly less shots without being capped to decay a set amount. Allowing Snipers and Bows to pierce the shield completely would definitely help. Aside from that, make the Nullifiers focus on providing cover for their allies instead of marching down their own path to attack the players. And maybe a way to break their backpacks so that the bubble cannot reactivate (particularly desirable vs Capture Target Nullifier variant). *** ###Bombard (and variants) **Combat:** Rockets trail for a long time and have ridiculously good tracking. **Recommended Solution:** Add a maximum tracking time to each rocket. After that time elapses, the rocket can no longer turn. *** ###Napalm (and variants) **Combat:** The fire damage hitbox/animation is wonky. Sometimes you'll take massive damage before the visuals even register. **Recommended Solution:** Second pass at animation vs damage application. *** ###Manic **Vulnerability:** Melee hits appear to work while they are invisible, but shooting at an invisible manic does not seem to work. Also, weird interactions with things like Trinity's EV and Nova's MP. *** ###Rampart **General AI:** Instant turning, blind firing into nothingness (and/or invis), absurd health scaling with level, and enemies do not dismount them as you move out of range / line of sight / out of the room entirely. **Recommended Solution:** Improve the above. *** ###Disruptor Drone **Spawning:** Clusterfuck spawning. I've had raids where 4-6 spawn spawn within 10m of each other. This was particularly a problem when they changed the nullifier shields to block most weapon types. **Recommended Solution:** Add in some kind of spawning conditions which prevent them all from appearing in the same place at the same time. Something to force the spawns to spread out a bit more than what it is now. *** #Bosses *** ###Vay Hek (Drone Form) **Vulnerability:** Locked to an animation, erratic movement during it, and no way to trigger it manually. Phases cap how much damage you can do per vulnerability state resulting in a prolonged encounter even if you have the firepower to deal significantly more damage. **Recommended Solution:** Add a way to trigger vulnerability. *** ###Sargus Ruk **Vulnerability:** Locked behind an RNG mechanic and no way to trigger it manually. Phases cap how much damage you can do per vulnerability state resulting in a prolonged encounter even if you have the firepower to deal significantly more damage. **Recommended Solution:** Add a way to trigger vulnerability OR create a clear state of invulnerability which creates a new active objective which then results in vulnerability. Would work best if he got a custom tile designated for the encounter. Have him set the room on fire during his invulnerability state and make a ""the floor is lava"" scenario for the players to overcome. You trigger vulnerability by doing something like activating an environment object to put the fire out or disrupt his channeling. A parkour-based thing. Could be cool. *** ###Lt. Lech Krill **Vulnerability:** Locked behind an RNG mechanic and no way to trigger it manually. **Recommended Solution:** Add a way to trigger vulnerability. *** ###Alad V &amp; Zanuka **Combat:** Skill purging via Dispel Bomb is kind of a boring mechanic. Also, Zanuka missile tracking is kind of ridiculous. **Recommended Solution:** Rework the Dispel Bomb to be less spammy and maybe use the silence mechanic (similar to what the Violence Acolyte has) to prevent player ability spam for a short time as well. *** ###Raptor **Combat:** Missiles deal damage past line of sight, past large obstructions, and have ridiculously good tracking. **Recommended Solution:** Reduce the AoE range of the explosions or at least have them not go through large/thick obstructions. *** ###Mutalist Alad V **Vulnerability:** Visually makes no sense that when his shield is deployed he is vulnerable. Vulnerability is locked behind an RNG mechanic and cannot be triggered manually. **Recommended Solution:** Make it so that when he deploys the barrier he is invulnerable but when the barrier is gone he is vulnerable. Add a way to trigger his vulnerability state manually. Like Sargus Ruk, Rotten Salad could benefit from having a unique boss room. A mutalistified version of The Jackal's room could work nicely. *** ###Phorid **Combat:** Projectile based attack with limited visual cues and Juggernaut-levels of inconsistent animations. **Recommended Solution:** Improve visual cues in the fight. Improve animations to visually communicate attack tracking. *** There are other smaller gripes along the way. Mostly we just need to improve visual communication of various attacks and add a way to trigger vulnerable states outside of waiting and doing nothing but waiting and waiting."
155,vulnerability,Warframe,Advice for speedrunning the Divine Will Tac Alert,9,45cd91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/45cd91/advice_for_speedrunning_the_divine_will_tac_alert/,2016-02-12 12:49:31,"1. Blessing Trin recommended or high EHP frame for convenience. Ivara works well with Sleep + Cloak arrow but many attacks will track you while stealthed. 2. Run to the boss room as quickly as you can. Deal with any Bursas and lockdowns in the way. 3. Do not bother with the upstairs hacks to let the Bursas down. Just jump up to where the Crewmen are, run behind the pillar to the Bursa to kill and hack it. 4. Damage the boss. Repeat steps 3 and 4 about 8-10 times. *** How this event was clearly *supposed* to work is that you would make your way to the boss, hack one of the 4 terminals to let a Bursa get to the floor level, defeat the Bursa, hack the Bursa, and then aid the Bursa as it damages the boss. The reality is that the boss vulnerability state is just tied to the duration of the Bursa hack. Doesn't matter how close it gets to him, doesn't matter if it hits him. The sooner the Bursa dies, the sooner the boss becomes vulnerable. Theoretically you could just have 4 people in each potential Bursa spawn point and instagib + hack them to speed things up. Enjoy."

I know some people might've found it annoying, but it was by far one of the best boss fights I've ever played in Warframe and it incorporated better ways to fight bosses that felt like you were fighting something rather difficult. I honestly wish a LOT, if not all bosses were like this, albeit their drop chances should change to incorporate difficulty. The second thing was Bursas and Hyenas. I know a lot of people were awaiting the return of the Bursas, Im not sure if it was because of their mod drops or because they're a fun enemy to some like myself. They're rather difficult to kill at first, but rewarding in the fact that they help you for a short time after you defeat them, and they deal considerable damage (Tested out in Pluto, Bursas began ripping through the light units and CC'd techs and took out a considerable portion of their health). My only real grudge with Bursas is that their Explosives should be LOS based, I got killed a lot through walls and clutter from them. I know Hyenas seem to be a rather odd unit when it comes to Warframe. They were introduced as a squad unit as a boss way back, but we've repeatedly seen them throughout Tactical Alerts. I personally love them because they're somewhat tanky, but not too much, and they're considerably agile. I honestly wish they were another unit. I was dissapointed a while ago when DE introduced the Juggernaut mainly because it doesn't reward anything worthwhile at all, and they're not super fun to fight since pubs can screw you over if they repeatedly CC them out of their vulnerability stages, which is something DE should consider. They're an alright unit, but not as fun as I had hoped. I really hope that DE takes away from Bursas and Hyenas as somewhat fun units to fight, and doesn't take anything away from things that aren't fun to fight (*coughnullifierscough*)"

159,vulnerability,Warframe,Proto-Shields on Waframes,28,46u5q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/46u5q5/protoshields_on_waframes/,2016-02-21 17:23:00,"As all veterans should know by now (if you do not, shame on you...) there are different kinds of ""flesh"" in the game; from Cloned Flesh, to Infested Flesh, and even... just Flesh (Corpus). Not only that but there are also different types of ""sponges"", varying buffs to protect the the target's HP, aka Shields and Armor, but even these have variants of their own. While the Grineer do not have Shields, they do have Alloy and Ferrite Armor, while the Corpus have Shields and Proto-Shields. Us Tenno naturally have Alloy Armor (a greater version of Ferrite Armor), but what about Shields? Well, we have just that.. Shields (a lesser version of Proto-Shields). Where em I going with this? Well, we can upgrade Health with Vitality, Armor with Steel Fiber, and Shields with Redirection, but while Armor aids in mitigating incoming damage to our Health, there's no equivalent for Shields. And that's what my babbling is about, why not Proto-Shields? They are clearly stronger than regular Shields; let's compare them: 1) They are both bypassed by Toxin dmg and Finishers, and are weak against Magnetic dmg but, while Proto-S. have a +25% vulnerability to Toxin, they compensate by nullifying the +50% dmg from Cold! 2) Shields take +50% Impact dmg; Proto-S. only +15%. 3) Shields only protect against Puncture and Radiation by -20% and -25% respectively; Proto-S. doesn't protect against Radiation at all BUT does against Puncture, Heat and Corrosive all by -50%. So what have we learned: Our current shields suck and there's nothing we can do about it. Thank you for reading! :3 TL/DR: You could use some more reading, go back up find out by yourself. Note: A mod that turns your current Shields into Proto-Shields would be great. "
160,vulnerability,Warframe,New mission type idea (Second Dream Spoilers),58,46wxps,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/46wxps/new_mission_type_idea_second_dream_spoilers/,2016-02-22 06:54:21,"So... not sure whether this would be more of a 'Rescue 3.0' than a completely new idea, but I think it could make for a lot of fun. At the very least, it'd be more engaging and involve more team co-ordination than current Rescue missions, which are basically freeing a captive and then ignoring them for as long as it takes to sprint to the exit. In any case - MAJOR Second Dream spoilers ahoy, so if you haven't finished it, you may wish to stop reading past here. So at the climax of the Second Dream, we discover that we are not, in fact, badass space ninjas, but rather scarred and withered little kids who can't even stand on their own, let alone run and fight like ordinary human beings. This leads to a frankly awesome sequence in which our weakened Warframes are forced to carry us to the end of the mission, as the operator uses their full Tenno powers to blast anything we encounter out of the way. It's a really great mechanic - a crippling reduction to mobility and an increase in vulnerability, in exchange for a big increase in outgoing power - but one which doesn't appear anywhere else. So, my idea is this. Don't know whether it would be Moon-specific, or could somehow be explained for the other factions, but it's basically an ordinary Rescue mission, except at the end once you've gotten into the cells you have to retrieve an Operator, be it from a somatic link chair, a cryopod, or just a regular cell where they've been unceremoniously dumped by their captor faction awaiting execution, dissection, or some other suitably horrible fate. Obviously, the Operator is too weak to be able to walk out on their own like a normal Rescue target, meaning that in order to safely evacuate them, one player needs to pick them up and carry them to the exit. There can be a brief transmission from the Lotus here to explain what happens - only one Operator can control a Warframe at a time, and physical contact overrides the somatic link, or whatever - but the outcome is that the Warframe goes back into the same 'crippled' state, needing to stagger to the end as the rescued Operator uses their powers to deal with enemies. This gives players a bit more control over the rescue target than just hoping their AI pathfinding doesn't bug out, and encourages players to move as a group rather than just take off at the highest speed possible. Also helping encourage this is that, as soon as the Operator has been grabbed, the normal enemies in the level are replaced by Sentients, who spawn in slightly greater numbers than they do on the moon, and continue to do so until the end of the level. More importantly and unlike the Second Dream, during this time the Warframe is actually vulnerable to being downed, rather than their health just being reduced to 1: Warframes and dropped Operators can be revived as normal if this happens. And as a reward? Because you're touching the mind of another Tenno directly, through shared contact with their Warframe, they impart a small amount of their memories, experience, and skills on you, translating directly into all players's Warframes receiving a reasonably large amount of Focus at the end of a mission, which is then filtered through its equipped lens into whichever school you prefer. I think this could make for a really challenging but engaging gamemode, as it encourages close teamwork rather than splitting up, re-uses a unique mechanic from a great quest, makes use of high-level enemies, and actually offers a worthwhile reward in the form of Focus points. Thoughts?"

I'm using Mirage as an example, as she's pretty unique. The rules I set for my self, each change should be related to the description of the said school. Any change should not be OP when deciding between it and the original ability effect. Overall, should not just be stat changes. Each change should be more than subtle and change how you play. *Madurai* ""Reckless Attack, speed and savagery"" *Vazarin* ""Counter opponents' attacks"" *Naramon* ""Knowing the enemy"" *Unairu* ""Endurance, outlast enemy"" *Zenurik* ""Dominate, choke resources, overwhelm"" **Mirage Hall of Mirrors:** * Madurai - Every enemy killed increases movement speed (2.5% per enemy, caps at 25%), fire rate (3% per enemy, caps at 30%), swing speed (3% per enemy, caps at 45%), and increases duration (0.15s per enemy - adds to current duration) for the duration of the ability. Decreased base duration (25s to 11s). Increase power cost to 35. * Vazarin - Damage reduce to 10% per decoy, each kill from a weapon, restores 1 energy and 10hp. * Naramon - Hitscan weapons/projectiles that hit Mirage receive a radiation proc for 1.5 seconds, damage decreased to 20% to each decoy and duration decreased (25s to 18s). * Unairu - When Mirage receives damage, remaining duration is increased by 0.5 seconds. Base damage decreased to 10% to each decoy. * Zenurik - Hall of mirrors when used - now blinds all enemies in a 10m radius for 2s. Base duration decreased from 25s to 15s. **Mirage Sleight of Hand:** * Madurai - Increased power cost, greatly increased damage (2.5x), range greatly decreased (40m to 15m). * Vazarin - Mirage and allies in explosion/effect radius receive 200 overshields (per explosion/effect). Base radius reduced to 20n. * Naramon - Power cost increased (+15), enemies take 300% more damage if the damage they are dealt is a weakness. * Unairu - Pickups that explode are transferred to Mirage and have 1.5% increased effect, instead of disappearing. Reduced base damage (-60%). * Zenurik - Range reduced, pickup explosions are now all deal blast damage and have a 75% chance to proc status effect.. **Mirage Eclipse:** * Madurai - Damage bonus increased (200 to 300%), damage reduction decreased (75 to 35%). * Vazarin - Overall strength is reduced (-10-15%). Power cost increased (25 to 50). While hit in Light - increase movement speed and gain damage reduction (+20%) for a short period (4s), while hit in Dark - increase damage (+20%) and fire rate/swing speed (+20/30%) for a short period (4s). * Naramon - Power cost increased (25 to 50) and overall strength reduced. While in light, gain +15% additional damage as fire, 10% chance on hit to proc radiation status, and increase weapon punch-through by 2m. While in darkness, gain 50% knockdown recovery and on hit, heal 30hp over 3 seconds; cannot stack. (Fire bonus for Infested, chance to proc Radiation procs for Corpus or Grineer, and punch through for Infested grouping up or hitting Grineer better when they use cover) * Unairu - Damage bonus decreased (200 to 50%), while in darkness, heal 10hp per second. * Zenurik -Overall strength reduced, damage from 200 to 100%, DR from 75% to 20%. Duration decreased from 20s to 15s. Light blinds enemies that are hit - in a small AoE (5m) for a short period (3s) with a cooldown (6s) per enemy. Darkness, gain invisibility on hit for 3s. **Mirage Prism:** * Madurai - Blind base duration reduced to 4s, radius to 10m. Damage per tick increased from 125/250 to 200/325 * Vazarin - Damage per tick reduced from 125/250 to 50/100.Each tick of damage has a 5% chance of a radiation status. * Naramon - Power cost increased from 50 to 60 and energy drain from 10 to 12. Damage decreased from 125/250 to 75/150. When prism is active and for a short duration (10s) after it explodes, all Grineer units hit by laser have their damage reduced by 35%, all Infested units receive +100% more damage from damage types they are already weak against, and all Corpus units have a 25% increased vulnerability to receive a status chance. * Unairu - Lase radius reduced to 20m, Blind duration increased to 25s. * Zenurik - All stats are halved, damage, radius, duration, and power cost/drain.

163,vulnerability,Warframe,On the Subject of Vey Hek,0,427i9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/427i9l/on_the_subject_of_vey_hek/,2016-01-23 07:50:36,"tl;dr off the bat: Vey Hek of Oro, Earth plz nurf. The Vey Hek boss fight of Oro, Earth has a lot of artificial difficulty which makes him exceedingly not fun to go up against. None of my friends like fighting him, and I am very much against going up against him to help them get Hydroid parts. I would rather be forced into T4 Survival with unleveled pugs, than fight Vey Hek. My main problems with Vey Hek however mostly apply to his first ""egg"" form, before he hatches into a beautiful missile-spamming ""chicken"". So I'd like to list the reasons Vey Hek is, to me the most annoying boss in the game and not even because he's actually hard. **1. Vulnerability vs Invulnerability** The first problem with Vey Hek is the duration of his vulnerability state against his invulnerability state, I've been in missions helping friends of mine and waited full minutes just for a few seconds of face-shooting just to resume the wait. All the while wondering whether or not he will spawn adds so we don't run out of ammo. That is the second issue. **2. Grineer on Strike** he second issue with Vey Hek is ammo and his adds. Sometimes they just don't appear. I'm not sure why, but its annoying because he doesn't drop anything in his location switches, and health and ammo can run low ridiculously easy because the other Grineer decided not to fight the Tenno today. Of course it's not always great when they **do** show up... **3. Vey Hek is Some Kind of Dog-hating Vampire** This one is actually a combo platter of strange complaints about Vey Hek. First of all, I don't mind that Vey Hek has the power to drain your energy, however, it is very annoying how much he will spam the energy drain, especially if you attempt to solo him. Secondly, is the weird instance of Mr. Hek turning his abnormal hunger on his adds. On occasion in both forms Vey Hek will suddenly turn towards one of the other Grineer, usually one hidden by the terrain and cause the guy to twitch out, kill him, and take that clone's power for his own. This would be super cool...if he didn't deny you ammo drops or go invulnerable or hide on strange places of the final arena while doing it. Final bit of this dish is his hatred of dogs. Vey Hek hates dogs. Vey Hek hates all dogs. Often I've gone into a zone where Hek is staying and found him 1v4ing a pack of wild kubrow, which is fine because kubrows seem to hate all Grineer. (Possibly because Grineer breed them into uglier scale covered...things) What is less fine is what happens when you bring your own kubrow to the fight. First, Vey Hek will very likely target your ugly-cute pup to the detriment of his own existence, forgetting to put his mask back on just so he can focus on murdering your 'bro', because he has no legs with which to kick it. Second, if your Kubrow manages to pull a superman and hit the flying egg-lord it seems to put some kind of DoT on the pup. I watched my dog die without getting shot or electrocuted at, because Vey decided to focus on the friend I was helping for a bit, simply because my kubrow had the gall to hit the boss. Huge chunks of the dog's HP just starts disappearing without being attacked, but while they twitch out similarly to when Vampire Egg eats his allies. I suspect Vey Hek eats dog. The main issue for Hek really lies in the first bit, but the whole combination of things he does even before he starts missile spamming you just makes fighting him an immense chore. "
164,vulnerability,Warframe,Bullet jump spam vs Sprint n slide,0,3wo4ft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3wo4ft/bullet_jump_spam_vs_sprint_n_slide/,2015-12-14 04:40:38,"Hello, I have been trying warframe for a week or 2 now and im trying to learn more about the movement mechanics in this game. From what I can tell at the moment, the current jumping mechanics makes sprint seem obsolete. I noticed that many players recommend sprinting and sliding with abit of bullet jumping in order to move around, however I can't see why this is better than straight up bullet jump/double jump spamming in both combat and transport. In straight lines, a 45 degree bullet jump launch followed by a late divekick+doublejump makes you move as fast as a volt speed buff sprint user. In small areas with tight corners (which rarely exist in warframes squarish tiles) a small dash followed by a bullet jump always seems safer as the AI can't hit bullet jumped targets almost at all. Not to mention the turn rates on the AI is so slow that just jumping over them is almost like a 1s stun on them. Jumping also lets you precast spells so that you don't have to suffer the ""not moving"" vulnerability that is persistent in this game. Is there a benefit to sprinting that I can't see? I have never used it since I was MR1 and now I am MR10. Bullet jump just seems 10 times more broken than sprinting and the dodgeroll seems useless (even with damage reduction) as the enemies can't hit you at all when you are bullet jumping. Plus the added penalty of not being able to reload/attack bullet jumping is just better than sprinting/dodge rolling. Thank you."
165,vulnerability,Warframe,Valkyr is fun now,0,3n8oen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3n8oen/valkyr_is_fun_now/,2015-10-03 02:10:02,"Goodness... If you look at my flair, you can tell i'm a fan of a certain melee-heavy tank-frame. NOW, her invulnerability can go on into infinity AND any damage now buffs her attack. In T4D, i just put myself in front of the laser and BAM, i one shot everything. BUT... the nullifiers are my bane. It takes something akin to skill to kill those while not leaving hysteria (and my 3.5mil stack of buff), and they ruin me. Now, if only DE could make it so that i'd have to wait like five seconds BEFORE re-entering hysteria again... and it'd be fantastic. Out of Hysteria, i fell flat immediately due to a few bombards. Hysteria was epic. Now it's epic-er. I get those damage stacks up and suddenly i can tank a planet. If there could be a vulnerability after hysteria, to keep me from immediately reentering it, that'd be fantastic. Ripline is also fun - now i can launch my ~~allies~~ ~~enemies~~ everything everywhere. It used to be sorta meh pull, but now it's just an inverse cannon. In Hysteria, it becomes comically lethal. Your thoughts? ***EDIT: I hit Hysteria while being shot at and standing in a fire, then walked over to the nearest mob and ended hysteria, and took out all of my 250 shields and about 150hp. The hysteria tick was around 700, so make of that what you will. THE HYSTERIA COUNTER DOESNT AFFECT YOUR DAMAGE - HYSTERIA IS JUST STRONGER NOW.***"

[Link to the original post.](URL Hope you like it. Feedback is appreciated. *This is Dominus, the divine light.* *When Dominus enters the battlefield, all opponents cower before his holy fury.* **Stats**: Health: 150 (450 at rank 30) Shields: 75 (225 at rank 30) Armor: 300 Energy: 125 (200 at rank 30) Powers: **1 - Purification** Brings down a ray of light down on Dominus, healing him and all allies around him, while dealing damage to enemies around him, and inflicting a **Heat** proc. *Purification*'s damage is equally split between **Radiation** and **Heat**. Damage and healing is affected by **Power Strength**. Radius is affected by **Power Range**. **2 - Holy Purge** Dominus releases a wave of holy energy, purging buffs from his enemies, and debuffs/status procs from his allies. Radius is affected by **Power Range**. **3 - Divine Mark** Smites enemies in the targeted area with a cross-shaped blast of light. All enemies hit by the cross will be slowed down, receive more damage and deal less, and receive a part of the damage the others take. If an enemy is killed while marked, it releases a energy pulse that heals and restores energy. *Divine Mark*'s damage type is **Radiation**. *If you are confused about the damage sharing part, let me explain: All marked enemies are linked together, and if one of them is shot for 20 damage, it still receives full damage while all the others will receive, let's say, 5 damage, of the Finisher type.* Initial damage, slow intensity, damage penalty and vulnerability are affected by **Power Strength**. Radius is affected by **Power Range**. Duration is affected by **Power Duration**. **4 - Penitence** Dominus kneels down in prayer, linking himself to his allies, and taking a portion of any damage they receive for himself. His allies receive a 50% damage reduction, while Dominus himself gets 95%. Any damage that Dominus takes directly is sent to other Tenno as healing. This link is global, not affected by mods. When *Penitence* is activated, all enemies around Dominus are blinded and blasted away. During *Penitence*, Dominus has a large aura that deals **Fire** damage, with a guaranteed proc, and a smaller aura that blinds those who enter it. As he absorbs damage, these auras get stronger and larger. If Dominus dies during *Penitence*, all damage he received is released in a fiery explosion, dealing **Radiation** and **Heat** damage, equally split, with a guaranteed proc for both. Initial aura damage is affected by **Power Strength**. Death blast radius, and initial aura radius are affected by **Power Range**. Passives: - 15% extra damage with Hammer and Heavy Blade (Galatine, Scindo, etc.) class weapons. - Innate Equilibrium effect OR innate 10% Rage effect, stacks with the mod. **Appearance:** Bulky and slow, heavily armored, with a tabard and a mantle. Imagine Rhino Prime with Oberon's tabard and a small cape. His helmet has a faceplate resembling a cross, and a tassel on the back. **Gameplay Concept:** Despite Oberon having the title of Paladin frame, he never felt like one, his abilities being more druidic at best. So I tried to create a frame that incorporated the classic Paladin feel, being in the middle of a battle, delivering the hurt while keeping your friends alive. Most of Dominus' abilities affect the area around him, and affect both friend and foe, forcing him to stay in combat to be able to use his abilities to their fullest. I also avoided putting any numbers of his skills, as I'm terrible at balancing. My sources of inspiration were the [Crusader](URL class from Ragnarok Online, and [Omniknight](URL from DotA 2.

167,vulnerability,Warframe,Best community I've ever had (Story-time),8,3ojzda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3ojzda/best_community_ive_ever_had_storytime/,2015-10-13 17:27:08,"So here is the story. I created the account and tried out Warframe around a year and a half ago but uninstall it shortly and never really touch it cause my PC was not that great and on top of that, I have to serve National Service. Fast forward to the previous week, I installed (technically re-install) Warframe with my friends as we were looking for a co-op game to play together and just relax and generally have fun. We grew tired of MOBAs like League of Legends, Defense of the Ancients 2 and Heroes of the Storm and just wanted a game where we do not have to really worry about 'end-game' and the need to play catch-up like World of Warcraft. At the initial stage, we were very confused with a lot of things, like most newbies do. Things like, Mods, Weapons, Frames, types of Missions, Upgrades, Goldtato, Blutato, etc. The most confusing part is the map and its markers, especially my friends who could not even notice that little white color at the top or bottom of the logo that indicates the floor of the map. Luckily for us, we know the power of Google and able to discern the simple stuff like 'meta' for T4S or proper mod builds for whatever frame we use further enhanced by a Steam friend, which had played 500+ hours, who assisted us with tons of newbie FAQs. As the times goes by, 1 of my friends bought the Prime Access, the one with 2625 platinums, to get his hand on a Prime Trinity and a Dual Kama Prime. Truthfully, I was kind of jealous to see him having a 'headstart' with a Prime and also with an 'overly' powered weapon at the start of our journey. I felt like Frodo Baggins as I hide in the shadows while he was smashing waves after waves of Grineers. This urged me to purchase my own Prime version of Loki just cause it is 'Prime' and also because I was green. I purchased the cheapest platinum (75plat ones) and bought a Loki Prime set for 75p from the Trading Chat. At that point of time, I was overjoyed because the price for Loki Prime at URL was stated 80p at its lowest. That feeling was soon eclipsed by another friend of mine who had wanted a Loki Prime and found a seller willing to let go of the set for 45p. I felt slightly stupid, embarrassed and ashamed by my own desire but lesson learnt and from that day on, I was very wary of going into the trading chat. Fast forward to today, I decided to sell some of my Prime Parts and Blueprints. I posted up the notice (the very so often you found in trade chats) and found a buyer who wanted to buy 2 Blades and 1 Handle for Orthos Prime. I made an offer of 30plats for all 3 of them as I Google'd for 'Orthos Prime Price' and saw that it costs 31p in total. The buyer was hesitant to pay for that price and counter offer with 25p. In my mind, I was going to make me some big bucks and they were my very first few platinums earned in the game, so why not? I ended up learning that his account had been hacked and he made a new account. I sympathised with him and ended up Wiki'ing up Orthos Prime and found out that Shimmering Blight Stance Mod was ideal for it and just gave it to him as a package. I felt slightly happy for I was able to help someone out despite being still new to the game and totally excited when I realized I made some platinums! So with those new plats, I tried to find something nice for me to boost my damage a bit. I saw someone wanting to sell a Boltor Prime Set without stating a price. I PM'ed him saying ""Hello!"" and accidentally pasted my long list of inventory to him in private instead of the trade chat. He read it and took interest in one of the item (Volt Prime Blueprint) for the very low price of 9p (I was desperate looking for plats and also I have like 5 of those). He invited me to his dojo and opened up the trade with me. We ended up chatting and he asked if I had wanted any of his wares. Of course, I said, I would love to have his Boltor Prime set but I have only 20p to spare (the 5p remainder was spent on something else which I forgot, I believe it was spent for a Warframe slot with the intial plats). Somehow I ended up telling him that I was a newbie (which is supposed to be terrible because it would create an image of vulnerability on my part and he could have scam me) and I offered him 20p and any of my stated wares. To my surprise, he agreed to trade the Boltor Prime set for only 20p and took nothing of my wares, maybe they were too shitty for him :/ . On top of that, he ran me through Captain Vok to get some 'Rare Blueprint', which was Cronus and I already had it Mastered but nonetheless I obliged to follow him through his journey, keeping him company. A little bit after that, we went to farm The Sergeant for Mag parts, which I had also previously obtained with my friends. As we repeat the mission, we chat and as soon as he learned that I already had Mag parts (I had not told him earlier) he asked me if there was any frame that I would like to farm. So I told him I wanted Nekros for I had not been nor tried Orokin Derelict Missions and he obliged. It took us roughly 1 hour to farm Lephantis for me to obtain all the parts, roughly 10 runs or so cause I had not much luck for the helmet. I was totally overwhelmed by his generosity of helping me obtaining Nekros and I could not believe there was such a person in the community. I wish I had remembered your name Mr Portugal but to my dismay, I had forgotten it. Even my screenshot was corrupted. Thank you for helping me out. After Mr Portugal went to sleep, I went back to creep the trade chat. Still the same copy paste of my wares to sell on the chat. Since there wasn't much activity there (half-the-world-is-asleep-while-the-others-are-at-work time) I asked if anyone has a Volt Prime Chassis to trade away with some of my wares, and no, I did not spam the Alliance chat, it was just a simple question. One of them replied and said he has 1 spare. In my mind, the word 'spare' doesn't sit right with me. It has this vibe of giving it away and at the same time it feels as if he wants something in return. So he invited me to the dojo and open up a trade with me. I tried to ascertain the statement he said earlier and it was confimed that he was willing to just give it away to me. Truthfully speaking, as much as I love free stuff, I do not really like taking things freely. I sort of feel indebted to the person. I ended up offering my Trinity Prime Chassis with him, cause it was hard for me to find someone to trade with in the trade chat and Volt Prime Chassis farming is still far away for me to be able to farm it constantly. Thank you ShioriShi for assisting me in completing my Volt Prime! Previously before this trade, I had a chat with a fellow trader in the trade chat. It was about trading my wares for a Volt Prime Chassis. This trader did not particularly like my wares for his Volt Prime Chassis despite me offering 20p (yes, i sold some wares in-between the time of ending my adventure with Mr Portugal and now) on top of my wares. Funnily enough, we began to just do a casual chat and since my hope of trading with him was gone, I outright told him I am still quite new and am unable to farm the Volt Prime Chassis yet. I even told him that I had not tried Tower 3 Survival because I am not confident with my damage (I just do not know how to set my mod up) despite having done Tower 1 Survival to 60 minutes with my friends (CC combo, EV Trin, Frost, Valkyr and Loki). Without even the slightest of hesitation, he offered to break my cherry of my very 1st T3Survival run. I happily obliged cause of free loots! Amazingly enough, we did all the way to 38 minutes (only both of us) and him being Ash with a Cernos. It was awesome because I did not expect Ash to be that great, maybe because of how the general community view Ash to not having enough value towards a proper team composition. Nevertheless, his playstyle of kiting around and shooting made me interest to get back into using Bows despite me selling both my already Mastered Paris and Cernos. At this very moment, I was in a state of disbelief on how awesome the community was until he mentioned that he was going to give me a 'Cat'. I was taken aback and wondered, what do you mean by cat? All I see are kubrows in the marketplace and the only thing DE mentioned about cats are only in the future updates. Shortly after, he told me to open up my mail and to my surprise, I received a Blutato! My very first Blutato! I was awestruck with his generosity especially after declining my trade of the exchange of Volt Prime Chassis and 20p plus my other wares. Thank you EN4TUN3 for the T3S run and a Blutato. To sum it up, I honestly did not expect the community to be this awesome. These 3 occasion gave me the warm fuzzy feeling inside of me and gave me tremendous joy. Once again, thank you to Mr Portugal for the Boltor Prime set and Nekros farm, thank you to ShioriShi for the 1-to-1 exchange of Volt Prime Chassis and Trinity Prime Chassis and ultimately the last person whom shall never been forgotten for you've been befriended, EN4TUN3, for both breaking my cherry to T3S run and also for my very first Blutato! TL;DR Best community I've ever had "
168,vulnerability,Warframe,"Limbo, A Rework That Embraces The Playstyle Of The Rift",39,3ph9xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3ph9xh/limbo_a_rework_that_embraces_the_playstyle_of_the/,2015-10-20 22:41:28,"Something I've been considering for a long while now is how Limbo is my favorite frame, but I find myself frustrated by a clunky power implementation. Shifting into another plane of existence, only to reappear from another angle, is amazing. Banishing foes that can barely comprehend whats going on before you assassinate them, incredibly cool. Ripping a giant hole into the Rift where anything within takes incredible damage from your handy chain gun or rocket launcher, divine. But when it comes down to it the frame is almost unplayable without Natural Talent because you have a drawn out casting times. Even with the decreased casting speed we're limited by requiring the precasting of Rift Walk and Rift Surge for a personal only damage boost that only effects enemies in the Rift. Its just so...clunky and drawn out. So as I put together these revisions I considered how I could keep the spirit of the frame alive while providing options that wouldn't break the game. Do let me know what y'all think. ------------------------------------- Passive, Limbos connection to the Rift allows him to benefit constantly from the energy regeneration all frames benefit from once on the Rift plane. 1) Banish, remains unchanged as an excellent way to remove annoying targets or save an unfortunate ally. 2) Rift Surge, Limbo removes himself from the material plane and begins twisting the very fabric of the Rift Plane, increasing damage taken by enemies within. Mechanics: Instead of a timer this is a toggle ability that consumes 50 energy initially and then 2pts a second to offset the natural regeneration of the Rift plane. In exchange he receives a scaling damage buff that counts UP until either of two conditions are met; either the frame runs out of power or it hits a hard cap (that can be increased by mods) 3) Rift Flaw, Limbo rips a hole into the material or rift plane allowing limited travel, at a cost Mechanics: A stationary black(material)/white(rift) horizontal hole in the air that allows gunfire to pass through in one direction. Only a single flaw can be maintained at a time. -If on the Material Plane bullets that travel through will consume and be imbued with a moderate amount of energy before Banishing any target they hit. Targets already banished will simply take damage as normal. -If on the Rift Plane the flaw will allow Limbo to fire into the Material plane with the Damage bonus granted by Rift surge. However each bullet fire will consume a variable energy based on attack speed. Ideally the slower the weapon the higher the energy absorbed 4) Cataclysm, Already a very useful and effective skill. I see no real issue with the current implementation. ---------------- Edit for some small explanations 2a) Rift Surge has a minimum damage multiplier that I think would be about 100% extra damage, or about half of its current rank at max level. Then the scaling percentage would increase for the duration of the toggle until it reaches the cap. 2b) Rift Surge in my design is suppose to create a choice for the player. If you squat in the Rift and allow the numbers to continue to scale thats fine, but your going to find yourself limited to enemies you can banish, Cataclysm, or the new option Rift Flaw that consumes energy at a much faster pace. 3) To clarify, the Rift Flaw actually consumes energy with every bullet fired through it based on the speed of the weapon being fired through it. Ideally a Soma clip would consume about as much energy as a fully charged Ogris shot or two. This 'includes' ally gunfire much in the same way as allies casting powers within Equinox's power amplifying 3 does. This will force Limbo out of the Rift at an accelerated rate unless they can benefit from an EV Trinity or something similiar. 3b) Rift Flaw was left with the single 'Window' vulnerability because it will create opportunistic gameplay for enemies to respond to the PC. On the Material Plane he's vulnerable from all other directs due to the limited direction of the window. On the Rift plane he's consuming energies at an increased rate and might drop out quickly if abused to long"
169,vulnerability,Warframe,[Obvious spoilers] It's 1 in the morning so I'm just going to start typing about Warframe lore and maybe something cool will come out of it.,0,3plpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3plpeg/obvious_spoilers_its_1_in_the_morning_so_im_just/,2015-10-21 17:41:01,"Alright, I'm probably going to contradict myself several times here and much of this might not make sense, but I'm going to keep typing until I get tired because insomnia sucks. Here's how I see the Warframe universe: Let's start with the Orokin. Currently, you are inhabiting the body of an Orokin. The Orokin are humans, quite simply (or were). As they spread across the Solar System, they combated the problems of economy and production in such a huge environment. This is where I believe the split between the Orokin and the Corpus occurred. The Orokin Empire must have, at some point, decided upon a complete abandonment of capitalism. Given what we know about the odd plutocratic nature of the Corpus, as well as their less advanced technology, the Orokin had much more success in the sciences and technological advances than the Corpus, who were caught up in making money. (I'll go into more detail about the Corpus later). However, with a now mostly non-working society and without money as a motivator for labor, the Orokin needed to fill that void. There's where the Grineer come in. They're cheap to make, they're expendable, and they work well. This must have been a breakthrough after the Corpus split, because we obviously see that the Corpus do not have records of cloning technology. Another note: the Corpus seem to operate like a huge mafia (we see in Anti-MOA imprint that corpus is also a word for family), lending further credence to the idea that they operated like a black market under the radar and/or outside the interests of the Orokin. We see in what we know about the Grineer that they had to 'rediscover' cloning technology. It would make sense that the Orokin would keep the Grineer from becoming Von Neumann machines, to use an analogy. The Orokin were obviously very focused on keeping their holdings contained (don't we already see people like Musk and Hawking warning about restraining AI?). After the Grineer had already grown to a huge population in the Solar System, the Orokin discovered the biomechanics necessary to upload a consciousness (""oro"") into a computer system. This is the nature of the term ""Oro""kin, and why Teshin refers to Tenno as ""oro"". More on that later. The important part is that since the Orokin could now survive outside a mortal body, they had little need for the Grineer. Thus began the existential Grineer hatred of the Orokin for creating them without an ""oro"" (analogous to a soul; it is often debated among philosophers whether or not a cloned human would have a soul). Perhaps the oro is more, though. We see in the Arid Eviscerator imprint that the Grineer themselves cannot operate a shuttle, which is likely itself a precaution (a 'lock' of sorts). It also explains why your Liset is left in disrepair after being in Grineer hands: they have no means of operating it. Further evidence of the Orokin being consciousnesses inside a humanoid machine is in the Corrupted Ancient imprint, where the Grineer twins have to be implanted with robotics to be able to operate the Lora. The Lora are then converted into Ancient powers by the Technocyte virus as we see later in the imprint. ""But Kuro, why would the Grineer use MOAs?"" The Orokin still used them, and by extension the Grineer, until after the Grineer uprising. They aren't Corpus inventions. As seen in the Anti-MOA imprint, they were definitely around in the pre-Corpus-schism days. The Orokin just developed some alternatives while the Corpus have been stuck with relatively the same technology for a *long* time (hence why they want Orokin tech, just like everyone else). Enter the Technocyte virus. Why was it created? We don't know. We *do* know it was created by the Orokin, perhaps as an experimental way to regain their 'humanity' as they had since become almost completely machine. Obviously, the venture failed, and the First Infestation began. Why the First? The wiki states there was an outbreak before the Collapse, which i believe to be an accident. This period is when the Orokin reached out to the Corpus for assistance with the Plan: reach the Tau system to save their Empire. I also believe this is when the Sentients were first introduced and, against the better judgement of the Orokin, put to use. However, they quite simply screwed up. They didn't heed the warnings they had given themselves over centuries and created a self-sufficient AI that promptly turned on them. Out of the great Archimedes Project (spearheaded by the best minds of the Orokin and Corpus) also came such ideas as the Crewman project (terminated by the Orokin as violating their Seven unknown Principles that sound a bit like a cross between human rights laws and Asimov's Three Laws) that the Corpus later more or less bastardized for their own. The Archimedean display of Sentient technology seems to me like the starting point for the second Technocyte outbreak. I believe the Sentients were a parallel breakthrough with the Technocyte discovery, both working toward the same goal of finding a way to save the Orokin's dying empire. (Why were they dying? That's one of the big loopholes in my theory and requires more thought and research into the very scattered lore resources we are given) One thing I haven't mentioned is the Void, and I think this may be the key. The Void was likely the crux of the Orokin technology leading up to the Old War: it was like discovering fire. Void energies were quickly funneled into every aspect of Orokin life, and this is a likely candidate for why the Empire was crumbling: they Orokin harnessed the Void without completely understanding its effects. The Corpus' worship of the Void as an entity is interesting, but more important is they know not to mess with it, a lesson learned from the Orokin's meddlings. The Orokin's need to leave the system would rid them of all their problems: the Sentients wouldn't be able to follow due to vulnerability to Void energy, the Technocyte virus would be contained in a different star system, and they wouldn't have volatile Grineer slaves and rebels to deal with. This becomes much more complicated when reviewing what is said in the Natah quest. We see that the Lotus herself is a Sentient, which makes sense given her machine/humanoid hybrid appearance. She infiltrated the Orokin (a very real possibility with a super-advanced AI and a biomechanical society like the Orokin) and converted the Tenno. Natah is an old Hebrew word that means ""bend, pervert"", etc. I think the Tenno used to be individuals, personal badasses of the Executors, who were 'anti-corrupted' by the second wave of Sentients, their oro freed from Imperial control. We see that the original Tenno could die from the Mirage quest, but oro could be uploaded into replications of Warframes (hence answering the question of 'why' the player can be so many different sizes and shapes; they're facsimiles). Teshin is a Sentient, too, perhaps one who saw the Old War as folly and disagreed with the plan to capture the Tenno. ________________ Alright, I've spewed enough stupidity. I'll go to bed now. If you managed to read all that, I'm impressed."
170,vulnerability,Warframe,"Diriga is a great example of a offensive sentinel, let me explain...",6,3jx102,https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3jx102/diriga_is_a_great_example_of_a_offensive_sentinel/,2015-09-07 10:47:28,"Diriga starts with 3 mods: Calculated Shot, Electro Pulse, and Arc Coil. All of these mods will help/aid the weapon that the sentinel uses and they all work well for Diriga. Diriga excels as a ""offensive sentinel"" none of its mods are utility mods and that might make it less effective as such but makes it great in firefights. &gt; Calculated Shot - Sentinel charges a powerful shot and fires at the first enemy in sight. &gt; Electro Pulse - Sentinel continually zaps a nearby enemy, trapping them in a stunned state. &gt; Arc Coil - Sentinel will zap multiple enemies within range. --- Let's take Carrier(prime): Striker, and Vacuum. Both help the sentinel and are great for it but what Carrier lacks is a good offensive mod. (Striker is an offensive mod) If Carrier had a mod that sucked up and used enemy projectiles as its own periodically or just have it suck up incoming bullets that would be a reasonable offensive mod for Carrier(prime). Carrier(prime) is a ""Utility sentinel"" and doesn't have much to give in the line of offensive variety. &gt; Striker - Carrier will attack the first visible enemy in range. Increasing level increases range. &gt; Vacuum - Detects and collects items throughout the room for its master, including mods. Increasing level increases range. --- Helios has: Targeting Receptor, Investigator, and **Not Default** Detect Vulnerability. Great for codex scanning but doesn't have any variety in combat, if we had a mod that allowed Helios's projectiles to stick into a surface/enemy and had a lightning leash attached to that part that would do damage when touched by an enemy, might give it better variety in combat. Helios is a ""Utility sentinel"" and doesn't have much to use in a fight, it would have a better advantage if it had more/better offensive mods. &gt; Targeting Receptor - Sentinel will attack first visible enemy in range. &gt; Investigator - Allows the Helios Sentinel to scan objects and enemies it encounters. This consumes Codex Scanner chargers. &gt; **Not Default** Detect Vulnerability - Allows the Helios Sentinel to reveal weak points on enemies that have had previously completed Codex scans. --- I picked Carrier(prime) and Helios to compare Diriga t because they are the ones that I see the most used. **tl;dr I just want the older sentinels to have a greater offensive role, would you like utility over combat superiority?** "
171,vulnerability,Warframe,Tactics Tuesday #25 | Equinox,26,3gm2ip,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3gm2ip/tactics_tuesday_25_equinox/,2015-08-12 02:58:43,"**Hey everyone it's TUEEEEESSSDAYYY. You're reading the Tactics Tuesdays thread with your host, thatdovahkiinyouknow. Joining me today is a very special guest, or uh guests? Either way, introducing Equinox!** --- Welcome to the Tactics Tuesday thread. These threads are intended to build up archived resources to help newer players and even older players alike! Here you can post your builds, share advice revolved around the topic, and give tips and tricks about the topic as well! Got a very useful build you want to share? Perhaps a really fun build that you love even if it's not end game material? Or perhaps you just found out a cool trick with an ability? Well this is the right place to share! Here is the guideline: * Build posts need to be either pictures or links to [warframe builder](URL * When making a build post please add a small synopsis for the build. E.g. ""With this build I specialized my mods on saryn's miasma by focusing on extra power duration and power range."" * Advice, tips, and tricks don't have to be the most obscure things you can think of. Try suggesting some of the more simple pieces of advice, tips, and tricks as well! * Above all else as usual, **be excellent to each other!** Here is a couple example posts: * ""[This is my valkyr build](URL I designed it so that I take as little damage as possible in as many circumstances as I can."" * ""Did you know, Valkyr has the best butt in warframe."" or more seriously, * ""Did you know, you can switch teleport with loki's decoy for in instant teleportation to anywhere you can place it."" Things of that nature. One last reminder for the newer players, most if not all of these builds will use mods you won't have for a while. This is mostly so you can get the feel of how you should mod for something in specific or more general ways. Onto the meat of the post though. --- Today we have **Equinox!** This tag team duo is capable of bringing in the hurt and the healing! With their special property of being able to swap between form that are opposite to one another for different skillsets. First up, **Metamorphosis!** &gt;&gt; *Switch forms, temporarily gaining bonus shields and armor in Night-Form, or bonus damage and speed in Day-Form.* &gt; * Upon switching to Night-Form, Equinox gains 100 / 150 / 200 / 250 armor and 50 / 75 / 100 / 150 shield capacity bonuses that decrease in effectiveness over 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 seconds. (Bonus effects are boosted by power strength and duration) &gt; * Upon switching to Day-Form, Equinox gains a 1.1x / 1.15x / 1.2x / 1.25x damage multiplier and a 5% / 10% / 12% / 15% movement speed bonus, which both decrease in effectiveness over 10 / 15 / 20 / 25 seconds. (Bonus effects are boosted by power strength and duration. &gt; * Costs 25 energy &gt; * Switching between forms removes any bonuses granted by the previous form. Only a single set of Metamorphosis buffs can be active at any given time. &gt; * While switching between forms, Equinox cannot cast any abilities but can perform all other actions, such as moving and using weapons. &gt; * The 2 seconds delay between switching Metamorphosis states is not affected by Natural Talent or Power Duration. Next, **Rest &amp; Rage!** &gt;&gt; *In Night Form targets are put to sleep. In Day Form targets become more vulnerable to damage.* &gt; * Equinox hypnotizes a target within 20 / 30 / 40 / 50 meters and enemies in a 1 / 1.5 / 2 / 2.5 meters radius around the target into deep sleep or into a frenzied state for 10 / 14 / 18 / 22 seconds. (Range and duration is boosted by power strength and duration) &gt; * Night Equinox forces the target and enemies nearby to sleep. Affected enemies will automatically wake up when ability duration expires or their health reaches 80% / 70% / 60% / 50% of their current health. &gt; * Day Equinox enrages the target and enemies nearby, causing them to receive 20% / 30% / 40% / 50%damage vulnerability while increasing their movement speed by 5% / 10% / 15% / 20% for the ability duration. (Damage multiplier is boosted by power strength) &gt; * Costs 25 energy &gt; * Recasting on the same target will not refresh sleep or enrage effects, however unaffected enemies can be acquired within the effect radius. Moving on, **Pacify &amp; Provoke!** &gt;&gt; *In Night Form reduces damage inflicted by nearby enemies. In Day Form increases Power Strength of nearby allies.* &gt; * Equinox emits a crippling or empowering aura within 10 / 12 / 14 / 16 meters around her. Pacify &amp; Provoke will remain active indefinitely until deactivated by casting Metamorphosis, by running out of energy, or by pressing the ability key again. (Radius is boosted by power range) &gt; * Night Equinox emits a crippling aura that affects all enemies in range, reducing their damage up to 20% / 33% / 43% / 50% the closer they are from Equinox. While Pacify is active, 1.5 / 1.25 / 1 / 0.5 energy is drained per second for each enemy within the aura. (Damage reduced is affected by power strength) &gt; * Day Equinox emits an empowering aura that affects all ally Warframes in range, providing an additional 5% / 10% / 15% / 20% Power Strength to each player. While Provoke is active, 5 / 4.33 / 3.66 / 3 energy is drained for each Warframe ability cast by affected allies within the aura. (Power strength boost and energy per cast is affected by power strength and efficiency) &gt; * Costs 10 energy Lastly, **Mend &amp; Maim!** &gt;&gt; *In Night Form, allies are healed with each nearby enemy killed. In Day Form, nearby enemies are bled and then subjected to a wave of slashing force.* &gt; * Equinox calls forth the serenity of night or calamity of day, surrounding herself in a 10 / 12 / 15 / 18 meter aura of moonlight's gleam or sunlight's glare. (Radius is affected by power range) &gt; * Night Equinox emits a serene aura that accumulates 50% / 55% / 60% / 75% of the maximum health of each enemy killed within the aura. &gt; * Upon deactivating Mend, all stored health is evenly distributed to Equinox, all ally Warframes and Companions in range &gt; * Day Equinox emits a lacerating aura that deals 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 Slash damage with a 100% Bleed and stun chance to all enemies in range. Maim accumulates 50% / 55% / 60% / 75% of the maximum health of each enemy killed within the aura. (Slash damage is affected by power strength) &gt; * Upon deactivating Maim, all stored damage is dealt to all enemies in range and damage amount decreases with range. &gt; * Costs 5 energy per second --- *So, in what ways do you build your Equinox? What kind of helpful advice can be given? Got any useful or interesting tips and tricks about them or their abilities be it obscure or well known? If so, feel free to share it!* --- Next Tactics Tuesday [Previous Tactics Tuesday](URL"
172,vulnerability,Warframe,What is the Tenno's fatal flaw?,42,3gr79w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3gr79w/what_is_the_tennos_fatal_flaw/,2015-08-13 04:51:25,"**OBLIGATORY SPOILER ALERT** So according to the Crewman synthesis lore, everything the Orokin created had to have a ""Flaw"" to prevent it from turning on them. For the Grineer, it was the inability to reproduce. For the Sentients, it was a severe vulnerability to Void energy. The Technocyte Virus isn't as simple, but I theorize that it was originally the inability to corrupt technology, since it only began infesting ships and robotics after Alad V modified it. But the Tenno don't have an obvious flaw. What do you think it might be, and could our enemies use it against us? Do we even have a fatal Flaw? Discuss!"
173,vulnerability,Warframe,Bug? Damage vs Sensor Regulators has been severely nerfed,20,3hdk35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3hdk35/bug_damage_vs_sensor_regulators_has_been_severely/,2015-08-18 09:13:10,"I've always been able to one-shot Sensor Regulators with my trusty silenced Vaykor Marelok. The AoE burst from the proc has always one-shot them in the past. However not anymore. It was taking 3 shots to kill Sensor Regulators on Hapke-Ceres. This while being stealthed and the target unaware... With a weapon modded for blast/corrosive which they are supposed to be +++ weak to... While hitting a section highlighted by the Detect Vulnerability mod. This setup resulted in 817 damage instead of the normal 10k+ damage I'm used to seeing. I tried this multiple times all with the same result. I also tried hitting them with my maxed Orthos Prime from stealth. That also just pissed them off. This is a mission I've done many many times with that weapon. Normally damage has extreme overkill vs these low hit point enemies. **If this setup cannot kill them I don't see how anything can possibly kill them in a single shot.** If I had to guess, this is an unintended change from the Covert Lethality mod changes a few days ago. ----- pointless edit: The point of this post was to bring attention to the fact they are taking a fraction of the damage they should be taking. It was not to find edge cases where it is possible to one shot them. That is why it was labeled ""Bug?"" And not ""Help!"" It is not reasonable that this setup is no longer able to kill them."
174,vulnerability,Warframe,Weapon Switch Mechanics - More Important Than We Think?,42,3cfpk1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3cfpk1/weapon_switch_mechanics_more_important_than_we/,2015-07-08 01:39:34,"Currently in Warframe each enemy faction has at least few enemy types with different vulnerabilities and resistances, for which player must adapt his weapons. But what player usualy does is choosing main weapon and maximizing build against whole faction, while second and third weapon becomes merely security measure just in case. One of the goals of Damage 2.0 was to eliminate rainbow builds and bring some thought into modding and gunplay. Oops, haven't happened. It introduced elemental vulnerability and resistance mechanic, Toxin element and proc mechanic, but utility aspect of elemental damage is almost vanished as a result. If before ""top tier"" was consisted of weapons with armor ignore and best potential for rainbow build (when last time have you seen someone holding Flux Rifle in his hands, Tenno, other than Crewman?), now it's a weapon with best potential for damage boost through elemental mods stacking. Not much changed, after all. But that's a story for another day, perhaps, back on topic. If we utilize potential of Damage 2.0, we could actually make player strategy when modding, for example, primary solely against shields and robotics, secondary and/or melee for the flesh to fight against the Corpus viable, thus making gunplay more engaging and fun (one-shot everything you see is not much fun, at least for me, as well as "" hold LMB to kill bullet sponge""). It will be especially useful against high-level enemies, where scaling makes resistances quite noticable. Solution? Streamlined weapon switch mechanic. Here is my take on this. Controls are almost the same: * Hold F to equip your melee weapon. * Hold F to equip your primary weapon (or secondary, if it was in your hands before you equipped melee). * Tap F to instantly switch between your primary and secondary weapons if one of them is currently equipped. * Tap F to instantly switch between melee and primary/secondary (depends on equipped before switching to melee mode weapon) when melee is equipped. To make it work, we need very fast weapon swap animation. Even teleporting weapons between pocket Void portals in palms of waframe suit and weapon holsters will suffice, quick animation is what really important. Weapon switch should happen in a flash, both metaphorically and literally - flash of light (waframe energy color, or even distortion effect with special sound) will show that transition has happened and you're ready to shoot someone's face. This kind of transition (weapon teleporting) will allow to make everything much faster without even using holstering/drawing animation, this also makes easier to implement customizable holsters and such - something many of us wanted for a long time. With some tweaks to damage/armor system and fixed enemy scaling/AI this change could make gameplay much more interesting. Especially gunplay, which is currently quite boring. This change by itself will fit concept of Warframe as fast paced game perfectly. "
175,vulnerability,Warframe,"Draco exp farming, how i do it.",2,3cpca0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3cpca0/draco_exp_farming_how_i_do_it/,2015-07-10 04:15:00,"My native languange isn't engligh, so i appologise if my words are mispelled I have had a few players ask me how was i doing draco since the method involving frosts or trinities wasn't going so well. Trinity indeed does give energy but for those who probably noticed, trinity range on ev is higher then the pulses from ev, so even if you hit the enemy it is likely that when the enemy dies, you receive no energy and that applies to your teammates, there is also the issue of using EV, since mesas are usually quicker at killing them before you can even aim properly. 1 mesa in team also has to stop often to get energy, these moments make you or the mesa vulnerable, chances of something going wrong increase. So how do i do it? **The setup:** - Mesa - Mesa - Limbo - Buffer / Speed nova / optional (can be a leecher if the rest of the team is good) **The builds:** Mesa - efficiency build is priority, damage is secondary Limbo - Duration build, natural talent recommended to reduce the vulnerability gap on you and the team Buffer - Buff mesas Speed Nova - makes enemies take more damage and makes them come to the mesas line of sight faster **Jobs:** Limbo - while banish is nice for individuals that move alot, cataclyst seems better suited for stacionary groups of players, this frost replacement has a benefit, the buble it creates cannot be destroyed by bullets, so this gives you freedom to walk around capturing areas while you're in the rift, so you simply use your 4th on the boxes, buble can be small and then you go capturing and neutralizing, with a duration based build you have no worries. Mesa - you perform 2 roles, you attack or you rest, it depends on what the other mesa is doing, therefore paying attention to the other mesa, speaking in chat or by using voice chat you must know when to rest and when to kill. If the other mesa is killing, you rest inside limbo's cataclyst, if the other mesa is resting then you need to kill. Trying to kill enemies at the same time will result in resting at the same time, creating gaps that the enemies will use to overrun the map, especially if you have a speed nova. Buffer - Mirage/rhino/frost/volt/ember/oberon/saryn stay in the rift near the mesas and give buffs (easiest role) Speed nova - if you don't want a massive buffer, you can always use something to speed things up while making enemies receive more damage, do note that this isn't recomended if the team doesn't have a good suply of energy, sometimes mesas that lack energy run around trying to pick up energy, if a gap in the killing happens and the enemies are speed up, then they will quickly overrun several terminals with little opposition, if you think the mesas get sleepy often or not paying attention, then a speed nova is not recommended. **Notes:** - Bringing energy siphons is recommended, the rift will not give you enough energy to refill mesas energy pool, so the less energy siphons you bring, the more complaining you will hear about mesas not having energy. - half baked mesas will either consume to much energy or will output low damage, so the enemies will try to overrun the terminals - Try to cap A and D, since that wil garetee that the mesas can see and kill whoever is capturing the targets, if the enemies are to strong the limbo must be quick to solve the situation or the buffer if the buff it timed based instead of proximity based, you know very well what happens when you have a small margin and then the enemy captures something at 97%, you will fail the round, if you see that letter flashing in the ui, take action. - Speed novas only when the mesas are coordinated enough, altough i did several runs without issues i did have moments where both mesas were resting and obviously the chat gets a bit active to try and wake up the sleeping mesa that needs to kill, sometimes the mesa that needs to kill is just walking around at the worst time, your margin of error is minimal when enemies are speed up, so make sure not to use nova when players are slow on the reaction time. - sindicate weapons can help kill enemies and aid you, cephalon suda augments for weapons or the sindicate weapon can give you energy, as a mesa this might be helpfull to boost your energy gain while the other mesa fills the meter for you, the AOE also helps killing the enemies below you. - If you are leveling up only 1 weapon and it can't be a sindicate weapon, then things might get a little harder, remember that if you can't kill or take away the enemy capturing the area, only the mesa is left, if that fails then you guessed it, the enemy will capture. The less equipment you bring, the harder it is to deal with small hicups that might appear, same with energy siphons. - Can't you simply grab half baked mesas, no energy siphons and do this? yes, but always remember that the lack of preparation on your part will reflect the outcome of the mission, the strategy i use works, so if for some reason with the same setup it doesn't work for you, then something failed. - Pickups, yes you will need to run around to pick them up, don't kill all the enemies before everyone had time to search the entire map. I know draco eventually will be removed and an interception on ceres will only appear from time to time once the new starchart becomes available, but while u17 hasn't come yet, feel free to use draco to lvl up your stuff. Feel to submit your ideas, builds and setups."
176,vulnerability,Warframe,Ash Evolves: Rework proposition.,23,3d2ecp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3d2ecp/ash_evolves_rework_proposition/,2015-07-13 09:48:03,"#**Isn't Ash fine as is?** In his current state Ash is able to deal great damage with his Bladestorm ability, but it outshines rest of his powerset and puts player into the role of spectator. At this point game plays itself, such lack of interactivity is definitely a downside for players who looking for some action and fun (and that's what are you looking for in space ninja game such as Warframe). You can just ignore Bladestorm, of course, and become a burden for your team, since rest of his powerset consists of damaging projectiles with no utility and bad scaling capability, underpowered short version of Loki's Invisibility with insignificant stagger effect and longer cast animation, Teleport that sometimes doesn't even work properly (alerts targeted enemy, doesn't open up him for finisher). While it's kinda useful for solo play, there's warframes that do all of this better. Otherwise it's all about Bladestorm, flaws of which i already highlighted. I think that removal of Bladestorm in its current form is necessary if you aim to make Ash more interesting, give him deeper mechanics. That's were i started, and that's why i ended up with such significant changes. My opinion on necessity of Ash rework/tweaking is based on facts listed above. If you're not agree - that's fine, feel free to tell me where exactly i'm wrong in the comments. **______________________________________________________________________________________** #**My suggestions** It is known that his main inspiration is traditional ninja - stealthy, determined assassin. It will be nice to feel this way while you're playing with this warframe. These changes will help to make Ash more interesting to play with, more engaging, requiring player to use whole powerset to achieve maximum efficiency in combat through ability synergy. I won't provide accurate stats and numbers, that's all subject of balancing and can be changed in any moment. **Shuriken** is changed in new charged ability type: Hold 1 to choose targets while aiming with mouse (it's enough to move crosshair near enemy) for guaranteed headshot and knockdown effect with bleeding proc. Once all shurikens targeted, Ash will throw them in an instant. Ash is able to throw all charged shurikens in one target, for this player should lock on target for a second and release ability button. Press 1 to throw them automatically, shurikens won't be able to hit critical points and will only stagger enemies, cause bleeding. Amount of shurikens is increased with each rank of ability: Rank 1 - 2 shurikens; Rank 2 - 4 shurikens; Rank 3 - 6 shurikens. Shuriken ability has base stats like those of weapon and can inherit some boosts from mods on players secondary weapon, such as multishot, elemental damage and status chance, critical damage and multiplier. Ability damage is affected by *Strength* mods. **Smoke Screen** is duration based ability that is not affected by range mods, creates large AoE cloud that expands over time in all directions (similar to Nova's MP, but has limited ceiling) with short blind effect on every enemy it touches. Significantly decreases accuracy for enemies inside, they also suffer additional damage from all sources (with stealth multiplier applied on melee strikes). Enemies outside the cloud are unable to detect players inside - their accuracy is also severely reduced. Ash gains additional movement speed inside the cloud. He can create multiple smoke clouds and link them together - able to create fog of war. Ash is true predator and this is his hunting grounds. Visually smoke clouds/fog should be semitransparent or highlight players/enemies inside. Smoke cloud size is affected by *Duration* mods, enemy vulnerability and speed buff are affected by *Strength* mods. **Ambush** Teleport and Bladestorm merged together - press 3 to enter smoke/shadow form for 3 seconds (smoke wisp if you want). Zero animation time, can be casted on move. In this form player can't be damaged and able to keep moving (float above the ground), melee channeling can be activated. Next actions are available: * Aim at enemy and press LMB to blink behind him and automatically perform fast backstab finisher or multi-takedown if there's more enemies near initial target. If not aimed directly, it chooses closest to the crosshair target. Considered as melee finisher/stealth attack even if player was detected. * Aim on smoke clouds and press LMB to instantly move between them. * Aim on ally and press LMB to blink behind him. If none of these actions were performed, player gets 50% of wasted on cast energy back. Ambush ability strikes have base stats like those of weapon and can inherit some boosts from mods on players melee weapon - finisher damage, critical damage/multiplier, channeling effects, base and elemental damage, status chance. Ability damage is affected by *Strength* mods, ""smoke wisp"" form duration can't be modified. Blink range is affected by *Range* mods. **Living Shadow** - new duration based ultimate. Makes Ash invisible for enemies while in the smoke, gives him ability to save accuracy decrease effect and movement speed buff gained inside for 50% of Smoke Bomb duration when outside (effect refreshes automatically while player enters smoke cloud). Amount of shurikens available is doubled, 100% status chance is added to them. Integrate Seeking Shuriken here would be nice as well. Ambush now can be targeted at any visible shadow on the tileset for blink. Visually looks like smoke or shadow aura. Affected by *Duration* mods. **______________________________________________________________________________________** Alternative powerset loadout with more accurate modification info: * 1 - Smoke Screen - Energy cost is 25. Final size of Smoke Screen cloud depends on *Range* mods, speed of its expansion and duration of cloud depends on *Duration* mods (less duration, faster it grows). It has 30 seconds base duration at all ranks, but countdown begins only when cloud reaches its maximum size. * 2 - Ambush - Energy cost is 25. Blink range is affected by *Range* mods, attacking component is affected by *Strength* mods and melee mods. Keep in mind that range limitation doesn't work when ability is aimed at Smoke Screen cloud. * 3 - Shuriken - Energy cost is 50. Damage is affected by *Strength* mods and base stats can be modified with secondary weapon mods. * 4 - Living Shadow - Energy cost on cast is 25. Energy drain is 2.5 per second. Living Shadow becomes toggleable ability with power drain over time. **______________________________________________________________________________________** Now Ash has options for both sniping and melee combat, instruments to engage battle and disappear at any given moment just to unleash devastating attack from new position. At last, i just want to remind my fellow Tenno that game constantly evolving, and warframes should change accordingly. Thank you for reading! "
177,vulnerability,Warframe,My take on a Saryn Rework,0,3d9ks1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3d9ks1/my_take_on_a_saryn_rework/,2015-07-15 01:52:55,"Saryn has always been my go to exterminate fast clearer but like many players, I wish she is something more than a press 4toWin frame. To me, what makes a frame fun to play means that the abilities interact with each other, much like embers toolkit. The vision I had for Saryn takes that to another level, where combining abilities often times create a whole new ability or opens up new possibilities. Now moving onto the theme and overall feel of Saryn. When I think Poison I think clouds of toxins, pools of poison, and acid melting enemys faces, so I try to incorporate that into the abilities. --- 1) Venom Mist (50 energy) - Saryn launches a moderately fast moving toxic cloud in direction your reticle is pointing (the cloud is similar in size to an augmented Novas AMD with a fixed radius of 10m). Enemies caught in the cloud gets viral procced (status chance tick occurs every 0.3 seconds enemy stays in the cloud) and gets dealt X damage per tick. The chance of the proc occurring depends on how far the cloud has traveled. The cloud travels a total distance of 50 meters at max rank. As it gets farther (distance cloud travels scales with range mods), it loses its potency, so the chance of viral proccing boils down to: a- First 25% of total distance traveled (100% viral proc chance) b- Next 25% of total distance traveled (75% proc chance) c- After reaching 50% total distance traveled the proc chance becomes 50% for the duration of the cloud travel time Now enemies who have a toxin/gas/corrosive proc on them already, the chance of viral proccing becomes 100% no matter the distance they are at when they get engulfed by the cloud. The player can reactivate the ability anytime during flight to detonate the cloud in an explosion of goop, which leaves behind a pool of sludge with a fixed radius of 10m on the ground (duration of pool effected by duration mods).Enemies walking through the pool is afflicted a DoT. The slow and DoT damage amount depends on how far the cloud has traveled, the longer it has traveled, the weaker the slow and DoT. The slow and damage reduction is capped to 50% of base amount. Saryn can have 2 pools active at one time. Casting and detonating a third Venom Mist will get rid of the first Venom Mist pool. +Power Strength= more damage on the Cloud DoT, Reactivation goop explosion, Pool DoT +Range= Distance cloud is able to travel which in turn effects the effectiveness of the slow/damage/proc chance +Duration= How long pool stays active --- 2) Molt (60 energy)- I did not change much about this ability. Saryn creates a stationary clone that draws aggro in a wide range (maybe around 40m). If the clones HP hits zero, it detonates in an explosion of goop (mmmm goop). HOWEVER, now Saryn takes INCREASED damage for 5 (fixed) seconds after molting, BUT gains a large amount of damage reduction(maybe around 60-70%?) for 10 seconds afterwards. During Saryns naked, vulnerable period, she enjoys increased movement speed (like when Chroma strips), jump height and increased reload speed. +Power Strength= How much damage clone can take before exploding and explosion damage. Also boosts the movement speed/jump height (not reload speed) during vulnerable period. +Duration= How long Clone lasts and how long the damage reduction period lasts (capping at additional 10 seconds for possible total of 20 secs of damage reduction). +Range= Goop explosion radius and aggro range of clone. --- 3) Miasma (100 energy)- Like Excalibur, this is now her third ability instead of ultimate. Functions pretty much the same as a large AoE nuke. Sayrn damages enemies in an area off loading 40% of total damage upfront. The remaining 60% is dealt as DoT over a flat 5 seconds. In addition, enemies that survive the initial 40% damage blast have reduced armor. +Power Strength= effects damage (duh) of explosion and armor reduction to a maximum of 50% reduced armor +Power Duration= NO EFFECT +Range=more range of nuke -- 4) Contagion (40 energy)- SOME FRIES MOTHER LUCKER! Her worst ability is now her ultimate. BUT! Now it becomes the catalyst into making Saryn even more versatile. Activating Contagion now buffs Saryns melee attack speed and she gains a flat 15 energy per melee hit, with a maximum of 4 hits per target. In addition, casting an ability while empowered provides that ability with an additional or new effect: a) Empowered Venom Mist- Saryn is now engulfed in that very same poison cloud. So instead of firing it off in a direction, the cloud sticks to her. All status mechanics+DoTs apply the same way. While active, the cloud gives her channeling efficiency and boosts her armor by XX%. The downside she suffers longer reload speed and an accuracy penalty on ranged weapons (not sure on number), BUT her bullets now gain additional Toxin damage. b) Empowered Molt- Saryn can now have multiple clones active at one time up to a maximum of 4 clones. The cost of casting Molt gets cut in half to 30 energy. Her vulnerability period gets reduced to 3 seconds, but each time she creates a new clone, the vulnerability period is extended by 0.5 seconds. In addition, Saryn enjoys life steal on her melee during the vulnerability period. No changes to damage reduction. c) Empowered Miasma- In the resulting nuke, half the planet Saryn is standing on gets vaporized instantaneously and Saryn gets thrown in to space in her archwing gear. Jokes aside, Saryn along with all her active clones (located anywhere on the map) each sets off a Miasma. Damage from overlapping explosions STACK! However the nuke damage is reduced, with Saryn doing only 70% of non-Empowered Miasma damage (counter intuitive amiright?) and her clones doing 50% of non-Empowered Miasma (now shortened to be called NEM). The nuke range is also reduced, with main body Saryn reaching 80% range of NEM and her clones dealing 60% of NEM. Clones once consumed, leaves behind a full strength goop pool like the one in her reactivated Venom Mist. --- So as you can see using most of her abilities has an upside and downside, it is all about the tradeoffs and using the right combination of abilities to suit your current situation. Numbers wise I pretty much ham handed it, the important thing is to get the mechanics behind the ability out on paper. I believe this allows Saryn to be built as a melee bruiser which DE seems to have her originally be intended, but also retain her role as a potent nuker. Personally I would enjoy playing this version of Saryn, but I understand this style does not appeal to everyone. Please let me know what you think of these changes and thank you for taking the time to browse through. "
178,vulnerability,Warframe,Sakura (An idea for a samurai-based Warframe),1,3ejkl5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/3ejkl5/sakura_an_idea_for_a_samuraibased_warframe/,2015-07-25 18:42:23,"Sakura is a Warframe that I came up with. I designed her abilities through the concept of a Samurai archetype. She is designed to be a potent melee frame who is able to effectively dish out melee slash damage, but also stay mobile and defensive enough as to not be vulnerable while in melee range. I'm not a fan of numbers and stats, so I only came up with abilities and how they work mechanically. I didn't worry about the frame's stats, energy costs, ability stats, and whatnot. Please let me know what you think about Sakura. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 1) Execute- Sakura draws her melee weapon and appears in front of the target foe, striking them swiftly. If the enemy is slain by this ability, half the energy cost is refunded, and the damage of her next ability or melee attack is increased. Execute is essentially Sakura's mobility tool. It allows her to instantly get in range of a target, near or far, and deal a surprising amount of damage with one quick hit. This ability has zero delay before casting, and very minimal vulnerability time after casting. Execute is great for picking off multiple targets who are far away from eachother, especially when their fire isn't focused on Sakura. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2) Bushido- Sakura enters a defensive stance, preparing to counter. If a foe attacks within the next few seconds, Sakura will nullify the damage and strike the target with a powerful attack, knocking back any foes in range. Bushido is great as a defensive tool for when enemies get a little too close. From activation, through defensive stance, all the way til the end of the strike, Sakura is invulnerable. If bullets hit her, they will be nullified and deflected back to the foe who shot it, but Bushido's strike will not be triggered until a melee attack hits Sakura. This allows Sakura to remain safe for several seconds, even if all attacking foes are ranged. The strike that triggers from Bushido is very powerful and wide. It is able to stagger all foes who are hit, making it a great tool for escaping, or making enemies vulnerable to attack. Using Bushido followed by a string of Execute casts on all of the staggered and damaged enemies is a potent strategy. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 3) Challenge- Sakura taunts a group of enemies in a wide cone, causing them to abandon tactics and mindlessly attack her. Affected enemies become vulnerable and take more damage. Challenge is a dangerously tactical skill. Using it at the wrong time will result in Sakura being overwhelmed by a horde of angry enemies. However, if Sakura is defensively prepared against the onslaught, it can provide an invaluable distraction for Sakura's allies to unload on all of the weakened foes. Using Bushido instantly after Challenge is an incredibly powerful combo. Dozens of bullets will fly back at the weakened enemies, before a powerful Bushido strike completely decimates them all. Sakura can be banished by a Limbo to provide hilarious results, with enemies helplessly attacking an invulnerable target while she runs circles around them or dances in the middle of them. Using Challenge during the right time will prove incredibly valuable to a team. If a horde of enemies overpowers Sakura and her allies, a well-placed Challenge could save a defensive objective, or assist in reviving an ally. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 4) Sacred Flower- Sakura focuses her power and infuses her melee weapon with ancient energies. She then slashes through the air, firing a deadly crescent in the direction she is facing. This crescent can travel far and cut through multiple enemies. Sacred Flower is Sakura's trump card. If there are too many enemies for you to deal with, then you can always just cut them all down with a super wide ranged attack. Think of this ability as a super powerful Exalted Blade ranged attack. The ability is designed to be a last resort. The energy cost is very high, along with a long cast time. It is great when there are too many enemies to think about, and the best option is just to throw out a costly, but super-powerful attack. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Passive- Sakura gains additional Power Strength depending on how high her melee damage is. Also, she gains a 15% bonus to her total melee damage if she only has a sword-type weapon equipped and no primary or secondary. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Power Strength scaling works on: Execute, Bushido, Challenge (enemies take more damage), Sacred Flower Power Range scaling works on: Execute, Challenge, Sacred Flower (wideness and travel distance) Power Duration scaling works on: Bushido (longer defensive stance), Challenge "
