0,vulnerability,learnprogramming,Build a project. Dont rely on tutorials,1,i281ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i281ms/build_a_project_dont_rely_on_tutorials/,2020-08-02 17:11:32,"Hi reddit (first-time poster here) Im a software instructor on Udemy (Rayan). Im also filling an enterprise development position for the government of Canada. I noticed a lot of posters were discussing tutorial hell. This is something my students have messaged me about as well. If youre in that position, I cant give you a universal solution to becoming a professional developer. But, I can tell you what worked for me. 1. Do not aimlessly watch tutorials. Look for tutorials that will help you build a project that youre planning. 2. Plan a large scale project. Build it at any cost. I first learned how to program by building an anonymous chat application. This incorporated front-end and back-end. This also forced me to learn crucial design patterns (i.e MVC) 3. Never fear bugs. Embrace them. Encountering a bug means you found a vulnerability in your app. This is great news! The easiest way to fix bugs is to set a series of breakpoints. Then, run print statements at each breakpoint. Or, sometimes it helps to compare the current version of your code to a previous version. See what changed. This may help isolate the issue. Of course, there are many ways to debug a program (some beyond the scope of this post) In any case, do not leave a bug unsolved. Resolve it at any cost. Its only when we struggle that we learn. 4. A coders best friend is stack. Everybody uses stack. It doesnt matter what level. 5. There are many more things I could write about. But, I believe the first 4 points are the best advice I can give to a beginner in development. This may get lost in the millions of programming posts. But, I hope this at least can guide one person. Head up and happy coding!"
1,vulnerability,learnprogramming,URL Query String Vulnerabilities / Alternatives Question,1,i3r6pf,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/i3r6pf/url_query_string_vulnerabilities_alternatives/,2020-08-05 06:32:01,"I'm working with ASP.NET MVC to create a page that will be linked to by several other pages. On my page, I need to have a button that links back to whichever one of these pages a user came from. Unfortunately, I don't know exactly what the URLs of said pages will be. They may contain query strings and variations that I'm not sure how they are generated. So, I am passing the URL of whatever page a user is coming from as a query string to my new page. As long as it is a relative URL, and the domain name is the site, it should be fine right? Is there a way in ASP.NET to validate that a URL is relative and not absolute, or maybe a way to check that a URL does not link away from the site it's on? Alternatively, is there a better way to do this that isn't prone to vulnerabilities like this one? There is the javascript history.back() function, maybe I should just use this? I have heard of flaws with this too though, for example if browser history has been cleared. But then maybe it's better to deal with these flaws than a potential security vulnerability. Thoughts? TL;DR Is redirecting to a relative URL from a query string a terrible idea? If not, what are some reliable forms of ASP.NET validation?"
2,vulnerability,learnprogramming,Overwriting an ASM instruction via a format string vulnerability?,1,ideeg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ideeg8/overwriting_an_asm_instruction_via_a_format/,2020-08-21 03:13:10,"I'm doing the [format4 exploit exercises](URL challenge. My idea was to overwrite the `exit` instruction at the end of `sym.vuln` with custom ASM. My solution is: ``` python -c ""print '\x0c\x85\x04\x08\x0d\x85\x04\x08\x0e\x85\x04\x08\x0f\x85\x04\x08\x10\x85\x04\x08' + '%4$n%5$n%6$n%7$n%8$n'"" | ~/workspace/exploit-exercises-protostar/protostar/bin/format4 ``` In theory, I should be able to write values to the address that says `exit` and instead make that instruction say `jmp 0x080484b4` which is the `sym.hello` function (the target). I use `rasm2` to get that instruction in hex: `e8eafeffff`. However, as I'm stepping through `sym.vuln` with radare2, I never get out of the `printf` function. I get a segfault but I don't seem to be modifying the instruction where `exit` is supposed to be. (I understand that the expected attack is to modify the GOT but I wanted to test other methods) So does anyone know if that's a limit? Can I not modify the instructions specifically? Or am I doing something wrong?"

As admin, I have to send such a persistent XSS message that when user_a logins to the site, user_b receives some amount of money transfer from user_a. I downloaded Burpsuite to view POST requests during login and money transfer. They seem very simple. They are just a single line of parameters. I tried searcing online, and general advice is to use ""XMLHttpRequest"". So I tried to use that with given instructions shown below: &lt;script&gt; var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest(); const url=new URL(""the transfer page url is pasted here""); xhr.open(""POST"", url, true); xhr.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"", ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""); xhr.send(""toid=6789&amp;amount=2&amp;usage=instance2&amp;submitbtn=%C3%9Cberweisen""); //this is the body of the post request for the transfer &lt;/script&gt; So I append that script at the end of the search url so it receives as an input, and click it as the victim(user_a). I expect that this script should send money to the user id 6789 (user_b) but it doesn't work. It just somehow makes the victim administrator all of a sudden. No money is being set.

Anyway, here's my confusion. There seem to be many different, seemingly unrelated definitions of the term ""security"": 1. Cryptography - encrypted message are more secure than plain-text. This type of security makes perfect sense to me. 2. Memory leaks - people say that you can write ""insecure"" or ""unsafe"" code in C/C++ because you have to manually manage memory. I'm just confused about what this has to do with security. If you use a couple more kb than you need to, what does that have to do with safety and protection from hacking? 3. Security at the operating system level: people have different opinions on this, some say that Linux is more secure than Windows, etc. What makes one operating system more secure than another and why? Isn't the fault ultimately with the user, who chose to run a random virus file with elevated privileges? 4. Security of libraries (especially for web servers): every now and then, I get a notification that says that some security vulnerability has been patched. I don't understand how it's possible for a server to be hacked due to a vulnerability in a web server library - doesn't the library just give you a way to easily handle requests? Not sure how someone would be able to exploit this. Are these definitions different, or are they somehow related to each other? And I'm also not sure how number 2 is a type of security at all.

I'm trying to make it as secure as possible. This is the workflow I came up with. Looking for any feedback regarding how I can improve it or if something is a security risk. User clicks ""Login with Google"" 1. Clientside sends a request to backend server asking for Google login URL 2. Server responds with Google login URL 3. Clientside opens a popup with the login URL. 4. The client logs in with Google and is redirected to another URL with access code in the query params. 5. Clientside sends a request to the server with the access code provided in the query params. 6. The Backend server uses this code to get an access token and a refresh token for the user. 7. Backend server stores the refresh token in a database and sends the access token to the clientside 8. Clientside receives the access token and saves it in Browser local storage. After logging in, whenever the client needs information from the server, the clientside can send the access token to the server. The server can then verify this access token with Google OAuth and if the token is valid, send the appropriate information back. If the access token has expired, it can use the stored refresh token to send a new access token back with the information. I guess the only vulnerability I can think of is that, if the stored access token is compromised from the client's browser then someone could make a request to the backend pretending to be the user but I don't know if there is a way around this? Is there a better way to achieve something similar? Would it make sense to hash the access token at any point? Also, some websites tend to store this information in the cookies? Since when I delete the cookies, it usually prompts me to log back in. Also, I had a question regarding storing information in the database. Wouldn't it be more secure if all the information in the database was hashed? I didn't really find much on this online but doing so will mean that if the database is compromised then the information has no meaning. I'm still new to web development and any feedback is appreciated!"

For authentication I'm thinking about using Auth0, but for DB I don't know what to do. I know that directly accessing the DB in-app is very, very stupid - people can just decompile the app and extract the passwords and then it's game over. Should I just learn API development? I'm scared that I might fuck it up and create a security vulnerability. Any platforms you would recommend? Thanks!"

Ive built a couple of websites for actual business clients which are currently in private Github repositories which I assumed would be best for security reasons. I had planned to do some personal projects and make them public but havent quite got around to it yet. I have got some college projects on there but my work has come on a fair bit since that. Would a potential employer expect to see my code for client websites and is it a good/bad idea to make that code public? I dont think I have any sensitive information like keys etc. stored in the repo but I also dont particularly want to search through all the push history to check I didnt accidentally push something sensitive at some stage of development. And Im not sure what other info could be a vulnerability.

I began to think about this more thoroughly when my aunt said she was going to take a programming course to become a web developer to get a better job, and when I heard someone at school talking about how their little brother is making a programming project with his friends. ""Seems like everyone's starting to program now."" I felt.. disposable. Not that I believed that my cousin or the person's brother were disposable, but it was an invasive intrusive thought. ""*So many programmers! Who am I to jump into this when so many other people are doing it too, some for steel-like motivations? Who am I to try and learn this when there are people doing this because they have mouths to feed? Who am I to try and learn this when I've never been considered gifted or technically capable in my life, and frankly most often- the opposite?""* This train of thinking assaulted me with every second I spent trying to learn or follow the course, any mistake or failure or question or lack of knowledge simply making this voice in my head louder and louder, *""You definitely can't do this!""* Mixed in with my general feelings of vulnerability and being condescend upon showing lack of education to other people. I wonder why I don't feel this way about art. When i'm making a piece, i'm not thinking about all the other people watching a drawing course or making an animation in a studio, I generally think about the piece. Maybe it's because I've seen multiple artists be appreciated for the individual unique work they do to a point that I may feel occasionally that it isn't bad that there are millions of other artists out there, because there's something that I and they individually bring to the table and that I can hone upon to make it my own for other people, and if not; whatever! I like the feeling of making lines on paper, even if it's ""garbage"" to other people. I can't deny that the aspect of not being able to make money off of my art when things get hard has scared me into putting as much time as I like, but in my heart for some reason I just enjoy it. In programming, however, this feeling takes a quick 180. I've generally felt that my love for programming wasn't that genuine (despite these feelings being influenced by other things like this) and that I didn't seem to have anything innate being able to help me laugh even when I was stumbling on the floor wondering what this or that is. I can't deny that some of my feelings upon wanting to program and do STEM things has been from being in a lower income family (The prospect of having to get a scholarship to do anything academically after high school has been waved to me more than anything else in my life right now), and wanting to prove all the people that said I was less capable and ""not built for this"" wrong that I can learn to do the technical things that I've wanted to do, and anyone else can, too! I generally don't possess the knowledge on any programmer topics, but despite people saying that different programmers do things differently and individual problem solving ideas are embraced in coding, I keep feeling that it's more technical and rigid, especially when people talk about 'good' and 'bad' programmers. I already only have a brief idea of the types of programming people do for certain things, and maybe I might stumble upon something that makes me want to do it every waking second of the day, regardless of what anyone thinks. But right now, I can't even get through a single course without feeling like a nobody who doesn't deserve to try. How do I stop being fussed about all the other people learning to program or making projects or just anything with their programs, and start focusing on how I feel going on this journey and exploring more about what programming is? How do I stop feeling like the field of programmers is so saturated and it's like a candy shop for employers to choose and spit out as they please because they'll always be someone else at the door who's just trying to feed their kids? I feel that I don't even deserve to take up space, much less be seen as a """"dummy"""" for all the things I don't know, can't solve and need help with? I don't know, i'm just lost. Has anyone else felt like this, and what did they/you do? Thanks. &amp;#x200B;"

I came up with a couple code snippets that I wanted to interviewee to comment on/review. This was for a ""senior level"" contract to hire C# .Net/MVC/SQL position. After going through this with two candidates, and one of the Junior developers already employed, I was kind of underwhelmed with the responses. I'd love to hear your feedback, if you think I'm expecting too much in a 30-40 minute interview setting, if you considered yourself experienced/adept and would have trouble identifying problems/commenting on the less than perfect code, or if you could talk at length about how poor the code is and what you consider your skill level to be. Anyways, for each snippet, I would give a little context and ask them a couple questions, such as ""Do you think this is good code?"", ""What would you do differently?"", ""Can you identify any bugs or vulnerabilities in the code?"", or ""What would you say in a code review"". I would also tell them to be picky, mention anything that comes to mind. For the first bit, I would explain that the following functions were MVC actions and to pretend that these were functions for a public facing ecommerce website. The first two, I would just ask their opinions, if they thought anything looked wrong or if they would change anything. The third function I would say had many problems and one in particular was huge. [HttpGet] public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; LoadInvoices(int page, int customerId) { var invoices = linqEntities.Where(x =&gt; x.CustomerId = customerId).ToList().Skip((page-1) * 15).Take(15); return View(invoices); } [Authorize(Roles = ""Admin"")] public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; SetUserAsAdmin(string id) { await databaseFunctionToMakeUserAnAdmin(id); return RedirectToAction(); } private static Invoice invoice; public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; LoadInvoice(string invoiceId) { SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(""Server=sql1;Database=Motovicity;User Id=steve;Password=production""); string sql = null; if (invoiceId.StartsWith(""5"")) sql = $""SELECT * FROM tblInvoices WHERE Invoice='{invoiceId}' AND InvoiceType = 2""; else sql = $""SELECT * FROM tblInvoices WHERE Invoice='{invoiceId}' AND InvoiceType = 3""; SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(sql, connection); SqlDataAdapter adapter = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd); connection.Open(); var table = new DataTable(); adapter.Fill(table); invoice = Map(table); return View(invoice); } Next, I would explain that this function was part of the checkout for our old website. This function was called when the user chose a shipping method on our ""Shipping confirmation"" page to save the shipping info to the database before the user could place their order on the ""Order confirmation"" page. I would ask if they could see anything wrong with the function or what feedback they would provide in a code review. protected void SetSelectedShippingMethod() { Instrumentation.Tracing.TraceFunctionEnter(); string selectedMethod = Page.Request[""ShippingChoice""]; if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(selectedMethod)) { var shippingCharge = Page.Request[string.Format(""{0}-{1}"", ""shipping-charge"", selectedMethod)]; int smiid = Convert.ToInt32(selectedMethod); UserPrefs.Cart.SmiId = smiid; // UserPrefs is an object in the session if (smiid.ToString() == ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""ShippingMethods_FreeFreight""]) { UserPrefs.Cart.HandlingTotal = objCustomer.HandlingFee; // objCustomer is an object in the session UserPrefs.Cart.FreeFreightProgram = true; } else { UserPrefs.Cart.HandlingTotal = 0; UserPrefs.Cart.FreeFreightProgram = false; } UserPrefs.Cart.FreightTotal = Convert.ToDecimal(shippingCharge); } UserPrefs.Save(); // Save the cart information to the database Instrumentation.Tracing.TraceFunctionExit(); } For this snippet, I would explain that this uses the log4net library to log errors and that they should assume the `_logger.Error` call would correctly log the error message, inner exceptions, and stack trace. I asked them what they would say in a code review, if they could tell what would be logged, and if that would be helpful in debugging errors. public class IntegrationException : Exception, IMotovicityException, IDomainEntity { private ILog _logger = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(IntegrationException)); // log4net instance public string Application { get; private set; } public DateTime ErrorDate { get; private set; } public string Function { get; private set; } public string Module { get; private set; } public string Note { get; private set; } public string Project { get; private set; } public int Severity { get; private set; } public IntegrationException(string application, DateTime errorDate, string function, string module, string note, string project, int severity, string message) : base(message) { try { Application = application; ErrorDate = errorDate; Function = function; Module = module; Note = note; Project = project; Severity = severity; throw this; } catch (IntegrationException integrationException) { _logger.Error(""Integration Exception"", integrationException); } } } This next bit I would explain was code we actually had in production at one point. It was part of a webservice to quote orders for our ecommerce website. I would point out the `LengthAndGirth` function, say it was used exclusively to determine if an item qualified for FedEx SmartPost which had the restriction that the ""dimensions of length plus girth (L + 2W + 2H) cannot exceed 130 inches"" (From FedEx's own documentation). I asked if they thought the code was correct, and if they could come up with any examples where this class would incorrectly classify an item as having a length+girth above or below 130 inches. (Assume we always used inches and didn't have any data issues such as negative or 0 measurements). namespace Core.Units { public class Dimensions { public Dimensions(decimal length, decimal width, decimal height) { Length = length; Width = width; Height = height; } public decimal Length { get; } public decimal Width { get; } public decimal Height { get; } // For FedEx SmartPost, the dimensions of length plus girth (L + 2W + 2H) cannot exceed 130 inches public decimal LengthAndGirth() { return Length + (Width * 2) + (Height * 2); } public decimal MaxSingleDimension() { if (Length &gt; Width &amp;&amp; Length &gt; Height) return Length; if (Width &gt;= Length &amp;&amp; Width &gt; Height) return Width; return Height; } public bool EachDimensionAtLeast(Dimensions other) { return Length &gt;= other.Length &amp;&amp; Width &gt;= other.Width &amp;&amp; Height &gt;= other.Height; } protected bool Equals(Dimensions other) { return string.Equals(Length, other.Length) &amp;&amp; Equals(Width, other.Width) &amp;&amp; Equals(Height, other.Height); } } } The next snippet I would say that there's nothing *incorrect*, but I would ask what they would say in a code review or if they thought this was ""good"" code. I would then mention that the `ORDER_getTblTaxJurisditionByJurisdictionType` function call was to a database stored procedure. // From MaterialWithCustomerDiscount.cs public StateTax[] InternationalTariffDuties //Might be Confusing but StateTax now encompasses International Tariff { get { return StateTax.getInternationalTariffDuties(); } set { } } public TaxSettings TaxSettings { get { return new TaxSettings(); } set { } } // getInternationalTariffDuties from another file public static StateTax[] getInternationalTariffDuties() { //For now this is just Canadian Tariff/Duty (Actual Percentage will vary, but we can use this to get the Tax InternationalID, //which will be pulled when doing GL Journal entries. using (DAL_NOLOCK_MotovicityDataContext ctx = new DAL_NOLOCK_MotovicityDataContext()) { List&lt;StateTax&gt; l = new List&lt;StateTax&gt;(); var results = (ctx.ORDER_getTblTaxJurisditionByJurisdictionType(1)); if (results != null) { foreach (var result in results) { StateTax st = new StateTax(result); l.Add(st); } } return l.ToArray(); } } Next, I would explain that this snippet was from our old ecommerce webforms site, and that we had a page where customers could download a spreadsheet of our items for sale. They would click a button and an iframe would open that would force download the spreadsheet. The code was the ""Page Load"" of that iframe. I would ask them if they could identify a *vulnerability* in the code. // From GenerateFile.aspx.cs - What's wrong with this web forms page/iframe? public partial class GenerateFile : System.Web.UI.Page { protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { string sXLSFile = Request.QueryString[""XLSFile""]; { Response.Clear(); Response.ContentType = ""application/force-download""; Response.AddHeader(""content-disposition"", ""attachment; filename=Pricing.xls""); Response.BinaryWrite(File.ReadAllBytes(sXLSFile)); Response.End(); } } } Am I expecting too much? Do you think this is difficult for a 30-40 minute interview setting? I'd really love to hear your feedback, thank you. "

I am aware that in %99 of cases brute-force is useless on RAR as it uses AES256 encryption and it would take billion of years. This project is more about learning than building a useful software. Finding a password like '1234' in an acceptable time period is enough for me. From the data I gathered, rainbow tables are useless for RAR. My professor doesn't accept dictionary attack or known plain text attack either. It has to be strictly brute force. So hash comparing is my only way. But getting the hashes value of the archive password is problematic. Rar doesn't hold the hashed password since it is not required (also it would be a vulnerability I suppose). So my first step is somehow extract the hashed password from the RAR file. I found a free sofware that can extract the password hash called 'John the Ripper' which is an open source password cracking software. I put my test.rar through the JtR to get the password hash. The input was like this: test3.rar:$RAR3$*1*0000000000000000*398efb83*32*8*1*074997279cecdca804b8936489a2f3bf8069e5c60a94b56976357ca52c584749*33:1::hi - 1.txt When I studied the source code of John the Ripper (which I couldn't understand %99 of what was written despite the code comments) and managed the get the meaning of the hash above: test3.rar : $RAR3$ * 1 * 0000000000000000 * 398efb83 * 32 * 8 * 1 * 074997279cecdca804b8936489a2f3bf8069e5c60a94b56976357ca52c584749 * 33 : 1 :: hi - 1.txt name : $RAR3$ * type * hex(salt) * hex(crc) * PACK_SIZE * UNP_SIZE * 1 * hex(full encrypted file) * meth : type :: file_name At first I thought the hex of fully encrypted file is what I am after.As you can see above: 074997279cecdca804b8936489a2f3bf8069e5c60a94b56976357ca52c584749 But putting the actual password of the test3.rar (which is '123') to an SHA256 converter gave me this: 181210F8F9C779C26DA1D9B2075BDE0127302EE0E3FCA38C9A83F5B1DD8E5D3B which doesn't match with what JtR gave me. So I am at loss here.Why don't they match? And how can JtR actually find my password if the information it works on is completely different? Here is the github link of John the Ripper if anyone needs it : URL I am aware that I am asking a lot of questions but even a little piece of information is very valuable for me. I literally hit a wall at this point. Thanks."

Even if I made the source for the web app viewable to the public, there's still no way to be sure that's what is actually on the sever...which leads to my two questions 1) Is there a hosting service that lets you view the code that exists on the server? It doesn't matter if the site is ""secure"" with SSL/TSL or that you can view everything the client receives if you have no idea what actually happens on the server. There is absolutely no way to know for sure if a site stores your passwords in plain text or in a reversable encrypted format, but I think a service that lets you view whats on the server would solve that...maybe. Anyway, this just makes me know for sure that I should use a different password on every site 2) I want to make a nice site and make it ""open source"" (in quotes because no one actually knows if that's the real source on the server). I want to do this primarily so that I could put it on my portfolio and hopefully get a dev job someday. But if you're a noob, wouldn't this just open up your site for attack?

Right now there are two components: nginx and python with gunicorn. But hypothetically, if someone were to find a vulnerability in forms, he would have access to an entire Python container, meaning it would be possible to steal API keys. So I decided that it may be a good idea to incapsulate all the contact with the outside APIs into a separate container that stores the keys, so it would be impossible to steal ANY data by compromising Python part, with added bonus of implicit caching.

This news comes with a silver lining of course. If you are a web developer (or are thinking about teaching yourself web programming), you probably don't think of yourself as a security engineer, or a white-hat/blue-team member of an information security assurance team. You might have considered security threats in the context of quality assurance before (e.g. validating input), but perhaps you're no expert on the subject. But the second your code is deployed in production, your code is the front line of defense for that entire system and quite possibly the entire network. Logically, that means the software you produce must be made reasonably secure. Accidentally concatenate a user-provided value with your query string, and someone can steal all your data and cripple your application in their wake. Forget to escape some data before displaying it, or escape it improperly, and suddenly your application has betrayed your users' trust in your client's brand and infected them with malware. This might seem like a lot of pressure. A common argument I hear from other developers is, ""Our clients don't pay us for security; they want it pretty, they want it feature-complete, and most importantly they want it done yesterday."" I'm not going to say you *need* to become an application security expert. That very notion betrays the (largely untapped) potential for rich diversity in the technology communities. But I will say this: # Application Security is Every Developer's Responsibility **This doesn't mean you have to be an expert.** You can take one step forward on the path towards expertise and stop, and it will still move the needle in your organization as well as any clients you work with. As long as you take the right first step. The most frequent recommendation for learning about application security is to read the [OWASP Top Ten](URL and the [SANS Top 25](URL I believe this recommendation causes more harm than good. **There are *way* more than 10 or 25 vulnerabilities.** I used to joke that someone was going to hack the planet with OWASP's number eleven vulnerability because no one would see it coming. Attackers don't think in checklists; skilled attackers think in graphs. ""What is the easiest way to get from outside this system to a privileged position inside of it?"" If you're trying to build an application and you don't want people to steal your data, infect your customers, and abuse your network resources for distributed denial of service attacks, a checklist mentality isn't going to help here. Henceforth, I propose a new model for thinking of security weaknesses, which is more approachable for application security neophytes and lends more towards developing a mentality that nurtures the development of layered defenses. ## A Taxonomic Model for Insecurity Instead of creating a checklist of arbitrary size (OWASP Top 10, SANS Top 25, Paragon Top 50, whatever), we should classify security vulnerabilities like we do with living beings. Like organisms, many security vulnerabilities appear to have features and traits in common. Like life, the complexity and diversity of possibilities can seem incomprehensible, but at a very high level, we can place them in a mere handful of categories. And that is what I'd like to share with you today. What follows are my picks for the a high level taxonomic rank for security vulnerabilities. If you're a new developer and you can learn the lessons of each category, you will be much better off than someone who only knows a domain-specific defense strategy and not the fundamental problem. ### 1. Failure to Separate Data from Instructions This covers the majority of security vulnerabilities exploited by hackers of any persuasion, and covers specific topics including: * Stack and Heap Overflows: * Affects most software. By overflowing a memory buffer, you can overwrite the next instructions to be executed. Normally this results in a crash, but if you overwrite these instructions with meaningful values, you can take over the remote process. * [Cross-Site Scripting](URL * Affects web browsers. Improperly handled data by the application will cause Javascript to execute on another user's computer. * [SQL Injection](URL * Affects database queries. By sending a specially crafted string, you can change the query that the application runs. In many cases, you can abuse this to upload malware. * [LDAP Injection](URL * Affects Active Directory, similar to SQL Injection. LDAP Injection can result in arbitrary reading/writing of data from the directory server, which can result in privilege escalation of user accounts in an entire network. * [XPath Injection](URL * Affects XML document querying. Can result in arbitrary data disclosure from the remainder of the document. * [Command Injection](URL * Affects shell executions. In all of these cases, the end user (or another device) is able to enter some data into the system, whereby it manages to alter the instructions intended to operate on said data. ### 2. Unsound Application Logic Application logic is considered less exciting for many security researchers than turning data into instructions, but logic errors are often overlooked in a rush to take care of the vulnerabilities that can lead to the webserver being taken over. Unsound application logic occurs when invalid data is blindly accepted without validation, steps can be skipped entirely, or the outcome of the previous step in a sequence is not verified before continuing on. Application logic errors are best illustrated by example. Let's say you're designing an eCommerce website that uses PayPal for credit card processing. Without knowing much about checkout integration, the most obvious and straightforward process looks like this: 1. User adds items to their cart. 2. User presses PayPal button. 3. User is taken to the PayPal website. 4. Some magic happens. 5. User clicks a special link (static, not unique per user) which marks the contents of their cart as `paid` and redirects them to a thank you page. 6. User sees thank you page. There are three possible logic errors that can take place here, provided you don't explicitly work to prevent them: 1. Users can add -1 of a different item with the same price to their cart to bring the total down to $0.00. 2. Users can skip the checkout process entirely by knowing the special link (Step 5) beforehand, which marks the transaction as fulfilled. 3. User can add a cheap item to the cart, click the PayPal link, go add a bunch of expensive items to their cart, finish their PayPal purchase (Step 4) with the lower total, and then the whole shebang is marked as fulfilled. The first case is remedied with simple input validation. In the latter two cases, server-server API integration is the only real solution. Instead of relying on the user to click a URL (which is brittle even in a utopian world where no one acts maliciously), your checkout provider will tell your server which items were purchased and how much money was transmitted. All of the failures in my example can be detected by manual human oversight (which doesn't scale to high transaction volumes) but why create more work for your client? One of the benefits of software is the capability for automation, but **that automation is only as reliable as our systems can be secure**. ### 3. Your Application's Operating Environment Your application does not exist in a pocket dimension. It depends on a number of other components to function: * Third-party libraries * Your server's operating system * Your server's hardware components * The hypervisor, if you're in a virtual machine * The power supply to the data center * Network connectivity to the outside world * Your end user's client software (e.g. web browser) Security vulnerabilities in any of these components can weaken or outright cripple the security of your application. Generally, the only way to be safe is to [keep all of your software up to date](URL and never rely on [abandonware](URL A related example: Resource asymmetry. Most websites run on a single machine and will fall over if hammered with thousands of machines. This is called a Distributed Denial of Service attack. The only effective mitigations are at the network level, not the application layer. ### 4. Cryptographic Weaknesses Although many cryptography-related issues can fall under ""operating environment"" or ""application logic"", they really do deserve special consideration. For example, outside the [scope of cryptography](URL comparing two strings isn't a big deal. In cryptography, you have to be sure that string comparison takes the same amount of time whether your first byte is the same in both strings or if it differs. Otherwise, your application becomes vulnerable to [remote timing attacks](URL And that's but one of the many things that can go catastrophically wrong when [writing cryptography features](URL **Cryptography is hard. Leave it to the experts.** It's fine to [experiment with cryptography in order to learn](URL but don't ever deploy it in production or recommend anyone use it. ### Miscellaneous Security Weaknesses It's certainly possible that there are broad categories of security issues that I am not aware of. It's also likely that there are security issues that don't fit neatly into one of the four categories I've outlined above. Or perhaps some that fit into two or more categories equally. Specific example: Are [XXE processing vulnerabilities](URL really an instruction/data issue when its only mitigation is turning off a libxml feature? I can't say. ## Towards a More Secure Tomorrow I believe this model, at a 10,000 foot view, is a simpler and gentler way to introduce application security concepts than expecting developers to memorize an arbitrarily sized list of the most common security vulnerabilities from a given year. It's not perfect; in the end, the security community will have to decide what the categories should be, where the lines should be drawn, and how many layers it should have. Everyone is invited to join in the effort to refine this model. But it's a start, and if you can remember these four rules, you'll be in good shape: 1. Prevent data from corrupting the instructions. 2. Be explicit and comprehensive with your application logic. 3. Keep your software up to date and don't rely on abandoned components. 4. Don't write your own cryptography. If, after reading all of this, you still want to look at the OWASP/SANS checklists for the most common issues (or just to pique your curiosity), feel free. Though I don't consider them good starting points for beginners, they remain excellent resources.

Also, can someone explain to me what are environmental variables and how to set up Java environment for Windows and Linux? How to automatically update JDK to the latest version and why would I need to keep older versions of a JDK (why may applications utilize only older JDK version and not always the newest)? P.S. People used to say OpenJDK was not as good as Oracle JDK and I can definitely understand that. Nowadays, they are probably close enough that you can substitute either one for general needs. For a Java developer or those who utilize JDKs in many scenarios, is OpenJDK still able to completely replace Oracle JDK?

58,vulnerability,learnprogramming,How do buffer overflow attacks work?,77,2yrzt8,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2yrzt8/how_do_buffer_overflow_attacks_work/,2015-03-12 20:05:03,"I understand how they function in general, but how do people discover a vulnerability without viewing the source code? Isn't this something that most programs account for? Does anyone have an example of a specific buffer overflow attack? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit: Thanks for the great replies everyone. I noticed that there were a few comments asking what buffer overflows were below, and I didn't include anything in my original post about it so I will include a very brief and simple explanation here so that those coming in who don't have experience in a low level language like C can understand what the comments in this thread are referring to. /u/Hexorg has a great explanation of them below as well. Suppose that you create an array of char large enough to hold 10 characters; the computer is then going to allocate enough space in memory to store those 10 characters. Suppose then you take input from the user and store their input in this array. If the size of their input is &lt;10 characters, there is no issue -- the input is simply stored in the array and the program moves on. Now suppose that the input is greater than 10 characters. If there is nothing built in to detect and stop an input larger than the size of the array from being stored, then the input is going to overflow into memory, onto the program stack, and overwrite whatever is currently stored there. Some malicious users can abuse this vulnerability by including instruction encoding that the program will execute in place of what was previously there and cause it to perform in ways it was never intended to. Those of you who are far more knowledgeable about this, please by all means correct me on anything that is wrong in my explanation. I just want everyone coming in to understand what is being discussed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Edit 2: I posted this as a comment but I will post it here so it gets more exposure and more people have an opportunity to answer: I guess what is still confusing is how someone knows where to pass a return address for whatever instructions they want to execute without viewing the stack. I see how it would be easy to just pass in an arbitrarily large string of characters and see if it crashes the program -- obviously you wouldn't need to actually view the stack to do this; but how do people actually cause a program to execute their own set of instructions passed in via their input without knowing where the programs return is in order to give it the address of their own exploit instructions? My understanding is that you would have to pass in a string of a specific size so that the address reached the point on the stack where the return instruction executes."

I considered that some of the benefits of using this model would be: - Having UUIDs in-place for public routes which fetch records would prevent just being to increment a number to fetch all records (helpful in the event of an unseen vulnerability) - Makes transferring data between environments a lot easier since UUIDs are pretty much going to be unique. For example if a record is created in our local VM and it has a relationship with another record, there will be no auto-increment ID conflicts if the destination environment's sequence is not in-sync with our local auto-increment ID sequence Negatives: - Auto-increment becomes redundant and would only be used internally for identifying which records came first I suppose - Generating UUIDs is somewhat costly ([benchmark I found through Google](URL Are there any other significant negatives/positives to my auto-increment ID + UUID idea that I haven't considered (code-related, front-facing, DB performance, etc.)?"

From what I've been reading the general consensus for bootcamps is ""No, just go online and learn how to program for free"" However, I recently found that a lot of good universities offer relatively cheap 6 month bootcamps for learning various tech related fields. The bootcamp gives you a certificate from the university, and you end up making roughly six ""projects"" that you could use on your resume. Furthermore it gives you access to the career service center of the prestigious university, which is huge for me since I went to a tiny school where the career service center was useless. My question is which one should I take? I am a history major who works in real estate. i was a few credits short of a minor in economics, and I work in real estate where I have to work on budgeting, cash flow reports, and book keeping.

I have experience in finance in my current, but truthfully, it is quite small, my current position is almost entirely operations.

Since it's gotten to this point, we both agreed that school isn't right for him (or at least this one?)... But what are other options out there that he could take so he can still eventually work in this field, or is getting that bachelor degree really the only sure way? (Is anything even guaranteed nowadays lol) Is there such thing as a vocational or short schooling for this? Can he just study and self teach in this day and age and still get a job in the industry? Is there a website or list of videos you'd recommend to someone who's looking to self teach themself in this area?

For some quick background, I work in the legal industry and have been out of grad school for a few years. I work 40 to 50 hours per week Mon through Fri. I'm working on a career change into the field of computers, e.g., programming, networks, cybersecurity, etc., and, for now, I am doing it self-taught. My passion is in computers, and I've finally taken steps to pursue it in my career. Anyway, beginning in mid-fall 2019, I began auditing an online intro to computer science course called CS50 from Harvard (you may have heard of it). My strategy is to begin with C and to branch out from there. I have been enjoying it and doing it at my own pace, but I found that I wanted supplemental material to help me along. I purchased C Programming: Absolute Beginner's Guide by Greg Perry and Dean Miller, and have been going through that in tandem with CS50. I find myself understanding, and enjoying, the book more because CS50 often seems to make tremendous ""jumps"" from lectures and shorts to the psets; can feel very overwhelming! Here's what my strategy has been. I committed to at least 1 hour of programming every day for 100 days (a ""100 days of programming"" thing I found online) to help build a habit of programming. I'm about two weeks in I think. (Prior to that, I had set aside a few days each week and would spend a couple hours to work on stuff.) I usually end up doing 2-3 hours after work and 3-4 hours on weekend days, rather than just 1 hour. (I can easily get engrossed in it and truly find it enjoyable and fascinating. Yes, my social life has suffered already tremendously lol.) I will rotate between sometimes doing CS50 work and sometimes doing the book. I usually do the tutorial stuff and then play around with the code to see what changes I can make (and usually more often what mistakes I make!). I am planning on incorporating a mix of coming up with simple programs and then trying to implement them with the code syntax I've learned. The goal would be that, as I get more advanced, my programs can be more advanced in the process. I've sort of already been doing this by playing around with the code, but I wanted to make it more of a planning/executing process. So you think of a problem or program and then figure out how to implement it, if that makes sense. I am thinking that, by this summer, I'll begin enrolling into formal courses, probably in certificate-type programs. I'd prefer a Bachelors or Associates, but, with working full time and having to pay bills, that would take a long time. I'm thinking that I'd begin with certifications and such and that as I (hopefully) get my foot in the door, I would continue my education and such. I know the Information Services folks at my current position, and I'm known as a great worker at my employment, so I'm hoping to perhaps use that to my advantage and get the first position in one of those positions. (They do a mix of IT, programming, maintaining systems and the network, etc.) That way I can continue paying my bills while gaining experience in the field, and then, you know, maybe continue the education even more. So my question is what do you think of my strategy? (I'm in my late 20s BTW and already do a lot of critical thinking and problem solving in my current position, so I feel that will help me.) This field is incredibly new to me in terms of what it takes to succeed and such, so I am open to any and all suggestions, comments, critiques, etc. Like, if you think my strategy is awful, rip it apart and let me know what you would do instead! Thank you all in advance!"

There's this makerspace about a 30 minute drive from home, a sort of community center for entrepreneurs, programmers, engineers, DIY hobbyists, and more. Basic membership is $25 a month, full membership is $75 a month. I'm just trying to decide whether or not if it's worth it. I live out in the middle of nowhere with my family, and I'm not trying to stay at home while I'm working on classes and developing skills, and I think I would fare better and make quicker progress if I had a place to go to twice a week to meet like-minded people and have some designated place for me to focus on nothing but programming, with some socializing on the side. But like I said, it's a 30 minute drive away. An hour total driving time is almost about 1/6th of a tank of gas, and I also will most likely end up going to some other places during the week or on the weekend to volunteer at some places. It costs \~$20 to fill the car up when it's almost on empty. So I'm thinking that, assuming I fill up the car twice a month, the membership plus the gas would be about $45 \~ $90 a month. You know now that I've typed it out, out of $4,000, it doesn't seem like a lot of money for a month. Not even the $90. And I'm thinking about $20 \~ $40 in monthly personal care expenses. I just don't want it to end up being more expensive than I anticipated just to go and sit there and work, even though it would be much easier to focus on my work there than at home."

I am faced with a bit of a dilemma. I am currently pursuing a second B.S., this time in Cybersecurity. Due to the pre-requisite course requirements my expected graduation date isn't until Fall of 2022. At this time, I am also accepted into Grand Canyon Universities M.S. bridge cybersecurity program, and if I choose that I would graduate Spring of 2022. My question is, would it be more beneficial for me to pursue the B.S. at ASU or the M.S. at GCU? It just seems a little fishy to me that my B.S. in Sociology from 10 years ago is all that I need to show for acceptance into the GCU Cybersecurity masters program. I have been attending ASU for 1 year, I have a 4.0 GPA and am motivated to do well, learn and absorb the material whichever route I choose to take, chasing certifications on the side. I would hate to leave ASU to obtain my Masters from GCU just to not be taken seriously once I enter the workforce. I am 30 years old, and GCU's online masters degree really appeals to me because it would enable me to work full time while I pursue it, and I would graduate sooner than I would if I continue to pursue my B.S. from ASU. I am wondering if a B.S. in sociology with a M.S. in cybersecurity would be laughed at compared to a B.S. in cybersecurity. I would be looking for the same entry level jobs either way, I would not expect to obtain a senior level position. Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank You!"

I am hoping for some advice from those in cyber and/or those who have completed online certificates (or even in-person non-degree university programs like U.T.s Bootcamp) on what the best way to get the fundamentals is. Of course, one of my main concerns is how my education will be perceived by future employers (i.e. what's the most reputable online certificates-- like George Washington University vs SANS.) I found the programs can be split between programs offered by universities and those by other online schools. I'd love to hear thoughts and feedback. Heres the breakdown: Group 1: Cyber studies from recognized universities, and it seems that the syllabus of these courses is a little more general and theoretical than technical. Group 2: Cyber education certificates from several different private colleges, offering various certificates by a cyber expert (eg Cyber Security Analyst CySA +) and job security. This is usually a self-paced study course or a field study in the format of Cyber Boot Camp. I would love to receive a recommendation on what is the best way to enter and enter the field.

I'm a high school STEM teacher. I'm helping my department modernize our rather small set of course offerings. Last year all we had was a one-term introduction to keyboarding, visual basic and a graphic design course. This year we've added Computer Science Principles that is largely project based that eventually leads to independent Python programming projects, which is a good start, but we'd really like to add several other classes. Here is a list of classes we're considering offering. \-Robotics (My administration seems very excited about offering a course based on the First Robotics Competition. Java or C++ programming can be used, but this will only be a portion of the course.) \-web design/programming \-app development (Probably starting MIT app inventor and then switching to Java and possibly Swift. This could also replace about 4/5 of the AP Principles class if that appealed to students. I know there is a Principles curriculum entirely based around MIT App Inventor. ) \-cybersecurity (Know of any good curriculum for this?) \-animation (Many of our students and a couple of our teachers are familiar with Inventor, so I was thinking teaching Maya might be possible since I've heard that's similar. More likely the electronic art teacher would handle this though. Any suggestions for curriculum or software for a course like this?) \-video game development (a.) Either Unity/C# based with a strong emphasis on design, or b.)creating 2d games using Java, Javascript, or Python with an emphasis on using game creation to teach programming skills. I've heard of one teacher using option b. to teach pre-ap and ap CS Principles) \-networking (Possibly Cisco) \-language-specific programming such as with Java. (Perhaps AP CSA. Is this a quality course that isn't too tedious? Might be a good course to act as 'advanced app programming since it uses Java?') &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; Any suggestions are welcome! What classes would be most worthwhile... since we probably can't offer them all. The electronic art teacher will probably offer one more art class, like animation. I'm one of two programming teachers... and I think I may be the only one interested in moving in a programming direction, since we've hired people that can take care of most of my courses. At most I think we can offer 4 more courses, but that is uncertain this point. The limited number of courses we might be able to offer is partly why I suggest using AP courses for as a phone app or game creation course since we are already offering AP Principles. I think those two courses in particular could be useful for recruitment... Suggestions for software, materials, or curriculum for said courses is also very welcome!"

I've worked for several multinational companies and I currently run a small team running AdWords, Bing Ads, FB campaigns, etc. I guess what I mean is that I'm not completely unfamiliar with coding as I work closely with developers, data scientists, PMs, etc. I was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago. Fortunately, I'm much better now and I've decided not do delay any longer what's been always one of my dreams: working remotely and perhaps while travelling. Finding a remote online marketing job would be the straight option but, looking tino remote work websites, I found only a few marketing posts. Freelancing is an option but I feel only small business would take a single individual to run their campaigns. Not sure how reliable that option would be. I taught myself enough R to create simple scripts to analyze large datasets, segment customers or do basic web scraping. I also did some Udacity HTML/CSS/JS courses on my spare time and build two embarrassing websites with Bootstrap. Enough to know that I enjoy problem solving and that the unforgiving logic of programing turns me on. I still need to be home for a while to regularly check myself so it is the perfect time to learn a coding language. Software engineering or Data Science (especially the last one I believe) could complement very well my current skill set and boost my career to the next level. I can see how statistics and machine learning could help me but also developing with javascript an app that connects to an API. Nevertheless, it seems 95% of remote work is software engineering, neither data science or marketing. I would appreciate any advice you could give me on the path you think I should follow. I can only speculate and search job posts to get an idea about my options but you really know your stuff and know the job market from the inside. In case that matters, I'm from the EU. Hoping this post gets noticed by somebody.. PS: I have also fantasized about a career in CyberSecurity (love NITE Team 4) but that's probably unrealistic, especially for remote work.

Primary goal is to get a job in the timeframe listed, whether that is web dev or leveraging my compliance management skills to land some kind of analyst hybrid tech position I will need to get a job 2.) As of now, I don't particularly want to do web development long term nor am I interested in heavy data science or iOS. 3.) I have a bachelor's and master's degree, both in history, not a goal but it might affect your suggestions 4.) My long term goals currently are to end up in cybersecurity or in the video game industry (but I'm really not interested in developing my own indie game in Unity) 5.) My job market for the next several years is Ohio particularly Cleveland or Columbus due to family and friends(my mom is also from around here and doesn't have many years left so we want to be somewhat close) 6.) I learn better in a structured environment which could be a coding school, books, a well crafted Udemy series, etc. So please Reddit programming friends give me your advice. What is a good game plan and some of your favorite resources to help me achieve my goals. Thank you!"

I'd say my skills are at a medium level, I can write fairly decent code but not full fledged complex programs and applications.

I decided for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp. I absolutely love the course so far. I even completely stopped gaming, instead, I sit and code every night. That never happened with anything else I picked up. It's probably a good idea to tell you where I would like to go. I come from a Cybersecurity background and I am already kind of half self-employed. I picked up Web Development mainly because I want to do something more creative and secondly because I want to ultimately be completely independent of my office job. That means, I definitely want to exclusively freelance or do remote work with minimum office time. Long story short, I am almost finished with Colt's course and so far, I am pretty solid with building basic websites. I already know most of the serverside stuff from my profession, so that was an easy chapter for me. I know one of the advice will be ""build something"", which I am constantly doing. Unfortunately, Colt's course, even it's great, it's a bit dated. So I don't want to waste too much time building stuff using those technologies. I have a friend who is a developer and who helps me out with learning stuff and because of him, I am gravitating towards React + Redux as a next step. I bought Colt's React course, but he does not cover Redux, my friend said Redux would be very important. My problem is, because Colt's course only covers the bare basics of JS, I suck at JS. I started the Reddit Daily Programming Challenges (easy) up until day 12, and I honestly struggled with every one of the challenges. My buddy who takes the same course has the exact same problem. They are way too hard, even the easy ones. I know of Wes Bos JavaScript 30 and I started the first project, but I stopped because I was overwhelmed of so much stuff I haven't seen before so I thought it's a bit too much as well. (There is no ES6 in Colt's Course). So at the moment, I feel a bit lost. Without direction. I feel like I need to solidify my JavaScript before moving on to something like React, but I don't really know what's the best way to do that. Let me summarize my burning questions: * What are some easier practice resources than Reddit Daily Programming Challenges? * What should I do when I finished the course? * What is the best React + Redux course? Quite long post but I do have a lot of questions and don't want to create multiple posts. I am happy to answer any further details. Thanks a lot!"

Some of you may be aware of this company which administers a variety of coding, cyber, and data analytic bootcamps often in partnership with universities. I am writing this thread to warn others who may considering it to save their money and look elsewhere. The cybersecurity bootcamp organized by Trilogy is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in education. Myself and my fellow classmates paid $12,000 to attend this course on the assumption that the curriculum, teachers, and overall course had been designed in coordination with Columbia. This could not be further from the truth. Over the course of the next six months, we experienced an extremely disjointed and unprofessional program including a complete lack of support from career services, a verbally abusive instructor whom Trilogy, after many complaints, did nothing about, non-functional labs, poor AV equipment that made recordings largely inaudible for anyone who was absent or wanted to attend remotely, and finally, a complete disregard for the well being of the students. In the six months we were there, we probably sent 6 to 7 weeks in totally actually focusing on useful and practical content. I cannot express to you how frustrating it was to sit through the majority of this course knowing the projects, presentations, and material being presented was in many cases factually wrong or irrelevant to our future careers. The saddest part about this experience was how it affected the lives of many of the students in the course. Between the horrible curriculum and a verbally abusive teacher, many students quickly became dismayed and received no support from Trilogy throughout the entire process. People spend their hard earned savings or took out loans to participate in this course on the promise of a chance to achieve something that was impossible from the start. Without going on a rant, there are plenty more details I can share, but my number one recommendation is avoid attending any of Trilogy's bootcamps and to advise anyone considering them to do the same. You can find plenty of other similar reviews out there and trust me, despite a few positive ones, you are not going to be that lucky person who got the perfect teacher and curriculum. With Trilogy, it does not exist."

Regardless of if symbols are encoded or left in plain ASCII, the input string is never in a correct format and there's no reference on the web services API. I've looked at the sample code they've sent, the documentation, I've tried reaching out to different people to ask questions just to get bounced around and then (professionally) called incompetent by the senior dev contractor I asked for advice for not being able to get it to work. Overall, this has been a hellish and miserable experience this summer. I've learned about jQuery ajax (never knew it existed until 2 weeks ago), the foundations of CORS, more in-depth knowledge of just how HTTP requests work, how to utilize Java and jQuery to make these requests.

As for (a), I'm inclined to choose Python because I've heard it has many purposes and is relatively easy to get into. I'm personally interested in cybersecurity and it seems like Python is popular in that sector too. Ideally, for (b), Ideally, the book would be fairly up-to-date and readable within two months. I've already stumbled upon _Cracking Codes with Python_ by Al Sweigart and from reading a few fragments it looks interesting, however I'm not sure if it's about cryptography with a bit of Python or Python taught with cryptography exercises -- I'd much prefer the latter. But those are just my initial findings. Any suggestions are welcome :)"

ONLY ONE PERSON bothered to be kind and offer help without giving me a rough time. In leu of what happened, I want to really extend a hand and let anyone who struggles with mean/rude/obnoxious/troll commenters to know that they are wrong and you are definitely worth helping. You are not annoying, whiny, or anything for asking for clarification, help, specificity, and respect. You are really just trying to learn, and that is very admirable. Even if you come here with ZERO experience and just want tips on where to start. (Just don't ask someone to straight up write your whole program for you.) If you are a new programmer/student/prospective student, here are some general things that helped me personally get a bit better: 1.) Don't overwhelm yourself. You might see posts telling you to learn about ten different programming languages. This might make you feel a sense of urgency in learning them. STOP. Work at your pace. Some people are gifted with learning things fast and getting concepts quickly. They are exceptions for the rules. If you learn slowly and through example, don't feel frustrated. Most of us actually learn this way. 2.) Continuing from point number 1, come here and post questions when confused (take help with a grain of salt), talk to others who do code, ask teachers if you are a student, seek out a mentor who is willing to help. 3.) Don't listen to unkind voices. I have made THREE major switches. I was first going into psychology. Then biology. Now computer science. Never in my life have I ever met people this pretentious in threads. You need a thick skin to get your way around here. There are definitely some very kind people, but they will be masked by rude comments sometimes. Don't fret. Just know they too were at your level once. They aren't special. You are not deserving of rude responses. 4.) If you feel whatsoever that you need a break, take it. Don't feel guilty letting yourself put your mental/physical health over learning. It's like if when someone is using their pencil to write and it loses graphite and needs sharpening but the person continues to use it and their writing gets illegible and faded. Being stressed and tired is not a good mindset to be in bc you are like the dull pencil in need of sharpening (a break). Relax, take a moment, eat, sleep, socialize, distance yourself. Then come back rejuvenated and ready to learn again! 5.) Your situation is not everyone's situation. I am a UX/UI student wanting to learn code. For me, it isn't AS serious as it is for, say, a software developing student. They need more coding experience than I do. If you plan, for example, to get into gaming, you should ask specific questions about gaming, like what programs are used to create games, how to create the animations/visuals, how to combine the visuals with the codes you create, where to start, what a good major is for game dev, etc. If you are really strongly passionate about cybersecurity and want to become an ethical hacker, where would you start? What are the utmost essential programming languages to learn? What are some very common and very uncommon hacks? Majors? Where are there some schooling options? Where do I get hired? See? The questions tend really to have different responses. 6.) If, after all this, you still feel confused and not passionate about programming, you are not a failure for choosing to bow down from it. That doesn't make you stupid or anything. This just might really not be your forte or interest. No problem. Just put effort into the next thing you focus on, whether it be just learning a new language, switching majors, looking for new passions, whatever it is. Good luck to any fellow new programmers, and thank you from the bottom of my heart to the good samaritans who go out of their way to be kind and patient with new students like me and others. :)"

From a few months i am trying to learn programming but the problem i am facing is that i am not focussed enough. For ex: after learning basics of C and python i practiced some coding questions but after 1-2 month i thought my interest is web so i learned HTML, CSS ,Bootstrap(for CSS), JS(little bit). Then i thought i should have some design experience so i learned Photoshop(basic tools,layers,layer masks,color correction-no advanced stuff), after that i decided to continue webDev so i decided to learn some modern framework so tried ReactJS for 2-3 weeks but then i realised my JS fundamentals are week so i learned it for few weeks. But then i realised that i can learn webDev in future but now i must focus more on CS fundamentals.I also tried Unity3d and made beginner projects like a clock,Roll a ball. Also from the very start i aspire to be good at competitive programming but was just too afraid of it. Also i was fascinated by all news about AI,ML etc, so in vacations i learned basic machine learning and pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn but it started to feel too difficult, also i was just using libraries but i have no maths or algo knowledge(and learning it meant less time for fundamentals) so i dropped it. I also tried contributing to some open source github repo, but only did few beginner-friendly task and everything else seemed too tough(was working with python but haven't learnt OOP yet). Then spent 1 month learning flask framework and dropped it. Also tried learning cybersecurity for CTFs but dropped it too. In ""trying"" to learn all this for most of the things i was using a follow-along approach from books or videos. I was just jumping from one thing to another( Can anyone relate to this?) whenever i felt something too tough or i felt that grass is greener on the other side. This led to me forgetting many things as i was not regular with anything. Most of my peers focussed on 1 thing for this year, now many people are either good coders or developers or designers or hackers etc. I feel i am interested in everything or i have no passion for any particular field. Now i have only 3 years of education left and i am seriously concerned about being good at atleast something. I am not interested in doing masters(don't have motivation and don't want to take edu. loans and be in debt). Want to get a decent job after bachelors. I am definitely going to focus on making my fundamentals (DS and Algo) strong but other than that what should i focus on or should i just do fundamentals? How can i not get influenced by news articles or peers and stop making frequent changes to my study plans/career goals? Note- I am new to reddit i don't know if it is right place to ask this or what i am asking makes any sense or not. Not a native english speaker,so please ignore mistakes if any."

In fact, I want to learn *how* the computer works, and I think systems programming would be a great start. Do you know of any good lectures on YT?

Hows it going, Reddit? Heres a short story. I graduated SHS in 2009. I took my time off to develop skills in the restaurant, sales, and marketing industries before sprinting back to school. I graduated NSCC this year with a Liberal Arts Associates, which included taking a Stats 101 course. Heres a longer story. I realized tech was my direction. I like working with teams, but also working remotely in cafes, because I care about my mental, physical, and spiritual health. Working in an industry such as data science would allow me to work on meaningful projects, afford housing and further education, and would allow me to exercise, sleep in, or whatever else Id need to do to stay on my A-game. After working as a resum collector at a job fair focused on cybersecurity, computer engineering and the like, I was granted some time to network. I learned from a recruiter that with 2 internships and a Bachelors in Comp Sci, I should be able to land a job making $60k a year, easily. This makes sense, because I live in Boston, but theres just one problem: I live in an apartment and work full-time! I dont have the money to afford a graduate degree! Anyways, after graduating in May, I started putting the pieces together. I went to General Assembly and took an intro to data science workshop. I acquired their resources and syllabus for the full-time, ten-week, $16k course on data science.I listened to two podcasts: Becoming a Data Scientist, and CodeNewbie, as I drove across three states for work (vendor selling, training, and merchandising computers). I bought LPTHW, and picked up many but not all the basics of 2. I went on Codecademy, took Python 101 and 201 workshops at GA(ga.co), and earned a certificate on edX.org(Intro to Python for Data Science). After taking the Data Camp/edX course, I realized I should only be learning P3. So I bought the Learn Python 3 The Hard Way book, which comes with videos, and am about to get approved PTO for today, which Im stoked about because all I want to do is learn until I can get a job that lets me feel happy. With my dual-monitor setup, Im printing scripts after I write them, analyzing them after running them, on paper, just to make sure I understand whats going on in each line. My goal is to redesign my daily caloric intake calculator to P3, so I can use numpy and convert lists to arrays, and eventually create diet plans/meal planning/recipes through script, more for using skills Ive learned in my own way than for any type of business idea. Ill post it on GitHub once Im through. Then, when Ive finished this book, Ill go through it once last time and break all the code Ive written, so I can learn more about bugs, Errors, and debugging scripts. This week I find out if Im funded $5k for a data science certificate, but this is dragging on so let me Boolean my point back to the title: certificate = 0 python_learned = in process python_learned = 0 If certificate == True: print(pass, and find job) else: print(apply for FAFSA, go to SSU for 3.5 years) If python_learned == True: print(learn SQL, other skills to land 1st tech job) else: print(ask Reddit what skills land entry level job) ... Any advice is greatly appreciated. Ive heard that startups are a great way to get your toes wet, but Im not sure what types of skills Ill need at first. Ive almost considered going in a direction I didnt have in mind, which would be learning about how Python leads to building websites, but my concern is that if I learn enough python to appropriately transition to learning something like SQL on my own, I might forget how to do some of the things I am learning, if it takes months or even more than a year to land my first tech job. Thats also why Im hesitant to learn JavaScript. Its almost common sense that I stick with one language, until Im either in a workplace that requires I learn it, am in school and theyre teaching it, or Im finally in a career that allows me to do the things I want to do, which would likely include learning a new language, since falling behind in tech is really easy nowadays. Reddit, what are your thoughts? Other than my soon-acquired Python and past-acquired Stats 101 skills and education, what other hats must I wear before I have a plausible chance of landing my first entry level tech job? Thanks "

(One of my majors is cybersecurity, so I'd like to at least provide some level of security, even if phones are inherently less secure.) Additionally, I'm hoping to be able to scan the amount of data and routinely clean out older data (from events that are like 6+ months old) to help keep the size of the data down as there were some concerns about using up too much of the phone's storage. Thanks in advance for any advice/commentary. "

I am really hoping you can help me out here. I have a phone interview coming up in the next couple weeks as a LAMP develops for a company that works in cybersecurity. I would consider myself advanced in working with PHP, MySQL, and Linux, and probably intermediate with Apache. I know they aren't really language specific and I am at an Intermediate level as far as Python. They are looking for some front-end experience, which I am definitely lacking in. But I have almost no knowledge of handling security on computer system or network. I know it is a lot to learn in a little time, but what is a good source for a crash course in security. Some good front-end work would probably be helpful as well, but honestly, anything you might have available for a LAMP dev would be good, especially if it is your current profession. I know this next interview will be over the phone and more technical in nature, so I'm trying to develop a good idea of the questions I might be asked and how to answer them. If you can provide any info here, I would appreciate it r/learnprogramming."

In a nutshell I am in my early 30s and changing careers (currently a lawyer. No undergrad or grad degree related to CS). I've being doing months of self-study and have a decent grip on the MEAN stack. I should be ready to start beginning my job search around April. Yesterday a friend told me about a 5 month cyber security program (originally I wanted to get involved in cyber security) where people are trained in the very basics, ultimately prepping them for the CCENT. I plan to study for and take the CompTIA, then the CISSP. The ultimate goal being an analyst. I am mulling this opportunity over vs. continuing on my path to becoming a web dev. My questions are: 1) will these certs be enough to get my foot in the door in the cybersecurity field, or will my lack of a CS/IT degree be a major hindrance (I understand a five month bootcamp isn't the equivalent; unfortunately I do not have the money or time to go back and get another degree)? 2) Is it unreasonable to set the goal of achieving my CompTIA and being in the cybersecurity field (optimally as some sort of analyst, but I will take any position as long as there is the ability to grow from there) by the end of this year? P.S. I understand that people generally hate being asked ""how can i get into your field without going the long path that you have?"" but my constraints are entirely about very limited time due to finances and family obligations, not opposition to hard work. I'm willing to do whatever it is I need to do if it is at all feasible for me to make the switch in a few months. Any other related advice is appreciated as well. Thanks!"

237,cybersecurity,learnprogramming,Paid and intensive certificates with most lucrative end result?,0,5fqeko,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5fqeko/paid_and_intensive_certificates_with_most/,2016-12-01 03:09:26,"Long story short, I will be finishing up my second year of CS this upcoming spring. The debt is starting to pile up ever so slightly since my parents don't have much to help me out with. I currently work at my school as an office aide for the CS department (luckily they let me do homework there sometimes) and then I'm a busboy on the weekends at a local restaurant. Working these 40-50 hours a week of minimum wage just aren't cutting it. There are threads on here where people take part in free courses online to gain knowledge and some background in a particular field just for their own benefit. I was wondering if there are any courses out there (free or not) that can end up with you landing a side job to make some side cash. I know that Coursera and edX have some good courses, but are they worth it if you pay for the certificate -- does anyone actualy get a job or get paid from that? I will be free from early May to mid-August until school starts up again. I know that the CCNA is a super decent paying job, but that'll take a little longer than I anticipate and just don't have the time for such a program (unless I pull a 20+ hour course load in the summer). I'm interested in anything CS. I'm fairly well versed in Java, C, C++, and HTML/CSS (If you want to count those). One of the few things that really catch my attention though is anything cybersecurity related. I'm not saying I'm the smartest of students, but I definitely work hard and go get help when I need it (above 3.0 GPA). Essentially, I am looking for any certificates online or at a community college that are intensive and have a solid salary at the end. Not saying that it's gotta be like 50k+, but just something more better-paying than making copies and washing dishes. Any recommendations would be seriously appreciated, thanks in advance guys!

238,cybersecurity,learnprogramming,Here's a SANITIZED list of 530+ free online programming/CS courses (MOOCs) with feedback(i.e. exams/homeworks/assignments) that you can start this month (December 2016),3319,5gr8nw,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5gr8nw/heres_a_sanitized_list_of_530_free_online/,2016-12-06 16:50:51,"Preamble: So, a submission on this sub to a [huge list of MOOC courses](URL caught my attention today as I've been trying to learn programming myself. So I look into the comments first to see what courses people were taking, when [a comment caught my attention](URL that says: ""This is a great resouces but beware, OP ran some of the links through some pay site so that he profits out of traffic and hid this using bit.ly links...."" So I decided to investigate further, and sure enough. uBlock Origin blocked the first link that I clicked. It turns out, pretty much every link to the course on the post is a bit.ly link hiding a reference link to a spam site linksynergy.com. The url itself has reference id and everything. Full link: URL I posted this in the comment and reported the post for spamming, thought nothing more of it, and move on. In my goofing off, I ended up installing NVIDIA CodeWorks, and the damn installer turned out to be a download manager for installer to a bunch of stuffs it needed to install. So, I let it run and while it downloads, I thought I'd fire up Overwatch and try to climb out of gold rank, when for some reason, I thought about the MOOC post again. Hiding a reference link using bit.ly is not only spamming, but it's also unethical because bit.ly tracks where clicks come from and the whole practice preys on the innocent who just wanted to learn some programming stuffs. So I decided to go through the links and sanitized the bit.ly and removed all the spam links and replace it with direct links to each of the course. Over the course of cleaning up the links, I found that OP feed all their links through two spam sites that ublock origin blocked: The first one is the linksynergy site as I've mentioned before. URL The second one is through awin1.com URL I hope this sort of shady spamming behavior is not tolerated in this sub, and doesn't happen again. But just in case another post comes up again next month, would someone be so kind as to make a bit.ly expander plugin for chrome or something to automate this cleanup without exposing the user's location, and clicking on the reference, etc. I didn't want to run this through python in case something bad happens and some dumb protocol got exposed or whatever. Anyway, here's the full sanitized list. I've left the links bare so you can see this list has not been compromised. And if you'll excuse me, I'm going to run spybot on my system now. Happy learning.

I have a bunch of books I got on my own about hacking, history of CS, cybersecurity, etc. Lots of general CS books that are enjoyable to read and to see how everything comes together and clicks. I love reading all these blogs you guys post in here and other subs. My last final is today and I want to do something productive over the winter break because next semester I'll be faced with similar challenges. My professors recommend I go on sites such as CodeFights to get better at programming. I was also thinking about going through that list in here of hundreds of MOOCS and programming classes to get better at it. Anyone else have any recommendations to get overall better at programming? Obviously PRACTICE, but what are the best methods to practice in? EDIT: Minor changes"

In the past, I've led a data science team at an Andressen-Horowitz funded cybersecurity startup. AMA about how to become a data scientist or what data scientists do.",403,5hzjcb,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/5hzjcb/im_a_data_scientist_who_transitioned_to_the_field/,2016-12-13 08:53:35,"Hey everybody, This is my story. I have a background in computer science; my undergrad was in computer science as was my masters and Ph.D from Rice University in Houston, Texas. Then I started working as a programmer/developer in a startup around 2009. While I was a programmer I realized that I wanted a career change, at least a change in direction. I got curious about data science after taking some machine learning classes online via [Coursera](URL and realized I wanted more! Eventually I took classes with Stanford via their [continuing education program](URL (SCPD). During that time I gradually switched jobs from a software developer to a data engineer to a data scientist. I've been a full-time data scientist for about 4 years now. Lets clarify what data science is here: a combination of statistics, programming and business communication skills that combine together to help people analyze massive datasets at scale to unearth business insights. It was actually pretty interesting how I got my first role: I started a [data science meetup in Atlanta](URL where I was based at the time, and gradually got recognized as an expert in the field. When there were open data science job opportunities, people came to me! Naturally, when I found something I liked, I offered my skills up -- and since then I havent looked back. Im now the Director of Data Science Education at [Springboard](URL We just launched the [Data Science Career Track](URL a data science bootcamp with a job guarantee, because I believe in helping others make the same journey I did. BTW, here are some awesome resources to get you started! * [Datacamp](URL has great resources for the programming basics in either R or Python. * [Khan Academy's probability and statistics section](URL is a great resource to grasp inferential statistics. * [Mode's tutorial to SQL](URL is a fully interactive path to mastering SQL skills. * [Springboard's Data Science Process series](URL (disclaimer: I wrote this) is a good place for beginners to understand what a data scientist does. * [Kaggle](URL is a community of data science enthusiasts, where you can learn by taking challenge problems, once you've learned the basics. * [Airbnb data scientist Claudia Gold's Data Analysis curriculum](URL provides a step-by-step approach to learn from scratch. P.S. Thanks for all the love. I'm new to Reddit, and am amazed by the response and the community."

Does anybody here who did Software eng or Information technology get into a programming job front end/back end or network security/cybersecurity? What I don't want: Working on circuitry instead of programming, ending up diddling with excel as a career. I want to be developing code, net security, pen testing, hacking and cryptography. These are the course descriptions for each one: Information technology: The course description: The Bachelor of Science degree program in Information Technology will provide you with knowledge and skills that are in demand. Our courses in computing, software programming, and network technology are up-to-date and taught by our international faculty of computer science professionals. The IT program provides both theory and practical programming and network skills. Our curriculum is based on international standards (IEEE &amp; ACM) developed in the U.S. We integrate into our courses, online resources and course materials from some of the top universities in the world. Software Engineering: The BSc. in Software Engineering international degree program is an interdisciplinary program collaboratively developed and administered by faculty in the Faculties of Science, Engineering, Humanities and Social Sciences, CMU. The program is designed to offer students an opportunity to learn theoretical aspects of software engineering in the lecture room and laboratory and practical aspects of the engineering profession via co-operative education and professional training in software industrial sectors. This is a project-intensive program in which students learn by example and by practice. Theory and practice are introduced by applying them to relevant software engineering problems. They are reinforced through case studies, exercises, and projects. The emphasis of the program is to produce graduates with the capacity to create a body of knowledge in software engineering, provide leadership in information and communication industries as a software professional or an entrepreneur at international level as a global citizen. This includes preparing students with good communication and language skills as well as an understanding of foreign cultures. "

243,cybersecurity,learnprogramming,Need advice on preparing for an internship,0,57py04,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/57py04/need_advice_on_preparing_for_an_internship/,2016-10-16 15:33:26,"I tried not to write a wall, but it keeps happening. **TL;DR: Freshmen won a hackathon, prize is a paid internship. I haven't been able to stick to learning one language, and am looking for advice on how to stay focused on one language and ignore distractions to learn other things. Also, any internship advice stuff?** I recently won a paid internship at a software/it company in the area. Internship-wise it is a great opportunity, though from what I hear/read, it isn't a place to have a career because they pay pretty low. However, they have higher-tier clients, they partner you with people with experience, and you do actual work on actual projects, and it pays more than my current IT position with the school. Not trying to go in detail on the company simply because it distracts from the question, but I'm just making it clear that it is a good opportunity that I want to take. Especially since I am a Freshmen coming off a 2-year gap year after high school, and I have always had a lot of drive. My problem is, is that I have taken zero Comp Sci classes (first one is next semester), I have very basic knowledge in HTML/CSS, C, Python, and a couple Linux distros. When I say basic knowledge, I mean I got 30% through the HTML/CSS CodeAcademy lessons, 40% through my Python Udemy course, 45% through my C book (The Absolute Beginner's Guide to C), and my Bash/Powershell knowledge is doing maybe 15 total commands in Learn Python the Hard Way's Command Line Crash Course. I kept jumping to further understand what I was doing. By that I mean HTML/CSS didn't feel like ""programming"", Python felt too simple (stopped right before OOP), C is fine but I kept getting distracted by people wanting me to learn this or that. Basically I am struggling to stick with one thing, and could really use advice on how to stick to and follow through one language even when I have so many different distractions going on. For example, one time I switched from C to Python because the founder of a cybersecurity company in the area wanted me to do Python projects (he never sent me the projects). Or I began learning Linux systems to set up the right environment for Athena MHD simulations for my undergraduate research. Really just looking for guidance on this. Generally I am fairly good about managing my time and prioritizing, but right now I am definitely struggling and could use some clarity. I do not yet know what exactly my tasks would be with the internship, but the competition dealt with C#. So I'm thinking my best bet would be to finish my C book and stick to expanding my C knowledge until then, but I am not sure how to handle the outside distractions (like other project offers). Sorry for the wall I said I wouldn't make, but I really appreciate all advice!"

I'm about to start my second year as an EE major but after a lot of thinking I've realized how much I'd love to do some sort of AI programming, or cybersecurity. However, building something with your own hands and watching it work properly is a feeling like no other. I've heard that EE is better because you can learn coding on your own, but you can't learn the hardware part of EE on your own. So for someone who would love to do something related to AI but also is fond of hardware, is CompSci or EE a better fit? "

I love programing, I find it incredibly fun and engaging but I got this problem and that is, when I finish college I have no idea what I can actualy do xD. Bit of backgorund:starting second year now, in first year we learned C which I think wasen't coverd properly they only tought us How to do things and not Why you actualy do them which made a lot of my class mates stuck when they get some kind of asigment I was motsly fine, but 3 weeks ago I started going throu C Programing a modern approach by K. N. King and I realised how little they actualy teach you at college. So this year we will be doing C++ one semester and Java(long list of classes inc be warned xD) (in the next 4 years I will also have classes like Operating systems, modeling data and proces, Safety of informatic systems, data bases, computer networks, objective oriented techonlogys, web application design, modeling and simulations, data base menagment, tools for development of information systems, comunication technologys, control and revision of information systems, software engineering, development of objective orientated aplications, development of multimedia systems, control menagmanet of quality of information systems, computer menagment over complex systems). Sorry for listing so many I got no shorter way to explain what I am studying and I did translations from croatian to english so some classes may be called diferently :P I am really intrested in AI but it doesn't seem as my college offers anything of sorts to get into AI development except data bases. Except AI I am also really intrested in cybersecurity but I dont know how to get into any of these 2 fields, so my question is basicly when I get my degree would i be qulifed to work in any of thoes 2 fields and how can I start self studying them since I know college wont be enough for me to really understand them. Also if you work in any of thoes 2 fields or some kind of similar field how did you get your first job and what kind of dificulties did you need to overcome if any?

I am now a rising sophomore at Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison as a Computer Science major with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I'm not exactly sure what career path I want to go down but some things that interest me are Network Administration, Penetrative testing/Ethical Hacking, Software Engineering, and Network Security (I have a big interest with security in general). I want to start building my resume so I can get bigger and better internships and eventually a good job that I love and that pays well. One way I plan on doing this is acquiring various certifications. Some basic certifications I have looked into as starting points are CompTIA Network+, ComptTIA Security+, CCNA Routing and Switching, and CCNA Security. Can you give me some insight as to which certifications would be best for me to get, or which ones would prove to be less useful than others. I would like to study for these courses on my own using relatively inexpensive study materials, so any good information on how to help learn and prepare to take the tests would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and please feel free to request more information if I left anything out that would help you provide an answer. "

He asked me if I could explain him what is so special about ""code"" and why people want him to know ""code"". What aspects of code did you find most useful in RL when not programming? I guess the way programmers approach (logical) problems is really useful in all way of life, but how would you explain it KISS to somebody who only wants to grasp the concept without wanting really to code? Do you maybe know any (small, not o'reilly-size^^) literature which discusses this? Thank you! If you need more clarification, I am more than happy to provide it :) Cheers!"
