At the state level, in Arizona's 15th Legislative District, Senate incumbent Heather Carter is competing against challenger Nancy Barto after being criticized for her support of LGBT rights and her role in delaying passage of the state's budget in 2019. In Arizona's 6th Congressional District, four Democratic candidates are competing for a chance to run against Republican Representative David Schweikert, who has been in the news lately for a series of ethics violations related to the misuse of campaign funds. At the state-level, Democratic candidate for Senate Mark Kelly is unchallenged, and Republican incumbent Martha McSally is facing off against challenger Daniel McCarthy. **Kansas** has been the focus of a significant amount of attention from both parties in the weeks leading up to today's election. On the Republican side of the ticket, former Secretary of State Kris Kobach looks to win his party's nomination for Senate, despite concerns about his vulnerability against likely-challenger Democrat Barbra Bollier in November. Last week, Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans pushed President Donald Trump to endorse Kobach's opponent, Representative Roger Marshall, but were unsuccessful in their attempts. In Kansas' 30th Legislative District, voters will be selecting between Democrats Melissa Gregory and Amy Lyon as candidates to replace retiring Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle. In Kansas' 2nd Congressional District, incumbent Republican Congressman Steve Watkins is facing some late pressure from his primary opponent, State Treasurer Jacob LaTurner, after Watkins was charged by the Shawnee County District Attorney with voter fraud last month from using a UPS store address as his place of residence on his voter registration form. **Michigan** voters in the state's 13th Congressional District will get to choose between Democratic incumbent Representative Rashida Tlaib and challenger Brenda Jones, while voters in the 3rd Congressional District will get to pick outgoing Representative Justin Amash's replacement for the Republican-side of the ballot in November's race. Long-time Republican Representative Fred Upton of the 6th Congressional District faces a challenge from Elena Oelke after winning his 2018 primary by a margin of less than 5%. **Missouri** voters will be voting for politicians and policies in their state's primary. In Missouri's 1st Congressional District, incumbent Democrat Representative William Lacy Clay is facing a challenge from Cori Bush, who seeks to end Clay's 20-year tenure in office. Statewide voters will decide whether or not to expand Medicaid and which Democratic Attorney General candidate, Elad Gloss or Rich Finnian, will face Republican incumbent Eric Schmit in November. Republican Governor Mike Parson - appointed to the position in 2018 following the resignation of Eric Greitens - aims to secure his party's nomination for November's race against a field of Democratic challengers, currently led by State Auditor Nicole Galloway. **Washington** voters will be participating in the state's ""top-two"" primary, in which candidates from all parties compete for the two spots on November's ballot, regardless of party. 35 gubernatorial candidates are running against incumbent Democrat Jay Inslee, and 12 candidates are running for the Lieutenant Governor seat after Cyrus Habib decided to step down earlier this year. Voters will also be selecting candidates for Washington's 10th Congressional District's House of Representative seat following the retirement of Democrat Danny Heck, and Republicans will be selecting their candidate in the 8th Congressional District, hoping to win back a seat they lost to Democrat Kim Schrier in 2018.

[The known facts of Hillary Clinton's server is worthy of an indictment. Here is a timeline.](URL I came to the conclusion, with the publicly available facts around the investigation, an indictment would be warranted. This week, Dan Abrams released an article of his analysis that doubted it. He references the same Title 18 statutes as I did in my summary: [Sorry But There Still Isnt Enough to Prosecute Hillary Clinton](URL Dan's analysis is pretty favorable for Clinton on the surface. His argument boils down to that the bar to prosecute Clinton is very high, and so far with the facts we know, that bar hasn't been met. I agree with this analysis for Clinton. In my original postings I believe that an average staffer or military member would have been recommended for indictment by now; but Clinton is certainly not average. So let's continue. Dan on a couple of occasions says this: &gt; As discussed below, I believe she probably violated government procedures and rules but even based on all the new material that has emerged, it also would be a purely politicized prosecution (if there isnt more than we currently know). &gt; To be clear, none of this means Clinton wont be charged. There may be a trove of non-public evidence against her about which we simply do not know. **Here's when I start freaking out if I am Hillary Clinton.** As I mentioned in my post last week, we know very little about this case. The FBI has committed resources on this for nearly a year, with FBI Director Comey and AG Loretta Lynch meeting frequently. If the information that was publicly available was all they had to work with, this investigation would have ended much sooner. Especially considering that the FBI has already [withheld information relating to the case.](URL So lets look at the information we don't know: * Testimony from Bryan Pagliano, the IT staffer, who has been granted immunity * Contents of 30k emails that were deleted by Clinton, but recovered by the FBI * Contents of emails from Hillary's staffers * Content of Clinton Foundation emails * Testimony from ""Guccifer"" the Romanian hacker (more on him in a bit) * Interviews with Clinton staffers and Hillary * Everything else the FBI is really good at digging up So Dan has set this baseline argument, it's clear Hillary broke some rules and that her case is extraordinary - but it hasn't yet reached the bar of prosecution. To me, knowing that's where were at now with zero information on what the FBI has, I would be concerned. So here are some other updates, let's stick with LawNewz as the source, because god damnit I can't get over that z. [Hacker Extradition to U.S. Connected to FBIs Clinton Email Probe:Report](URL &gt; Guccifer was brought to the United States, just as reports indicate that the FBI investigation into Clintons email server is in in full swing. Do you think the timing is interesting? Well, according to a new Fox News report, it is not a coincidence that he was extradited to the United States during a critical point in the investigation. &gt; Because of the proximity to Sidney Blumenthal and activity involving Hillarys emails, [the timing] seems beyond curious, Ron Hosko, a former assistant director of the FBIs Criminal Investigative Division told Fox News. Guccifer has already made this statement: &gt; Back in the Arad penitentiary, I ask Guccifer about his heyday. Was it worth it? **I had memos Hillary Clinton got as a State Secretary, with CIA briefings. These were being read by her, two other people from the US Government, and Guccifer. I used to read her memos for six-seven hours and then Id get up and do the gardening in the yard, he says.** We've always known that Guccifer had gotten access to Clinton's email through Sidney Blumenthal. We have yet to get confirmation that he compromised Hillary's server directly, though, his statements hint at this. If you are reading ""six-seven"" hours worth of memos, you are not just looking at Blumenthal's correspondence. Furthermore, Guccifer wasn't really a hacker. He guessed passwords after reading biographies. It would have been incredibly easy for him to have composed an email under Sidney Blumenthal's compromised AOL account and targeted Clinton. She would very likely open an email from a trusted source. Let's continue: [Was an Asian government reading Hillary Clintons emails in February 2009](URL This is an opinion article from a conservative, but he has some primary source information that is relevant. &gt; But whats fascinating and troubling is something else in the correspondence. One staff message says that during Clintons conversation with Boswell, her attention was drawn to a sentence that indicates we [the diplomatic security office] have intelligence concerning this vulnerability during her recent trip to Asia. &gt; Eighteen days later, Clintons server acquires a digital certificate supporting TLS encryption, closing the biggest security hole in her server. The implication here that her server might have been compromised during her trips to foreign countries. Potentially through her use of a private blackberry associated with the server. Interestingly, Guccifer made his claims about reading her memo's well after this. Simply, acquiring a digital certificate is about the most basic precaution you can take. Previously, she transmitted her emails in plain text. **What does this mean?** So if we look again at Dan Abram's baseline argument, that the public facts aren't enough yet to indict, that would look really good for Clinton. But, knowing how little information has been publicly shared, and how much potentially exists, I would not be confident if I was Clinton. Two more points. **First Point** One aspect that is missing from Dan's write up is how Sidney Blumenthal would email Hillary classified information relating to Libya. We know this looking at the emails Guccifer posted, but were withheld from the public release. Sid, was a Clinton Foundation employee, and it's not clear how he obtained that information as he did not have security clearance. Clinton was legally required under [Title 18 Section 793](URL to ""promptly report"" this. &gt; (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction It might very well be the case that Guccifer compromised her entire server, and had Clinton reported this illegal removal of classified information by one of her employee's, could have prevented it. **Second Point** Whatever the FBI finds, it's not going to come out with a report saying ""Clinton is completely clear of any wrongdoing and this last year we couldn't find anything damning"". *At minimum*, they will speak to how dangerous and reckless her home brew server was for national security. This will of course damage her in a general election, or primary if it comes out by then. **In a potential debate, all someone has to ask her is:** ""Hillary, as Secretary of State, if you had found out that one of your staffers had setup a private unencrypted server, at their home, to conduct all business - including discussions with classified material, would you have fired them?"" That's it. Wrap it up. She can't answer this question honestly, because she would absolutely have to fire this person. Alright, let's see what happens next week. EDIT: Hat tip to: /u/kevinbobevin it's so crazy it might work. Tweet CNN/Wolf. If enough people suggest they ask it they might include it during the upcoming debate. **""@CNN @wolfblitzer Ask the secretary, #wouldshefire a staffer who setup an email server like she did?""**"
3,vulnerability,politics,Bringing a logical approach a counterintuitive election: The only smart choice is to volunteer for Bernie.,39,4e4ws3,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/4e4ws3/bringing_a_logical_approach_a_counterintuitive/,2016-04-10 16:40:41,"There is a lot of spin and myth obfuscating the most important election of our era. Concentrate on the absolute indisputable 3. * **Climate change** This presidential election will significantly influence the chance of civilization's survival, versus human extinction or dystopia. That's not an exaggeration, but basic fact. Bernie's proposals are not sufficient, but he is the only candidate whose perspective on the issue is even consistent with science. He's the only candidate that recognizes climate is the top national security priority, and opposes fracking, which is not profitable any more anyway and releases methane. * **Lobbyist trade deals** I would bet most people here comprehend that these are not 'free trade.' They are massive stealth legislation that not even the uber corrupt Congress would want in their voting history. Yet they are worse than bad legislation because they make the attack on our rights, privacy, and environment a matter of effective international law as a treaty - virtually impossible to fight later. They are not even good for the economy, because they lock in a right to profit for established big business that will eventually inhibit innovation and small business. The fact that Bernie got flack for suggesting her support of the Panama agreement was a disqualifier is another sign of how completely out of step with perspective society is. * **Liberty** Bernie opposed the patriot act, opposes the NSA's attempts to end privacy, and proposed automatic independent investigation of any police custody homicide. There is not even a contest on which candidate is the best on these issues or police and authoritarian misconduct generally. --- These are virtually unanimous on reddit and justifiably so. They are incredibly time-sensitive and must be addressed fast to prevent lock in. Every one of these issues is an existential threat to the sustainability or quality of human civilization, and more importantly, the right to play on the internet. The other candidates might be moderately not completely terrible on some of these, but none is close to Bernie on one, never mind the full set. If anything it is embarrassing reddit is not MORE Bernie centric. The [bystander effect](URL is strong: [pluralistic ignorance](URL [diffusion of responsibility](URL and sheer fears of appearing foolish. * **End the backlash** Would reddit tolerate trolls who complain about how loud those damn climate people are? Or say these complaints about police corruption are stupid since those people are delusional about the chance of their ever doing anything about it? How would you react to people trolling opponents of the **damn TPP?!** Yet every time I click an article on Bernie there are there those who apparently believe shitting on people for their enthusiasm about doing anything about it is a mark of intelligence. Cynicism is necessary, but intelligent people are cynical about cynicism, not just contrarians who think they are above it all for being antagonistic. I find it cowardly. Supporting anything necessarily involves vulnerability. Those with desperate lives often pick on anybody they can find with a vulnerability. Source: internet, everywhere. It is one thing if a complaint involves actual substance, but do not tolerate the reverse bandwagon trolls and their ""hurr reddit candidate."" They definitely qualify as a legitimate downvote for low quality off topic distraction. * **If you are on the fence** If you do not like the rest of his agenda or think it would be impossible, how important is that compared to the big 3? These are issues he can influence significantly in the executive branch. No ""republican congress"" excuses here. Along with marijuana reclassification, non-establishment judicial appointments, preventing another Iraq war or Libya intervention, and more. If the presidency is as weak as his detractors say, why is there such a fight to win the presidency and hundreds of millions in investment? * **Those of you who understand the importance of climate change, TPP-style legislation, and privacy will never have a better opportunity to actually exercise power.** There is a high chance you will spend the rest of your life paying for these ridiculous positions and cringing at news of their continued worsening. I would bet that in a few years you will be disgusted you could not do more. Already I am angry I only did anything recently. ""But what if I spend time to call for Bernie or donate or get emotionally vulnerable for nothing and we lose?"" This is a post about escaping the spin and being honest about the election, so I will state it straight. The chance that Bernie will win the nomination is between 1 in 3 and 1 in 5. There is a flood of spin out to claim he's dominating or has no chance but it is absurd. ""Why would that be convincing?!"" Because: * There is a significant chance you could feel like a freaking superhuman for that win, and probably extend your life expectancy by fighting climate change. People pay a lot for an offer of that privilege in other ways, especially as they get elderly. * There is a high chance you will feel awful for not doing it. I can practically guarantee your future self will be glad you participated or beat him or her self up about not participating. This is basically the election of our era. * That opinion is built on the assumption there are no surprises. Like, you know, the Panama controversy a week ago, or Bernie getting invited to a vatican speech right before the 40% catholic New York votes or virtually the entire primary from now until the end has a catholic majority as you can see in the following picture: URL Or the FBI doing its job after giving immunity to a number of potential witnesses in the email case. Every additional delegate would bring more probability of such a surprise mattering. Most importantly, this is not a win or lose proposition. Delegates would have a vote at the convention on the platform. There are a range of potential outcomes: * Bernie wins * Bernie is so close to winning he is the VP and potentially president by indictment * Bernie is the VP which is enough to boost the ticket's popularity and prevent a president Ted Cruz or Trump * The platform is now the official party agenda after sufficient Hillary delegates agree with those positions even though they thought Hillary was 'electable' or 'experienced' or whichever myth * His performance increases the credibility of sane candidates in a country controlled by absolute psychopaths. Seriously, he probably did not think he would get any more than credibility when he started. Hopefully you get the idea. Every delegate builds the probability of any of these objectives. You will not have a better opportunity to actually do anything about the big 3. It matters. A few booby prizes are available if you are risk averse. As I said supporting anything makes you vulnerable, but think of how you would feel about the decision in the long term. If you are a keyboard warrior join the special project I am developing.

The top Democratic candidates on the May 21 primary ballot  Attorney General Andy Beshear, state House Minority Floor Leader Rocky Adkins and ex-state Auditor Adam Edelen  are competing for the support of a Democratic base riled up by Bevin's combative style. Also running is Democratic candidate Geoff Young. Beshear, the son of former Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear, casts himself as Bevin's main rival. Adkins, the top-ranking Democrat in the Kentucky House, points to his experience in helping craft budgets and shape legislation. Edelen touts himself as best able to transform Kentucky's economy. Bevin's challengers in the GOP primary are Robert Goforth, a state representative from southeastern Kentucky; Williams Woods, a bus driver and real estate agent from northern Kentucky; and Ike Lawrence, a real estate developer from Lexington. #ATTORNEY GENERAL Two Republicans and a Democrat are running in primaries for state attorney general. A Kentucky state senator and a former aide to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell are battling over the Republican nomination. State Sen. Wil Schroder of Wilder, a former county prosecutor, holds a GOP leadership position and calls himself a Trump Republican. Daniel Cameron served as McConnell's lawyer and assisted in the confirmation of several conservative judges, including U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. The winner will face former Kentucky Attorney General Greg Stumbo, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary. Stumbo was attorney general from 2004 to 2008. #SECRETARY OF STATE The primaries for Kentucky secretary of state drew eight people hoping to replace Alison Lundergan Grimes, who is finishing her second term and cannot run again.

The three in the Democratic primary are: Sheri Donahue, a cybersecurity professional; teacher Kelsey Hayes Coots; and Chris Tobe, who served as a trustee for Kentucky Retirement Systems and wrote ""Kentucky Fried Pensions,"" a book detailing problems with the state's public pension plan. #TREASURER Democrats Michael Bowman, a banker and graphic designer, and business owner Josh Mers are running for the Democratic nomination for state treasurer. The winner will face Republican incumbent Allison Ball, who is unopposed in the GOP primary. #SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, the Republican incumbent, drew a challenger for the May primary. Hemp farmer Bill Polyniak says he wants to champion legislation that will benefit Kentucky farmers in the cannabis markets. Democrats running for the nomination are Scott County farmer Robert Conway and Glasgow City Councilman and farmer Joe Trigg."

That is, agency information security programs apply to all organizations (sources) which possess or use Federal information - or which operate, use, or have access to Federal information systems (whether automated or manual) - on behalf of a Federal agency.** Other organizations may include contractors, grantees, State and Local Governments, industry partners, providers of software subscription services, etc. FISMA, therefore, underscores longstanding OMB policy concerning sharing Government information and interconnecting systems.

No. Section 3541 of FISMA provides the Act' s security requirements apply to **"" information and information systems"" without distinguishing by form or format; therefore, the security requirements outlined in FISMA apply to Federal information in all forms and formats (including electronic, paper, audio, etc.).** ________________________________________ **What must be communicated to other agencies?** From NIST 800-30 Guide For Conducting Risk Assessments: URL ________________________________________ **The idea of understanding the role the system plays in supporting the organizations mission, and its interconnection to other systems, is a core principal of the risk assessment process.** ________________________________________ URL &gt;Information Sharing and System Interconnection Agreements: Agency personnel should utilize aggregated and individual security categorization information when assessing interagency connections. **For example, knowing that information processed on a high impact information system is flowing to another agencys moderate impact information system should cause both agencies to evaluate the security categorization information, the implemented or resulting security controls, and the risk associated with interconnecting systems.** The results of this evaluation may substantiate the need for additional security controls in the form of a Service Level Agreement, information systems upgrades, additional mitigating security controls, or alternative means of sharing the required information. ________________________________________ **What are the Secretarys Responsibilities?** From Homeland Security Presidential Directive No. 7, from 2003: URL ________________________________________ &gt;It is the policy of the United States to enhance the protection of our Nation's critical infrastructure and key resources against terrorist acts that could: &gt;1. cause catastrophic health effects or mass casualties comparable to those from the use of a weapon of mass destruction;

Plan the Information System Controls Audit &gt;2. Understand the Overall Audit Objectives and Related Scope of the Information System Controls Audit &gt;3. Understand the Entitys Operations and Key Business Processes. &gt;4. Obtain a General Understanding of the Structure of the Entitys Networks &gt;5. Identify Key Areas of Audit Interest &gt;6. Assess Information System Risk on a Preliminary Basis &gt;7. Identify Critical Control Points &gt;8. Obtain a Preliminary Understanding of Information System Controls &gt;9. Perform Other Audit Planning Procedures &gt;10. Relevant Laws and Regulations &gt;11. Consideration of the Risk of Fraud &gt;12. Previous Audits and Attestation Engagements &gt;13. Audit Resources &gt;14. Multiyear Testing Plans &gt;15. Communication with Entity Management and Those Charged with Governance &gt;16. Service Organizations &gt;17. Using the Work of Others &gt;18. Audit Plan ________________________________________ &gt;The auditor should identify and document the key business processes that are relevant to the audit objectives. For each key business process, the auditor should identify the significant general support systems and major applications that are used to support each key business process. &gt;Also, for each key business process, the auditor should identify the use of contractors and others to process information and/or operate systems for or on behalf of the entity. Throughout the remainder of this manual, references to entity systems and business processes include the use of contractors and others to process information and/or operate systems for or on behalf of the entity. If the IS controls audit is performed as part of a financial audit, as discussed in FAM 320 (Understand Information Systems) and other FAM sections, the auditor should obtain an understanding of the entitys information systems (including methods and records) for processing and reporting accounting (including supplemental information), compliance, and operations data (including performance measures reported in the Managements Discussion and Analysis). The auditor should document an understanding of the entitys operations and key business processes, including the following items to the extent relevant to the audit objectives: &gt;1. **the significance and nature of the programs and functions supported by information systems;** &gt;2. **a general understanding of the entitys and the IT functions organizational structure;** &gt;3. **key business processes relevant to the audit objectives, including business rules, transaction flows, and application and software module interaction;** &gt;4. **significant general support systems and major applications that support each key business process;** &gt;5. background information checklist, if used; &gt;6. **significant internal and external factors that could affect the IS controls audit objectives;** &gt;7. **a detailed organization chart, particularly the IT and the IS components;** &gt;8. **significant changes in the IT environment or significant applications implemented within the recent past (e.g. 2 years) or planned within the near future (e.g., 2 years); and** &gt;9. **the entitys reliance on third parties to provide IT services (e.g., in-house, remote connectivity, remote processing).** ________________________________________ &gt;Perform Information System Controls Audit Tests &gt;1. Understand Information Systems Relevant to the Audit Objectives &gt;2. Determine which IS Control Techniques are Relevant to the Audit Objectives &gt;3. For each Relevant IS Control Technique Determine Whether it is Suitably Designed to Achieve the Critical &gt;4. Activity and has been Implemented. &gt;5. Perform Tests to Determine Whether such Control Techniques are Operating Effectively Identify Potential &gt;6. Weaknesses in IS Controls and Consider Compensating Controls ________________________________________ &gt;Report Audit Results &gt;1. Evaluate the Effects of Identified IS Control Weaknesses &gt;2. Financial Audits, Attestation Engagements, and Performance Audits &gt;3. Consider Other Audit Reporting Requirements and Related Reporting Responsibilities ________________________________________ **Control Implementation is guided by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800 Series** ________________________________________ It starts with the Risk Assessment Process (SP800-30) and is followed by the Security Control guidance (NIST SP800-53). These are too lengthy too discuss here, and the details are not necessary at this level. URL ________________________________________ **How does this information get reported?** ________________________________________ **They are first reported at the agency level to the White House. Then the White House produces a consolidated report for Congress:** From the 2009 State Department FISMA Audit Report: URL ________________________________________ &gt; **In response to four FY 2008 FISMA report recommendations relating to inventory systems management and oversight of contractor systems, IRM/IA modified its procedures for collecting, analyzing, and managing inventory systems.** The review team found that IRM/IA had implemented several controls procedures that were reviewed and verified during the teams analysis of 3rd and 4th quarter inventory records. Specifically, the following controls were implemented: &gt;**Routine quarterly inventory data calls were made, and they reminded bureau and post systems owners to report new systems and significant changes to systems to ensure the accuracy of their FISMA-reportable inventory.** &gt;**FISMA requires the Department to keep an inventory of information systems. OMB Circulars A-123, A-127 ( Financial Management Systems), and A-130 (Management of Federal &gt;Information Resources) require agencies to develop and maintain an information systems inventory, document the types of information systems required to be reported, and detail how and how often those reports must be submitted to OMB.

To that end, we continue to work to improve our financial management and internal controls. This Agency Financial Report (AFR) is our principal publication and report to the President, Congress, and the American people on our leadership in financial management and on our management and stewardship of the public funds to which we have been entrusted. We worked with our Independent Auditor to ensure that the financial and summary performance data included in this AFR are complete and reliable in accordance with guidance from the Office of Management and Budget. Through this publication and the February release of the Congressional Budget Justification, which includes the Agency Performance Report, we are providing an alternative to the Performance and Accountability Report. **The Secretarys signature from the report:** URL ______________________________________________________________ 2011 State Department Financial Management Report: URL ______________________________________________________________ &gt;To assess conformance with FFMIA, the Department uses FFMIA implementation guidance issued by OMB (January 2001 Memorandum to Executive Department Heads, Chief Financial Officers, and Inspectors General), results of OIG and GAO audit reports, annual financial statement audits, the Departments annual Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) Report, and other relevant information. The Departments assessment also relies upon evaluations and assurances under the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act (FMFIA), including assessments performed to meet the requirements of OMB Circular A-123 Appendix A. Particular importance is given to any reported material weakness and material non-conformance identified during these internal control assessments. The Department has made it a priority to meet the objectives of the FFMIA. &gt;**In the FISMA report, the Office of Inspector General will cite weaknesses to enterprise-wide security they consider to be a significant deficiency in accordance with OMB M-11-33. The Department acknowledges the weaknesses identified by the OIG, but does not agree that any of the findings, either individually or collectively, rise to the level of a significant deficiency that would require treating the matter as an additional material weakness in accordance with OMB M-11-33 which states a significant deficiency is defined as a weakness in an agencys overall information systems security program... that significantly restricts the capability of the agency to carry out its mission or compromises the security of its information, information systems, personnel, or other resources, operations, or assets. In this context, the risk is great enough that the agency head and other agencies must be notified and immediate or near-immediate action must be taken. Management has defined corrective actions for the applicable weaknesses cited by the OIG, and will address each in a prioritized manner based upon the risk and impact posed to the Departments security posture.** **The Secretarys signature from the report:** URL ______________________________________________________________ From PDF Page 13 of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) Evaluation of the Department of States FOIA process for Requests Involving the Office of the Secretary, January 2016: URL ______________________________________________________________ &gt;Although specific details of processes for handling FOIA requests vary among agencies, the major steps in processing a request are similar across the Federal Government. Recent assessments of the Departments processes revealed poor practices. In 2012, OIGs inspection of A/GIS found, among other deficiencies, that FOIA requests are prone to delay and that IPS lacked a sound process to develop its information systems. A 2015 report by the Center for Effective Government found that, among 15 Agencies that receive a large volume of public records requests, **the Department ranked last, in part because of increased processing times and outdated regulations. According to the report, the Department was the only agency whose rules do not require staff to notify requesters when processing is delayed, even though this is mandated by law. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the accuracy and completeness of responses to FOIA requests. The Department has not sent out a notice or memorandum reminding employees of their FOIA responsibilities since March 2009, when former Secretary Clinton sent a message commemorating Freedom of Information Day.** &gt;**Although OIG focused on procedural weaknesses in the Office of the Secretary for this evaluation, the issues OIG identified have broader implications. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government stresses that the tone at the top managements philosophy and operating styleis fundamental to an effective internal control system. OIGs past and current** ______________________________________________________________ TL;DR: Executives have direct responsibility over Risk Management, and (at least in public companies) have been held accountable for their failures. The fact that the other Agencies were not aware of how her server was being managed is all the evidence that you need. A core principle of the Risk Management function is to understand how a system supports the agency's mission, how it interconnects with other systems and agencies, and how the information flows through those systems, to ensure that information in, for example, a system categorized as High (Whitehouse Email) to something with little or no controls (Hillary's email) without going through some process to make sure the information is filtered, redacted, blocked from transmission, etc. This information is required to be documented and audited. The lack of documentation is itself evidence that it wasn't being done. The combination of operational importance, information types, role in business process and in supporting the Agency's mission, and classification levels all ultimately impact the IT security process (controls) that are required to be put in place. They apply to all systems that house Federal Information, classified or not. This is also for preserving the integrity and availability of public record, the communications that influence decision making, and other public records, and preventing malicious alteration of those records. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ EDIT: Also, I am not currently, nor have I in the past, been employed by, contracted with, or audited a Federal Agency. I'm just familiar with the underlying framework (NIST SP800), auditing standards in general, and evaluating deficiencies, significant deficiencies, and material weakness, as well as evaluating the reasonableness of management's response. EDIT: Formatting ___________________________________________________________________________________________ ELI5/Classroom analogy Hillary had to protect information and follow instructions, she failed to follow the instructions, and didn't listen when the teacher's assistant checked her work and told her it was wrong. Eventually the teacher found out, and sent instructions back to her on how to do it right. She didn't listen, asserted that she was doing it right, and signed a legal document stating that she didn't agree with the teachers assistant. ___________________________________________________________________________________________ 5 Questions: 1. **Was she reimbursed for the cost of her email server and support services by the State Department?** 2. **Was her server included in the Federal Information Systems Inventory (Required by OMB A-130, among others places.)?** 3. **Was her server included in the State Department's annual audits and reviews for compliance with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, and were there any findings relevant to her server?** 4. **Did she withhold information about her server to prevent it from being included in these audits or discussions with auditors and the Inspector General?** 5. **Is there a reasonable basis for the management assertion in response to recommendation #17 in the 2012 State Department FISMA Audit Report?** ___________________________________________________________________________________________ "
16,cybersecurity,politics,Clinton and Trump Are Popular Only Because of Their Celebrity,0,43h6xa,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/43h6xa/clinton_and_trump_are_popular_only_because_of/,2016-01-31 13:08:34,"I'll make the case here that Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are popular Presidential candidates because of their celebrity and nothing else. Their campaigns are ego trips and both candidates are getting by on public image and not on substance. I really believe that the support these two get is due to being people allowing themselves to be easily influenced by media. In Clinton's care, it's also because too many Democratic voters are too trusting in the Democratic Party's corrupt, imcompetent leaders, and have come to see Barack Obama and the Clintons as gods, whose public images must be protected at all costs, rather than people. Before you walk away and think this is crazy talk, open your mind and consider what I've typed here. As for Donald Trump, the case is easy to make and the simplest. Compare him to the other Republicans running President. There are candidates who have the same positions as him, or similar positions. He's the most outrageous of those candidates. The others aren't as stupid as Trump. They state their ideas without resorting to bigotry. Most have government experience, which Trump doesn't have. I can't see how anybody could take his candidacy seriously. I believe Trump is more popular because he's the biggest celebrity who'll compete in their primaries and caucuses. Hillary Clinton has always been a manufactured public figure. It all began in 1992, when her husband ran for President. His PR people decided to sell her to the public as a celebrity because they thought having a wife with a good image would help get Bill Clinton elected. She got praise for being First Lady, but that's a ceremonial post with no power and no genuine influence. She was allowed to participate in her husbands projects, but he was the one who made the decisions, so I assume her presence was just for show and to make her feel and appear important. Notice that what the public expected her to do as First Lady, besides be famous and attack Republicans, didn't happen. She then became Senator of a state where she had never lived. A Senator is supposed to know about a state so that she can represent that state, and somebody who hasn't lived there can't be expected to represent that state very well. Her runs for Senate got a remarkable amount of support from people outside New York, including through organizations like Friends of Hillary. New York City residents tend to be obsessed with celebrity and hipness, and tend to believe a person is cool and important because their local magazines tell them so. So I suggest that New Yorkers elected her in an effort to support a national celebrity, not in effort to get a Senator who could well represent their interests. She and her supporters cite 8 years as a Senator as a reason for making President, but her record is unimpressive. She didn't write any part of any important legislation. She repeatedly voted for to allow lots and lots of unrestricted surveillance, thus setting up the overblown surveillance state the NSA and Homeland Security have been building since ever. She supported George W. Bush's disastrous international agenda without reservation. Remember that the intelligence community's pre-war report on Iraq concluded that the cases for invading Iraq were hypothetical and theoretical at best, and that report was available to every Senator, including Hillary Clinton. Her 4 years as Secretary of State are cited as a reason for making her President, but [her diplomatic work was disastrous](URL The Dept. of State had awful cybersecurity when she went in and [she failed to improve it](URL before she left. She [ordered the collection of DNA and email passwords of foreign diplomats](URL - not a necessary responsibility of the Dept. of State. At the UN's climate conference in Copenhagen in 2009, the world had a chance for a global treaty to stop climate change, but [she blew it](URL She went to Europe to promote fracking. You know, the drilling practice that causes and-made earthquakes and mineral contamination of groundwater, and makes tap water flammable! She pushed for an invasion of Libya without a declaration of war from Congress, and we all know where Libya's at now. Clinton has shown only that she can learn military and diplomatic terms and phrases to make herself sound Presidential. But she has shown that she doesn't care for the consequences of her decisions. And she talks a lot of nonsense on foreign policy. Her stated reasons for opposing Pres. Obama's deal with Iran are because Mr. Sanders favors it and Benjamin Netenyahu opposes it (for his own political reasons, of course). She has yet to make a convincing case for why for her proposed no-fly zone over Russia and hasn't explained why she thinks enforcing it wouldn't require the US shooting down airplanes. She just says things like no-fly zone and other jargon to cover up for the fact that she has only thin proposals for national security, warfare and diplomacy. The only time she says anything about those issues that makes sense is when she repeats something that Bernie Sanders or Martin O'Malley have said at the debates. The difference is that when Clinton says it, it becomes a news article, and pundits respond by attacking Sanders for not having a foreign policy agenda. But Clinton's supposed expertise on international issues is almost entirely image, and the media and her supporters have bought that act hook, line and sinker. Some of the excuses for supporting her don't make sense. One is that the Democrats can't possible regain a majority in government with the elections this year, but we have no reason to assume that. Even if it were so, that doesn't justify electing her over Sanders or O'Malley. Her media cheerleaders say she'll do better than the other candidates at ruling by decree, but a President doesn't Constitutionally become a dictator simply because the majority of Congress doesn't support the President. A President can't make much of difference without meaningful Congressional legislation. Clinton says she'll appoint judges who'll use the Supreme Court to advance an agenda, but that's an abuse of the courts, which are supposed to be impartial and apolitical. (In fact, that's the problem we have now the court, only from a different political party.) And that the next President gets to appoint any judges can't be guaranteed. If you buy these reasons for voting for her, you're gullible and don't know how government works. The other reason that her supporters keep giving for supporting her is that she's The Most Qualified Person to Ever Run for President of the United StatesTM. But O'Malley has more government experience and Sanders even more. Sanders at least has written meaningful legislation, including that healthcare law she defends so much. O'Malley accomplished enough as a Governor and a Mayor that he can talk at length about how he's a proven leader capable of bringing progressive change. And some past Presidents had more experience with government before becoming President than she has. I believe the reason people consider Hillary Clinton The Most Qualified Person to Ever Run for President of the United StatesTM is because they think the President is supposed to be a celebrity whose popular with media, and she fits those bogus qualifications better all the other candidates. Notice that she takes credit for things that have nothing to do with her, such as the Affordable Care Act. Also notice how defensive and paranoid she gets when somebody mentions Goldman Sachs and the crisis in Libya without saying anything about her or specifically something she did. She must feel very insecure about herself and feel a need to cover up a lack of good accomplishments, a lack which she has covered up very well with public relations. I believe the media is biased in favor of Clinton and Trump, but not because any journalist or reporter thinks we need either of them to be President. We now live in the U.S.A. at a time when the media considers Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton important and treats bullshit artists like Matt Drudge and Perez Hilton like journalists. Naturally, the media gravitates to the candidates with the most celebrity, while overlooking current and former Congressmen, Governors and Mayors who're also running. Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are the biggest celebrities running for President right now, so naturally the media covers them the most. Almost everybody in the media wants a match-up of Clinton vs. Trump for the general election, because that will give them an opportunity for 24-hour-a-day coverage of celebrity bullshit for months. Consider the Democratic debates. Clinton dodges some questions, tries to give the moderators red herrings, and takes credit for things she didn't do, and proposals banking rules that [won't do enough](URL to address the issues with bad banking, lending and crediting.. At the first, [she outright lied about her record as Secretary of State](URL and took credit for things she didn't do. At the second, she claimed that she was coziness with white-collar criminals on Wall Street because of 9/11, but failed to explain the connection. At the third, she rambled about cybersecurity without making a lick of sense. Clinton had a few good moments at the first and third debates, but calling her the winner of any debate is questionable, and calling her the winner of the second is ridiculous considering how bad she was. Notice that much of the coverage of and commentary about the debates has centered around the styles of the candidates, their appearances and charisma, and the judgments often have nothing to do with the substance of anything said at the debate. Some people (see Salon, USA Today, Esquire, Talking Points Memo) ruled her the winner of the second for reasons that had nothing to do with the debate itself. Some say Clinton didn't do anything to embarrass herself at the debates, but of course she does! I think the people judging these debates think a debate is a reality show and rather than an exchange of ideas, so they judge Clinton the winner because she's the biggest celebrity there. To be fair, that changed for the fourth debate, which I guess more people saw. Notice the celebrities who support them. Trump is supported by Jerry Lewis, Kenny Rogers (the singer, not the baseball player), Mike Tyson and Gary Busey. In other words, Trump attracts people who're washed up, or whose careers have been on the down-low, and rely on their celebrity to stay in the limelight. Clinton is openly campaigning with celebrities more so than the other candidates. She has had Katy Perry and Lena Dunham speak for her. Both of them are talentless and get by and celebrity, while Dunham also benefits from their family connections and from the herd mentality of the New York media. In other words, Dunham is a lot like Hillary Clinton in some bad ways. Sanders and Ted Cruz have some famous people supporting them, but celebrity doesn't feature in their campaigns. The Republican field right now is bad enough that any Democrat with experience and no criminal record could defeat any of those Republicans. Some issues can wait, but climate change, water pollution and surveillance have to be stopped immediately and waiting another 5-10 years may be too late. Trump and Clinton have shown no interest in solving those problems; quite the opposite in fact. But look at who the frontrunners are. If you support Clinton or Trump, and you want to say it's not about celebrity, then give us a **real** reason for supporting them. I really believe you have reason for supporting either that haven't been stated in media, that I haven't heard from their supporters. We who don't support them just don't get it. Clinton is just another politician and so is Trump. They aren't smart, passionate or honest. They care only about themselves. **What's so special about them?** Why doesn't their greed bother you? Stop repeating their talking points. Stop repeating their rhetoric. **Stop attacking Bernie Sanders' character and crucifying his supporters.** Realistically explain coherently and sensibly why you want so badly for Clinton or Trump need to be President. Especially you Clinton supporters: why are y'all behaving as if Earth will fly into the Sun if she doesn't get to be President? Is celebrity really that important to you people?"

There _are_ questions about credibility and conflicts of interest, as well as transparency and adherence to regulation, to be asked, when discussing Hillary's deviance. Does her disregard for the FOIA matter? Or her betrayal of Obama in her involvement of Blumenthal with State Dept business? The media, like Jim Webb, figured out that ""cybersecurity"" is the buzzword du hour and they are holding onto it like a dog with a bone. What would a serious treatment of the scandals around Hillary's private server look like? &amp; Is the cybersecurity angle legitimate at all? I have avoided this issue for weeks now so any updates from either ""side"" would be more than welcome."
